INTRODUCTION



In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and the earth was formless and void.
—GENESIS 1:1-2
THE PUZZLE BREAKS DOWN AS FOLLOWS: EVERY LIVING THING we know of sprang from another living thing, yet we have reason to think that there was no life at all anywhere when the world first got going.1 This observation implies that the first life there ever was grew from stuff that was not alive, and the question is whether this grand event occurred mysteriously, in a manner incomprehensible to the laws of physics and chemistry as we know them, or took place in a series of steps that we can understand. In other words, how did life begin? Scientists, curious observers of the natural world, and a great many other sorts of contemplative seekers struggling with the human condition may all agree on the importance of this question, yet much confusion and disagreement reigns about what kind of answer we are even looking for.
Some biophysicists might like to know which specific types of atoms collided with each other in order to form the first biomolecules, while others take for granted that something like this must have happened, and focus their inquiry instead on judging the likelihood of such an event under various conditions. For that matter, what even counts as life, and what doesn't? Was the early presence of life in the world a gray continuum through which things gradually progressed over time, or do we insist there must have been one moment when it burst decisively onto the scene? If the former, how precisely can we differentiate between something that is alive and something that isn't? If the latter, considering that life is good at doing an impressive number of things, which of them came into being first? Was it guaranteed to do so, in the same way that ice always melts in the warm sun, or must it have been sparked by a freak occurrence, one so rare that our best theory of how things transpired is no explanation at all? We understand something of why ice forms when water gets sufficiently cold, or why stars ignite when gravity is strong enough to squeeze hydrogen gas together, but it is strangely and marvelously more challenging to articulate the physical conditions in which nonliving matter is guaranteed to become alive. Like the skeptical onlooker at a magic show, many of us simply won't be satisfied until we get to see how the trick was done.
Tenacious scientific inquiry is not, however, the only reason people long so much to know something of how life began. A thoughtful human being—indeed, even a professional scientist willing to take an honest look in the mirror and examine his or her own sentiments carefully—may admit that the reason the question has such a command over us is that it expresses a shared yearning. The search for meaning and purpose begins with wondering where we came from and what we are part of, and seeking an account of how things began, partly because people use ideas about the past to decide how to act in the present and the future. If everything humans are made up of can be found in a pond or a chemistry set, then what really makes us different? Are humans simply animals, or something more? Does our existence express the intention of a Creator who made us in His image, or are we—and all other life—merely an exotic variety of frost condensed in the razor-thin layer between ground and sky? Can it be both? Once we start talking in these terms, the stakes of the argument could hardly be higher.
In this book, we will see that physical science does provide a new insight into when and how things that are not alive start to become more lifelike. Living things accomplish a variety of feats that, though not unique to life, are certainly distinctive of it. For example, they make copies of themselves, harvest and consume fuel, and accurately predict the surrounding environment. These processes are all part and parcel of what it is to be alive, and each of them can be studied systematically from the perspective of thermodynamics. Emphasizing recent progress in a rapidly growing offshoot of thermodynamics known as nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, this text will build up all the concepts needed to construct a clear argument for when and how the physical properties of inanimate matter might first give rise to the kinds of activities that life is particularly good at. The key point will be to realize that, just as living things have specialized properties determined by their genes that they have inherited from their ancestors, so, too, do collections of physically interacting particles have specialized properties that come from the past shapes into which they've been assembled. By continually getting pushed and knocked around by patterns presented in the environment, matter can undergo a continual exploration of the space of possible shapes whose rhythm and form become matched to those patterns in ways that look an awful lot like living.
If all we aimed to do here were to make new physical sense of life's distinctiveness, that would be plenty. And yet, even more so than most other scientific topics, this one surely demands a broader conversation. Whether because one needs to grapple mightily with the simple, definitional question of what is alive and what is not, or because arguments about the exceptionality, value, and purpose of life make up a large part of what people have disagreed and fought about throughout the ages, it seems thoroughly necessary to put our examination of the boundary between life and non-life in a suitably rich philosophical context. There might be more than one way of doing this well, in principle, but this is where my own deeply felt personal commitments come to bear. The way I know how to be most effective and accurate when talking about "big questions" of the human condition is to ground my understanding in interpretations of the Hebrew Bible. At the beginning of conceiving this book, I therefore set to pondering whether the Bible had anything cogent to say in reaction to the physics I planned to write about.
What I have been amazed to discover is that the Bible is particularly interested in the question of how and why matter might cross from being lifeless to alive, and that it features this subject at the center of one of its most central narrative moments. As a result, the biblical text turns out to provide an unexpectedly detailed conceptual roadmap for the scientific journey we are about to undertake, one that is useful not only for making physical insights comprehensible to the intuitions of everyday experience, but ultimately also in navigating the broader consequences for how we think about the human condition. Moreover, in what feels to me a very pleasing side effect of this whole endeavor, we are going to articulate a way of relating to the Hebrew Bible that combines with and enriches what science can teach us, instead of seeming to be incompatible. It is usually taken for granted that the Bible comprehends little or nothing of what modern science knows about the natural world; it has even been asserted that progress in scientific understanding of where life comes from directly undercuts the credibility and authority of biblical scripture as a path to true knowledge.2 This book so happens to demonstrate the profound falsity of that assertion, but not by injecting more argumentation into an already bloated debate. Instead, engaging with the Bible presents us with a delightful opportunity to prove the point by example, for not only does its text seem to be aware of the concepts needed to think about the emergence of lifelikeness in a physical material, it even provides a poetic summary of them using imagery that makes them more relatable and broadly comprehensible.
For me, in this regard, there is a very satisfying harmony here between the demands of a personal commitment and what simply does the best job when trying to teach about the physicochemical ideas contained in this book. An account of how life might emerge from "dumb, blind" mechanical processes unavoidably will look to some rhetoricians like a last stake in the heart of the Bible's account of creation—not only this, it also risks casting the whole intricate web of interwoven human lives as a wholly material process that is devoid of any moral meaning. I therefore have a firm intention to lay out the discussion in such a way that the relevant commentary provided by Hebrew scripture never actually appears at loggerheads with the science in the way that some mistakenly perceive. At the same time, the way the Bible treats the subject of how matter comes to life turns out to be wondrously useful as an explanatory tool, because scripture addresses itself to the unenhanced perspective of a human being observing and assaying the world with little beyond his or her five senses. Ideas that are born in the mathematical realm of statistical thermodynamics can often be translated into more everyday parlance, but doing so usually requires reference to tangible examples in that everyday world. In quite deliberate fashion, the Book of Exodus provides a whole drawer-full of these examples, and if I do my job right here, then including them in our discussion is going to make the meaning of the physical theory clearer to a greater number of readers.
Moses is a lone shepherd in the desert tending sheep when he encounters a shrub wreathed in marvelous fire, a living thing that burns brightly without being consumed. The God who reveals Himself in that moment speaks to Moses of his nation's ancestry and the promise of their redemption from slavery, but He also provides three signs for Moses to bring to the Hebrews in Egypt. The first sign is a staff that turns into a serpent. The second is a "snowy" growth on his skin. The last is a mixture of river water and dirt that turns into blood.
Each of these signs can be read as a comment about the border between life and non-life. The staff is a lifeless object that surprisingly transforms into a living creature. The snowy skin is an anomaly in the boundary between the body of a man (who is alive) and his surroundings (which are not), and the reference to snowflakes evokes the idea of an ever-branching edge that is impossible to trace and thereby fully define. And, of course, the creation of blood—the liquid essence of life—from more basic, formless ingredients completes the portrait. Viewed in these terms, this passage from Exodus hammers home the question of where life comes from and how we can distinguish it from the inanimate material background from which it might have emerged.
It is easiest to think of the miraculous signs given to Moses as a bunch of parlor tricks. Indeed, the text expects this, for when Moses and his brother Aaron show their mud-blood and transforming reptilian stick to Pharaoh, the magicians of the Egyptian court are able to produce the same dazzling effects using their own spells. Superficially, the passage therefore invites those of us fascinated by life's emergence to compare ourselves to the audience at a magic show. Looking more closely, however, we will discover that these signs also serve as a surprisingly cogent and detailed guide for explaining emergent lifelikeness in the language of physics. The titles for the chapters of this book—2, Staff and Snake; 3, Snow and Dust; 4, River and Blood; 5, Mountain and Sword; 6, Flame and Tree; 7, Wind and Breath; and 8, Voice and Word—all come from the biblical text, and I have paired each one with an accompanying epigraph that highlights the title theme. These pairings will allow us to ruminate on the biology and physics of life from a new perspective. My goal in setting things down in this way is to let this biblical lexicon provide a rich organizing framework for the separate ideas in the natural sciences that must be woven together into a complete account of the origins of living things. By tracing this path, we will not only get a glimpse of how lifelikeness "gets going" in material terms, but also, by the end, begin to appreciate how the Bible seeks to express and comment on such a perspective, so that our reaction to it stays grounded in a full appreciation of what the lives we are living have the potential to mean.
Before plunging ahead, however, it will be well worth our while to state a bit more concretely what kind of answer to the question of where life came from one could possibly hope to put forward in what follows. The most straightforward notion of what such a success could look like would be the perhaps childlike hope that we could one day make a movie of exactly whichever storied puddle it was where certain special chemical reactions first happened, and (crucially!), that we would be able to prove, using data gathered in the present, that the movie was a faithful model of what took place in the past.3 There is more than one reason why that kind of approach is a fantasy, but the most fundamental must certainly be that we do not have—and cannot ever have—any evidence in the present day of exactly what happened on Earth however many billions of years back. Much the same way that both crime scenes and archaeological digs are ruined irreparably for forensic analysis if all the clues are allowed to be trampled, tampered with, and rearranged at random, so, too, must the precursors of the earliest life have gotten scrambled—only much, much more severely. DNA, RNA, and proteins are all macromolecules central to how life works at the subcellular level, and all of them fall to pieces in water on the time scale of millions of years or less.4 No one is foolish enough to try to comb the beach sand at Coney Island trying to reconstruct what a child's castle might have looked like for a few hours one summer day a hundred years ago, and reconstructing the molecular origins of life as we know it by trying to detect its leftover debris is a fool's errand.
There is, however, a different kind of approach one can take to explaining where something came from. The underlying premise of asking about the origins of life is that there is something here that needs an explanation, and it is helpful to try to be precise about what that is. When we go hiking in the mountains and notice a bunch of rocks at the bottom of a ravine, we are not provoked to ask how they got there; the same goes for pine cones we step on when walking under a pine tree. Of course, when I see a pine cone in a place in which I find it perfectly normal to observe one, I do not actually know with certainty what the whole history of that particular cone is; maybe someone actually put it there under the tree by hand before I arrived. Still, it does not seem out of place, because there is a perfectly ordinary, observable, and reproducible way to get pine cones to accumulate under pine trees. They fall there all the time as part of the normal seasonal ebb and flow of things.
This is the sense in which life seems to demand an explanation of the sort we might have a hope of constructing. We do not typically (or really ever) see living things spring from inert, inanimate matter, and so it seems abnormal to us to imagine it happening as an explanation for the life we see. Moreover, it is clear to our intuition that this is not merely an issue of our being unable to wait long enough. Of course, some processes that seem rare and improbable on one time scale (like a bolt of lightning on a particular mountain peak) become near-certainties if we just wait a hundred or a million times longer. Still, when we look at life, in all of its intricacy, it is apparent that the simplest of examples of it that we know are so complexly assembled that you would have to wait the ages of countless universes before seeing all these parts slapped together from one random fluke. The exact amount of time it all would have had to take obviously must have been the consequence of little details in this or that chemical process that might take a hundred years under one set of conditions or a million years under another. Nonetheless, the account we really hunger for—the only kind of account that could provide an answer that is both testable and (at least to some degree) satisfying—is for the first assembly of life to be conceived of as a process that has been decomposed into steps that can be theoretically understood and experimentally implemented and observed—in other words, into steps that each look to us like pine cones falling off trees.
I aim to showcase the beginnings of this sort of an understanding within these pages. I do not know, and never expect to know, exactly which molecules did what or when a long, long time ago. What I do want to propose is that there is a set of ideas, based on a branch of physics called nonequilibrium thermodynamics, that is starting to show us how to break the stepwise process of life's emergence into comprehensible increments. Once we recognize that life, through the lens of physics, is an omnibus of specific but different phenomena with precise physical definitions, we can study the emergence of these phenomena more in parallel, as little, limited successes in lifelike self-organization. The more these pieces of the puzzle can be separately implemented, poked, and tweaked in a laboratory, the more we can start to relate to them as banal, tangible bits of the places and timetables we inhabit.
Central to this discussion will be an idea I have called dissipative adaptation, which essentially is a fancy way of saying that when matter gets knocked around by the patterns in its surroundings, it ends up getting stuck in shapes that look specially suited to respond to those patterns. We are going to have to lay out a number of different observations about physics and biology in order to build this idea up a bit more rigorously, but one of the gratifying things about this kind of science is that it stays very much in contact with the examples of messy complexity that we encounter in everyday life. What that means is that, by the time we reach our conclusion, you may be in the position to test much of what is being claimed here against the evidence of your own significant experience, whether that be watching sleet slide down a windshield in cold rain or observing how salt and pepper grains dance together in a pan of heated oil.

STAFF AND SNAKE



So he threw it to the ground, and it became a serpent.
—EXODUS 4:3
THERE IS JUST SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY REASONABLE ABOUT the following notion: if all life is built from atoms that obey precise equations we know—which seems to be true—then the existence of life might just be some downstream consequence of these laws that we haven't yet gotten around to calculating. This is essentially a physicist's way of thinking, and to its credit, it has already done a great deal to help us understand how living things work. Thanks to pioneers like Max Delbrück, who crossed over from physics to biology in the middle of the twentieth century, the influence of quantitative analyses from the physical sciences helped to give rise to mechanistic, molecular approaches in cell biology and biochemistry that led to many revolutionary discoveries. Imaging techniques such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and super-resolution microscopy have provided a vivid portrait of the DNA, proteins, and other structures smaller than a single cell that make life tick on a molecular scale.1 Moreover, by cracking the genetic code, we have become able to harness the machinery of living cells to do our bidding by assembling new macromolecules of our own devising. As we have gained an ever more accurate picture of how life's tiniest and simplest building blocks fit together to form the whole, it has become increasingly tempting to imagine that biology's toughest puzzles may only be solved once we figure out how to tackle them on physics' terms.
But approaching the subject of life with this attitude will fail us, for at least two reasons. The first reason we might call the fallacy of reductionism. Reductionism is the presumption that any piece of the universe we might choose to study works like some specimen of antique, windup clockwork, so that it is easy (or at least eminently possible) to predict the behavior of the whole once you know the rules governing how each of its parts pushes on and moves with the others. The dream of explaining and predicting everything from a few simple rules has long captured the imagination of many scientists, particularly physicists. And, in all fairness, a great deal of good science has been propelled forward by the hunger of some researchers for a more completely reductive explanation of the phenomenon that interests them. After all, there are things in the world that can be understood as the result of known interactions among various simpler pieces. From the rise and fall of ocean tides with the moon's gravitational tug, to the way that some genetic diseases can be traced to molecular events arising from the altered chemistry of one tiny patch on a protein's surface, sometimes the thing we are studying looks like a comprehensible sum of its parts.
Alas, the hope that all scientific puzzles would be conquered through reductionism was more popular with physicists before the twentieth century rolled around. Since then, multiple Nobel laureates in physics (and countless others as well) have written lucidly about how and why reductionist thinking often fails.2 You cannot use Newton's laws or quantum theory to predict the stock market, nor to predict even much simpler properties of "many-particle" systems, such as a turbulent fluid or a supercooled magnet.3 In all such cases, the physical laws supposedly "governing" it all are swamped with the immensity of what we do not know, cannot measure, or lack the ability to compute directly. As we shall see, physics still works on such systems, but not solely by starting with fundamental equations governing the microscopic parts.
The second mistake in how people have viewed the boundary between life and non-life is still rampant in the present day and originates in the way we use language. A great many people imagine that if we understand physics well enough, we will eventually comprehend what life is as a physical phenomenon in the same way we now understand how and why water freezes or boils. Indeed, it often seems people expect that a good enough physical theory could become the new gold standard for saying what is alive and what is not. What I will argue here, however, is that this approach fails to acknowledge that our own role in giving names to the phenomena of the world precedes our ability to say with any clarity what it means to even call something alive. A physicist who wants to devise theories of how living things behave or emerge has to start by making intuitive choices about how to translate the characteristics of the examples of life we know into a physical language. After one has done so, it quickly becomes clear that the boundary between what is alive and what is not is something that already got drawn at the outset, through a different way of talking than physics provides. The proper goal for a physicist's account of things should therefore be to find a way of describing that boundary in precise physical terms, so that we can get new insight into how matter might be gotten to move from one side of the borderline to the other.
TO SOME DEGREE, A HOPEFUL INCLINATION TOWARD REDUCTIONISM is expressed in the very asking of the question of where life comes from. We look at a living organism and cannot help but wonder whether such breathtaking success in form and function could simply be the result of a bunch of more basic pieces bouncing off of each other like simple and predictable billiard balls. Is there something more in the machine other than all its dumbly vibrating parts? If there isn't, shouldn't that mean we can eventually understand how the whole thing fits together? Put another way, wouldn't any proposed explanation for the emergence of life have to break it all down into a series of rationalized steps, where each next one follows sensibly and predictably from the last? If so, how is that not the same thing as saying we want to reduce life to a choreographed performance directed by a simple, calculable set of known physical rules?
As I've said, it must be granted that physicists have already identified some rules that prove to make highly accurate predictions in systems that once seemed hopelessly and mysteriously complicated. Thanks to the ideas of people like Kepler and Newton, the motion of heavenly bodies is now an open book, and our ability to compute where these bright lights in the sky go is such an unremarked banality that it is now possible to get an extensive education in physics at many a great university without ever delving into the specialty sideshow of rigorous orbital mechanics. Imagine, though, being a brilliant natural philosopher at any point during most of human history, and marveling at the seemingly intractable complexity of how the sun, moon, and stars seem to continually rearrange themselves in the firmament as the days and years pass. The idea that a terse pair of equations describing gravitation and motion under force could bring distant galaxies, the wandering planets, and boxes dangling by coiled springs all into one comprehensive theoretical frame must have been inconceivable even to the greatest genius of every era for thousands of years. The scope and significance of the revolution that started with Newton and his contemporaries are hard to overstate.
And then came the twentieth century! Einstein began with contemplating the equations that describe the motion of light, and through sheer force of insight ended up reimagining the origins of gravity, so as to finally explain the last remaining puzzle of planetary motion that Newton could not touch (namely, Mercury). Meanwhile, Erwin Schrödinger's quantum mechanical wave equation unlocked the atom, providing an elegant quantitative explanation for the colors of light emitted from various types of electrified gases. This was a bizarre, unintuitive theory of the mathematical inner workings of objects too small to be seen or touched, yet it could still match experimental measurements with stunning accuracy. In the wake of these grand scientific victories, one might forgive the odd scientist or two for feeling like all unpredictability might eventually be swept away as newer and ever more brilliant theories arrived.
On closer inspection, however, this hit parade of wins for reductive theoretical science reveals some bias. What these and many other examples of successful physical theories have in common is that they perform best when trying to predict a well-isolated piece of the world described by a relatively simple mathematical formulation involving a few different things one can measure—the one-planet solar system, the single, solitary hydrogen atom, and so on. In each of these cases, the theory succeeds by filtering out the rest of the universe and focusing on a few equations that accurately describe the relationships among a small number of physical quantities. By the same token, looking a little more closely at these same models gives us some appreciation of where reductive thinking is going to falter.
Sometimes our models disappoint us because they fail to capture something fundamental to the behavior of the system they are trying to describe. For example, as referenced above, the sun's gravity is felt so strongly by the planet Mercury that Newton's Law of Gravitation was notoriously insufficient for predicting the observed shape of the orbit; only with the added subtlety of General Relativity could that hole be plugged. Still, there are a great many situations in weaker gravitational fields where Newton works quite adequately, in principle. Remarkably, though, even when the model we are using is a perfectly accurate statement of the rules by which the system of interest behaves, the problem of prediction can still be a slippery one.
With only one star and one planet, the equations of motion are beautifully supple and, after a little effort where pen meets paper, yield precisely the Keplerian laws that planets are observed to obey. Predicting the shape of a planet's orbit when it's all alone is therefore thought of as being relatively easy. The task gets more difficult, however, when you add just one more orbiting object, and stumble into the famous three-body problem, which no longer admits a solution in terms of exact equations on a blackboard. Tangling with such a system forces one either to use mathematical tricks, in order to approximate an answer that can still be derived by hand, or to employ computers, for "brute-force" tabulation of numerical results. Moreover, the longer one studies, the more it becomes clear that the instances where everything is beautifully tractable and can be written out from start to finish on a cocktail napkin are the rare exceptions rather than the general rule. Every so often, special symmetries and particularities of cases like the one-planet solar system make for an elegant resolution of things in a few lines of equations. The norm, however, is that systems with many different interacting components have to be solved by a computer program. With information-processing power as great as it is today, it is possible to make highly precise and accurate Newtonian predictions about orbital motions involving many more than three celestial bodies. Nonetheless, the general and highly influential lesson from orbital mechanics, ever since it was first developed as a theoretical field, is that systems with more pieces are harder to study than systems with fewer pieces, and by making and testing predictions about the behavior of simpler cases, we can better understand the laws that govern the complex ones.
According to what we have said so far, though, reductionism could still be correct—it might just be a bit dull and costly to find out the answer by waiting for a computer cluster to spit one out. Armed with such tools, an extreme reductionist would say that all theoretical science has to proceed as follows: start with the fundamental laws that seem to govern the separate little pieces of the world and that do well describing small groups of interacting objects, and then groan and strain to keep adding more variables to the calculation, in order to predict what more complicated systems are supposed to do. Several centuries ago, when the total absence of computers meant that no one understood very much about their limitations, it may have been more reasonable to imagine that all successful theoretical predictions would follow this same pattern. In the past two hundred years, however, a great portion of the science that has been done has worked in a different way from what had been expected, for reasons both practical and profound.
Consider, for example, a beaker of liquid water that has been placed on a hot plate: common knowledge would say there is a certain temperature above which we expect water to boil off into steam. For the reductionist, this boiling temperature depends on a short list of fundamental things we already know about water at the microscopic level. Water molecules are made of even tinier particles called electrons and nuclei, and we know a lot about how much they all weigh and what kinds of forces they exert on each other. Consequently, the Schrödinger equation provides an excellent model of what allows these components to bind together into what we call H2O. In that case, you might say that to find out the boiling temperature, you just need to write down a Schrödinger equation describing the trillion trillion water molecules filling a vessel of water, and then work out the probability of those molecules staying in the vessel depending on how fast they are jiggling around.
This brute-force approach fails spectacularly. First of all, it faces an obvious logistical hurdle: even with state-of-the-art supercomputers, the amount of computing muscle required to handle the time scales, particle numbers, and spatial resolution needed to tell the difference between vapor and liquid, using an exact treatment of quantum theory, dwarfs what we currently can manage by many orders of magnitude. The insufficiency of our computing power is so dire, in fact, that it is tempting to speak bluntly and admit we will never build a computer big enough because it would not fit inside our galaxy. Brute-force attempts to bridge from the nanoscale to the macro-sized world of our experience will lie beyond our reach for the foreseeable future, and possibly forever.
There are, however, work-arounds. Perfect precision in every detail is not needed in order to wring correct answers from the reductionist approach, and we may be able to get away with judicious approximations. Indeed, most, if not all, attempts to use quantum mechanics to compute the properties of molecules these days depend on well-established tricks for making the math simpler by sacrificing a bit of accuracy. These methods can give decent agreement with many quantities measured in real molecules, at least up to a certain number of decimal places. What if we just get the properties of each tiny molecule a little bit wrong—this force somewhat too strong and that atom slightly too light? Can we still get things mostly right when asking, for example, whether water should behave as a liquid or as a vapor under certain conditions?4
Boiling turns out to be a phenomenon perfectly well suited to showing why the smallest inaccuracies in the simulated properties of individual pieces of a system can lead to dramatic qualitative differences in how the collective will behave. The conversion of a liquid to a vapor is an example of what is called a phase transition, which is precisely the sort of everyday scenario we are familiar with where small changes in physical parameters can have a huge impact. Water in a glass on a kitchen table at 98 degrees Celsius (208°F) will be scalding, but unambiguously a liquid. As we heat the same molecules to 102 degrees Celsius (215°F), we will see it convert to a gas called steam. If we measured the typical speed at which the molecules were found to be randomly jiggling around at the two different temperatures, we would find it had changed by less than 1 percent in the process of heating. How, then, can we explain such stark differences in material properties between the liquid and gas states?
Transitions between phases of matter happen when their individual components cooperate in some way. Consider, for example, a small group of water molecules. Because of the positive and negative charges in different parts of the molecule, there are attractive forces that hold groups of molecules together, a little like the way gravity holds things on the surface of the Earth. If a rocket achieves a high enough velocity pointed away from the planet's surface, it can escape the gravitational pull, which gets weaker as the rocket moves upward. Similarly, if one member in a cluster of molecules achieves a certain speed relative to the other members it is also able to escape.



In a liquid, the constituent atoms or molecules are packed together relatively densely, so that one particle feels the attractive forces exerted on it by a number of other particles in its vicinity. Because of these forces, the particles stay close together even though they are always moving in haphazard directions. In a gas, particles move at higher speeds, and the mutual attraction between any pair of them is not typically strong enough to bind them to each other as one flies by the other. As a result, the same number of particles spread out over much more space.


At a given temperature, we can think of the possible speed of one of these molecules as being roughly fixed, so that the question of escape velocity reduces to asking how strong the "gravitational pull" is. In a cluster of two molecules, there is a base level of attraction between the two, but in a cluster of three molecules, the attractive force felt by any one molecule is stronger, and with four, it is even stronger than that. As other neighbors crowd around, the same molecule moving at the same typical speed effectively finds itself sinking into a deeper and deeper valley that it is harder and harder to climb out of. The net effect, therefore, is that every individual molecule feels stuck in place in proportion to how many other molecules are near it. But this also gives us the makings of a stampede, in which the escape of a few members of the group from the liquid state can effectively drag the rest along with them.
Liquid water molecules take up much less space than the same number of molecules of steam, so we can think of vaporization as a process whereby molecules that were crowded into one corner of a container together now break free and get to rove more widely. When only one molecule escapes the huddle, the rest do not notice, and the force holding each of them in place barely changes. If another leaves, however, followed by another, each time, the attraction holding the next molecule back gets weaker, on average. Right at the phase transition of the boiling point, the water teeters on the brink between a condensed liquid (where the molecules crowd together) and a dilute vapor (where in a runaway bandwagoning effect one molecule after another goes off on its own as the number of other molecules grabbing onto it and holding it in place precipitously declines).
If we imagine some steam poised on the tipping point in this way, the tricky thing now is that we could make an enormous difference to its behavior by just slightly altering how strongly its molecules are attracted to each other. Formerly, we had a situation where the evaporation of one molecule from a drop of liquid might make it more likely that another molecule will do the same; by tilting the scales just a bit to make molecules hold on to each other more forcefully, we can suddenly find instead that when a single molecule joins the liquid, it makes the next one more likely to follow suit. In such a case, it is now a stampede into the higher-density liquid state that becomes massively more probable. And the crucial point here is that, because of how sensitive the physical prediction is to fine details of parameters like the strength of an attractive force between molecules, using an approximate, numerical simulation on a computer to calculate what such molecular properties are becomes a dicey proposition. In the finicky molecular herd, even small quantitative ways in which our calculations are inaccurate can easily add up to a huge qualitative inaccuracy, such as claiming a vapor is a liquid, or vice versa.
The world abounds with cooperative, bandwagoning effects like the one we have just described, many of them operating at the molecular level or smaller. Phase transitions like freezing or evaporation give us a simple everyday phenomenon to take as the archetypal example, but the full range of ways that large groups of interacting pieces can be tipped from one kind of collective behavior to another through small changes in how they interact is vast and diverse. The upshot of this fact is that there are many ways in which the extreme reductionist, armed with a powerful supercomputer, is going to miss the mark by miles when trying to compute the behavior of the whole directly from the simple rules obeyed by its parts. As physics Nobel laureate P. W. Anderson once famously wrote: "More is different."5 And while we may well succeed at coming up with very good physical theories of things like freezing crystals or viscous fluids, it will not be because we have started by perfecting our detailed models of the atoms or subatomic particles out of which these things are built. Instead, we have to meet the many-particle system in question on its own terms and try to understand relationships among the different collective properties it presents.
THERE IS A RETREAT POSITION AVAILABLE AFTER THE defeat of reductionism that keeps many vaguely nursing the hope that the study of life will one day look less like gardening and more like tabulating the consequences of a physical equation. While it may be hard to predict the vaporization point of water from a first-principles model of molecular dynamics, we certainly still have some very good physical theories that help us to predict much of what happens in systems made of many interacting particles.
For a first example, when liquid turns to vapor, its volume dramatically increases, and it generally absorbs a certain amount of heat from its surroundings. Knowing the exact increase in volume that accompanies this phase transition, as well as the corresponding amount of heat absorbed, enables one to use a theoretical result called the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to predict how much the boiling temperature should increase for a certain increase in external pressure.6 This equation can be derived without making any reference whatsoever to molecules, quantum mechanics, or the specific forces that act between the different bits of the liquid together.
There is also a number that describes how the typical size of bubbles in a superheated pressurized fluid changes as one varies the temperature.7 This number, along with various other "critical exponents," as they are called, can be computed very well from a beautiful theory, and they do not depend one bit on the details of how strongly the molecules involved interact. Indeed, in a phenomenon known as universality, which arises from deep mathematical identities between different kinds of models that can be made of various many-body systems, these exponents turn out to pop up with precisely the same values in very different settings: for example, magnetic crystals, lipid bilayers, and superheated fluids.
More evocatively, however (and most basically, as far as the physics is concerned), we can imagine firing a bullet into a giant tank of water. Though performing precise enough measurements might be challenging in practice, we have very simple and accurate theories that tell us how much the temperature of the water should increase once the bullet has stopped and the water has ceased its sloshing. All we need to know is the speed and mass of the bullet and the quantity of water. This calculation can be performed by a college freshman without any knowledge whatsoever of how viscous water is, how the bullet is shaped, or even what kinds of atoms the liquid is made of.
What these and many other cases like them have in common is that they rely on very general theoretical statements about the physical laws we observe all matter to obey that are independent of the particular types of materials and forces involved. In the case of the bullet, we invoke the idea from Newtonian mechanics that energy is "conserved," meaning that the total amount of it in the world has to stay the same. Thus, the kinetic energy of the bullet has to be converted, joule for joule, into heat energy in the surrounding water. The "heat capacity" of water, meanwhile, is an empirical, collective property of the liquid that can be measured in the laboratory, and once we know it, we can tell how much heat was introduced by measuring the corresponding change in temperature. True, it was the friction and turbulence in the water that helped to turn the bullet's motion into heat—that is, into the random motions of countless molecules. But we do not need to have a good model of that process at all in order to know its consequences for the flow of energy.
It was precisely this kind of thinking that launched the study of thermodynamics. The concept of energy is born from studying Newton's laws: it is a single number that gives a combined summary of all the motion and potential for motion in an assemblage of matter. The important thing about energy is that Newtonian mechanics does not allow it to be created or destroyed; it can only be transformed from one form to another. This principle of energy conservation is easiest to derive from Newton's laws for a single particle, but it is expected to apply equally well to ice cubes and hurricanes: we may not be able to predict exactly everything that a complicated collection of different particles will do, but we generally expect it only to do things that conserve energy, and this does frequently grant us a lot of power to predict what can happen.
The classic early successes of thermodynamics are all founded in one way or another on applying the idea of energy conservation in a system where tracking and predicting what all the microscopic parts are doing is impossible. An insulated canister of pressurized air might contain a trillion trillion molecules, but thinking about where each particle is turns out to be beside the point for what we are typically interested in here. As the air pushes against a piston and expands the size of the container, it is a virtual certainty that the gas will cool down, because the energy bookkeeping requires it. The calculation is beautifully simple, exploiting physical laws that the system will obey regardless of what it is made of. Thus, amid a great many details that might be devilishly hard to predict, there is ample opportunity for physical theories to work quite well.
Energy conservation is one of many ways in which a system with many unpredictable microscopic pieces can exhibit behaviors on a collective scale that can be explained and predicted with good physical theories. Whether because of symmetries—as when a molecule is identical to its mirror image—or other geometrical regularities—as in a type of crystal of identical atoms that behaves like a regular lattice of tiny interacting bar magnets—there are numerous opportunities to take something whose microscopic description seems complicated and make a good model of it that takes advantage of mathematical tricks to set powerfully predictive constraints on how the collective behavior can look. This is especially the case once one also makes use of ideas from probability theory to focus on the average, or typical, behavior of a large number of particles rather than on the atypical flukes that, while possible in principle, are highly unlikely to be observed in an experiment. So it is that the field of statistical thermodynamics, and more broadly a field called condensed matter theory, has tackled an enormous range of hidden predictabilities describing different kinds of systems—whether in the heat capacity of crystals or the patchiness of a lipid membrane, in the clumping of micro-sized beads or the magnetism of cold metals.8 Complex collections of large numbers of separate parts turn out to be stunningly simple and tractable when viewed in terms of particular physical properties.
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING SUCCESSES OF statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory is their ability to explain, in testable, quantitative terms, how and why matter undergoes phase transitions like boiling and freezing. As described earlier, the formation of liquids (or solids) from vapors (or liquids) always involves a stampede of molecules or atoms cooperating to bind each other into a denser or more orderly arrangement once the temperature drops to a point where thermal motion is sufficiently weak. What is particularly captivating about phase transitions, though, is that they are processes that transform one substance into another whose properties are qualitatively new. Any young child can tell the difference between liquid water and a solid chunk of ice, and may even marvel when discovering for the first time that one of these things can be turned into the other in the palm of one's hand. How is it that something so brittle and unyielding, that can be carved into a brick or a figurine, can become fluid and formless just by getting a little bit warmer? The mathematical understanding of how this qualitative newness arises has been crystal clear for more than half a century and is a testament to the deep insight that physicists have been able to glean from their equations.
But what about life? Much like a toddler holding an icicle, we still feel a measure of awe when confronting the fact that a living organism, with all its dazzling qualitative difference from things that are not alive, is still built out of the same lifeless raw materials as everything else. From the perspective of the physicist, it at first might seem that what we have here is a well-defined challenge that could eventually yield to inquiry in the same way that melting ice once did: we have an instance where matter gets arranged in a way that seems wondrously new and distinct, but perhaps we just need to understand the physical principles involved well enough to realize how the wondrous newness is actually just a predictable expression of laws we already know. Once upon a time, the transformation of liquids into solids was mysterious, but now we know it's all about temperature and the forces between molecules. Could there be a similarly pat explanation for when and how inert building blocks join together and come to life?
In the first half of the twentieth century, more than one titan of quantum theory grappled inconclusively with this very question. Physicists had developed sensible, powerful theories of the tiny bits out of which atoms are made, and many of the phenomena of molecular chemistry suddenly began to look like derivative consequences of a more basic physical description. The time was ripe, it seemed, to ask whether a living thing made of atoms should really be thought of as something more or different than any other pile of atoms, and the question attracted the attention of no less than two of the founding fathers of quantum theory. Niels Bohr believed life should be thought of as more than its constituent pieces, but struggled to explain why.9 Erwin Schrödinger, meanwhile, authored a monograph titled What Is Life?, in which he ruminated on what life must look like on the atomic scale.10 With so much new knowledge about what molecules were, it suddenly made sense to try to explain life's tricks using the seemingly unstoppable physical theories of the day.
Schrödinger's speculations became famous for at least two insights. First, in a stunning leap of intuition, he suggested that in order for inheritance of traits from parent to offspring to be physically possible, there had to be a molecule in cells that was best described as an "aperiodic crystal," much like the linearly ordered ("crystal") but nonrepeating ("aperiodic") sequence of chemical bases that has since been discovered in DNA. Second, he pointed out that life had to "feed on negative entropy," an apt phrase that we shall return to in Chapter 6. On the topic of whether there was new physics—or something beyond physics—in life, however, Schrödinger was somewhat elliptical. On the one hand, he acknowledged at length that living things seemed totally unlike inanimate matter in how they interacted with their surroundings; yet, on the other, he expressed confidence that nothing about what life did at the molecular level occurred according to laws other than the physics he knew. In the end, the reader of What Is Life? is left feeling that physics should be able to describe all that there is, including life, but that there was a lingering possibility that could not be entirely erased that life was a phenomenon that somehow stood beyond the confines of its physical mechanisms.
We haven't solved this puzzle yet, but its resolution is much easier to articulate decades later, now that molecular biology has its own long and venerable history as a hard science in its own right. Thanks to countless experiments on molecules, cells, tissues, and whole organisms, it is now abundantly clear that the marvelously diverse functional capabilities of a living thing all have sound bases in the physical properties of their material parts.
However, this is not to say that reductionism reigns again; on the contrary, the "more is different" idea of emergent properties rears its head everywhere in the study of how life works. Blood, for example, is a liquid that flows through veins and carries oxygen, and its biochemical capacity to absorb and release oxygen is well understood in terms of the atomic structure of a protein on red blood cells known as hemoglobin. At the same time, though, a quantity such as the viscosity of blood (which in theory results from mixing water molecules with plasma proteins and many other components) would be utterly impossible for anyone to predict precisely from first principles. The number of different factors contributing to how a given cell or molecule slides by another in such a heterogeneous mixture is so particular and complexly sensitive to small differences in the interaction properties of each pair of components that there will never be a computation as reliable and informative as just doing the experiment to measure what the empirical answer is.
Yet this empirical answer is important! Life thrives in the realm of the particular, where quite specific and precise properties are achieved by its components that could trigger catastrophic failures if they turned out differently. We cannot assume that any small change to how sluggishly blood slides through a vessel, for example, or to the DNA sequence that instructs the cell how to build a particular protein, will necessarily only make a small difference to how the living thing functions as a whole. Life is a grab bag of different pieces, some of whose physical properties are easier to predict mechanistically than others, and it is certainly the case that at least some of the factors that matter a great deal to how a living thing works will fall into the category of highly nonuniversal emergent properties that are impossible to derive from first principles.
At base, this challenge will always keep popping up, because talking in physical terms is never the same thing as talking in biological ones, and so biologically important questions are not picked for their physical tractability. Instead, biological and physical ways of talking ground themselves in very different conceptual spaces. Physics is an approach to science that roots itself in the measurement of particular quantities: distance, mass, duration, charge, temperature, and the like. Whether we are talking about making empirical observations or developing theories to make predictions, the language of physics is inherently metrical and mathematical. The phenomena of physics are always expressed in terms of how one set of measurable numbers behaves when other sets of measurable numbers are held fixed or varied. This is why the genius of Newton's Second Law, F = ma, was not merely that it proposed a successful equation relating force (F), mass (m), and acceleration (a), but rather that it realized that these were all quantities in the world that could be independently measured and compared in order to discover such a general relationship.
This is not how the science of biology works. It is true that doing excellent research in biology involves trafficking in numbers, especially these days: for example, statistical methods help one gain confidence in trends discovered through repeated observations (such as a significant but small increase in the rate of cell death when a drug is introduced). Nonetheless, there is nothing fundamentally quantitative about the scientific study of life. Instead, biology takes the categories of living and nonliving things for granted as a starting point, and then uses the scientific method to investigate what is predictable about the behavior and qualities of life. Biologists did not have to go around convincing humanity that the world actually divides into things that are alive and things that are not; instead, in much the same way that it is quite popular across the length and breadth of human language to coin terms for commonplace things like stars, rivers, and trees, the difference between being alive and not being alive gets denoted with vocabulary.
In short, biology could not have been invented without the preexisting concept of life to inspire it, and all it needed to get going was for someone to realize that there were things to be discovered by reasoning scientifically about things that were alive. This means, though, that biology most certainly is not founded on mathematics in the way that physics is. Discovering, for example, that plants need sunlight to grow, or that fish will suffocate when taken out of water, requires no quantification of anything whatsoever. Of course, we could learn more by measuring how much sunlight the plant got, or timing how long it takes for the fish-out-of-water to expire. But the basic empirical law in biological terms only concerns itself with what conditions will enable or prevent thriving, and what it means to thrive comes from our qualitative and holistic judgment of what it looks like to succeed at being alive. If we are honest with ourselves, the ability to make this judgment was not taught to us by scientists, but comes from a more common kind of knowledge: we are alive ourselves, and constantly mete out life and death to bugs and flowers in our surroundings. Science may help us to discover new ways to make things live or die, but only once we tell the scientists what those words mean.
The angst of physicists such as Bohr and Schrödinger was therefore impossible to cure within the confines of physics alone; their question was, in fact, a philosophical one that was handled most effectively by a contemporary of theirs named Ludwig Wittgenstein.11 As Wittgenstein put it, "the borders of my language are the borders of my world." In other words, the same whole cloth of human experience can be talked about and classified in different ways, and we cannot entirely separate the question of what the world is from the language we use to characterize it. Take a drop of rainwater getting soaked up into a tree through roots in the ground: I could talk about percolation in granular materials, osmotic pressure, and capillary action, or I could say the plant is being nourished by water that it drinks with its roots. Both of these ways of talking are perfectly true, yet while one focuses on measurable physical quantities, the other is oriented toward the integrity and health of the living tree. While it may be fair to say that one of these accounts is a reasonable attempt at translation from the other, they simply aren't couched in the same terms, and they both add to our understanding of the world.
Accordingly, we cannot expect a theory couched entirely in terms of physical quantities to tell us the exact moment when life emerges. Whether a physicist is looking at a hurricane or a cat, the fundamental picture is the same: a pile of particles with positions and velocities governed by forces acting between them. Now, the antireductionist story of emergent properties allows the physicist also to see new kinds of physical quantities that are hard to predict from the microscopic ones: the vorticity of the hurricane, or the refractive index of the lens in the cat's eye. Still, no list of such quantities is equivalent by definition to answering the question of which pile of particles is alive and which is not. We did not know any physics when we invented the word "life," and it would be strange if physics only now began suddenly to start dictating to us what the word means.
THE DEFINITIONAL SEPARATENESS OF PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL thinking is not as dismal a state of affairs as it may at first sound. While it is true that concepts like health, sickness, life, and death can never be fully replaced by measurements of physical quantities, it is obviously the case that making such measurements often informs our judgment. For example, the blood pressure of a living person is generally a lot higher than that of a cadaver. The point about language here is simply that it is always up to the intuition of the observer to make the conceptual leaps necessary to translate accurately from one vocabulary to another, and no one way of translating is going to be obviously best. The upshot is that, while biology may never be taken over entirely by physics, there is a tremendous amount we can discover about how the physical properties of living things allow them to accomplish all the distinctively lifelike things they do.
Much of the biophysical science that has been inspired by this approach so far has focused on explaining the behavior of existing life in terms of what we can measure physically in the matter it is made of. For example, the hemoglobin protein in our blood is a molecule composed of thousands of atoms—carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, and iron—that are strung together in a chain known as a polypeptide. When this polypeptide chain is produced in the body, it folds up into a particular three-dimensional shape that enables it to grab onto and let go of oxygen in just the way that blood needs to. There is a lot of interesting physics to understand about how it is that this linear string of atoms needs to be engineered in order for it to automatically fold, like a self-pitching tent, into a particular, special shape that imbues it with just the right chemical properties, and this challenge is known as the protein folding problem.12
What makes the protein folding problem especially fascinating is that it provides a window into the emergence of biological function on the smallest scale. Polypeptides are strings of chemical groups known as amino acids, and each amino acid on its own is fairly unremarkable: a relatively small molecule that can spin, vibrate, and stick to things. String together a few hundred of these into a chain, however, and suddenly there is a seemingly infinite array of possible tasks that might be accomplished in a way that serves the biochemical needs of a living cell: proteins speed up vital chemical reactions, clump together into filaments and structural scaffolds that give the cell its squishy resilience, and even can assemble into spinning motors powered by chemical fuel.
Indeed, the functional capabilities of proteins are so breathtaking that their usefulness and qualitative difference from nonbiological matter seem self-evident, but here is where we have to be careful. Hemoglobin looks useful to us because we first take for granted the biological goal of carrying oxygen, and then work backward. If we did not know this or have such a goal, it would be much more difficult to specify a physical property of this particular pile of atoms that makes it more evocative of life than a hunk of mineral or plastic. When breaking off a piece of a living organism we know, and trying to see what makes it tick from the perspective of physics, we do not have to tangle directly with this problem if we do not wish to because the goal is already known. Much of biophysics proceeds in this way: it starts by taking for granted the problem a living thing is trying to solve and then studies how molecules or cells achieve an impressive solution. But what if we are interested not in what life does, but rather, in how it got that way? In the absence of a living thing with a goal, what could it mean for a piece of matter to have function and purpose? How does the first goal get decided on?
For the hint of an answer, we need to consider carefully what is meant by the claim that the shape of hemoglobin gives it a particular biochemical function. Clearly, if every possible way of slapping together atoms were equally good at carrying oxygen in the way that blood needs, it would be meaningless to claim that hemoglobin functioned this way. Instead, what we implicitly recognize is that the three-dimensional structure of this molecule is exceptional in comparison to most randomly chosen alternative ways of putting the pieces together. In general, we have the accurate intuition that putting building blocks together completely at random does not usually produce a tool that's particularly good for anything. Well-built assemblages are rare in the space of all possible assemblages, and we sense that rarity when we recognize that a structure is impressively suitable for a particular function.
In order to understand how matter that is unlike life gets to be like it, then, the first step may lie in thinking about the physics of becoming exceptional, so that one's physical properties are highly atypical compared to what most arrangements of the same matter will get you. As we have said, there is no physical property that is the same thing as being alive, but there certainly are behaviors that are distinctive of life that have exact physical definitions. Living things self-replicate—that is, they make copies of themselves. They also harvest energy from their surroundings and use it to repair themselves and to grow. Most intriguingly, they behave in ways that often seem to reflect accurate predictions about their future environment that have been inferred from what already happened in the past. While it may be nonsense to try to derive a definition for life from physical laws, it is useful to ask well-defined questions about the conditions under which particles that are initially bad at such harvesting and predicting start to get good at it. This is an investigation that is inspired by what we find remarkable about life, but that can be undertaken entirely within the domain of physics—and, while it may not tell us at the end where life as we know it came from, it promises at least to open our eyes to the physics of what may be lifelike about any pile of particles we see in the world—clouds, cats, and everything else.
MOSES HAD A STAFF WITH HIM THE DAY HE FIRST REACHED Mount Horeb, because he was a shepherd. He had driven the flock of Jethro there along with him. The remarkable starting point for his divinely inspired contemplation of life's boundary is therefore a herd of animals—that is, a somewhat unruly collective phenomenon made up of many distinct pieces that interact strongly with each other. We can easily miss the point because each sheep in the herd is itself alive, but the flock still stands strikingly for a single thing that has properties and behaviors reaching far beyond the sum of its simpler individual parts. Thus, the herding staff of Moses begins by reminding us that "more is different."
The real show starts when God asks Moses to speak. "And the Lord said to him, What is that in your hand, and he said, A staff" (Ex. 4:2). When being named and grasped by a fist, a staff strongly evokes the idea of an inanimate object: It is an instrument that is only moved by the hand that directs it. It points and prods—even measures, perhaps—but it is a passive piece of material that is predictably subject to the forces that act on it. We can push on one end and reliably get the other end to go where we want with metrical precision.
When Moses flings the staff to the ground at God's command, our focus is on the marvel: "And it became a serpent" (Ex. 4:3). It wasn't supposed to do that! In the midst of all this wonderment, we find it all too easy to miss the fact that a serpent is the living thing that most resembles a staff. In one sense, "and it became a turtle" would be no more stunning, since part of the point, of course, is that usually staves flung to the ground remain staves. Still, the close similarity in shape between this yardstick and a snake should get us thinking that part of the point is to recognize that this is really about looking at the same object from a new perspective, perhaps by talking about it with different words. A staff is a dead stick, but what, specifically, is true about a snake that makes it so much more alive?
Suppose we were to put a stick beside a snake and ask this question. A ledger of differences unfolds: snakes keep moving across the ground, while sticks come to rest; snakes eat and excrete, while sticks do neither; snakes keep on changing in shape, while a stick stays stiff. And perhaps the most notable difference of all stands out if we let ourselves think back to the Bible's first and archetypal serpent, in Eden: this is a creature that seems to speak. Above all, the difference between the staff of Moses and the reptile it becomes is that the latter can appear to communicate something. This could fairly be taken to refer to the sense of behavioral back-and-forth that develops between a person and another animal in the same place: even if we do not share a language of words with snakes or other creatures, we feel compelled to recognize that they behave as though they have intentions that might be accurately expressed through words. By comparison, the opportunity for any kind of dialogue is totally lacking in the lifeless sticks and utensils that we grab hold of and use.
At the same time, in this story, the stick and snake are a single, unified object; the marvel therefore spurs us to question, and perhaps even discard, some of the above contrasts. Can a stick floating down a stream or bending in the wind be said to be "eating" in any sense if we were to quantify and monitor the right flows of matter and energy? Is it never the case, in such settings, that the stick acts as though it is trying to accomplish a particular complex task, or to adapt its motion to a particular pattern? Everyday experience tells us to ignore these speculations and others like them, but once we realize that the lens of physics reduces every living thing to looking like a specially configured pile of inanimate sticks, we confront the vast expanse of gray area stretching between the obviously alive and the obviously inanimate.
What might a rock remember, or even be able to predict, about the sounds that once knocked into it, if we had the ability to examine its physical structure in the right way? Are flames and tornadoes just your run-of-the-mill chunks of inanimate world, or do they know something more about what it's like to be alive? Questions like these are designed so as not to yield clear, decisive answers. Instead, they remind us that the word "life" admits many imperfect translations into the language of physics, and in order to hone our skills as translators, we may be well advised to spend some time pondering life's highly ambiguous boundary.

SNOW AND DUST

WHAT COUNTS AS LIFE, AND WHAT DOES NOT? I HAVE JUST argued that it is not going to be possible to use physical insight alone to define such a boundary, but that describing it precisely and accurately in the language of physics would shed new light on things. Yet, if the idea of being alive does not originate with physics, then what kinds of qualities and properties does it identify in the world, and how do we begin the hard work of translating those concepts into terms that might be described with physical theories?
The easy part of defining what it means to be a living organism is that any person can list countless examples off the cuff that are not at all close to any kind of borderline. Birds are alive, rocks are not, algae are alive, ice is not, and so on. Of course, the universe comprises exotic corner cases, such as mitochondria and computer viruses; and there may be someone somewhere who wants to put forward the idea that rocks actually are alive. Still, the existence of marginal examples does little to impinge on our ability to sort through the vast majority of cases, even in the face of the odd attempt at gerrymandering definitions.1 The reality is that we learn the meaning of most of the words we know simply by hearing how they are used, over and over again. We are all experts when it comes to the most representative cases of what is alive and what isn't.
The upshot of this linguistic state of affairs is that the truly coherent way of talking about what being alive consists of, physically, starts with noticing that all living things have certain behaviors and features in common. In other words, if we want to go the route of physics, we have to stop trying to tackle life at one go, and instead divide and conquer by being more precise in physicochemical terms about the different ways it is possible to look lifelike. We might first be tempted to be very specifically chemical and point out that every living thing contains water, DNA, amino acids, and the like. This route may miss the mark a bit, however, as our interest in life is usually not the fact that it contains these molecules, per se. Most ways of mixing together amino acids and DNA in water do not impress us as being lifelike at all, and this fact should remind us that it is really something in the dynamic relationship between different material building blocks coordinating together in particular ways in space and time that makes it possible to evoke lifelikeness. We therefore have a better chance of being able to shed light on our question in general theoretical terms if we keep our description of the phenomenon at hand somewhat more abstract, and less wedded to particulars of certain commonly occurring biochemicals.
A reasonable starting point is to observe that all living things are born from a parent or progenitor of some kind. In other words, self-replication, or the production of a faithful copy of oneself, is a dynamical behavior that is distinctive of life. Here, we have used the word "distinctive" quite carefully to mean something other than "unique," because it is certainly possible to think of examples of self-copying things that are not alive. A wildfire may spread through a field as though the flame in one location were duplicating itself in the nearby underbrush, yet to call the flame alive is a stretch. Nonetheless, self-replication definitely evokes life more powerfully than many other behaviors (such as falling in gravity or dissolving in water).
We also typically notice in living organisms the sense of a pattern that encompasses different parts, which together form a coherent whole. Life is not generally an arbitrary pile of unrelated pieces, but a pageant of interlocking components that manifestly have a coordinated relationship to each other. This coordination typically expresses itself both in structure (through symmetry, for example) and in dynamics (through the correlated motion of separated pieces of the whole). Thus, whether watching the opening of a flower's symmetrical arrangement of petals or observing the choreographed motion of fluorescently labeled chromosomes during the division of a single cell, we are confronted by hallmarks of unmistakable order, sometimes with striking geometrical regularity.
One could also make the case for the importance of self-repair to any concept of life. Not only is life typified by patterns across space and time, but it also is capable of recovering from physical insults that disrupt the orderliness of its internal components. Though healing is partly driven by the self-replication of tiny cells in a creature like a human being, the self-restoring tendency of many structures within living things is a more general feature of their behavior, even at the subcellular level.2 Of course, in order for self-repair to be a meaningful concept, we have to get more precise about what kind of activity it refers to. If a ball that gets dragged up a hill subsequently rolls back down, is it "repairing" itself to the valley where it "belongs"? If a hole that we melted in a frozen pond with a blowtorch resolidifies, is the pond ice healing itself? Clearly, the use of such language feels inaccurate in these simple cases, but if so, it is important to understand what is so different about the physics of a flesh wound that closes, scabs, and heals.
Living things also harvest and consume matter and energy from their surroundings that serve as fuel for their activities. From sequoias to mosquitos, from plankton to killer whales—without exception—everything that is alive has a different stream of chemicals, heat, and light going into it than it has coming out, and like a giant physicochemical waterwheel, this directional flow makes a whole host of subsidiary activities possible. Moreover, also like waterwheels, living things are structured so as to enable this flow in numerous ways. Trees have leaves, lions have teeth, and a great deal of biological science is devoted to showing all the ways in which the form of the living organism is exquisitely suited to the task of eating, digesting, and excreting. Again, we should not say that being good at absorbing energy from the surrounding environment is sufficient for being alive. When an opera singer strikes a high note, a crystal goblet may resonate with the pitch of her voice, thus absorbing some of its energy. But the goblet should not be said to be an example of life. Nonetheless, it is hard to imagine how life could be what it is without this striking ability.
Lastly, although the distinctive features of life are numerous, there is one more that is perhaps the most significant to include on any short list, and that is that living things sense, predict, and react deliberately to the world around them. Examples of this kind of behavior are numerous, whether at the molecular level—when, say, single bacterial cells detect sugars in their surrounding medium—or in larger organisms—such as when a forest animal finds shelter in advance of a breaking storm. Still, in another sense, prediction and sensing are the most difficult features to define precisely. Sometimes actions taken in the present correlate with future conditions in a way that serves a stated goal (as when a person brings an umbrella along for a walk because the sky is cloudy). However, the typical case with simpler organisms—or worse, with complex systems that are not necessarily alive—is far murkier. Every hunk of matter there is will change what it is doing when it gets pushed on by its surroundings, but it would not make sense to say that a rock senses anything when it gets stepped on. For that matter, how would one even go about proving that a rock's current behavior does not (or does!) imply any accurate forecast about what its environment is going to do in the future?
It will take several more chapters before we can begin to speculate about how to answer this last question. The starting point is to consider what the impossibly fuzzy border between life and non-life looks like when a physicist starts to dissect it.
WE THINK OF MAKING A COPY OF ONESELF AS BEING DIFFICULT, but that is because we usually focus on examples where the form being copied is extremely intricate. There may be no wonder in the world greater than the way a single zygotic cell can grow into a new, fully formed human being equipped with eyes, toes, and all the rest, and our sense of marvel is born out of not having the foggiest idea how to design such a process.
The truth, however, is that being a self-replicator is a much easier trick to pull off than being a human being. In the broadest sensible definition, a self-replicator is just any patterned clump of matter whose presence in a certain environment will increase the rate of formation of other clumps with the same pattern. To be more concrete, imagine a soup of molecules made of atoms of type A, B, C, and so on, where each molecule is a combination of one or more atoms, such as AB or C. The molecules jiggle around together and bounce off of each other somewhat randomly, and every so often, they react by forming or breaking chemical bonds. Some reactions happen frequently and rapidly, and others are slower.
In any situation where a chemical reaction, such as A + B → AB, proceeds more rapidly when C is an unconsumed bystander (as in C + A + B → C + AB), C is called a catalyst for that reaction. And in any instance where a molecule can catalyze its own formation (such as in AB + A + B → AB + AB), it is called an autocatalyst. Autocatalysis is certainly not a property common to all molecules and all reactions, but it can be found all over the place, as it can be achieved with relatively primitive physics. Suppose, for example, that A and B only react when they are in close proximity to each other for enough time. If so, then AB could easily end up acting as an autocatalyst if it turns out to stick to A and B and cause them to spend more time only a short distance apart. The presence of AB would increase the rate at which new AB molecules formed from raw materials (A and B) in the environment. Thus, while not as impressive as an animal giving birth, AB is nonetheless a self-replicator, because it accelerates the construction of more things like it.
Real examples of simple autocatalysis abound in the world of chemistry. In the lab of the chemist Sijbren Otto at the University of Groningen, a solution was prepared of single, separate molecules that tended to add onto the ends of linear filaments composed of multiple molecules stacked on top of each other. By allowing this reaction to proceed in a beaker that was being vigorously stirred all the while, the authors ensured that long filaments would get preferentially broken in half by the stirring, forming new short filaments. Every time a filament broke, two new filament ends were exposed that could begin to grow by stacking on more molecules. Thus, every time a new long filament snapped, the rate of short filament growth increased. The result was that the rate of formation of new filaments ended up being roughly proportional to the number of filaments already present, so that the overall rate of assembly grew over time.3
Researchers have also made self-replicating molecules using a so-called templated assembly model, which is easiest to implement using the kinds of macromolecules found in living cells. DNA, RNA, and protein all have in common that they are linear polymers built out of particular sequences of more basic building blocks. In the case of DNA and RNA, each has four types of nucleic acids to choose from for each member in the chain. For protein, there are twenty different kinds of amino acids that can appear at each position in the sequence. In both cases, each building block individually has some preference to stick to particular other kinds of building blocks. By stringing many such blocks together in a sequence, it therefore becomes possible to make a chain that has a highly specific preference to stick to some other patterned shape of molecule.



In a liquid solution, filaments (sticks) form as monomers (squares) stack irreversibly onto the stick-ends one by one (left side). Agitating the solution causes long filaments to snap, exposing more stick-ends, and thereby increasing the pace of filament formation (right side). The greater the number of filaments, the faster the next new filament will come into being.


In one study, biochemists at the Scripps Research Institute, Tracey Lincoln and Gerald Joyce, created RNA that could catalyze the fusion of two simpler pieces of RNA into a copy of itself.4 The experiment succeeded by ensuring that the RNA would be shaped such that it used two different portions of itself to bind specifically to the two separate pieces of component material, and held them in space together in a way that sped up the formation of a stable bond between them. With a generous supply of components, the concentration of this self-replicating RNA was able to grow exponentially.
Protein-based self-replicators are in some ways an even more intriguing case, because their most famous archetypes were first discovered in human medicine. Scientists investigating the cause of certain dementias, including mad cow disease and kuru, discovered a type of protein molecule, called a prion, that could act as an infectious agent on its own without forming a part of some virus or single-celled creature. Prions are protein chains folded stably into a shape that provides a template for other chains of the same amino acid sequence to fold into the same shape. Thus, putting things glibly, a prion can wander, zombie-like, around a single cell, forcing other proteins of like sequence to imitate it and also enter the prionic state, to the point where the number of prions can rise to toxic levels and keep spreading themselves to other cells.5
The fact that RNA and prions are made of materials first discovered in living cells does not mean they themselves are alive. They are single molecules of only moderately complicated construction, and while they may be able to promote the formation of copies of themselves under certain conditions, they are far less complex even than a not-quite-alive virus. The physics of acting as a template for the reshaping of matter in your surroundings into a pattern like your own makes for a less-than-dazzling story in its most basic versions, since it is just a question of how to arrange sticky patches on a surface in space so that the right parts of new material stick to them and to each other. What is clear from the above, however, is that templated assembly gets much easier to accomplish in practice once there is a worked-out mechanism for the formation of polymers made from a diverse set of similar but distinct building blocks. Much of biochemistry as we know it is based on being good at precisely this kind of molecular engineering, and it may well be that polymer templates are essential for achieving the specificity needed in order for self-replication to become as impressive as the versions of it that we observe in life.



The prionic state of a protein is a way of folding a certain kind of polypeptide chain so that other "native," functional copies with the same amino acid sequence will stick to the prion and get "templated"—that is, so that they fold into the prionic state themselves.


That being said, it should also be noted about prions that they are an excellent example of a more general phenomenon than self-replication, namely, positive feedback. Any time a feature, quality, or characteristic in a system accelerates the rate of its own increase, it has the opportunity to grow in a self-reinforcing way. At the social level, positive feedback can accelerate the spread of patterns of behavior, as when memes spread "virally" through the Internet. In an avalanche, small tremors can lead to larger rumblings, and so on. Yet, even at the level of molecular shape, or simply in the relative amounts of different kinds of molecules in a reaction pot, the feedback loop is one of the most powerful ways of bringing about a sudden and dramatic transformation of the organization of a system with many components. Moreover, all feedback has the same distinctive signature of energy flow and must be hooked up to some kind of power supply in its surroundings, and in the next chapter we will see why. Before doing so, it will be helpful to take a closer look at how living things are put together from their constituent parts.
HIDING IN THE BACKGROUND OF OUR FASCINATION WITH how living things work is a simple, accurate intuition: that putting matter together by hand so that it will act like it is alive is difficult. Whether we are considering the wings of a hummingbird or the leafy canopy of a tree, we take for granted that these are complex assemblages of different materials that, in the right combinations, are exquisitely good at what they are good at. Whatever engineers might learn by to some degree mimicking life's architectural successes, we usually find it quite challenging to come up with something more effective through our own ingenuity, particularly when it comes to the unique challenges of building things that work well on the scale of single molecules.
An even more basic point is that randomly assembled structures are nearly always going to be bad at recapitulating the functions that biological forms carry out. Put a frog in a blender, and afterward, the same physical raw material will be totally incapable of hopping, ribbiting, and catching flies. Cartoonish though this thought experiment may be (not to mention gruesome), it reminds us that when digging into the question of how lifelike forms get constructed, we need to understand that success is really judged against the backdrop of some "naïve" or "random" way of putting the same building materials together. Accordingly, it is worth our time to think carefully about the typical reason that materials with the potential to combine in lifelike ways fail to do so. Again, if a frog is ripped to its constituent atoms and they are then thrown together any which way, we do not expect to get back a frog, or even anything resembling life whatsoever. The two concepts we need to explain this fact lie at the foundation of all of statistical physics.
The first concept is called macroscopic coarse-graining, which is really nothing more complicated than the idea that there are many ways that two arrangements of the same matter can be identical in their coarser features while differing in their microscopic details. We start by conceiving of a physical system as something that can be described in its greatest possible detail by a set of numbers specifying what all the particles it is built of are doing—that is, where they are located in space, which direction they are moving in, and at what speed. In principle, this is all the information we would need to predict the behavior of the whole using Newton's laws, so from that Newtonian perspective, it amounts to a complete specification of everything that is physically knowable about the system. To tabulate the "microstate," as it is called, of a flake of snow made of 1021 atoms, you would need to know 6 × 1021 numbers: three numbers for each position in three-dimensional space, and three numbers to say where each particle is going and how fast. Now, it is a practical impossibility to know all of these numbers, if for no other reason than that our understanding of quantum theory suggests it is simply impossible—a contradiction in terms—to attempt to measure them all simultaneously. Nonetheless, even the most sensible and sophisticated theoretical understanding of this ice chip would admit that a vast amount of microscopic information is knowable about it in principle (even if that is challenging in practice), so that we can still think of different configurations for the atoms as corresponding to different choices of values of some set of numbers determining the microscopic state of the system.
Macroscopic coarse-graining is a way of lumping together groups of microstates and saying they are all the same by the standard of a particular way of assessing the whole. For example, if all I want to know about the ice is how many oxygen atoms there are per unit volume, on average, or what the speed of a single atom is, on average, then there clearly are vast numbers of microscopic arrangements for the entire collective that will give the same average value in each case. Put another way, using a device to measure a quantity like the average density determines the value of that coarse-grained macroscopic quantity, but it does not reveal enough information to know which microstate the system is in, because all the microstates in this coarse-grained group look the same from the perspective of the measuring device.
In the world of everyday life, our senses relate directly to coarse-grained features of matter. We can tell whether the air around us is warm or cool, which implies something about the average speed of molecules in the surroundings, but we have no idea how fast any single molecule is going or where it is headed. We can tell that the water in a glass fills the container relatively uniformly, but we are unable to say anything about where there might be slightly more or fewer atoms piling up. Indeed, most measurements we might make will still tell us coarse-grained quantities (the pressure of a gas, the refractive index of a lens). The notion of macroscopic coarse-graining was first developed to handle these kinds of measurements in statistical terms, so that it might be possible, for instance, to estimate the statistical fluctuations in observables like pressure by having the right model of the microscopic physics.
In truth, though, coarse-graining is just a fancy term for putting different labels on some members of a group. One kind of label might be a number. For example, one might take a microstate and compute the average speed of its molecules, and then label it as a member of the coarse-grained collection of states that have the same value of average speed. But it is equally possible, at least in a thought experiment, to label states for their holistic qualities. Imagine sifting through every possible microstate available to a mixture of atoms containing a certain amount of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and so on. For each such state, it could be asked, "Is this a normal, healthy frog?" Granted, such an assessment is a far more complex and debatable one than the already substantive task of measuring gas pressure. Many microstates considered in the labeling process would look nothing at all like a frog. Others might be crudely frog-shaped, but lifeless. Still others might be built just like a frog, but with their atoms moving too fast every which way, so that spontaneous combustion was imminent. Nonetheless, there is a vast number of microscopic arrangements for the same pile of matter that would be equivalent and indistinguishable as typical, healthy frogs to an external observer, and there is an even vaster number of borderline atypical—possibly sick or mildly dysfunctional—frog microstates that one could argue endlessly about including in or excluding from the group.



Assume that all the particles out of which a frog might be built are described in their position and speed by (many more than three) coordinates x1, x2, etc. In this whole space, where each point represents a particular arrangement of the matter in question, the locations that correspond to what we would call a frog (gray) must be exceedingly rare, or else a frog could easily survive a blender.


The point in talking so ponderously about the atomic makeup of frogs is to make clear that full knowledge of the physical state does not tell us, in and of itself, whether we have a frog on our hands. Instead, we start by making the decision to coin a new term ("frog") and thereby to begin sorting microstates into the "Frog" and "Not Frog" categories because we think it is useful and informative to do so. Once we have headed down this path, it becomes possible, if we like, to ask which physical properties differ between these groups, so that we implicitly start to gain a sense in physical terms of what contributes to a particular complex quality like frogginess. The same goes in general for being alive or not alive: whatever our atomic building blocks, there are numerous ways they can be put together that we would call alive, even more numerous ways that we would not, and a highly contestable group of other microstates lying on the ambiguous boundary between these two categories. Once we decide on a particular way of drawing the boundary, we can start to study the physics of how to cross from one side to the other.
THIS BRINGS US TO OUR SECOND CONCEPT, WHICH IS about how to determine the likelihood of each microstate. So far, we have said that a pile of atoms capable of being a frog is also capable of not being a frog, which leaves us with a burning question: Is it possible to use physics to calculate the probability of being, or becoming, a frog? When the frog tossed into a spinning blender stops being a frog, intuition tells us the transition away from frog-likeness is an absolute certainty. To understand why, however, it will help to start by thinking in terms of odds.
The idea of probability always refers to a choice being made among various well-defined possibilities. Flipping a coin, we say at the start that there are two things that could happen (called "heads" and "tails"). In reality, any number of other things could happen: the coin could land perfectly on edge, or melt before hitting the ground. For that matter, even if the coin lands face up or down, there are still many ways for that to happen: the coin could bounce, roll, or spin to its final repose, and it could wind up either in the hallway or under the kitchen table. In the face of this mess of details, we usually do coarse-graining, and lump a bunch of different outcomes together under the same heading. There are many distinct possible futures we would call "heads," many others that would be "tails," and the outcomes that fit into neither category happen so infrequently under normal circumstances that we do not worry about them.
It is at the point where we are trying to make an argument for why an observed outcome has a certain probability that entropy comes to the fore. Simply put, entropy just measures the number of microscopic ways a given coarse-grained outcome can be achieved. Perhaps the most frequently cited example of this definition for entropy comes from the question of why it is so unlikely for all the air in a room to collect into one corner. There are lots of ways of microscopically arranging the vast number of individual molecules in the gas, and only some of those ways spread the molecules out over the whole room; others instead cram the whole mess of particles into a much smaller volume. The reason we do not see the latter happen is not because the molecules cannot fit into the corner of the room; there's plenty of empty space to go around! Rather, the entropic argument is that there are just tremendously many more ways of spreading the molecules out uniformly across the whole room than there are of confining them to a smaller volume, and if we assume that all microscopic arrangements for the molecules are equally likely, then the most numerous type of arrangement wins. Put another way, we could say that an atmosphere that abhors vacuums has greater entropy than one that does not. But it is arguably clearer and more precise just to say that observing a spontaneous vacuum is very improbable because there are comparatively few ways at the microscopic level for such a coarse-grained outcome to happen.



There is basically just one way of packing some number of particles tightly into one corner of a room, but there are numerous ways of spreading those particles out in a roughly even way over the whole space. We therefore say that the coarse-grained collection of evenly spread states has higher entropy than the "collection" of one state where things are tightly packed.


It has to be noted, though, that the above argument only works if we assume that all microstates are equally likely. Sometimes, the circumstances justify such an assumption. For example, the air in a room is a dilute collection of molecules that bounce off of each other and off of the walls somewhat chaotically, and otherwise do not exert strong forces on each other. As a result, they rapidly progress to a point where it seems like each particle's location was chosen independently and randomly, without any preference for one location over another. At that point, the probability of any given coarse-grained quantity occurring (such as, for example, a particular number of molecules ending up in the left half of the room) is determined by nothing more than the number of different ways the outcome can happen, or, in other words, the number of different microstates that belong in that coarse-grained group. The blended frog scenario is supposed to operate by an identical principle. A blender is designed to bring about an approximately chaotic shuffling of millimeter-sized pieces of its contents, so that soon all the different shufflings become equally likely. Once this happens, we confront the simple fact that there are vastly many more ways of not being a frog than there are of being one.
WHAT OUR GRUESOME BLENDER EXAMPLES BRING INTO focus is that it only makes sense to start to talk about the probabilities of microstates once you define the physical conditions under which your hunk of matter is trying out different states. In various simple examples, one can get away with assuming that all the states are equally likely, but the more typical situation requires greater care. To see this, consider again the glass of water freezing into solid ice. A crystalline array of neatly arranged water molecules in their solid state has very low entropy compared with the vast number of different jumbled pilings of molecules that we would get by taking successive snapshots of the liquid state. Yet, when liquid water is allowed to get cold enough, it becomes overwhelmingly likely that the crystal will assemble, even though there are far fewer ways of being a crystal than there are of being a liquid.
What tilts the scales in favor of low-entropy order in this case is the forces acting between the molecules. H2O has positive and negative patches of electric charges on its surface, and opposites attract, so the ice crystal is always trying to snap together like two pieces of a magnetic office toy. As we discussed in Chapter 2, when the ambient conditions are too hot, the random kicks from thermal motion are constantly breaking apart molecules as they start to stick together and sending them flying in different directions. In contrast, colder conditions allow things to stay stuck, and the ice crystal is stabilized.
Now that we are talking in terms of probability, however, there is a different way of describing the same process by using concepts of temperature and energy. Every way of arranging a group of molecules can be thought of as a possible location for a ball that is rolling through a mountain range, where the internal forces acting between the molecules are always pushing the ball down the high-energy slopes and toward the low-energy valleys at the bottom.



Potential energy (here denoted as E for energy, but more often denoted as U) acts like a landscape in which a ball tends to roll downhill. Each possible location of the ball corresponds to a full, many-particle configuration of a hunk of matter. Random kicks from thermal fluctuations sometimes lift things uphill, ensuring that nothing stays trapped in one valley forever.


At a temperature of zero degrees kelvin (-459.67°F), it would only be possible to roll downhill and get stuck in the closest ravine, but once things get warmer, the random kicks from the environment serve to constantly lift the ball back uphill so that it is caught in an endless dance of rolling down and jolting back up again. If the molecules get to sit at constant temperature and, so to speak, let the ball explore the whole mountain range this way for a long time, things reach a condition we call thermal equilibrium, and we can assign a probability to the ball's location with an elegantly simple formula known as the Boltzmann distribution: at a temperature T, any microstate for the molecule—that is, any location in the mountain range—will be visited with probability proportional to 1/a(E/T), where a is a physical constant and E is the energy of that microstate. In other words, states with higher energy are always exponentially less likely to be visited than ones with lower energy, but the steepness of this exponential drop gets more gradual as the temperature increases and the uphill jolts get stronger.



The Boltzmann distribution establishes an idealized mathematical relationship between energy and probability (gray) in a state of thermal equilibrium that is expected to arise when matter sits at constant temperature for a long time. States of higher energy are exponentially less likely, and the sharpness of this exponential falloff gets sharper as the temperature shrinks.


The Boltzmann distribution is a powerful theoretical idea and it formed the basis for a century or more of successful theorizing in statistical thermodynamics. It can be used to make all sorts of accurate quantitative predictions about crystals, liquids, polymers, and gases, and besides that, it provides a beautifully intuitive way of expressing the tug-of-war between entropy and energy in a single concept. If one wants to know the Boltzmann probability of a given coarse-grained state, all one needs to compute is a quantity known as free energy (F), which is defined, in terms of energy (E) and entropy (S), as F = E - TS, where T, again, represents temperature. Lower free energy corresponds to higher probability and vice versa, which means that high probability can be achieved by having low energy, by having high entropy, or by having both. The exact trade-off between these factors is controlled by the temperature, from which we can immediately see that as the temperature drops closer to zero, an initially high-entropy, high-energy liquid might become unstable and start to prefer to assemble itself into a lower-energy, orderly crystal.



At high temperature, the numerousness of high-energy states wins out, and the high-entropy liquid is overwhelmingly more probable (gray denotes where the system tends to hang out).


Even more significantly, we can now understand in the same way how it might be feasible for a bunch of different disorderly pieces to assemble themselves spontaneously into a stable, low-entropy structure. So long as the pieces have one way of being put together that is much lower in energy than the diverse mess of other rearrangements, and the surroundings are not too hot, it is no trouble at all for them to coalesce without any help (much like freezing pond ice). Examples of this so-called equilibrium self-assembly abound on the cutting edge of bio-inspired materials science these days, whether in the amusing feats of DNA origami (which can be used to build custom nano-sized designs out of nucleic acids that stick to each other with high specificity) or in self-stacking photonic crystal arrays made of colloidal particles decorated with nucleotide linkers.6 What these two examples have in common is that they piggyback on life's use of nucleic acids to produce highly specific attractive forces between different pieces of molecular template, and use that specificity to encode a blueprint on a larger scale. We therefore see again how, as with self-replication, solving the problem of specificity in intermolecular interactions immediately makes certain other impressively lifelike behaviors much more achievable.



At low temperature, the lower energy of the solid state dominates the probability distribution, and crystallization becomes favorable.


WE HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT YOU WOULD BE very unlikely to get a frog out of the whirring blades of an infinitely sharp blender. We expect that the blender would make every possible rearrangement of that matter equally likely, so that entropy and probability became synonymous. However, a new question now arises: What about in the Boltzmann distribution? At thermal equilibrium, not all microstates are equally likely, and sometimes that means it is highly likely for molecules to coalesce into an orderly macrostate with very low entropy. Are we closer to being able to get a frog this way? In fact, we are—but not close enough! To understand why, we have to remember that thermal equilibrium is a condition that is only reached once your pile of matter has been allowed to sit at a constant temperature for a long time, so that its mountaineering ball can rove far and wide and explore many different possible parts of the energy landscape—in other words, so that the atoms or molecules can break apart and recombine many times into many different possible shapes. The corresponding frog scenario would be to take our hapless amphibian and put it in a closed container that only allowed heat to flow in or out, and then immerse the container in a bathtub at a constant temperature for a trillion times a trillion years or more. The question now is: What would we expect to find if we opened up the box again after all that time?
The commonsense answer is that, under the conditions described, a frog in a sealed container would quickly die after running out of food or oxygen. With the passage of significantly more time, the frog's material remains would presumably stop looking at all like a frog, as the tiny random kicks from heat carried by colliding molecules in its surroundings would knock everything to pieces. But why does this happen? Why should it not be the case that, under the right conditions, atoms might coalesce like pond ice, and self-assemble into the pattern of a live amphibian? As preposterous as this question may sound, it is not so far-fetched when we focus exclusively on one piece of how living things are built. The majority of dry weight in a living cell is made of protein, and, as we mentioned in Chapter 2, proteins are sequential chains of different kinds of amino acids with different chemical groups sticking off of a common backbone. The Nobel laureate Christian Anfinsen famously demonstrated that the specific sequence of amino acid side-chains on a protein is often sufficient at thermal equilibrium to determine the particular three-dimensional structure for the chain that allows it to carry out its function within the cell.7
For some proteins, this means positioning particular chemical groups in space in such a way that they can act as a catalyst for a particular chemical reaction. For others, it means folding into a shape that can serve as a structural element in a multiprotein filament that gives the cell its overall mechanical resilience to external stresses. In any case, though many proteins do require more active help when finding the right shape, a broad range of them can fairly be thought of as very complicated cousins of freezing pond ice: they will restore themselves into an exquisitely engineered configuration just by letting thermal kicks help them roll downhill to a low free energy.8



Amino acids of different chemical compositions are strung together in a chain to form a protein molecule, and this chain is called the primary sequence. Many amino acid sequences, with all their different specifically sticky and repelling surfaces, can guide the chains they are in to adopt a special, low-entropy configuration with the exceptional architecture necessary to enable the molecule to carry out its biochemical function(s) in the cell. This configuration is called the protein molecule's native tertiary structure.


There are, however, at least two significant ways in which living things are built at the molecular level that cannot be achieved entirely at thermal equilibrium. As we have said, living things do have in common with ice that they are relatively low-entropy macrostates, meaning that they correspond to a tiny number of exquisitely exceptional microstates in the space of possible configurations. But unlike ice crystals, living organisms do not sit at a low altitude in their energy landscape. On the contrary, all life can be thought of as inhabiting a high, narrow mountain pass, which, though surrounded by some steep slopes in its immediate neighborhood, nonetheless sits at quite a lofty elevation in terms of energy. Viewing things through the lens of free energy (F = E - TS), a macrostate of high energy (E) and low entropy (S) will have very high free energy, and will therefore be very unlikely to be observed when the system in question has been allowed to relax to thermal equilibrium, where the odds are dictated by Boltzmann. Since we are talking about probability here, there is always an inconceivably tiny chance that we could open up the box and still see a live frog—but only if the freak influence of numerous thermal fluctuations conspired to spontaneously assemble a new one right before we opened the box.
To appreciate what gives life such high free energy, we can further consider the example of proteins mentioned above. Proteins may be able to fold up into complicated shapes on their own, but each one of them is slowly falling apart because the free energy of their chemical bonds is too high. Proteins are born when chains of amino acids are strung together by linkages known as peptide bonds, and to the untrained eye, these "polypeptide chains," as they are sometimes called, seem pretty stable. If you take a protein, such as the myosin found in muscles, and put it in a glass of water on a tabletop, it will sit around and hang together for a long time without losing its chemical integrity. Indeed, the reason we have acid and enzymes in our stomachs is to accelerate the breakdown of molecules like myosin (for example, in meat) that otherwise remain mostly intact at body temperature. However, when we go out and make physicochemical measurements, it turns out that the peptide bond is not thermodynamically stable in the cellular environment; it is expected to decay over time into the more basic amine and carboxylate pieces from which it is built. The trick is that the metaphorical energy ball for these atoms has to go uphill a bit, out of a little alpine valley, before it can roll downhill and allow the bond to break apart, and consequently, it takes hundreds of years before a given bond, if left otherwise unmolested, will fall apart from random thermal kicks. This partial durability is sometimes referred to as metastability, or kinetic trapping. The key point, though, is that anything that is slow to roll downhill in free energy in this way is guaranteed to be even slower (in other words, less likely) to randomly roll back in the other direction. Thus, if we start without an assembled protein chain, we can forget about getting one for free by waiting for the system to get closer to thermal equilibrium. Much like a diamond at everyday temperatures and pressures (and unlike ice in a freezer), a protein's polypeptide backbone is only stable in a kinetic sense, and really should be thought of as slowly crumbling from the randomizing ravages of heat in its environment.
In truth, there is an even more impressive and significant way in which proteins found in cells are unlikely to appear in a thermal equilibrium, and this is that the specific linear patterns of amino acids found in real proteins are extraordinarily rare and special. With twenty different kinds of amino acids available, and a typical protein length of 200 amino acids, there should be roughly 20200 possible protein sequences to construct. On the one hand, such an enormous number of possibilities is essential for proteins to be able to work their wonders, because with that kind of diversity of different combinations being possible in principle, the number of distinct engineering successes that can be achieved within that space seems nearly limitless. Through the "novelty of combination," the same 20 amino acids can be used to construct macromolecules with totally different material, chemical, and dynamical properties, so that even a single cell must be thought of as a complex society of distinct interlocking and competing actors.9
However, much the same way that a randomly glued-together model airplane will likely not be able to fly, protein sequences randomly chosen from this vast array of possibilities are not typically capable of the feats that real proteins carry out every day to make life work at the molecular level. Not only do random sequences not always fold in ways that are reliable and stable, but they also generally have much weaker catalytic activity.10 For that matter, they essentially are never observed to be capable of the complex activities of proteins like myosin, which uses a molecular fuel called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to propel a directional walk from one end of an actin filament to the other, in striking similarity to a motor generating a power stroke. The sequence of myosin is exceptional in multiple ways, and even relatively minor changes to its amino acid makeup can easily prevent it from folding into the particular complex shape that is able to use the catalyzed chemical breakdown of ATP to produce the specific mechanical motions that enable processive grabbing onto and letting go of the filament.
Even if one somehow could solve the problem of polypeptide chains slowly falling apart, the Boltzmann distribution only cares about lowering energy. It is never going to be capable of expressing a strong preference for an extremely rare subset of ways of stringing together amino acids into chains that happen to have the ability to self-assemble into shapes with highly refined catalytic and structural properties.11 More generally, the simple fact is that virtually every piece of a living thing should be thought of as a very low-entropy arrangement of its constituent parts, because the overwhelming majority of alternative arrangements just would not "work" nearly as well. As with technologies invented by people, tools with specialized functions usually need to be put together in one particular way in order to be effective. The implication here is that most alternatives (even with the same amount of energy) will be mediocre at everything.
What has become clear is that, in order to start to understand how lifelike behaviors might emerge from a naïve mixture of inanimate building blocks, we are going to have to figure out what kinds of physical conditions will tilt the scales and change the way probability is computed. The heat bath of a constant temperature that brings you to thermal equilibrium is too discriminating in some ways (in that it hates high-energy microstates) and not discriminating enough in others (since it cannot tell the difference between two microstates of the same energy). Perhaps not surprisingly, the antidote to this situation will be to add another ingredient to the mix. Up until this point, the only way of getting energy into or out of a system that we have discussed is for heat to wander in or out at random, so that our mountaineering ball accordingly would roll downhill and get unpredictably jolted back up again. For behavior of the kind we wish to understand, it will be necessary to introduce something else to push on the system as well, so that things move around according to a different pattern. As we shall see, new and intriguing possibilities can open up once energy starts to flow.
SNOW BRINGS A WHOLE TROVE OF SEPARATE CONCEPTS TO mind. On the scale of a mountainside laden with unstable drifts, snow is a large group of interacting particles. It serves as an emblem of feedback-driven collective behavior in which small perturbations can carry the whole group somewhere (in this case, into an avalanche). The many varieties of snow also remind us how the emergent properties of the group can depend sensitively and unpredictably on the fine details of how individual members are assembled. And the swirling of countless tiny flakes in the turbulent wind sometimes reveals to the eye how some types of order and coordination are only apparent once you examine enough separate parts of the whole simultaneously and see how they correlate with each other.
More basically, though, snow is made of frozen water, and therefore also stands for the qualitative newness of properties that can arise from subjecting the same collection of matter to different environmental conditions. The single snowflake can exhibit a symmetrical pattern, visible to the naked eye, that extends across the whole object. However, the boundary of this object is highly branched and fractal, which makes it strikingly difficult to trace and fully define. Taken all together, these ingredients offer a commentary on the difference between what is alive and what is not: we have the overpowering sense that life is qualitatively different from its raw building materials, and that this difference somehow stems from a coordinated order that encompasses the whole organism; nonetheless, the boundary delineating that difference is highly ambiguous.
The significance of this ambiguity is driven home in the biblical text when one considers that it is the boundary of Moses himself that becomes "snowy." The Book of Leviticus establishes that the "affliction" described at the burning bush is one of the skin, and elsewhere, in Numbers 12:12, it is likened to being half-dead, akin to the deathly whiteness of a stillborn child. Moses' skin-snowiness is brought about when he touches his hand to the trunk of his own body. Much like the hand that grasped the tail of the serpent and rendered it an inanimate rod, so here does the hand objectify and deconstruct the living thing into implements and materials, causing an anomalous lifelessness to bloom like frost in the very boundary that separates the organism from its inanimate surroundings. We are therefore reminded that disassembling and objectifying the various parts of the living whole has an erosive effect on our confidence that life is so qualitatively different from non-life; in the eyes of the one doing the bit-by-bit dissection, everything starts to look like one or another pile of particles, whether it's alive or not.
Fascinatingly, snowflakes and frost are themselves examples of how matter can be assembled in ways that, though not alive, still somehow tempt our intuition with the sense of being more lifelike than mere pebbles or ice cubes. Perhaps this feeling persists in part because the individual snowflake's particular form can vary from one flake to the next under the same environmental conditions, and is contingent on the particular steps this way or that made by clusters of H2O molecules as they deposited themselves on the growing structure. To the extent that snow can have this qualitative diversity, it starts to seem to have something in common with dust as well. Dust is the ultimate reminder that we are made of stuff that is not alive. As long as a plant or animal lives, it remains a structurally integral whole for the most part, though dead skin, hair, leaves, and petals all still offer us the chance to watch parts of that whole fall to pieces. When a living thing dies, this process intensifies, and any everyday observer can discern that life has material bulk that is built from separate tiny parts, each of which just seems like a dry, lifeless powder grain. At the same time, it is also apparent that not all dust is the same. In contrast with snow, which forgets what kind of shape its flakes had the moment it melts, the dust of the Earth is a medley of different substances with distinct qualities. Flakes of dead skin that accumulate in unswept homes are hardly the same thing as reddish dirt blown up in a desert storm, and the pulverized bones on the floor of an ancient crypt will not feel the same underfoot as the sands of the seashore. Though vastly bigger than single atoms or molecules, particles of dust still evoke the idea that we are assembled out of collections of separate pieces that are both diverse and numerous, with the potential to be taken apart and reassembled in ways more diverse and numerous still.

RIVER AND BLOOD



Take from the water of the Nile and pour it on the dry ground, and the water which you take from the river shall become blood on the ground.
—EXODUS 4:9
ALL LIFE MOVES. THOUGH ANIMALS MAKE THIS POINT MOST directly with all their diverse antics, an opening flower or a spreading lawn of bacteria on a petri dish are equally good examples of how living things change their shape and location over the course of time in order to grow, develop, and behave. At the same time, it is clear that lots of things that move are not alive, which means that if we are to think of motion as lifelike, we will have to get more specific about the kind of motion that makes life tick.
The first clue comes from noting that there are some kinds of commonplace motions seen in the world at large that living things do not exhibit. A pebble dislodged by a hiker can roll down a hill, but it can also roll back up again if someone gives it a good enough kick in the other direction. A yo-yo can turn clockwise or counterclockwise on its axis, depending on which way someone spins it. Indeed, all of the most basic mechanical motions—going up or down, turning this way or that—seem to be equally able to run in both directions. Yet, when we now look to the process of a tree growing from a seed, or of an embryo developing into a newborn baby, the symmetry we noticed in a world of billiard balls bouncing there and back again is suddenly nowhere to be found. Towering trees do not ungrow into tiny seeds, and people generally do not get any younger with time. At least part of what life seems to be doing, dynamically, is a thoroughly one-way street, and the key question is whether this is a mere case of happenstance, or it somehow reveals something central to us about what life is accomplishing at a physical level.
Our search for an answer in this case has to begin with energy. From the perspective of physics, all motion requires energy. In mathematical terms, energy is simply a concept introduced to do good bookkeeping on exactly how much motion different bits of matter can impart to and absorb from each other. Still, while energy of some sort is found everywhere, it is not always deployed in the same way. A freshly cut log of wood and a kettle of boiling water might both have the same amount of energy, but only one of them is hot to the touch. A steaming kettle and an internal combustion engine might both be scorching, but only one of them can make a truck's wheels turn. In both of these cases, the significant difference turns out to be what the energy in the system is doing and where it is going. By the same token, keeping track of energy will help us explain why life is so bad at running backward, and start to reveal a special role for energy in the physics of living things.
SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES, BATTERIES, AND POWER GRIDS all have helped us become accustomed to the idea of energy as a sort of marvelous substance that can be stored in a container and moved from place to place. But it is worth reminding ourselves of where we got the idea for energy in the first place. As we discussed briefly in Chapter 2, from the perspective of Newtonian mechanics, energy is not something that you directly measure or manipulate in experiments; instead, you calculate it from other, more basic quantities, such as position, mass, and time, that you do measure. The beginning idea for Newton is that of force: pieces of matter exert forces on each other that can give rise to motion. Energy comes into the picture because the basic forces that typically act among the different pieces of any assemblage of matter have the special mathematical property of being conservative. A conservative force simply has the property that if it is used to halt motion, then it must be able to set the same amount of motion going again. If a cannonball gets shot up vertically into the air, then it starts off moving at high speed, but at the very highest point of its flight its speed reaches zero (since it has just stopped moving upward against gravity and is not yet moving downward). What makes gravity a conservative force is that (neglecting the effect of air resistance, which we will discuss in a moment) this upward flight puts the ball in a place from which it can fall back down and fully regain its high speed. In the language of physics, we say that the ball starts with lots of kinetic energy (which is basically just a measure of how fast it is moving), but it trades all of that in for potential energy as it climbs higher and higher against gravity. At the top of the flight, the kinetic energy has gone to zero, but the total energy has stayed the same.
It is helpful to think about physics in terms of energy conservation because it gives us a strong constraint on how things can move that allows us to make predictions. For example, if our cannonball experiences some air resistance, we may notice that it is moving more slowly when it falls back to Earth than it was when we first fired it upward. Since we think that every individual collision between the cannonball and the surrounding air molecules involved the action of conservative forces, we can immediately infer that some of the cannonball's initial kinetic energy must have been lost to the air during the course of the flight. When energy gets shared somewhat randomly like this into the kinetic energies of many different microscopic motions, we call it heat.



The time-reversal symmetry of Newtonian physics requires that if it is possible for motion to happen one way (such as a ball flying upward and from the left, so as to fall down and land on the right), then it must also be possible, for a suitable alternative choice of initial conditions, to get the "rewind" version of events to happen (such as a ball flying upward and from the right, so as to fall down and land on the left).


Someone who is watching closely may already notice an additional way in which heat plays an important role in this story. For indeed, if our cannonball is fired upward from the surface of the moon, where there is no atmosphere, we would not expect any loss of energy during the flight from drag. In this case, there is something beautifully symmetrical about the whole trajectory: the projectile can fly upward at high speed and then slow to a stop, or it can start from rest and fall until it achieves the same high speed in the opposite direction when it reaches the moon's surface. These two motions pair neatly with each other because they are identical once we reverse the time-order of events and flip the direction of motion upside down. In other words, one movie is the backward rewind of the other. A straightforward study of the mathematical structure of Newton's laws demonstrates that this symmetry is not accidental, but rather, a fundamental requirement. Whatever can happen according to the equations of motion implied by F = ma (again, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration), there is a rewind version that is no less possible.
Back on Earth, though, things are troublingly different. Somehow, through the introduction of heat loss due to air friction, we have seemingly broken this so-called time-reversal symmetry in the motion we observe, because when our initial speed upward lets us climb to a certain height, we do not fully recover the same speed in the opposite direction when we fall back down from that same height. Of course, the resolution of this puzzle is suggested to us by what we have already pointed out: if the air is stealing energy from the cannonball, then we have to treat the air molecules as part of the system we are keeping track of. In this case, it should be possible, in principle, to observe the rewind of our cannonball's flight upward: we just need the air to stop resisting and start donating energy to the cannonball, so that it picks up some extra speed on the way down the way that it lost speed to drag on the way up. If the molecules could all be compelled to move in just the right way, there would be no problem at all from Newton's perspective: energy would be conserved, and everything would be obeying F = ma the whole time.
The ludicrousness of this proposal calls our attention to something striking about how air resistance works, namely, that it always resists! When you are flying upward, friction pushes downward, and on your way back down, friction pushes up. This state of affairs stands in stark contrast to gravity, which pushes down regardless of which way you are going. Something in the nature of the frictional drag force holds the secret to understanding why our time-reversal symmetry is broken, and to see what that secret is, we just have to ask ourselves why we think it's so implausible that the air molecules could all suddenly conspire to help a ball speed up as it is falling, even though they regularly combine to achieve the opposite effect and slow things down.
The key to unraveling this puzzle can be found in our underlying description of the physical rules involved. If Newtonian equations of motion permit air resistance, in principle, to work backward, then all we should need, in order to see it happen, is the ability to choose the right initial conditions regarding where each molecule is, where it is going, and at what speed. And yet, if this sort of phenomenon is never, ever observed to occur, we have to infer that there is something somehow extremely difficult about arranging those initial conditions, and that they are extremely unlikely to occur by accident. And the fact that we feel forced to resort to the idea of likelihood tells us we are on the right track, because the very idea of the heat that frictional drag loses to the air relies on a notion of randomness in its definition. This means that even though we started off talking about seemingly very predictable deterministic things like cannonballs and drag forces, our inquiry into the origin of time-reversal symmetry-breaking has led us back to the idea of probability, with the added twist that now we are going to have to compare the likelihoods of different paths.
THE CARTOON VERSION OF WHY AIR RESISTANCE NEVER runs backward is that many separate air molecules moving in random, uncorrelated ways are much better at spreading energy around than they are at concentrating it in one place. Think about a group of people standing in a huddle at the center of a football stadium, each with his or her own coin. Every minute, all the coins get tossed twice, and everyone who gets heads-heads steps north, whereas heads-tails people step east, and so on. After twenty minutes or so, it becomes obvious that the huddle is spreading out and filling up more of the stadium: each individual is performing a random walk, and after enough time, these random walks usually lead all of the participants to wander away from their starting points. Eventually, we expect the people to be spread roughly uniformly over the whole stadium, essentially because the random walking ultimately makes every configuration of people across space equally likely, and there are many more spread-out configurations than there are huddled ones.
It is easy enough to see how this process works with people, and not much harder to think about how it can happen with energy. As we have said, energy can be thought of as a conserved quantity that gets transferred from one object to another as they interact. Thus, if a bunch of energy gets delivered as heat into one particular location in a gas of many molecules, each molecular collision is an opportunity for a small parcel of that energy to hop from one location to an adjacent one. In a fluid of many particles moving more or less randomly, heat diffuses in just the way that particles and coin-flipping people can; it will tend to spread out and become more uniformly distributed over time. If a bunch of rare, random events happened in the right way all at once, you could see heat collect back together again; still, the more dramatic the proposed effect, the less likely such a freak event is to occur.
Already, this picture helps us to understand why air resistance always resists. When a cannonball collides with air molecules and imparts some of its energy to them, they fly off in random directions and heat diffuses away. To see the reverse happen, one would need the random motions of many molecules to cooperate so that they all, by chance, push in the same direction at the same time on the cannonball; in other words, you would need a volume of warm air to spontaneously get colder than its surroundings and start gusting concertedly in a particular direction. This outcome, in crude terms, is the equivalent of flipping trillions of trillions of heads in a row on a fair coin: you might wait the age of the universe and more and never see it happen once.
It turns out it is possible to be precise and rigorous about exactly how much heat is needed in order to create a certain amount of asymmetry between forward and rewind movies of a physical process. In one sense, this result goes back to the Boltzmann distribution from Chapter 3, because it relies on a related quantitative relationship between the temperature of a system and the number of ways that energy can be spread around in it. On the other hand, whereas the Boltzmann distribution gives relative probabilities of states at thermal equilibrium, we now can talk about the relative probabilities of movies—that is, of time-ordered sequences of states called dynamical trajectories. Close to two decades ago, Gavin Crooks of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab proved a relation that governs these relative probabilities in a quantitative way and shows how they are connected to the flow of heat. For every temperature T, there is a number greater than 1 called b(T) that always increases as T decreases. Crooks demonstrated that if we take the probability of a forward movie and divide by the probability of the corresponding rewind movie under the same conditions, we get

p(forward) / p(rewind) = b(T)Q,

where Q is the amount of heat released into the surroundings during the forward movie.1 This equation states that at any given temperature, movies that depict processes releasing positive amounts of heat are exponentially more likely than their time-reversed rewinds (which would instead absorb the same positive amount of heat). Moreover, the steepness of this exponential climb grows greater and greater as the temperature of the surroundings gets colder and colder. In other words, all breaking of equivalence between forward and reverse must be paid for with heat, and the more heat you pay going forward, the more strongly you can favor that movie over its rewind.
In essence, the Crooks equation is just quantifying something we already expressed intuitively above, namely, that once heat randomly diffuses away from you, it is unlikely that this same spreading cloud of energy will suddenly retrace its steps and gather back together by accident. This basic understanding certainly helps with making sense of flying cannonballs and the like. When a rock rolls downhill and stops, it has converted gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy of motion, and then turned that energy into heat that is lost irreversibly to the surroundings. Hence the rock can stop and stay put. What is unsatisfying about this example, though, is that it is a one-off: the rock rolls and stops and the story seems to be over. In addition, we did not really need an elaborate statement about movies and rewinds in order to explain that matter tends to try to lower its energy over time; the Boltzmann distribution already told us that.
The more striking implications of the Crooks equation come to the fore when we consider systems that are not settled at low energy. Whether in biology, or in the natural world more broadly, there are endless examples to be found of systems that break time-reversal symmetry rather violently, and yet are the polar opposite of a rock that gets stuck in the bottom of a ravine. Every time a human heart beats, it pushes fluid in such a way that oxygen-rich blood in the arteries flows one way, and oxygen-poor blood in the veins flows another, but the total energy of the blood does not rise or fall. Similarly, if we follow some ocean water through a round of evaporation, rainfall, and spilling back downhill to the sea, we see that its energy at the end of the circuit is the same as it was at the beginning; nonetheless, the direction of motion is unmistakable, and the rewind movie (with rainwater on the ground flying up into the clouds) looks comically impossible. Even more impressively, when a tree grows from a seed, it climbs only higher in energy over time, implacably developing in one direction and refusing to run back the way it came and hide underground. Sand dunes are more primitive than plants, but similarly remarkable in this respect: when the wind starts to blow, they pile up high and store vast quantities of gravitational potential energy.
Every one of these examples involves a process of motion or transformation that looks very directional in time. This means, according to Crooks, that each case has to involve the generation of heat (or at least, if we are being precise, one of several equivalent processes, such as the transfer of heat from hot to cold). However, we may well ask a question: If we are dealing with systems that are not decreasing in energy, and yet the total energy we have to work with is conserved, then how can these systems all be shedding heat into their surroundings? The answer, of course, is that there needs to be another source, supplied externally, that is injecting energy into the system, so it can be converted into heat by the ensuing motion. For dunes, it is the force of the wind, and for blood it is the squeezing of the heart as it pumps; at the same time that energy flows out as heat, it comes in through some sort of pushing by the environment, with the result that the system acts like a conduit for the flow and transformation of energy from one location and form to another. Once matter gets driven in this way by a sustained flow of energy, new kinds of lifelike behaviors that were previously forbidden suddenly become possible.
WHETHER AT THE MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, OR ORGANISMAL level, many aspects of life involve cycles. When yeast cells need to convert sugar into the metabolic products required for survival, a series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle converts certain molecules from form A to form B to form C... and back again to A, like an elaborate chemical waterwheel that generates a refined chemical fuel for the cell as a by-product. When a bacterium needs to swim through the viscous fluid that surrounds it, it uses molecular motors whose cyclical changes in shape power the rotation of a filamentous tail called a flagellum that propels the microbe along. And, perhaps most strikingly, the mammalian circulatory system drives blood into the intestines and lungs and back out again so that the whole body can benefit from the air and food to be found there.
All of these cycles can be thought of as cases of what is called a nonequilibrium steady state, where the particles of matter in question, though not at thermal equilibrium, nonetheless have a stable and predictable probability of being in any given microstate at a given time. The tricky thing about these steady states is that the character of their motion is so consistent that at first they might seem like nothing is changing. The goal of the heart, after all, is to maintain a relatively constant speed and direction of blood flow. Nonetheless, a rewind movie of blood circulation looks all wrong for life, because it does a bad job of getting its chemical cargo to where it is most needed. In general, nonequilibrium steady states do not look the same under time-reversal, and in this sense, they starkly contrast with matter that is at thermal equilibrium. A gas or a crystal that has just been sitting at one temperature for a long time may be moving this way and that at a molecular level, but the rewind movie of that motion would be qualitatively indistinguishable from its forward counterpart. Only once energy and matter are flowing directionally through a system, so that they leave in a different form from how they entered, are the system's dynamical behaviors permitted by basic physical laws to exhibit asymmetry in time.
Starting from the Crooks relation, we know that when energy leaves an ongoing time-asymmetric process, it has to do so partly as heat. But how did the energy get in? Perhaps the simplest way to get a handle on this problem is to imagine a child dragging a wooden toy duck on a string around in a circle on the ground. The duck is in constant motion, but only so long as the child keeps tugging on the string. In the language of Newtonian mechanics, the force of the string tension pulling on the duck as it moves is doing what is called work; indeed, the term "work" is used any time a force acts on something by pushing along (or against) the direction of its motion. Work is a relatively orderly way of delivering energy into a system, because it acts on particular pieces of the system and gets them to move in specific directions. As soon as the child loses interest in this duck-dragging game, the string drops slack and the erstwhile moving duck halts in place. The kinetic energy it had while it was moving is dissipated as heat, and the motion ceases.
The point, though, is that the duck was also dissipating heat while it was moving. In a steady state, the circular motion is constantly absorbing work energy (supplied by the child via the rope) and converting it into frictional heat lost to the surroundings. All nonequilibrium steady states involve this same kind of process, in which external forcing drives cyclical motions round and round. What makes many such steady states far more complex than the toy duck is that the number of overlapping and interlocking cycles is vast, and the choice of which cycle to traverse at any given moment can be more probabilistic. Viewing things in this way, what becomes clear is that the argument also runs in the other direction: whenever we have a steady state that is constantly absorbing energy and converting it into heat, there is something in its motion (albeit frequently something quite subtle and microscopic) that is running forward in time more than backward. This realization goes most of the way to helping us understand why it is that so much of what life does seems to be hard to run in reverse; after all, life is always consuming chemical work energy from its environment (in the form of food and sunlight), and continually shedding heat into its surroundings as well. We are so used to this fact, however, that we might easily forget the obvious remaining question: Why does life have to consume energy in the first place?
THE SIMPLEST REASON THAT LIFE NEEDS ENERGY IS THAT it grows. Trees get taller, kids get bigger, and even single cells have to fatten up before they divide and give birth to two new, smaller cells. In all of these cases, more matter is always being thrown on the pile, and it gets put together in a way that stores up energy that the living organism harvests from its surroundings. Trees, for example, absorb energy in the form of sunlight and use it to stack carbon atoms higher and higher in the air, thereby amassing gravitational potential energy that can turn back into motion when the tree falls down. More subtly, wood is made of molecules with high chemical potential energy, and this is what gets released as heat and light when a log is thrown on the fire.
Since energy is conserved, it of course needs to be supplied from somewhere whenever it gets stockpiled in this way, and so demands of growth alone would make every living thing a hungry energy absorber. There are, however, several other ways that lifelikeness requires constant fueling even when energy storage related to growth ceases. For example, although in practice the process of reproduction, by which a bacterium or a mouse gives rise to offspring that resemble it, always involves growth, in principle such self-replication events could just be an energy-neutral way of spreading a pattern of organization from one pile of material to another. Imagine, for example, that a robot walking through a giant random pile of robot parts picked up a bunch of them and locked each element correctly into its socket so that a new robot was formed. One could conceive of a scenario where the fully assembled robot was not at higher or lower energy than the pile of parts from which it was made (indeed, the more careful among us might conceive of a way of doing this while keeping free energy fixed instead, so that a drop in energy counterbalanced the drop in entropy associated with assembly). Still, in a scenario where such self-replicating automata were capable of sweeping through the world and turning one robot first into two, then into four, and so on exponentially, the Crooks relation has something to say about the fueling cost that has to be paid.
Exponential growth is inherently directional in time: to whatever extent a robot or any other self-replicator is more likely to turn from one robot into two than to turn from two into one, there is a forward movie of events that is more probable than its rewind. Practically, this means that once we compare the population growth rate of a self-replicator to the (usually much slower) rate at which it spontaneously disassembles and falls apart, we know a minimum positive amount of heat that has to be released into the surroundings during the copying process.2 If the pattern being duplicated is itself energy neutral, then the only way to produce energy in the form of heat is to first absorb energy from the surroundings, and thus, any self-copying pattern reshaping the world in its image requires a fuel supply to power its spread. Interestingly, this way of thinking has implications for how we speculate about primordial competitions that might have gone on between different sorts of self-copying molecules. DNA and RNA are two different types of nucleic acids found in living cells, and each is notable for its ability to array a sequence of different chemical groups in a linear chain that can act as molecular instructions to other machinery in the cell. RNA in particular has attracted interest as a possible building material for early self-copying molecules, because it is more flexible than DNA and can therefore fold into shapes that grant it enzyme-like properties. Thinking about the fueling costs of self-replication exposes another possible advantage for RNA that could easily go unnoticed. Because of a small difference in chemical structure, RNA is less stable in water than DNA, and falls apart tens of thousands of times faster from the ravages of hydrolysis (which literally means "splitting by water"). This means that in order for a DNA molecule to copy itself at the same rate as an RNA molecule at room temperature, it would need to burn substantially more chemical fuel, in order to generate the greater amount of heat required by its greater durability. Thus, although being less durable at first sounds like a disadvantage, RNA's flimsiness may have made it more competitive when the name of the game was growing as fast as possible so as to take over the future.
In truth, self-replication is just a broader class of behaviors that all face the same kind of energetic constraints because they all amount to going somewhere fast and then staying there a long time. The simplest version of such an irreversible transformation happens when liquid water is allowed to cool in freezing-cold air. In a short amount of time, ice forms, and once it does so, it stays that way so long as the ambient temperature remains constant. The way of paying the piper in this case is that water releases heat as it is turning into ice, because the ice crystal is at lower potential energy than the liquid. However, there are many other situations in which the physical state of a material can be rapidly and dramatically transformed such that the final product is not at lower energy than it was before, but is also very stable and slow to change further. Whether we are talking about a ceramic being hardened with microwave radiation, a room full of furniture that gets moved around, or the reformatting of a magnetic tape hard drive, changing things quickly so that they will stay put afterward always relies on external work energy that can then be converted into heat.3 And somewhat surprisingly, there is actually a very simple intuition for why this is true.
In physical terms, collections of particulate matter can be described by the numbers that tell us about the locations of the constituent particles in the system. If we want to, we can therefore think of every arrangement of the particles as a location on a map specified by a set of numbers. This works just the same way that longitude and latitude can pick out particular places on the globe, the only difference being that whereas locating a spot on the globe requires two such coordinate numbers, the shape of a billion particles needs three billion numbers. Potential energy adds a topographical element to the map, acting like a height above sea level for each possible place. We can imagine exploring this landscape by rolling a ball across it, where the current location of the ball always corresponds to the current shape of the matter described by the coordinate numbers of that location.



If thermal fluctuations are weak, climbing a high-energy hill to the summit can be a very slow process. An "escalator" that uses external work input to power the ball's rise can speed up the traversal of the peak, and that energy can be dissipated as frictional heat when things roll down the other side. This loss of energy makes things slow to go back the way they came.


But how does the ball get from one place to another? We start by considering the simple situation of a ball in an energy landscape that has no external force helping it along its way. This circumstance is analogous to one where particles are bumping into each other and sticking or unsticking with the randomizing help of kicks from a surrounding thermal bath. In this situation, it is perfectly possible (though unlikely) for a ball to get kicked out of its valley and uphill enough to crest a summit and roll down the other side to a new valley. However, in the event that such a valley has the same altitude (meaning energy) as the valley where it started, it must be equally probable that the ball could roll uphill again and head back the way it came. In terms of the Crooks relation, if the thermal bath is the only thing helping the ball move around, then it donates energy as heat into the ball as it rolls uphill, but then reabsorbs the same amount as heat when the ball rolls downhill again. The net result (which is confirmed by the overall zero change in altitude) is that the total heat released or absorbed as the ball moves from one valley to another is zilch. Accordingly, Crooks tells us that both directions for the movie should be equally likely.



Once the escalated ball rolls downhill again, thermal fluctuations may "try" to get the ball back down to lower energy over time, but the escalator will keep pumping it back up, expending energy constantly to keep this high-energy valley stable.


We break this symmetry once getting uphill in one direction happens with the help of some kind of escalator: external work from forces or energy sources that push on the system from the outside can play the role of a conveyor belt of sorts. This conveyor belt takes the ball (that is, a collection of particles) and lifts it up out of a deep ravine so that it stands high on the ridge. If our roving ball slides or rolls down the other side, where there is no escalator, then there is no comparably fast way for it to go back the way it came.
The energy that the powered lift supplied for the ball to go up one side of the ridge will be dissipated and lost when it skids down the other side, and the way back will be effectively closed, because there will be no available source of energy to help push the ball uphill in that return direction. Thus, by combining external work with the dissipation of heat, we will have turned what was initially a barrier in both directions into a door that can be traversed rapidly only in one direction.
Living things constantly undergo rearrangements on every scale that expend energy in precisely this fashion. At the molecular level, many protein chains get squeezed and squinched by chemically fueled nanomachines called chaperones; with this energy-dissipating help, they can rearrange rapidly and irreversibly, acquiring new, stable functional shapes they could never have found on their own. At the other extreme, the very act of raising a hand to point in a particular direction involves a body first moving swiftly into a particular configuration, and then holding steady. We do this so effortlessly that we rarely contemplate that the energy of this motion has to be dissipated as heat before we can stop vibrating and jiggling from one contortion to another. And at intermediate scales, cells communicate with each other all the time in ways that require a power supply—for example, neurons in the brain generate prodigious amounts of heat while using specialized physicochemical reactions to electroshock each other with pulses called action potentials. The ability of the brain to quickly absorb new information and hold on to it for a long time depends on physical dynamics that break the reversal symmetry of time.
It is worth dwelling for a moment on the topic of memory and computing because the thermodynamics of information processing is increasingly becoming a scientific field in its own right well beyond the bounds of biological concerns. The study of the relationship between thermodynamics and information can trace its beginnings to the work of the IBM physicist Rolf Landauer, who considered the simple question of how much fuel has to be burned in a computer in order to erase a bit of information.4 Data of the sort Landauer considered were stored in a binary code of 1's and 0's, and in order to physically embody the storage of such a code, it is necessary to have a piece of matter that experiences the world as though it were a ball trapped in a deep valley, with a shallower ridge running down the middle that divides the valley in two. In practice, we might be talking about magnetization at a particular location on a piece of magnetizable tape, but in the abstract description, the point is that if the ball is in one little valley, then, without help from an escalator, it is likely to stay trapped there for a very long time. This means that if you write down a bit for a 1 or a 0, it stays that way, at least long enough to be read back out by a detector of the local magnetic field many times in the future.
However, sometimes we want to perform an operation that reformats the drive, and sets all the bits back to 0, regardless of their initial state. Of course, if you already have a 0, this costs nothing. But if you want to turn a 1 irreversibly into a 0, there is no way around the escalator problem: you have to expend energy to drag things uphill, and then you have to dissipate that energy as heat so that you can get nicely stuck in the 0 valley on the other side. The erasure of information in the system therefore requires the machinery of the computer to do work: it must rewrite the binary code and throw the energy of the work away as heat outside the system. Bit erasure, moreover, is just one of many kinds of computing operations that have this property. There is now a significant and growing field of research into all the implications for thermodynamic constraints on the implementation of information processing, both in the computing context and beyond.5 The inescapable conclusion is that engaging in the kinds of sensing and information processing that we so much associate with lifelike robots, or with the clever behaviors of living things, will always require the dissipative flow of energy through the system, since that is what permits us to sharpen time's arrow in the right direction.
THERE IS ONE KIND OF CYCLICAL BEHAVIOR IN PARTICULAR that is the least noticeable but perhaps the most fundamental with respect to the energy requirements of lifelikeness, and that is what we might term healing, or self-repair. We are most familiar with healing from our own direct experience: ever since childhood, we have gotten cuts and scrapes on our bodies that just seem to know how to fix themselves. Although our skin has the superficial appearance of an inanimate material, over time it reorganizes itself around punctures and lacerations, filling them in with new tissues until the wound vanishes, leaving little or no trace behind. From an engineering standpoint, it seems nothing short of miraculous when an animal body fixes itself in this way, because we are all too aware that the technologies we create possess little or no comparable ability to put themselves back into the right shape after they have been knocked into the wrong one.
It is worth looking closely, though, and asking what we consider to be truly impressive about this feat, because if we are too loose in our definition of "self-repair," then we risk missing the point of why it is interesting. As was pointed out in the previous chapter, a hole that gets melted in a frozen lake by a localized application of fire will automatically "fix" itself once the fire is put out, so long as the weather stays cold enough to favor solid ice over liquid water. It is intuitively obvious that making water freeze is much easier to accomplish than regenerating wounded skin, but if so, we should be able to articulate the difference in precise terms.
Physically speaking, the formation of ice is an energetically "downhill" process: water molecules assemble together into an orderly crystal, and as they do so, they lose potential energy by shedding heat into the frigid surroundings. What this behavior has in common with lifelike self-repair is that a bunch of particles are undirectedly restoring themselves into a rare, special configuration (the crystalline array), rather than remaining in one of some large number of random, less orderly arrangements (the liquid state). And, to be fair, there is a whole lot of molecular-scale structure in living things that does work this way. With building blocks exhibiting enough specificity to each other, such as in DNA origami or the assembly of viral capsids from their constituent proteins, it is possible to design intermolecular interactions that will guarantee structures that can snap together without any help. Like melted water molecules, the protein or DNA chains are sticky and feel attractive forces pulling them together, but in addition, these forces are highly specific between particular pairs of building blocks. As a result, a specific orderly multicomponent structure can form stably that, given enough time, will jump back together again like new, even if we "melted" things temporarily by dashing the whole thing to pieces with the flick of a nano-sized sledgehammer.6
Self-repair (or, really, self-assembly) of this kind does not require a steady flow of energy because its target state sits in a deep ravine at the bottom of the potential energy landscape. While many structures within living things do need to form this way, there are at least two significant ways in which using this method ends up being severely limiting. First of all, there are many ways of arranging matter that might be functionally useful for a specific biological purpose that simply are not particularly low in energy. Certain kinds of structural goals, such as in the folding of proteins or in the assembly of viruses, might well be served by the low-energy configurations of a collection of building blocks, but there are many more ways of arranging those building blocks that have higher energy, and some of those ways might be useful for other purposes. On the assumption that there is a great diversity of things that life in practice ends up needing to do, basing all of its functional success on the lowest-energy configurations of its building blocks would be far too restrictive.
More profoundly, though, there is something closer to what may be the essence of being alive that ice-like structures that self-assemble at thermal equilibrium cannot handle, and that is being sensitive, adaptable, and dynamic. Remembering our Crooks relation, we can see that if a structure is not going to dissipate heat once it forms, and yet we want it to form fast and last a long time, the only option is for it to fall into a very deep potential energy well as it forms. When it does so, however, it becomes like a gemstone: rigid, hard, and static. Its constituent pieces stick together very strongly in one particular way, and cannot easily be provoked to change how they are situated. The result is that while self-assembly at equilibrium works for making some specialized structures, a structure's strength and stability are directly tied to its inertness and inflexibility, which make it unable on its own to react quickly and specifically to particular changes in the environment it senses. Thus, whether we are talking about pond ice or DNA origami, something of lifelikeness is still missing if we talk about self-repair only in these terms.
The freedom to keep absorbing a steady flow of energy—one that powers a constant process of self-regeneration through endless cycles of damage and restoration—resolves this problem. In terms of our abstract metaphor, a ball that spends the whole day on one slope will go up (via an escalator) and down (via rolling or sliding) along the same routes, over and over again, and each time, work will be absorbed from the lifting and dissipated as heat during the descent. This same kind of process goes on in innumerable, miniature ways at the molecular level as a living organism maintains its exquisite structural integrity. In contrast with an ice crystal, which sits in the energetic equivalent of a deep, narrow ravine, a plant—for example—has to be thought of as holding steady on a steep hillside in a constant state of free fall. Much like the chemicals in a battery powering a flashlight, many molecules in a plant are constantly undergoing reactions that convert them into other, lower-energy forms. At the same time, randomizing thermal fluctuations are taking the specially ordered components of each cell that have been assembled in a particular fashion and wreaking havoc with them, either through chemical damage or via larger-scale physical rearrangements. In permanent darkness, a plant is therefore on a slow road to death, for dying in physical terms is nothing more than sliding downhill in a variety of chemical and physical ways. Of course, plants can survive just fine for a while in the dark, but not forever. Eventually, the twin tendencies to lower energy and higher disorder that are required by the fall to thermal equilibrium will win out, and the pile of matter that was originally a live organism will start to look less and less like one.
Turn on the lights, however, and matters have a chance to turn out radically differently. Under such conditions, it is still the case that things are falling downhill: the same internal forces and thermal fluctuations are present. The remarkable thing about life, though, is how it deploys the energy it absorbs from its environment in order to resist this onslaught. With the lights on, the plant is still falling, but at the same time it is also getting repeatedly kicked back up! Like all living things, plants are structures that absorb energy from specific sources in ways that lead to internal motions that correct or undo each incremental bit of falling to pieces that happens at every moment. This process goes on not only when a wound heals, but also much more instantaneously every time sunlight is used to regenerate a molecule of chemical fuel that was just burned up, or every time a molecular chaperone burns up some chemical fuel in order to help a protein that has become misfolded to get back into the correct, functional shape. The fuel-consuming, heat-dissipating activities of proofreading, quality control, and self-maintenance lie at the core of what living things are doing all the time to remain alive, and every one of these activities involves some kind of cyclical motion, whereby work absorbed from the environment perpetually drags things back up the mountain as each little downward slip and slide occurs. In this light, healing from major trauma is a rare and more specialized event compared with the unceasing microscopic way in which living things need to fix themselves just to stay alive and healthy.
Viewing things from the perspective of an organism trying to survive in the wild, one might well wonder why life typically camps out on such an energetically expensive slippery slope in the space of possible arrangements of its constituent parts, rather than staying stable, without constant burning of fuel, by finding more crystal-like states of low energy. As we have already alluded, the difficulty with this kind of architectural principle is that it leaves no way of being structurally sturdy and capable of withstanding pushes from the environment without also essentially being frozen into one rigid shape. In ways too numerous to count, what life typically needs is to combine structural integrity with the ability to rapidly reorganize itself in response to new information about the environment, and the way this is accomplished is through sustained energy flow. All animal cells, for example, use actin filaments, long chains of proteins that form a matrix of intermeshed strands, to maintain their shape and push back against their surroundings; in other words, actin makes cells dramatically more resilient and durable than a simple bag of liquid. Actin is also frequently involved in cell motion, and its growth and reorganization are central to what is going on at the leading edge of a cell membrane as it flows in a particular direction. Actin is able to combine the qualities of added structural integrity and dynamic flexibility because it is no mere static set of beads on a string; rather, it is an assemblage of individual proteins that are each capable of absorbing and burning through the cell's chemical fuel to power a continual succession of concerted changes in shape.7 Examples of this distinctive role for nonequilibrium driving in the molecular structure of cells abound, because there is physically no other way of skinning this particular cat: a material that has to be both strong and adaptable at the same time needs a steady flow of dissipated energy to power the constant internal motion that makes such a combination of properties possible.8
WHEN LOOKING AT THE PHYSICS OF HOW LIFE WORKS, we are always inclined to think in terms of the perceived purpose of the structures we examine. Every piece of a living organism is presumed to have a purpose that relates to its survival and reproduction. However, the concept of self-maintenance as we have just described it at first might seem to pertain to a much broader class of physical systems. Experimentally, we can always take whatever collection of particles we like and send energy flowing through it in a directional way, just to see what happens. For example, we might heat or mechanically vibrate the platform on which a container of liquid is sitting, or cause wind to blow over sand, or pour water through a pile of sediment. Once we have been letting energy (and perhaps matter) flow through the system for a while, we might expect things to reach some kind of nonequilibrium steady state—and, from the perspective of the physics we have discussed above, any such steady state is automatically "self-maintaining." The flow of energy kicks the particles this way and that, and in general, as a result, they will visit configurations that are simply not expected to be seen at thermal equilibrium. In other words, we are sitting on an energetic hillside where constant kicking from the flow through the system is lifting us back up as we slide down. Now, it might take a long time to roll down if the flow is turned off: sand dunes do not disappear the moment the winds die down, and the length of time they will now last in the total absence of wind will be much longer than the length of time it took for them to form when the wind was blowing. Nonetheless, we do expect the mere influence of thermal fluctuations from random collisions with molecules of windless air to eventually tear down even the mightiest of dunes.
Is that all that life is, though? A pile of stuff that slowly falls down if you cut off its power source? In order to put a sufficiently fine point on self-repair, we need to account for more than just how energy flow maintains arrangements of matter that are otherwise unstable; we also must account for how it sometimes does so for states of organization that appear to be exceptionally well built to accomplish specialized tasks. Escalating and holding steady on a slippery slope are certainly apt metaphors for what lifelike organization is doing, but there is a problem with stopping there, in that many physical scenarios fitting that description nonetheless look quite primitive. Consider a marble in a bowl, initially sitting still in the bottom at equilibrium. If we start spinning the bowl fast enough, the marble can ride up and roll along the rim at higher potential energy. It rides up despite (at the very least) the heat lost due to friction between the bowl and the marble because, by keeping the bowl spinning, we are supplying a constant energy input. But while the marble may be behaving in a more lifelike way than a frozen crystal, there is something quite artless about how it "self-restores" its position on the rim if it temporarily gets knocked down. What this example possesses in energetic resemblance to biological self-repair, it lacks severely in intricacy. After all, the impressive thing about lifelike self-maintenance is not just that it drags things uphill, but that it seems to "know" how to do so in the precise ways needed to maintain a very particular and special multifaceted shape.
The world of nonequilibrium many-particle dynamics abounds with suggestive hints along these lines. Indeed, it is not so difficult for a big pile of little building blocks to exhibit startling complexity of organization once matter and energy start flowing. When water seeps out of underground springs, and gradually cuts channels in the loose sediment through which it flows at the surface, it carves an intricately branched network of streams into the Earth. The branching occurs because channels at the tips of the network that begin to fork have the opportunity to soak up more groundwater by spreading into new territory, and this strengthens the flow in the channel. Experimental observation matched with theory from the lab of Dan Rothman at MIT has demonstrated that these strikingly patterned networks do not just branch at random; rather, they tend to make each new fork at an angle of 72 degrees, on average. This angle counterbalances competing tendencies, allowing the new branch both to gain access to new groundwater and to maintain access to the water flowing into the fork.9 As a result, the network as a whole takes the shape of a remarkable, self-similar fractal, built in such a way that each subportion looks like a miniature version of the whole. Moreover, though erosion is a slow process compared with the flow of water, if we blocked things up by filling the network in with new dirt, we would expect that with the passage of time, the fractal pattern would be reestablished. The reason we could expect it is that the complex shape emerges from surprisingly simple physical principles governing the directed flow of water through soil.
Whether in streams, snowflakes, or any number of other impressive structures formed by an out-of-equilibrium process, our intuition may sense that something in the qualitative specialness of life may be brewing there. At the same time, the difficulty with such examples is that we most easily relate to them as a motley collection of cases—cases in which complexity suddenly rears its head, but that nevertheless do not strike us as examples of life. While it is often clear enough that the structure that interests us needs energy flow to be sustained, it is a separate question whether its relationship to the energy flowing through it is recognizably special in a way we know how to look for. And as we shall see in the next two chapters, life has a strikingly fine-tuned and specific relationship to the sources of energy that power it. The question is whether we can understand how this kind of specificity might emerge from a physical principle.
ANY KID CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT kinds of mud. Even using the same dirt, a lot of different kinds of substances can be created simply by varying the ratio of water to dirt, spanning the gamut from a pourable liquid to a malleable building material. The encounter between water and dry ground described in Moses' third sign is therefore the completion of a theme we have already begun to develop, namely, the emergence of novel properties in a whole determined by the specific combination of more basic parts. By bringing blood into the picture, however, the text of Exodus 4:9 would seem to be making a more direct claim. Blood is the liquid essence of life, and its conflation with mud in the biblical passage asserts emphatically that the qualitative difference and separateness of life is perhaps just a particularly striking example of the kind of physical novelty that mud already showcases in a less impressive way.
What we have to remember, though, is that this mud is made specifically with water from a river—that is, from water that moves. Establishing this link invites us to ponder the river's relationship to its surroundings in analogy to blood as a way of making more general sense of the behavior of systems driven by out-of-equilibrium flows. Blood permeates every corner of the body and defines a connected, coordinated whole. Similarly, as we have seen, the flowing water in a river gives rise to a branching network of intercommunicating channels whose overall arrangement is also a coordinated and interdependent whole, and many other nonequilibrium systems exhibit similarly striking system-scale patterns. Indeed, the beating heart that pumps life-sustaining blood parallels the more general, physical way in which sustained flows from external sources are capable of maintaining whole new forms of organization in matter that would fall to pieces without access to energy that they continually dissipate.
Like the blood in our bodies, the cyclical flow in a driven nonequilibrium system—such as a rainfall-powered network of water channels—is directional, and carries matter and energy in an onward march that never runs in reverse. And, just as a choked limb denied access to blood flow cannot remain alive, so, too, do the patterns of self-organized nonequilibrium systems need to be fed by the continual nudging of their externally driven flows in order to sustain and repair themselves. In numerous ways, access to such flows opens the door for matter to have new kinds of physical organization that are more dynamic and adaptable than their previous ones. Perhaps most intriguing of all, we will soon see how nonequilibrium driving makes it possible for matter to adapt, and even to learn.

MOUNTAIN AND SWORD



And he drove the flock far into the desert, and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.
—EXODUS 3:1
EVERY PHYSICAL INTERACTION BETWEEN ONE PIECE OF MATTER and another carries with it the possibility that energy will be exchanged. Whether we are talking about one billiard ball colliding with another, or an incident ray of light triggering the chemical transformation of a retinal molecule in an eye, energy always has to be supplied from the surroundings in order to get an initially motionless object to move from one place to another or change its shape. Naïvely, though, we might have imagined the availability of energy as simply a property of the thing that carries it: a cue ball rolling along has a certain amount of kinetic energy, and whether it collides with a hand or another ball, some of that energy will be transferred to the target.
In fact, projectiles like balls and bullets are specialized technologies. Arguably, they are designed to be undiscriminating in how they share their energy with whatever gets in their way, but even so, the results can be surprisingly mixed. If a bullet ricochets and flies back the way it came, most of its energy stays with it, even if the direction of motion has changed. But if it sticks to its target and breaks apart, all the energy it possessed is released and shared around, sometimes with devastating results.
The general situation turns out to be one where the ability of any two interacting systems to exchange energy can depend quite sensitively on a specific matching between how they are constructed and how they move. There are clear exceptions to this principle: heat, for example, is guaranteed to move from a hot object to a cold one in virtually any situation, so while such thermal conduction may happen faster or slower depending on whether it is occurring in a metal frying pan or in a ceramic tile on the nose of a space shuttle, it can generally be relied upon to keep on flowing until temperatures equalize. Nonetheless, the world abounds with examples where energy will only be relayed from one place to another when the right matching occurs between the supplier of energy and its receiver. Wood thrown onto a bonfire will quickly strengthen the existing flame, but wood dropped onto a cold pile of kindling will do nothing of the sort. A child pumping his legs with the right timing can go higher and higher on a swing, but if he moves them too fast or too slow, the swing stays low. And, perhaps most amazing of all, the replacement of a few atoms in the DNA strand inside a bacterium can make the difference between being able to eat through a whole jar of sugar, in a voracious microbial population explosion, and being unable to digest one single molecule of the stuff.1 Collections of matter often turn out to be very specifically good or bad at absorbing energy from particular sources depending on what state they are in. We have already learned about how the absorption of energy can be essential for finding shapes that are particularly stable. The plot now thickens, because some shapes turn out to be better at absorbing energy than others.
WHEN WE ARE YOUNG, WE LEARN THAT GLASS BOTTLES toot when we blow into them, and that rubber bands twang when they are plucked; not only this, we also readily notice that the pitches of the sounds are different depending on how full the bottle is or how taut the band. By the time we are a bit older, we come to appreciate that musical instruments work by exploiting and enhancing these effects in a systematic way: the pitch we hear is the frequency of an oscillation, and parameters like the shape and size of a cavity—or the length and tension of a string—directly affect which oscillatory frequencies are favored by the vibrating object.
The reason these factors affect the pitches we hear is that frequency is all about timing. When a plucked string vibrates, the exact number of times it cycles through the same sequence of shapes in one second will depend on how fast a wiggle at one end of the string can travel to the other end, which in turn is affected by how far apart the ends are, and how much tension is tugging one away from the other. Similar considerations enter into the calculation when we instead are talking about sound waves propagating through the air in a bottle. Any vibrating object of this sort can wobble at different frequencies depending on how we push on it; however, the lowest frequency allowed (that is, the fundamental frequency) is always roughly determined by the amount of time it takes for a disturbance to run from one side of the object to the other. Mathematically, this principle arises because vibrations that stand in place can be thought of as simultaneous combinations of leftward- and rightward-moving disturbances that travel at a speed set by the properties of the medium. A series of other, higher natural frequencies, known as harmonics, are determined by the same physics, as it leads to crinkles in the medium on shorter-length (more rapidly traversed) scales.2
We first encounter the idea of different collections of matter preferring certain frequencies of oscillation when talking about the sounds they make, but the particularly interesting point for our discussion here is that the same principles pertain to the sounds that matter can absorb. A wineglass produces a particular sound when you give it a tap, but it also may vibrate a bit if you hum at it with great determination. A little experimentation of this kind with an object (or cavity) that gives good support to vibrations reveals that the amount we can get things to move by humming depends on pitch. An operatic diva can shriek at a glass until it shatters, and we could make the mistake of thinking that all that mattered was how loud she sang. But in fact, her song might not have had the power to break anything at all if the musical score had simply been arranged in a different key, even if she belted it out at the same volume.
So the frequency of the sound matters, and it is easy to see why. A glass shatters when its shape becomes so deformed that the strain causes different portions of the vessel to crack apart from each other. In order for this to happen, the glass needs to be pushed on, and this is what sound waves in the air will do. The question, then, is whether or not the glass "likes" to move at the frequency of the song. Remember that the glass has its own specific size, shape, and material properties, and these will determine how it responds to any sound waves pushing against it, which will have a particular fundamental frequency along with higher harmonics. If the timing of the frequencies of a particular song pushing on the glass is a match for those material properties, then the motions of the glass can grow by absorbing energy from the song: when the glass bends to the left, the air pushes leftward, and when the glass bends to the right, the air can push rightward. If, instead, the vibration in the sound field is out of synch with the preferred motions of the glass, a much more frustrated collision results, in which the sound field is only sometimes pushing in the direction of the glass's motion and other times pushing against it.



The same pile of matter (in this case, glass) can be shaped in different ways, and these shapes will generally differ in how they vibrate in response to being pushed on by the environment. Accordingly, the same sound at the same frequency, or pitch, might deliver enough energy into one glass shape to shatter it, but resonate much more poorly with the same matter presented in a different shape.


The seemingly choreographed cooperation that we get when the song and the glass are wobbling in time with each other is called resonance, and the key point is that it allows the oscillatory motion that is being driven by the song to result in much bigger contortions in shape in the glass. After all, a force that pushes in the direction of your current motion is going to cause you to speed up, so that you can ultimately climb higher up some hill in potential energy before you have to turn around. The most familiar example of this effect is one we learn on the playground, pumping our legs in time with the motion of a swing. Every kindergartner knows that bending one's knees in and out at the same rate at which the seat swings forward and backward allows one to climb higher and higher, and can quickly discover that kicking the legs much slower or faster than this will keep things at lower, less interesting altitudes. Contorting the glass to the point of shattering is analogous to getting the swing to fly high enough, and it follows that making sure the singer sings in tones that resonate with the glass could be the difference between a whole vessel and a pile of shards.
IN THE EXAMPLE OF THE SHATTERING GLASS, IT FEELS natural to talk about changing the way the diva is singing: if she alters her pitch, then the glass might wobble more or less than it did at the previous pitch. But we might also consider a scenario in which the song, or "driving environment," remains fixed, while the shape of the glass is what we vary. Resonance is about a match between the environmental energy source and the matter that acts as a receiver for it, so you can make things more or less of a match either by tweaking the matter (the glass) or by tweaking the source (the voice). Accordingly, the same pile of atoms can be prepared in different initial states, and some of these may be better than others at resonating with an oscillation in their surroundings. The upshot is that the question of how much energy gets absorbed from the environment by an assemblage of matter can be a sensitive question of what state the matter is currently in.
If shapes were static things that just differed in their quality as antennae for energy ready to be soaked up from their surroundings, then the story might end here as a matter of idle curiosity. What makes the point a far more significant one is that, as with the resonating glass that shatters to bits, the energy that matter absorbs has the power to rearrange it into a new state. We have said it before, but it bears reiterating: all energy is either motion or the potential to bring about motion. If the driving forces in the environment are strong enough, the energy-absorption properties of matter currently in the form of shape A might determine whether it later transforms into shape B. So the way matter explores its space of possible shapes over time is going to be biased, sometimes in highly consequential ways, by the extent to which particular shapes do or do not get good access to energy sources in their environment.
To make the best sense of this process, it helps to return to the wandering ball of the previous chapter. Our focus there was on how escalators can make certain mountain passes act like one-way doors in a potential-energy landscape: the absorption of work lifts one up one side of a mountain, and rolling, bouncing, and skidding down the other side dissipates that energy as heat, leaving the way back closed unless another escalator happens to be in the offing. The factors that determine the exact location and direction of any given escalator went unexamined. Now, however, in light of shape-specific effects like resonance, we can explore a new kind of consequence for escalators that derives from the fact that not all ways of assembling the same matter are equally good at absorbing work energy from their environment. In particular, it becomes the case that not all slopes in the ball's mountain range are going to have escalators on them, and the precise pattern of where these sources of external driving are felt, and where they are not, will determine what our roving sphere's meandering journey looks like.



Saying that different shapes of matter absorb energy differently from the same environment is like saying that by choosing our environment, we choose a particular set of escalators to install in an energy landscape. Once our ball starts exploring the space of what is possible, it may turn out that these escalators bias the path toward particular states whose structures have distinctive properties with regard to energy absorption (i.e., with regard to escalator access).


THE QUESTION WE HAVE COME TO IS HOW WE ARE SUPPOSED to know which configurations for a given assemblage are going to be good or bad at soaking up energy from a given environment. Before addressing the full issue writ large, however, it will be helpful to stay specialized for a little bit longer and look again at the case of mechanical resonance. Although resonant vibration is only one of many ways that the current state of a hunk of matter can strongly affect how much energy it absorbs from a given external influence, it is one of the most important ways, because of the broad range of settings where it can be relevant. In the examples we have discussed so far (such as a string on a musical instrument), it is easy to come away with the somewhat mistaken idea that there is one fundamental frequency that affects what we hear when things start to vibrate, and that's the frequency that is going to matter for questions of energy absorption. In fact, almost any large collection of interacting particles is capable of supporting vibrations of many different frequencies. Moreover, the specific set of frequencies permitted (called natural frequencies) acts as a sort of fingerprint or barcode that summarizes the exact features of the particular assemblage of pieces from which they arise.
To appreciate how natural frequencies arise, recall that each shape we might construct from some large collection of particles corresponds to a location in a potential energy landscape, and some of these locations happen to be sitting at the very bottom of a valley. In a normal valley in a real mountain range, there are only two perpendicular ways to walk uphill: the north-south axis, and the east-west one. For a system with many particles, there are comparably many perpendicular directions in the potential energy valley, and each of them corresponds to a slightly different rearrangement of many or all of the particles in the structure. It is possible to move along any one of them by a small distance. Moreover, in each of these directions, the valley will seem to have a certain amount of curvature or steepness, sometimes more, sometimes less. If we were to start with a stable arrangement and then move each particle in some random direction by a small amount, things would try to snap back into place, and the snap-back may be sharp or gentle. The upshot is that not all ways of jumbling the particles a little bit to change the shape will move the same amount of mass slightly uphill by the same degree—the slowest frequencies will come from displacing heavy particles in shallow directions, and the faster ones will come from displacing light particles in steep directions. Overall, the specific way in which different masses are bonded together and co-arranged in space will always give rise to a specific and distinct set of different possible "normal-mode" vibrational motions being available to the structure, and each of these is capable of absorbing lots of energy through resonance if it is driven at its particular natural frequency.
By bringing the idea of natural frequencies back to the discussion of escalators, we at last can start to glimpse an argument with sweeping implications. Recall that where the ball goes depends strongly on where there are escalators leading in and out—in other words, that the series of shapes that a pile of matter adopts will be affected by which shape changes can be activated by work energy supplied by the environment. However, if each shape the matter can adopt has its own specific fingerprint of natural frequencies with which it can resonate, then this tells us a great deal about where there are going to be lifts and where there aren't. If the environment is oscillating at a certain pitch, then shapes that are good at vibrating with that same frequency will be capable of absorbing large amounts of energy from the song, through resonance. The effect of this resonant motion will precisely be to lift things out of their current valley and drop them down some other slope into a new shape that has a different set of normal modes and natural frequencies.3
The easiest way to appreciate the impact of this effect is to compare it to a more naïve model of how matter might explore the space of possible shapes. We imagine a landscape composed of a grid of valleys, all equally connected to each of their neighbors by lifts running on either side of the ridge. With every location having equal, bidirectional access to all of its neighboring locations, we expect an exploration of this landscape to proceed in a random, unbiased fashion. Consequently, we do not expect the process of exploration to ultimately express any preference whatsoever for one valley over another. Translated into terms where each valley corresponds to the shape of a collection of particles, this would mean that no special, particular shape could be more stable than any other.
In the typical real case, however, the amount of lift in each valley sensitively depends on the availability of external work energy in that particular locale, and which ways the external driving forces are pushing. As a result, the path of the roving ball now can become biased. There are particular moments when one is most likely to get escalated one way into a new valley where no comparable lift in the return direction exists, and these particular moments are likeliest to be ones where the current amount of lift is exceptionally strong, so that its strength will typically decrease once another ridge is crossed. Translating again, the upshot is that the points in time when the system finds itself in a shape capable of resonance will be particularly consequential ones in the whole history of how the matter's arrangement evolves over time, because the work energy supplied by resonance at those key junctures is what is needed to power the irreversible transformations in shape that leave the most lasting marks on any stable shape that emerges with time.
Not coincidentally, there is an analogy here from biology that becomes useful for seeing how things play out. An organism with a particular sequence of genes develops according to a particular pattern, and as a result has various traits that may help or hinder it in the struggle to survive and reproduce in its current environment. Mutations that occur during reproduction can give rise to new organisms with similar, but distinct, sets of traits—and the whole, famed story of Darwinian selection basically boils down to the fact that some of these mutations lead to improvements in survival and reproduction, whereas others do not. We often talk about natural selection from the perspective of an individual and its offspring, but it is sometimes easier to think in terms of how the evolutionary process is playing out at the level of a whole population or species. The current state of such a collective is described by a long list of gene sequences, or "genotypes," and their associated traits, or "phenotypes." At any given moment, individual organisms are coming into being or dying off, and a mutation in one individual can be thought of as a small change in the genetic makeup of the population as a whole.
Taking this view, we can notice important parallels to how the physical dynamics of a collection of particles searches the space of shapes. When a mutation occurs, the genotype state of the population as a whole changes. The mutation might be as likely to disappear in the next generation as it was to appear in the first place (in which case it is called "neutral"). But alternatively, the mutation may have an impact on survival and reproduction. If the mutation is very harmful, it will likely disappear from the population quickly—which looks like restoring the genetic stock of the population to its former state. If the mutation is favorable, it is likely to sweep through the population and take over, because the organisms possessing this more helpful trait will start passing on their reproductive advantage to their children and grandchildren, etc. Such a "selective sweep" would look like a highly irreversible transformation in the genetic configuration of the population.4
The structural evolution of a particle assembly absorbing energy from its surroundings bears a key resemblance to this process, in that "mutations" from one shape to another can either be reversible or irreversible depending on how the system interacts with its environment before and after the change. The particle case, however, differs in at least two important respects. First, whereas genotypes and phenotypes are very clearly separate things in biology, the physical shape of a hunk of matter is an amalgamation of the two ideas. It both represents the space of possible arrangements to be searched (like a genotype) and exhibits behaviors that themselves constitute the motion that will lead to the search (like a phenotype). Perhaps even more importantly, much less can be assumed in general in the mechanical and physical case (than in the biological one) about what the impact of irreversibility will be, in the long term, on how the system interacts with its environment. Living organisms copy themselves, which by definition means that new offspring mostly resemble their parents and grandparents. Indeed, natural selection is used to explain the impressively adaptive traits we observe in present-day life by pointing out that the ancestors of these well-adapted living things looked very similar in most respects when they successfully reproduced. In contrast, a pile of particles does not have parents or grandparents, only shapes it used to be in. More to the point, although a current shape may resemble a recent one in certain respects, a successful, irreversible change in shape does not at all guarantee that the new shape discovered will have the same relationship to the environment as the previous shape that absorbed the energy to power the irreversible change.
To fully appreciate the meaning of this last statement, we need look no further than to our now familiar example of the vibrating, resonating glass. If the glass happens to be shaped in such a way as to absorb a lot of extra energy from the surrounding song through resonance, it may bend and warp itself to such a strong degree that the whole thing shatters to pieces. We tend not to think much about what happens afterward, but in principle, the pile of shards we end up with is still supposed to be capable of changing its configuration. In practice, however, once the system no longer resonates, there are no more motions in the system that will be violent enough to snap the glass further—or to fuse any of the pieces back together. These events could occur to some degree with the help of thermal fluctuations, but the time scale on which that is expected to occur is much longer. Thus, the glass has irreversibly jumped into a state that is much worse at absorbing energy and therefore much more stuck in place than it was when the devastating song began. At the same time, although the energy absorption has decreased, the shards still contain much more information about their history of highly resonant motion than if we had melted them down or thrown them into a spinning blender. Though it might be a tough job, especially if the fragments of glass shattered by resonance are too numerous, in theory we might be able to place the pieces edge to edge and glue things back together without too much trouble. While a pile of shards may not itself be good at resonating, it might still be thought of as a special, rare arrangement of its constituent atoms that bears the scars, so to speak, of a strongly energy-absorbing event in its past.
IF A CERTAIN KIND OF BACTERIA IS GOOD AT EATING A nutrient found in its environment, we tend to think of this match as being functionally meaningful, and call it an adaptation. We are now in a position to recognize a similar potential for matches between collections of matter and their more primitive physical properties, specifically as they pertain to how energy gets absorbed. However, it is worth noting that there are a great many ways that a particular current state of a material can influence its ability to absorb and dissipate energy from sources in the environment.
Perhaps the simplest question one can ask along these lines is how readily heat can flow in one end and out the other. Thermal conductivity is a measure of a material's ability to act as a conduit for the flow of heat from hot to cold, and it can differ dramatically from one material to another depending on how the constituent atoms are arrayed together. On the nanoscale, heat is expected to just look like the random jiggling of atoms and molecules, and when a whole group of such particles is assembled together, there are many ways in which the influence of jiggling in one place can propagate to different, distant locations. Moreover, the way heat flows through a medium can itself depend on how big a difference there is between the hot end and the cold end. Some fluids, for example, are famously capable of forming so-called Rayleigh-Bénard convection cells when their bottom surfaces are sufficiently hotter than their tops. For a big enough difference in temperature, a fluid's drop in density as it heats up leads to a buoyant upward force, powering a flow of liquid that carries heat from hot to cold more rapidly than if the heat had to travel jiggle by jiggle from molecular collisions.
Heating effects can also have mechanical consequences for absorption of work. Anyone who has been to a blacksmith's forge knows that it is sometimes useful to heat metal to the point of glowing so that its shape can be changed by a hammer blow. But why should that be? In essence, the issue can again be summarized in terms of topography: energetically speaking, cold metal is trapped in a very deep valley and needs a huge amount of lift if it is to exit that valley, whereas hot metal has already jumped up close to the ridge. The cold metal therefore turns out to behave much more rigidly, returning much more of the hammer's energy back to it in an elastic rebound, and the hot metal is much more fluid, and can move under the applied force of the hammer and then dissipate the energy of that motion as heat, rather than pushing back against the tool's motion. Hot metal can absorb and dissipate work in ways that more readily lead to irreversible structural change when it is struck.
The thoughtful reader may notice that the ability of a lump of hot metal to absorb work energy does not seem to depend much on how precisely the metal is getting smashed. The greater receptivity of the material to being pushed on by sources of work energy in the environment just has to do with a general pliability, so that virtually any force pushing it, in whichever way it pushed, would have more success than if it had pushed on a colder version of the same lump. And this is different from the case of mechanical resonance by normal modes—the shattering glass, for example—because the shattering glass requires a more specific matching between the way the environment pushes on the system of interest, on the one hand, and the way the system tends to like to move, given its structure, on the other. But it turns out that mechanical resonance of the type we saw in the shattering glass is only one of several ways that structure can affect energy absorption.
Perhaps the most commonplace way for structure to affect energy absorption is through the various ways that matter absorbs and scatters light. All light carries energy that it is capable of delivering into the matter with which it interacts. Moreover, light can be highly patterned in its spectrum of colors, in its varying intensity over some region of space, and through two other, subtler features of how it propagates from one place to another, known as polarization and phase. All of these factors can affect whether or not light passes through a material, gets bounced back by reflection, or gets absorbed and converted into some other form of energy in the material, such as heat. The structure of the object on which the light is incident makes a big difference as well. Photochemically, the way atoms are put together at the molecular level can hugely impact which colors or polarizations of light get transmitted or absorbed, as well as how the molecules may change in structure as a result of absorbing light. Meanwhile, optically, the overall shape of an object on a larger scale can affect how incident light waves may be reflected, bent, or diffracted. Suffice it to say, any situation where a patterned light source is delivering energy into something, the shape the matter takes on as a result might be affected by the optical and photochemical effects.
But the grandest and most profound way that the shape matter takes can affect its relationship to the flow of energy is through chemistry, whether light is involved or not. Chemicals are defined by how different types of atoms get stuck together in semi-stable arrangements of different shapes and sizes. Chemicals can mediate energy flow, because different configurations of atoms have different amounts of stored potential energy, like wound-up jack-in-the-boxes waiting to be sprung. When a chemical reaction converts one chemical into another, some of this energy may be released and converted into other forms. We are all familiar with the simplest examples of this kind of effect: when oxygen is allowed to react with wood or gasoline and helps the molecules of each fall apart into smaller pieces, energy is released that sends those pieces flying fast in random directions, which we register as an increase in temperature near the reaction that we call a flame.
Combustible materials, however, are typified by the ease with which they can be made to react and to rearrange in a way that dumps their energy rather indiscriminately into their surroundings: lots of different kinds of things can burn, and when they do so, the process seems to be wholly disordering—and it is much the same process regardless of the fuel. But there are other ways of releasing chemical energy that do much more to exploit the potential for structural discrimination and specificity that can be coded in the geometric and physical properties of particular sorts of molecules. The diversity of architectural possibilities, once one begins building molecules out of many atoms, is so great that it becomes possible for chemical reactants to start to refuse to react unless they get the right "handshake" from other molecules, in the form of specific surfaces that distribute the positively and negatively charged parts of different atoms in space in just the right way. Virtually all of biochemistry relies on this kind of phenomenon, especially through the central roles played by enzymes.
The simplest definition of an enzyme is that it is a protein chain that has folded into a shape that presents a particular pattern of different chemical groups in three-dimensional space so that they are optimally positioned to "catalyze"—that is, to accelerate—a chemical reaction that otherwise would proceed much more slowly. In landscape terms, we can think of a molecule of type A as the case of our ball sitting in a valley on one side of a high ridge, where that ridge flanks another valley corresponding to a molecule of type B. A can convert to B, but usually does so only rarely. Because the ridge is so high and there are no escalators, one would have to wait a very long time for all the coin-tossing of random thermal kicks to carry the ball uphill far enough that it could roll back down into the B side.



A "passive" enzyme accelerates a chemical reaction both in the forward and reverse directions. It does so by lowering the so-called activation barrier, which is the height of the energy (or free-energy) summit that has to be traversed to get from one chemical state to another.


Adding an enzyme to the mixture offers a new, lower mountain pass from A to B and makes it faster for things to interconvert between A and B in both directions. This effect can be very potent, because the rate of interconversion changes exponentially with the barrier height, so that cutting a given barrier in half might easily speed a given reaction up by a factor of a thousand or more.5 Moreover, because both the shape of molecule A and that of the enzyme have a specific, hand-in-glove kind of relationship, it is possible to add the enzyme to the mix without expecting it to change a lot of other reactions (involving C and D and E) at the same time.
Enzymes are the bread and butter of metabolism at the subcellular level; indeed, when a bacterium either can or cannot digest some type of sugar found in its surroundings, this typically is an issue of whether or not it possesses an enzyme capable of accelerating the breakdown of a nutrient molecule of that shape and composition. Usually, we tend not to think of the bacterium as an assemblage of atoms that could be put together differently; looking through that lens, though, we can recognize that the microbe's constituent building blocks, and how they are assembled, can dictate whether a source of chemical energy in its environment will make a big difference to its subsequent motion and behavior. A small change in how some of its proteins are constructed might be the difference between feasting and starvation! Yet, while it is easy enough to appreciate this kind of effect when life is involved, it turns out that matter outside the biological realm can act in a similar way for the same physicochemical reasons: whatever chemical fuel is present, there remains the question of whether the matter near it can react with it or not, and if so, how that reaction's release of energy will move or transform the matter in question.
So-called Janus particles may provide the most straightforward illustration of how this concept can work in settings that are decisively not alive. Many experimental physicists now make use of microscopic beads, or "colloidal particles," that are named for the two-faced mythological figure of Janus, because they have a chemical coating that only covers half their surface.6 The particles are typically placed in a pool of chemical fuel that is relatively stable on its own, and the surface coating on the particles acts as a catalyst for the breakdown of the fuel. Because the froth of the reaction occurs on one side of the particle while the other side remains inert, there ends up being a net pressure pushing the particle away from the reactive side. The Janus particle thus can convert the release of energy—through the breakdown of fuel—into a miniature rocket boost of sorts. Remarkably, although nothing so complex as life, a mixture of these self-propelling particles proves to be capable of a surprising degree of self-organization, simply because something in their structure has the specific capability to release stored energy in a chemical found in their environment. Although they are not attracted to each other at all at thermal equilibrium, self-propelled colloids have been shown to form dynamic crystalline arrays that can persist for long periods of time before breaking apart (a curious phenomenon that we will wait until Chapter 7 to explain).7 In other words, having a structure that is competent to release chemical potential energy in the surroundings can make a difference in how matter moves, and how it becomes organized as a result.
Perhaps the most compelling illustration of this point comes from the architecture and function of molecular motors found in living cells. Motor proteins—such as myosin, which enables our muscles to contract and pull—are enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of a chemical fuel called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into constituent parts, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate. What distinguishes motor proteins from many other enzymes is that they do not simply catalyze the breakdown passively, like the bellows of a forge that circulates oxygen to make sure it reacts faster. Rather, in a manner much more intricate than any Janus particle can manage, the motor protein couples a chemical reaction to a concerted motion. Because of the forces that molecules exert on each other when they stick together, each shape that myosin might prefer to be in depends on whether ATP has stuck into its specially shaped catalytic active site, or the ATP has already broken up, or the ADP or phosphate has fallen out, leaving the site partly or totally empty. The tendency of the protein to shift from one shape to another while the fuel is bound or unbound creates the opportunity to harvest energy from the breakdown of the fuel molecule and turn it into a power stroke. Although things look much more jittery and partly random at the nanoscale, the essence of this behavior might be likened to springing a jack-in-the-box in just the right place so as to use the oomph from its motion to turn the axle of a wheel forward a bit.8 Clearly, to build such a contraption on a tabletop would require a bit of thought about how to position the different pieces of the mechanism with respect to each other. What makes chemical architecture so powerful is precisely that it allows for such marvelous diversity in the ways in which molecules, by virtue of their shapes, can create specialized nooks and surfaces that enable chemical reactions to be harnessed for propelling other motions.
For this reason, perhaps, it should be unsurprising that life, with its seemingly infinite intricacy and architectural distinctiveness, achieves what it does by exploiting chemical diversity to the hilt. By using specificity of shape as a way of conditioning reaction and motion on the right "handshakes" or "passwords" among the various participants in the process, the driven search of chemical space can be intensely biased and guided by the question of precisely which pieces of the system can absorb energy from which other pieces and how. What is not yet apparent from what we have said so far, however, is where this biased path eventually leads. It is all very well and good to say that the moments when you absorbed energy and underwent irreversible changes made a big difference to who you are in the present—but can one be more specific about how that present state is supposed to look? Increasingly, the answer seems to be yes, and by exploring the implications of these physical principles a little bit further, we can start to understand the emergence of a surprising range of lifelike behaviors.
HILLTOPS ARE PLACES WHERE SMALL NUDGES THIS WAY or that can make a big difference to where we end up, because the precise way we roll down turns small differences in influence into big changes in outcome. Thus, even if we did not have the whole language of energy landscapes elaborated above to guide our physical understanding of how nonequilibrium systems change shape over time, we might nonetheless be drawn to talk of mountains and summits as a way of explaining what it means to be pushed past a tipping point, that is, to traverse a peak and fall down the other side.
Horeb, which can be translated from Hebrew to mean "Sword," is the mountain where Moses finds the burning bush, and we therefore also have to ask what swords might have to do with what he witnesses there. The signs given to him at Mount Sword all provoke us to contemplate what makes life different, but there remains the question of how one gets there: When do lifelike behaviors emerge, and what does that process look like? We tend first to think of what a sword can do: it points and stabs, or it slashes and cuts. It is, indeed, designed to puncture the boundary of a living thing, and to cleave it into its constituent parts. Even more important to our discussion, however, is how a blade gets forged. The image comes readily to mind of the blacksmith swinging his hammer and striking a strip of red-hot metal. In other words, an external force is brought to bear, with the aim of irreversibly reshaping the unformed material, and what we need to remember in the midst of this is why the steel has been heated until it glows. Hot metal is softer than cold metal, and the same hammer blow will cause a more dramatic and permanent change in shape when it strikes something soft than when it strikes something cold and unyielding. We therefore encounter, in the concept of the sword, an example of a system for which not all possible states of the material are equally good at absorbing work energy that brings about changes in shape.
In this instance, the simple and everyday way that a material can become more competent to absorb energy, and be reshaped by an external drive, is by being in a hot state instead of a cold one (which energetically happens to be all about being at higher elevation and closer to many tipping points). Fascinatingly, the biblical text offers additional connotations in another passage. The first mention of blacksmithing, in Genesis 4:22, attributes its invention to a man named Tubal-Cain, son of Lamech, but the same passage also mentions his brothers Yaval and Yuval. This pair were equally inventive, as it turns out: we are told the first discovered the herding of animals (4:20), and the second invented musical instruments (4:21). In a stunningly precise combination, we therefore encounter three related ideas: collective behavior (herds), irreversible reshaping by an external drive (blacksmithing), and shape-dependent energy absorption through resonance (music). These concepts all attach to the emblem of the sword, which in turn is the name given to the mountain where Moses comes to understand something of where life begins and ends.

FLAME AND TREE



And there the bush was, blazing with fire, but the bush was not consumed.
—EXODUS 3:2
WE HAVE ALL HEARD IT ASKED WHETHER THE CHICKEN CAME before the egg, but it takes a little additional effort to figure out if this most famous of paradoxical clichés has anything actually scientifically interesting about it. Armed with evolutionary thinking, one can run the supposed infinite regress backward and find that the ancestors of chickens likely were other kinds of organisms. The fundamental sticking point that we still encounter, though, is that while it may be straightforward enough to explain where chickens and eggs came from, we still need to assume the existence of some sort of cellular life in order to concoct such an explanation at all.
All chickens, or, for that matter, all the birds and egg-laying animals we have ever known, are intricately complex assemblages of molecules. So, in fact, are their eggs. What we are actually curious to know, and what requires some work to understand, has more to do with how the full-blown complexity of even the simplest living things could ever spring into being from a context that was originally more primitive in its organization. Empirical experience and common sense both tell us that it is much easier to get more biological complexity from some amount of it than it is to get some of it from none. We can easily conceive of a world, long before eggs, that was filled with single-celled organisms such as bacteria, all eating, growing, and dividing into new copies of themselves in a breathtakingly coordinated molecular dance. Once the process of self-replication gets rolling—along with the process of natural selection that accompanies it almost by definition—it is possible to understand how new adaptive successes in biological architecture can be discovered and incorporated into life's ever-expanding playbook. Nonetheless, this account of things has to leave us wondering: Where did the first self-copying, biologically complex selves come from?
There are at least two ways of trying to handle this conundrum. The first, more obvious one essentially amounts to waving it away by rejecting its main premise. It is true that the biological examples of self-replicators that we have in the present day are all magnificently impressive in how they accomplish the job of reorganizing their surroundings in a pattern that matches their own form. Still, it might also be the case that there is a gray spectrum of complexity in self-replicators all the way down to the bottom, and that jump-starting some kind of process of reproduction at the beginning need not be thought of as difficult. If so, then perhaps, like a teetering boulder beginning to tumble down the side of a mountain, the implacable march of Darwinian selection and adaptation could have gotten started at the beginning without needing any fluke or special help to set everything in motion.
The other way out of the woods is to reject a different premise of the puzzle, namely, that emergent lifelike complexity can't start emerging until the effect of natural selection is brought to bear. Many pieces of a living thing seem, from the perspective of a careful observer, to be perfectly shaped and built in order to accomplish very particular tasks that serve the overall organism well in its struggle to survive and reproduce. Did every single one of those pieces only start to look well built for some particular functional purpose once it was a part of a living whole that needed to copy itself? Or might some of them already have gotten "good at" part of what we now call their purpose even before being a piece of something that might be called alive?
After traveling quite a distance from the beginning of this book in order to build up the necessary concepts, we are finally in a position to say something meaningful on these topics, and, in point of fact, we will get to see how both of these explanations may be true to some extent. Self-replication is a process that has the potential to spring up surprisingly easily in contexts that seem quite generic and unstructured, in ways that make grandiose talk of eggs and chickens moot. At the same time, making copies of oneself is just one of any number of distinctively lifelike behaviors one might like to understand, and we shall see shortly that a good number of other ones can sometimes emerge spontaneously in systems where the normal Darwinian mechanism is completely absent. All told, these ideas may not quite make the beginning of life as we know it an open book, but they do help to adjust our sense of how likely different pieces of the puzzle were to fall into place.
ARE WE RIGHT TO THINK THAT SELF-REPLICATION IS difficult to accomplish? Certainly, when it comes to the examples that biology offers, there is something simply stunning about the way a highly complicated assemblage of pieces can possess the capacity to convert "raw" materials in its surroundings into an assembled form of similar or identical construction. Especially in an era where the technology we create is itself quite sophisticated, it is easy to think of examples of highly refined complex forms that have no ability whatsoever to clone themselves; one can hardly imagine taking a smartphone and making a small tweak to the design that would allow it to gestate and give birth to more phones.
Still, we ought to think carefully about what truly sounds so impossible in this fantastical scenario, because, in another sense, smartphones have proven to be self-replicators par excellence! Originally, there were just a few, but those few that did exist originally made such an impression on humanity that more were demanded, and thus, more were manufactured. Looking at the universe from the Darwinian perspective of the device, people might be thought of as a material process toiling in the background to create more copies of those brands and designs that are more successful at commanding the resources of manufacturing to help them reproduce.
Now, of course, to speak of the creations of human industry in this way is deliberately absurd, but teasing apart why this is so may help us articulate with greater clarity what it is about the biological examples of self-copying that seem so impressive. Viruses, after all, are just as parasitic and manipulative as the smartphone, in the sense that they do not themselves contain the industrial plant that must be used to produce their copies. Instead, they hijack the machinery of the cells they infect and make use of someone else's nutrients and protein assembly line to build their progeny. What viruses do contain that phones do not is a coded set of molecular instructions for their own reproduction. As a result, a single virion can more directly and locally cause new viral copies to be made, and this is arguably more of an accomplishment than merely becoming a popular consumer product. Moreover, this comparison calls our attention to an aspect of what makes biological self-replicators so distinctively impressive, namely, that they are highly portable, and that they carry out their self-copying relatively autonomously within a limited spatial domain.
At the same time, we should be aware that it is possible to widen the field and remember that self-replication is one example of a more general class of phenomena referred to as positive feedback. There are quantities in the world that can end up changing over time in such a way that they grow more rapidly in proportion to how large they already are. A population of self-replicators works this way, because having more individuals in total usually leads to an increase in the number who are giving birth at any given moment. Moreover, anyone who has ever played with walkie-talkies or the microphones and amplifying speakers on a stage has been treated to the ear-splitting screech that results when an electrical power source is used to make a loud output that gets fed back into the same channel as input. Nor are examples of feedback of this kind limited to what can be achieved with modern technology: most of us are familiar with the cartoon cliché of a snowball that rolls a little way down a mountainside, gets heavier from the flakes it gathers, and therefore rolls on faster and more implacably. And, even more basically and importantly, we all know about fire.
Fire is the ultimate basic example of a process of positive feedback that expresses the character of self-copying. The fascinating—and often frightening—thing about flames is that they can spread from one starting place to many adjacent neighboring ones, and that, consequently, the presence of fire in one limited locale may quickly lead to a much broader conflagration. Is fire alive? Surely not. Nonetheless, the physics of how it works is the same physics we need to make sense of self-replication more generally.
ODDLY ENOUGH, IT IS TEMPTING TO EXPLAIN FIRE AS A chemical version of a snowball rolling downhill. Chemical fuel, such as wood or grass, sits at high potential energy, as though on a mountaintop. When things are cold, nothing rolls downhill very much, but once enough heat is supplied to achieve ignition, the pace of events accelerates. The key thing is that by rolling downhill—that is, by burning wood in a chemical reaction with oxygen—a fire produces more heat by touching more new fuel, and this increase in turn accelerates its descent further in the energy landscape.
The process we have just described is a simple example of an autocatalytic cycle—that is, a series of reactions where at least one participant is more plentiful in the products than it was in the reactants. As mentioned earlier, the simplest version of an autocatalytic cycle is when a molecule of some type A reacts with another of type B to produce a second molecule of type A and some other product we can call C. Combustion and similar sorts of burning reactions follow precisely this pattern, except that we have to think of the heat they produce as the reactant (A), since it is the ingredient causing more reactions to happen faster. The double-edged sword in this kind of mechanism is that heat is both highly disordering and highly promiscuous: it will take a collection of particles and kick things into a higher-entropy exploration of random arrangements, and it can do this almost regardless of what material it is dealing with, because virtually anything made of many interacting molecules can absorb and conduct heat. This may mean that fire is capable of burning through lots of things once it gets going, but what you have on your hands at the end (that is, ashes) is not so interesting.
It turns out, though, that the same kind of autocatalytic structure describes a much wider variety of situations where some matter starts out near the summit of a potential energy landscape. Just as fire helps its fuel find a way downhill to lower energy while giving off lots of heat in the process, sometimes chemicals can facilitate a kind of descent where the heat released by each chemical event is not an essential or even a consequential input to further reactions. Instead, the input to the next round of autocatalysis is a chemical, some particular molecule that may be capable of converting substances in its surroundings into another copy of itself in a highly specific way that depends on the particularities of how the surfaces of molecules stick together in lock-and-key fashion. We have already discussed a straightforward example of this kind of behavior in Chapter 3, when we mentioned the example of an RNA molecule that can serve as a template for the assembly of two more basic RNA building blocks into a whole copy of the original RNA. What this first case points to, however, is that getting molecules to act autocatalytically with high specificity at first seems to require highly contrived situations, where the "building blocks" being used are very carefully constructed to fit together like pieces of origami. This approach puts us right back in the unsatisfying chicken-and-egg position of wondering how chemical autocatalysis might develop without the need for specificity to be built in by hand at the start.
We are in the early days of grappling with this question, but several recent studies have begun to chart the way forward. To unravel this particular knot, it helps to zoom out a bit. Autocatalysis seems difficult if it is a single chemical that has to be built in just the right way to exert the influences on its surroundings necessary to slap a copy of itself together. The trick is to think instead about a whole herd of different molecules and all the ways they can react with each other. In a reaction pot with even a few hundred atoms, the number of distinct ways they could be arranged and combined is staggeringly vast, and while not all reactions that are possible in principle can happen fast enough to be relevant, there certainly are many different types of chemicals that one might expect to see formed. Moreover, each of these molecules is no island, and will meet a fate that is strongly determined by the presence or absence of other molecules of different types to combine with. Some molecules get in each other's way, so it may well be that one of type A will hinder the ability of B to turn C into D. Still, with so many different possible types of chemical species, and so many different ways for them to possibly influence each other, it suddenly becomes easier to see how the snowball gets rolling. With the system perched precariously at the top of an energy landscape mountain, the question now is no longer whether or not one particular molecule can copy itself, but whether there exists any collection of different chemicals that might happen to cooperate with each other in just the right way that they will make more of themselves (and some waste products as well) through a series of reactions that lower the energy of the system as they go. Though it's true that such a subset of chemical species must seem very rare and specially chosen, it is also true that the number of chances the chemical reaction pot has to get it right is enormous. The number of unique subgroups of twenty that one could pick out of a set of just one hundred types of molecules is more than a billion times a billion. Among all those groupings, the odds could be quite low that any given one of them would cooperate well, and still it would not be unreasonable that two or more of them would turn out to help each other grow, and subsequently take over quite effectively. Where there is promiscuous random feedback among many species, it turns out that positive feedback may not be so hard to discover.
A straightforward illustration of this idea came recently from a theory paper by Zorana Zeravcic and Michael Brenner at Harvard University.1 They considered a collection of interacting species of colloidal clusters, which are basically little clumps of microscopic beads that vary in how strongly and specifically they stick to each other. The authors demonstrated that in a diverse population of such clusters with varying, weak tendencies to template each other's assembly, a strongly self-reinforcing population trend nonetheless typically takes over and grows exponentially because of the cooperation of various individual species. More recently, two different projects from my own lab carried things further by modeling networks of more basic chemical reactions among species sharing the same pool of atomic building blocks. We have found that, under quite generic conditions, as long as chemical reactants are not too promiscuous and easily consumed by many different reactions, forming autocatalytic cycles with the ability to exploit available fuel can be quite likely in a well-mixed reaction pot.2 Even if a source of energy in the environment is quite challenging to access, it is not so unlikely that a rare and special combination of building blocks will come across the chance to combine and start reproducing itself once the slowest simple reactions in the network are allowed to happen a handful of times.
Several experimental studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the underlying idea here, which is that diverse herds of molecules act like ecosystems in which it becomes likely that some particular combination of chemicals can discover at random that it forms a successful collaborative set capable of growing itself. Nilesh Vaidya and coworkers at Portland State University demonstrated this effect by generating a pool of autocatalytic RNA molecules with differing sequences that all had to make use of some of the same molecular building blocks to grow themselves. Rather than one single molecule winning the day, in a typical outcome several would prove to become a robust and effective autocatalytic set capable of taking over the pot. This research confirmed the expectation from theory that the combinatorial diversity and numerousness of such groups give them a winning shot at containing a rare combination of molecules capable of outgrowing everyone else.3 These self-copying trends in molecular composition are not quite chickens or eggs, but they point to the possibility that emergent self-replicators may be quite a comprehensible thing once we start to think about downhill chemical reactions in this way: as ecosystems of molecular species that are practically guaranteed to find their way down the energy mountainside once they get a chance to explore their vast space of possible combinations. A first complex self-replicator might therefore be able to get its start as a delocalized mixture of simpler species all piggybacking on each other, with the additional challenge of packaging them all into one compact bundle to be deferred to a later date.
WHAT WE'VE JUST SEEN IS THAT IT MAY WELL BE POSSIBLE to conceive of how a self-copying entity might not have such a hard time getting rolling on its own, at least in some relatively primitive version. To some, this point alone may already do much to satisfy their craving for an explanation of how biological complexity could have emerged. Natural selection does provide a testable—and indeed, proven—way to explain how new functionality can be discovered "blindly" over time. In the present day, protein engineers have applied these principles in so-called directed evolution experiments, where selection pressure is deliberately applied to mutant bacteria in a way that helps them discover enzymes with new properties.4 Of course, sketching the contours of how such a process of molecular tweaking works in a laboratory is much easier than explaining in detail what it might have looked like playing out over millions of years or more. It is possible to understand how a few mutations in a protein could cause it to bind to a chemical substrate with slightly greater or lesser stickiness; it is far more difficult to even conceive of the steps needed to change the body plan of a squishy sea creature into that of a vertebrate ready to crawl onto land.
Still, while arguments from natural selection currently leave many finer points of how life may have evolved unsatisfyingly vague, the blame for this vagueness lies mainly with the limitations of our imagination. The fact that we cannot currently, and perhaps may not ever, be able to fill in all the blanks between a bacterium and a frog is not on its own evidence of the Darwinian picture's insufficiency, any more than our difficulty with predicting the weather throws doubt on the accuracy of Newton's laws. Indeed, when it comes to modeling future weather, at least data are plentiful, whereas attempts at modeling the distant evolutionary past are always thwarted by how fragmentary the full set of hints and traces left to us is. The influence of selective pressure may not yet be able to explain every aspect of how the biological world came into being, but the incompleteness of success is not the same thing as failure. A great many questions and puzzles regarding the emergence and evolution of life may yet remain (in science, a heap of lingering questions is the norm), but such an absence of total clarity cannot on its own be taken as evidence that some new kind of theory is needed.
That being said, whatever accounts of the past we try to generate, we are always working with assumptions about what is possible that are based on what we observe in the present. Crucially, this means that new discoveries in the here-and-now about what kinds of lifelike behaviors can emerge when matter is subjected to certain physical conditions could dramatically alter the attempts we might make to tell a plausible story about life's early beginnings. It is worth considering that the whole name of the game here really is about assigning probability. Why do we not find it satisfying to say "the first life must have just coalesced from atomic building blocks through a random fluke collision of disorderly pieces"? Only because we assign such a laughably low probability to such an event do we dismiss it out of hand as the opposite of an explanation.5 Accordingly, the question to ask now is whether new insight into how matter gets knocked into lifelike shapes might alter our sense of how likely or unlikely life's ultimate emergence should be judged.
THIS NEW OPPORTUNITY BECOMES CLEAREST WHEN WE reflect sufficiently on what kinds of specialized structures can be said to exhibit lifelike behavior. We usually think of life as being good at absorbing energy: everyone has to eat, after all. However, there is equal reason to talk about a kind of self-organization that seems to be the opposite sort of phenomenon: a tendency in driven matter to self-assemble in ways that cause energy absorption to be exceptionally low. At first, this type of effect may sound like it should not belong anywhere on a list of lifelike physical properties. But there is a quite fundamental way in which this overly simple intuition turns out to be wrong.
To see why, we need only recall, yet again, that energy and motion are intimately linked. All energy that a living organism absorbs can be thought of as either something already in motion or some version of a compressed spring that is ready to burst apart, forcefully, when properly triggered. It is certainly true that life requires a wide variety of kinds of motion in order to sustain itself—from the wriggling of worms through soil to the currents of chemical flux that churn about in cycles while nutrients are being metabolized. However, it is equally true that all living things would not be able to remain who and what they were unless certain parts of themselves tended not to move very much. Organs need to stay properly connected to each other, tissues need to maintain their integrity at the cellular level, and well-functioning proteins need to stay properly folded in the shapes that enable them to engage in their distinct activities. To put it more bluntly, there is such a thing as getting smashed, broken, or damaged, and all the motions of that type are clearly not ones that help a living thing stay alive. Accordingly, people can eat sugar, but not dynamite; plants love sunlight, but not intense gamma rays. Life needs access to energy, but it has to absorb it in specific ways that are conducive to activating "healthy" motions while avoiding "unhealthy" ones.
To get a little bit more technical, it helps to remember that living things are in highly specialized, exceptionally rare configurations of their constituent parts that would not easily be discovered by a random and unbiased search of the space of their possible arrangements. The all-important question when assessing an influx of energy, then, is how random the resulting motion looks. The metabolism of a slew of sugar molecules by a living cell is a remarkably orchestrated process whereby specific chemical reaction steps get catalyzed in a particular order, so that the sugar's breakdown through its reaction with oxygen can be coupled in the right way to the generation of other, more general-purpose fuel molecules for the cell. Meanwhile, most parts of the cell do not react with the sugar at all. In contrast, when an electrically charged, high-energy alpha particle from a radioactive nuclear decay crashes into the same cell, countless protein, water, and nucleic acid molecules (to name only a few suspects!) pick up some of that energy and go flying in myriad unpredictable directions. Ionizing radiation can cause cell death so easily because it takes a collection of matter in a highly nonrandom shape and brings about many drastic and seemingly random changes in that shape all at once. In such a scenario, it is virtually unavoidable that things should look a bit more random and less exceptional afterward. A bicycle can sustain the impact of a cross-country race much better than it can sustain being shot in the gears with an elephant gun.
What makes life much more interesting than a bicycle is that it is not a technology designed by people for a particular purpose, but a diverse collection of different natural phenomena, each of which appears in its own particular environmental context. We do not find blue whales on mountaintops—nor can pine trees grow at the bottom of the ocean—and it is therefore interesting, about any given organism, not only that there exists a source of energy to which it is well matched, but also that this invariably happens to be the set of environmental drives we observe it to experience in nature. Plants are not blown to chemical smithereens by sunlight; instead, they harness its power to sustain themselves against chemical breakdown despite the randomizing ravages of thermal fluctuations. It would be easy to lump this exceptional capability in with everything else life does that was probably refined by natural selection. In this case, though, we can ask whether such matching between an organized structure and its external energy source could be an example of a more general physical phenomenon that does not need Darwin to explain its emergence.
It is in this regard that there might be something consequential to say based on a new understanding of the physics of self-organization that has recently begun to develop. Thus far, this whole book has been devoted in large part to building the conceptual framework needed in order to lay out an argument couched in physical terms for a mechanism of emergent lifelike behavior that does not found itself on self-replication and natural selection. It will be helpful at this point to review the different ingredients, so we can see most clearly how they fit together.
The first point was to try to be precise in the language of physics about what living things do that seems most distinctive, for lifelikeness actually breaks down into a number of separate activities. Living organisms make copies of themselves and harvest energy from sources in their environment that are difficult to access; as we have seen, these two phenomena might both be understandable as the result of runaway positive feedback processes that can start spontaneously in mixtures of particles interacting according to simple rules—whether chemically or mechanically. Equally significant, however, is that life also uses the energy it absorbs in remarkable ways, whether by maintaining and repairing itself in an exceptional structural form or by acting on accurate predictions of the future environment that are derived from what has been sensed in the present and past.
To have a chance at understanding these phenomena in a new light, we introduced the idea of coarse-graining, which is nothing more than lumping a bunch of microscopic shapes together according to some grosser property that they all share. Out of this discussion emerged the idea that some coarse properties of large collectives of particulate matter are very rare, and can only be achieved when the building blocks are arranged with respect to each other in highly atypical ways that would not be easily discovered at random. This way of thinking became particularly interesting when we were thinking about systems that have energy constantly flowing through them, since one way that matter can be exceptional in its coarse-grained properties is through its ability, or inability, to absorb energy from the driving forces in its surroundings. The flow of energy naturally comes to the fore in this discussion because energy is motion, and at low enough temperatures, the availability of energy from an external source can have a dramatic impact on a hunk of matter's opportunity to change its shape and dynamically evolve.
We therefore can now pose the following scenario. Suppose we have a collection of particles capable of assembling in a vast and diverse set of arrangements, and it is initially sitting at some temperature for which structural changes happen very slowly. Now imagine that we make energy available from an environmental source that pushes on the matter in some specific, fingerprinted way—perhaps only on a subset of the particles, or only through oscillations of a particular frequency pointed in a particular direction. The influx of work energy from the external drive will activate motion and accelerate the pace of structural change. Initially, and generically, it is reasonable to suppose that, for a system with many heterogeneously interacting parts, this activated motion will look at least partly random. Such randomness, in turn, might enable the system to explore the space of possible shapes somewhat haphazardly, making unpredictable leaps in the myriad directions available in shape space. This is the scenario of our skittering ball aided by a complex collection of escalators of varying degrees of power that have been thrown down on the rugged landscape by our particular choice of fingerprinted external drive.
A new all-important question now arises: Where is the mountaineering ball going to get stuck? In other words, at what point might this evolving, driven material settle down and stop rearranging its pieces so much? Will it keep on randomly bobbing and weaving forever, or are there states it might find at the end of its search that it is easier to get into than it is to leave?
Not surprisingly, the full answer breaks into cases, some more straightforward than others. Obviously, in order for the scenario described above to be interesting, we had to assume that the driving force was strong enough to activate motion; if it is too strong, however, the motion we get is going to be rather dull. In the extreme of very vigorous driving, so much energy would be expected to be converted into heat by friction in the disorderly motion of the various particles in our material that things will get hot and stay hot. Microscopic motion that is quasi-random and quite violent is something we are already familiar with from the work of physicists of the nineteenth century: it is the state of thermal equilibrium at high temperature, where any kind of assembled, many-particle order is disrupted in favor of a high-entropy exploration of randomized arrangements. The ball has so many escalators to ride that the exploration can continue without limitation to or preference for particular shapes.
For more moderate driving, however, a new kind of opportunity opens up. It is possible, in fairly generic circumstances, for an external drive to be able to activate motion in configurations that are good at absorbing energy, but for that motion to be only marginally energetic, so that many local barriers in the energy landscape might still be too high and steep to overcome. As a result, a selection principle comes to bear: if the system is in a state that is good at absorbing energy from the drive, its motion ranges more widely, and it is more likely to undergo dramatic and perhaps irreversible changes in shape; locales in the configuration space that are bad at absorbing energy do not experience the same tendency to be rearranged, which means that once the system gets into such a state, it is more likely to stay there for a long time.
The way to think about this selection principle in mountaineering terms is to imagine a landscape with many deep ravines that it is possible to become trapped in. If a given ravine corresponds to a highly energy-absorbing state, then there are likely to be powerful escalators that can carry the ball up and over the high passes, and into new and unexplored areas. If, however, a ravine corresponds to a state with very little access to external energy, then such power-assisted lifting is not available. Such a state of affairs can be particularly consequential if a neighboring state is able to access the external energy source. In that case, it becomes possible to get lifted up one side of a mountain and dropped into the ravine on the other side with little hope of ever getting back out.
On top of the basic point that the amount of energy flow available affects how easily a system can change its shape, there is another subtlety worth mentioning that can have quite a great additional impact. So far, we have been talking about drive energy as though it just activated random exploration, but the truth is that the particular way the system is being driven is going to lead to a particular set of responsive motions. This is especially true if the drive itself is of a more patterned and orderly sort, such as an oscillation, as opposed to the noisy unpredictability of thermal fluctuations. In this case, the question of how a system may come to be confined in a particular shape or configuration while being driven is not merely one of how much energy is flowing through, but also of which precise motions in the system are being activated by that energy flow, and whether they are ones that can lead to a large-scale, irreversible rearrangement of things. One can imagine, for example, a situation where a ball is trapped at the bottom of a ravine that is shallow to the east and west, but deep to the north and south. If it so happens that the only ski lifts available in this locale are ones that run in the north-south direction with insufficient strength to reach the top of the ridge, then the ball will stay confined. In other words, a given configuration of matter can sometimes stay stuck in its current arrangement even though a substantial amount of energy flow from external driving may be available—all that is required is for the particular way the system is being driven to happen to push only in directions that are most effectively confined by the internal forces acting among the building blocks.
For a collection of building blocks exploring their space of possible configurations with this kind of bias—such that access to external energy strongly impacts its ability to keep exploring—we can expect to observe a marked tendency to discover and settle into shapes that may be quite atypical in the way they absorb energy from an external drive. It is worth stepping back at this point to restate the selection principle being articulated here and the evolutionary argument that results from it. We start with an inert lump of particles stuck in one shape, and we begin to subject it to a patterned driving of some kind—oscillation of a particular frequency, for example, or stimulation of some subset of chemical components. The energy flowing from the driving force powers an exploration of the space of possible configurations where the matter makes little local moves that change how its constituent parts are assembled relative to each other. If the interactions among the particles give rise to enough novelty through combinations of collective physical properties, then each small rearrangement can lead to changes in how the external drive energy gets absorbed, both in terms of how much energy flows and in terms of the kinds of motion the energy flow activates. As time passes, the system visits more and more states, and eventually it encounters an opportunity to settle into one that is exceptionally good at allowing the matter to stay in the same shape despite the constant physical insults it sustains from the external drive.6 This success at remaining stable in one particular shape or group of shapes is the result of energy absorption that is either sufficiently low, or powers motions that are exceptionally well matched to the assembled structure in ways that keep it from falling apart. Either way, by subjecting inanimate matter to patterned external drives, we ultimately expect to see the spontaneous emergence of a structure with energy flow properties that seem fine-tuned and special compared with those of a random rearrangement of the same building materials.
AFTER SO MUCH ABSTRACTION AND SUPPOSITION, IT HELPS immensely to think about a simple example where it is possible to see the physics we are talking about in action. Before turning our attention to experiments, though, it is useful first to see what can be done in simulations. Remember our hypothesis: that building blocks with diverse possible response properties to a given drive should spontaneously organize themselves to either reduce their energy absorption or direct it into powering orderly, regular motion. In order to test this idea in a given system, we need to have a clear notion of how the current shape of the system controls how energy gets in. In typical experimental settings, sorting this out can be quite complicated, since it is often the case that energy can enter, pass through, and leave a system by multiple routes. In a simulated world, however, it is possible to make very well-controlled assumptions that greatly simplify matters.
We can start, for example, by supposing that we put a collection of particles in a viscous fluid on a flat surface and connect them together with a randomly chosen network of springy bonds. Each bond is unbreakable but has the ability to pop between a longer and a shorter extension, depending on how it gets pulled on by its neighbors. Think of this popping as though it corresponds to an energy landscape with two valleys sitting next to each other: one of them has its nadir at the short bond length, and the other has its nadir at the longer one. Thus, while short bonds and long bonds can sit happily where they are until something pushes on them, a bond of intermediate length is not stable and will soon pop fully open or closed.
As a result of being posited this way, the meshwork has many different ways it might like to resonate and vibrate, depending on which bonds are currently long or short. Indeed, for a system with 30 bonds, there are 230 (roughly a billion) ways. Thus described, we have a toy model that mimics the essential physical features we are after: an assemblage of many particles that has many distinct shapes with accordingly distinct response fingerprints that are determined by the frequencies at which they like to resonate while undergoing different kinds of contortions. It is very easy to write down the equations governing the low-temperature motion of such a tangle; we just use Newton's second law to solve for the effects of the spring forces acting between the particles and the frictional drag force of the fluid acting on every particle as it moves. Left on its own, the only thing such an object is capable of doing is relaxing all of its springs until it gets trapped in some shape where all the internal forces balance and things stop moving. Matters get much more interesting, however, when we pick one of these particles and start wiggling it with an external force. We could drag it around according to some preset path that we want it to traverse at some speed, or we could just push with a force that we allowed to oscillate in time, much as if a sound wave of a certain pitch were impinging and setting the particle in motion.
A system thus described and simulated is ideal for doing computational experiments on the physics of energy flow because there is only one way for new work to be done on the system, and we have exquisite control over it. Thus, the external force of our choosing can push on the driven particle as it moves and give it some new kinetic or potential energy, and then this energy either will get shared around through the rest of the particles, or be dissipated as heat via frictional drag. As a result, the dissipative adaptation argument laid out above should have a clear prediction to make about what our meshwork of springs should do. For an external drive that is strong enough to get bonds to start popping open and closed, the meshwork has the opportunity to explore its vast space of possible states with their different response properties. The selection principle we have claimed for this kind of scenario is one where the system finds and stays in states that absorb less energy from the drive, and that also direct the energy they do absorb into regular motion that looks specially crafted to keep the overall shape of the assemblage stable.
I recently worked with my colleagues Hridesh Kedia, Deng Pan, and Jean-Jacques Slotine at MIT on a paper in which we demonstrated that precisely this kind of selection principle acts on the structure of the meshwork described above when one of its particles is driven with an external force.7 We first examined the case where the force acting on the particle was a simple oscillation of known frequency and strength. In a simulated mechanical system, it is a trivial matter to calculate all the natural resonant frequencies for any given shape as well as the normal-mode motions associated with them. What we found reliably and repeatedly, for a large number of random meshworks studied, is that once driving starts, the bonds gradually rearrange their lengths in order to ensure that all the normal-mode motions that involve the driven particle are particularly bad at resonating with the specific chosen frequency of driving. This means that, after a long time experiencing the forcing of a particular driving environment, the system is expected to be stuck in a rare, exceptional state that is much more robust and stable than would be likely for a random shape.



Initially, a many-particle system in some random starting arrangement has a generic spectrum of frequencies at which it likes to resonate. After being driving with a chosen frequency of forcing (gray line), a network of bistable mechanical bonds self-organizes to resonate less at that frequency, producing a measurable depression in the normal-mode spectrum at a predictable location.







Even more remarkably, the dynamical behavior of the particles turns out to be highly ordered, for although there are several dozen particles, the trajectory they adopt after a long time is highly coordinated. Much like the tip of a bandleader's baton revolving in the air, their motion follows a specific, one-dimensional path through the much higher-dimensional space describing all of the particle positions. When one particle moves a certain way, every other particle obeys a specific choreography in response. And, most significantly of all, perhaps, this orderly motion has measurable consequences for the stability of the system's structure. The motion it undergoes from being driven does involve a constant absorption of energy from the external source, so that the particles can be thought of as being in a more "excited"—or higher-energy—state than if the drive were turned off. However, the way this energy is absorbed during the specific, orderly motion observed is matched to the response properties of the particular shape adopted so that things do not get broken or rearranged by the energy flow.
The way we can tell this is by doing more "experiments." Since we know the amount of energy being absorbed in this adapted state that the system discovered over time by being driven in one environment (that is, with one external drive), we can now ask what happens if we change the environment to a different one that supplies the same amount of energy to the system. For example, we could alter the frequency of the driving force, or the direction it pushes in, and do so in such a way that the amount of work done on the system is the same. In this case, the result is typically that the shape that had adapted in the previous driving environment becomes unstable, and is observed to fall apart, as the system evolves to a new state that is adapted to the new drive. In other words, in a manner very reminiscent of the way living things eat, the orderly motion of the adapted shape has been specially selected to be good at not getting rearranged by energy supplied in a particular form. When the fingerprint of the energy supply changes, we indeed observe that energy to have a more randomizing and destructive influence, at least until the system can go back to the drawing board and discover a newly adaptive form that is suited to the new environment.
At the time of writing this book, the mechanism for fine-tuning we have been delving into in this chapter is a new enough idea that it is still mostly being studied in simulation, where the most precise tests are easiest to carry out. Taking a wider view of experimental evidence, however, we find some very encouraging indications that we are on the right track. Whether in experimental studies performed in the past, in which one can now, in the present, recognize the physical principles of dissipative adaptation at work, or in recent experimental works inspired in part by the new theoretical frame, the number of clear examples of self-organized fine-tuning in driven matter studied in the laboratory is growing. In our penultimate chapter, we will discuss some of these results and point to startling connections with learning and computation that have begun to come to the fore.
FLAME MIRRORS THE FRAGILITY OF LIFE, IN THAT IT IS A process that needs to keep eating regularly so as not to be snuffed out into something cold and motionless. At the same time, the notion of a fragile living thing that survives fire is marvelous to us, because we expect flames to take something carefully constructed and devour it, tearing it to tiny pieces until all that is left is smoke and scattered ash. All forms of energy can cause as much damage as a flame if released in the wrong context, and the real marvel is always that there can be such a thing as the "right" context, where the flow of energy heals and repairs rather than causing damage. In the vision presented to Moses at the burning bush (Ex. 3), the text emphasizes the destructive potential of the very energy flow by which life is sustained. It poses the all-important question of how it is that this particular life (the bush) can withstand a maelstrom that could take so many other orderly structures to pieces. The implicit answer, as we now can realize, is that from the perspective of the living thing, the particular set of driving forces that swirl around it and constantly impinge on it do not look like a flame because they have a pattern to them that the life was born to recognize. Far from a randomizing, disassembling influence, the environment to which an organism is adapted is integral to it; in this sense, every life is on fire, wreathed in that familiar flame which helped coax it into being.

WIND AND BREATH



And the wind of God hovered over the face of waters.

And the Lord God shaped the human out of dust from the ground, and He breathed into his nose a breath of life.
—GENESIS 2:7
IT IS ONE THING TO BUY INTO AN ARGUMENT FOR HOW self-organization might work in the abstract. It is quite another to identify tangible objects in the real world that might be governed by such principles. Aided by the understanding that a bit of theorizing provides, however, we can begin to notice intriguing examples everywhere.
In essence, the idea of dissipative adaptation is that a system made of many pieces accesses energy from an external source differently depending on how those pieces are arranged, but that the energy that is absorbed also has an impact on how the arrangement of the pieces can change over time. Once that cycle of influence goes through multiple iterations, the opportunity arises for the shapes of things to skew strikingly in a direction that reflects the relationship between shape and energy flow in the system at hand. Sometimes, this means developing into a state that looks exceptionally good at grabbing energy, and sometimes it means the opposite: a robust state that is exceptionally skilled at avoiding the rearranging ravages of energy flow. In any case, when approaching things as an experimentalist, the first question is whether analyzing the structure of an evolving nonequilibrium dynamical system reveals one of these telltale signatures.
Spectral hole burning—that is, the frequency-specific extinction of the absorption spectrum of a medium—may be the earliest and most straightforward experimentally observed instance of a smoking gun of the kind we are looking for. Both in the optical properties of solid materials irradiated with lasers and in similar studies carried out in supercooled liquids subjected to time-varying voltages, experimenters were able to measure the tendency for the collective behavior of some large number of interacting atoms to oscillate together at certain particular frequencies.1 They found that after driving the system vigorously at a given frequency, its specific tendency to oscillate at that frequency (or similar ones) was depressed. Though these phenomena have been known for decades—even in contexts as biological as the photosynthetic reaction centers of plant chloroplasts—the many diverse instances of this effect have previously not been understood in one general theoretical framework.2 Though the detailed mechanisms may be different in each type of system, however, it is certainly tempting at present to suggest that the physical commonality linking all of these cases is the role that frequency-dependent energy absorption may play in accelerating the structural change of otherwise slowly moving pieces of the system. With renewed interest in studying these kinds of effects in experiments, it may soon become possible to confirm this hypothesis directly.
A more recent example that is similarly suggestive has come from a photonic engineering lab at the University of California, Berkeley.3 First, researchers took a plastic tube and filled it with a viscous fluid. They then added to the tube a dozen or so plastic particles that floated in the fluid. Finally, they took a loudspeaker and beamed a tone of a certain pitch through the tube, and as the sound impinged on the particles, they drifted along through the fluid from the force of the oscillating pressure waves in the air. Afterward, the spatial arrangement of the particles was analyzed for its ability to act as a medium for the propagation of waves of different frequencies, and it was found that it lacked the ability to transmit waves in a range of frequencies that was pegged to the frequency of the tone that had been played from the loudspeaker. In other words, the system would reliably self-organize into a state with absorption and transmission properties that had been determined by the specific timing of the external forcing. More recently, the same lab was able to demonstrate analogous phenomena with light transmission in photonic crystals whose optical properties changed depending on how much the light they absorbed heated them up.4
The emergence of response properties that depend on the frequency of oscillatory driving in these systems is certainly reason for further investigation, but is not itself proof that the observed effects result from the physics that we suspect. It is worth remembering, though, that we should be looking much more widely for experimental results that may contain the hints of a significant dissipative adaptation effect. Resonance is only one way for a collection of particles to control its access to energy, and there are circumstances where other ways that energy absorption depends on shape can come to the fore. In Chapter 5, we mentioned Janus particles, tiny beads with chemical jet packs that cause them to skate around in directions that gradually drift at random as the beads slowly rotate every which way. It is known that "active matter" particles of this type can condense into a somewhat sensationally named "living crystal" state, in which they are packed together in orderly arrays that can quite suddenly and violently break apart and reassemble.5 The idea that particles initially separate and adrift should form crystals because they have been given a source of random propulsion seems strange until one thinks in terms of how easily the external driving produces motion in the system. When each particle is on its own, it moves rapidly and randomly, as though searching for a new collective state for the system. However, once they are in a crystal, most particles are jammed up against their neighbors and therefore feel a force from the surrounding crowd that averages out to zero over time. In other words, the exceptionally arranged crystalline state is less able to harness chemical energy and turn it into motion than when the particles were all dispersed, and so ends up being the stable state that the system favors.6
Although the puzzle of self-organization in driven matter is not yet fully solved, there is tremendous potential to expand our empirical knowledge of what is possible as well as our theoretical sophistication in understanding it. In the face of so many diversely messy herds of interacting particles with energy coursing through them from different kinds of sources, those of us hoping to identify some unifying principles governing how they organize can feel encouraged. Indeed, the future looks bright in this regard with respect to active matter experiments already being done, and when we begin to think hard about all the scenarios where the process of dissipative adaptation might take place in response to a sophisticated challenge from a patterned environment, it shows even greater potential.
SO FAR, IN DESCRIBING WAYS THAT DRIVEN MATTER CAN adapt strikingly to match an environmental pattern, our focus has been on the what and not the how. A random network of springs can scramble itself into a shape that likes to wobble to a particular rhythm that keeps impinging on it, and we can find that "achievement" remarkable without delving at all into the mechanistic details of why the particular shape in question is disposed to respond to its environment in any particular way.7 In analogy to biology, this is like the difference between knowing a cow can digest grass and understanding the anatomy or biochemistry of how the animal accomplishes such a feat.
At the same time, we have also been talking about examples of dissipative adaptation that exhibit a simple enough version of fine-tuned matching between system and environment that the so-called anatomical question seems to be beside the point. Is it at all interesting to know exactly what it takes to be a jumble of particles that is particularly bad or good at resonating at a frequency of 2.3 Hz? Perhaps to the right kind of curious mind this can still be an intriguing avenue for further study, but the story we have already told of where the physical pressures come from to get this kind of fine-tuning to emerge seems to be more the point.
And yet, it is worth stopping to reflect on how the same kind of process starts to sound if we just push the envelope a bit. When a force varies over time in a simple, periodic way, a great deal of what is going on can be described with a single number measuring the time it takes for the cycle to repeat. By the same token, behaving in a way that matches exceptionally well with such a pattern may be relatively straightforward to achieve: there are lots of structures in the world that exhibit similar timing in the way they like to vibrate. Some patterns, however, are inherently more complicated. Whether we are talking about the digits of pi or the change in average temperature from one day to the next, there are many partly or even totally predictable patterns that might look random at a casual glance. This way of thinking brings us now to puzzling over how we should decide whether a given source of energy is randomizing or not. At either end of the spectrum, we can come up with cartoonish examples that help for grasping the basic concept: wind spins a windmill without breaking it, but an equally energetic bomb will break virtually anything. Still, even when talking in terms of everyday examples, there are slightly subtler ones. Setting fire to gasoline may cause an explosion, but whether that leads to indiscriminate destruction or the orderly turning of the wheel on a car depends entirely on where the gas is and what larger structure it is a part of. Generalizing this idea, we can realize that the degree to which energy flowing into a system can be thought of as a randomizing influence is not merely a property of the energy source on its own, but rather one of the matching between the source and the system it is driving.



Initially, a many-particle system in some random starting arrangement has a generic spectrum of frequencies at which it likes to resonate. When a morass of bungee cords or "catch bonds" gets driven at a chosen driving frequency, resonance becomes self-stabilizing, and the normal-mode spectrum spontaneously rearranges to absorb more energy, by having a peak corresponding to the frequency of the drive.







In an environment that looks random, but isn't, it becomes particularly important to ask what it would mean behaviorally for a clump of driven matter to exhibit an emergent adaptation behavior in the presence of a subtle influence. If inexorable physical principles are biasing the gradual exploration of shape space, so that things have a specialized matching to a pattern whose nonrandomness is hard to discern, that means the dynamics of the matter in question has had to "figure out" something difficult about how to detect the pattern. If we had been given the task of discerning the pattern ourselves, either we would have had to engage in some form of intuition or abstract mathematical manipulation, or we would have had to write a computer program that could use numerical calculation to substitute for those activities. In any event, whether human or artificial, we'd be inclined to say some kind of intelligence was being brought to bear. Here, the question that suddenly confronts us is whether, in the absence of any brain, equation, or algorithm, an emergently fine-tuned assembly of particles can fairly be said to be doing something called computing—or better yet, learning.
Posing the question in this way should remind us of an earlier point, when we asked whether a pond that refreezes after being partly melted is healing or repairing itself. Clearly, for such primitive examples, language like this is loaded and misleading—and the same goes for saying that when a ball rolls down a hillside it is "learning" to lower its altitude. The case we are not considering, though, in leveling that critique is one where optimizing one's relationship to the environment is a much less generic kind of task, and in which the environment is assumed to have a regularity that is not at all obvious. When a collection of matter we have built with our own ingenuity to be a computer behaves in a way that spits out an accurate prediction of a complex signal, we call that computation. If a bunch of particles whose structure we did not design nevertheless engages in behavior that is just as behaviorally successful with respect to the task of prediction, we may well want to refrain from saying it is computing. But if so, we still have to acknowledge that it is doing something just as useful as what computation does.
Consider, for example, the work of Weishun Zhong, David Schwab, and Arvind Murugan carried out at the University of Chicago, where they simulated the equilibrium self-assembly of many grayscale-shaded particles whose interparticle forces had been designed to arrange the particles as pixels in multiple recognizable photographic images (such as a picture of Einstein).8 The authors demonstrated that when such a soup of sticky building blocks got exposed to fragmentary partial remnants of the original image (through some patterned, but static, external forces), the collective was able to reconstruct the whole image by leveraging what little information the fragments contained to select the matching image state and assemble into it. From one perspective, the physics of what went on in this study was always only a very high-dimensional version of a ball rolling downhill (with the fragmentary image clues acting as a way of tilting the energy landscape to help the ball roll the right way). Yet, from another perspective, remembering and reconstructing an image sounds like something useful that we make software do for us. Moving away from thermal equilibrium, in principle, should only expand the playbook available to us in terms of the types of behaviors physically allowed to occur in the system. This possibility immediately raises the question of whether self-organizing, nonequilibrium, many-particle systems might be coaxed into doing various other things that computer programs are good for.
Musings such as these may sound far-fetched, but there are both theoretical and empirical reasons to give them serious consideration. In simulation, we can study the behavior of "messy" many-body systems that we subject to forcing patterns much subtler than simple oscillations, and the results so far show significant promise. Random spin glasses are materials built out of collections of atoms arrayed together in such a way that they interact with their neighbors like tiny bar magnets. Each atom has a north-south arrow that results from the behavior of its electrons, and any one arrow can feel the influence of the other arrows of neighboring atoms. What makes these materials random is that there can be disorder in how the arrows couple: one pair of neighbors might feel a force trying to align their arrows north to north, whereas another pair might be trying to anti-align and match up north to south. In a big jumble of such atoms, it's very hard to satisfy all the forces at once, because the same atom might be pointing up as the result of the influence of one neighbor, but this could be against the direction of a force being exerted by another neighbor. Accordingly, the story of when a given arrow flips, as the system tries to lower its energy, can be complicated and unpredictable.
Experiments on spin glasses have already shown that they exhibit intriguing memory effects: if you cool one down with an external bath whose gradually dropping temperature plateaus for a while at a few different temperatures you have chosen, then the magnetic properties of the material are detectably different at those same chosen temperatures when you warm things back up, as though an echo of the original treatment is stored in the configurations of all the arrows.9 MIT mathematics graduate student Jacob Gold and I picked up on this idea and simulated a random spin glass with a "barcoded" environment that varied over time.10 In addition to the forces acting between atoms, roughly half the atoms were made to feel external forces randomly pushing some arrows up and others down. After a fixed duration, a new set of random forces was generated (i.e., a new barcode), and the configuration of the arrows in the simulated material was allowed to evolve over time.
If the simulation always keeps showing the atoms new random barcodes pushing some arrows up and others down, then the behavior is largely indistinguishable from random thermal fluctuations at a higher temperature than the ambient environment—in other words, it just acts like friction is heating it up. However, things get remarkably different when a limited number of barcodes get shuffled into a deck and then reused over and over again. At each moment, the current barcode is randomly selected without any particular order, but over a longer stretch the same small set of barcodes recurs.
The first—now perhaps unsurprising—thing to notice is that the rate of energy absorption drops over time. Though the barcoded forces initially "look" random to the material, eventually it adapts to the pattern and finds a configuration that absorbs less energy from its environment. What happens, though, if we suddenly introduce a new barcode, never seen before in the history of the system dynamics? Naturally, the rate of energy absorption spikes upward, because the system has not yet adapted to a pattern that includes this novel environmental state as a possibility.



A set of atoms is randomly connected so that atom pairs linked by black edges like to point their magnetic arrows in the same direction (+ +), whereas pairs linked by gray edges like to point their magnetic arrows in the opposite direction (+ -). Each atom also feels an external force trying to push its arrow up (white) or down (black), with the set of such forces recorded in a barcode below.


Let us recap: A messy collection of atoms gets shown a bunch of different forces from the environment, each described with its own unique barcode. Its energy absorption adapts and drops, and now will spike if we poke the system in a new way in which it has not yet been poked. Inadvertently, perhaps, we have built what one might call a novelty detector.
The state of the system after it has adapted embodies an implicit prediction about the future, namely: I expect to see this, this, or this, but not that. In essence, then, the mere fact that these atoms have been poked in a patterned way leads them into a state that appears to have learned to tell the precise difference between something familiar and something new and unexpected. And, interestingly, if we were to design a computer program to make that kind of judgment for us, we might be inclined to call it machine learning.



When a set of barcodes to randomly flip through is chosen, the magnetic arrows on the atoms rearrange, and the rate of work energy absorption declines over time. When a new set of barcodes is introduced into the mix, however, the energy absorption spikes, indicating that the system has spontaneously learned to detect new and unexpected features in its environment.


The past decade has seen tremendous growth in the power and diversity of so-called machine-learning technologies that exhibit flexible capability for discovering accurate ways of computationally modeling complex relationships previously thought to be exclusively the province of the human mind. Facial recognition and language processing are two of the most famous examples, but the common principle in many of these applications is that a long list of numerical parameters describing some way of mapping computational inputs to outputs are trained using large data sets (whether pictures of faces, a corpus of text, or whatever else). In practice, this means that a computer algorithm is trying to search through a very high-dimensional parameter space in order to find a special and exceptional choice of parameters that will enable the computational model to exhibit high-quality matching to the data used for training. This search is typically carried out by programming the parameter coordinates to traverse partly random but biased paths that tend to go downhill over time in a "landscape" whose altitude is defined by some measure of error generated by using the current parameters to map inputs to outputs.
If any of this sounds familiar, it is because the parallels between machine learning of this kind and the mechanism for dissipative adaptation we described in the previous chapter are numerous and significant. An assemblage of many particles has a shape or structure that is described by a high-dimensional space of possible arrangements, much the same way that a machine-learning training algorithm has a high-dimensional space of modeling parameters that determine the way it maps inputs to outputs. A machine learner is trying, over time, to change its parameters so as to reduce an error function that measures how badly it models relationships in the training data; a driven mechanical system that is gradually reducing its rate of energy absorption does so by intricately changing its shape so as to modify the way it responds to and moves with the external forcing. Moreover, just as a machine learner maps observed inputs to calculated outputs, a driven mechanical system maps the input of external forces into the outputs of dynamical behavior. Does this mean we want to say that all driven, many-particle assemblies are doing a form of machine learning? Probably not, unless we expand the definition of the term excessively. However, in a side-by-side comparison, it is apparent that the mathematical structure of what is going on in each case is similar on multiple scores, which suggests there may be an as-yet-unexplored spectrum of possibilities that could lie somewhere in between these two poles, and look like an evolving jumble of building blocks that compute something useful as they disperse and reassemble.
Fanciful though such an idea may sound, the experimental indications along these lines are already surprisingly concrete and promising. Several years ago, a research group at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich made a standing leap forward by taking a comically bizarre complex dynamical system and showing that its behavior could be repurposed for solving systems of nonlinear differential equations.11 The experimental apparatus consisted of a tank of water with some synthetic octopus arms dangling into it. The soft silicone arms were riddled with motion sensors and connected at their base to a mechanical actuator that could move according to a programmed pattern. For an arbitrary external forcing determined by the motion of the actuator, the arms would flop every which way, executing seemingly random and unpredictable maneuvers determined by the complex interaction of their own bendy properties with the sometimes turbulent swirling of the fluid around them. No one on Earth purports to be able to predict what the arms in this system will do when a given pattern of forcing is brought to bear, but the researchers who built the apparatus tried to use this zany setup as a computer.
Solving nonlinear differential equations is computationally costly, but it can be done with the right program. In this study, the following question was posed: Can the octopus arms compute something for us that will make solving such a system of differential equations easier? Every time the researchers gave the system a particular pattern of forcing as input, they recorded the observed dynamics as output. They then fed the same pattern as input to a computer program that solved a complicated system of nonlinear differential equations. Finally, they demonstrated that through a simple mathematical mapping described by only a few parameters, it was possible to transform the motion of the octopus arms into the behavior of the solution of the same nonlinear differential equation system. In other words, rather than using a costly algorithm on a normal computer to solve the equations, one could just feed the same input into a messy water tank of tangling tentacles, and then harvest the correct answer from the resulting physical dynamics using a much simpler computation. Through the right lens, the conclusion unavoidably seems to be that the free physical dynamics of an untrained mess was computing something for us about the patterns in its environment, and the only question is whether we are clever enough to know how to extract the result.
AFTER ALL THIS TALK OF THE PHYSICS OF LIFELIKENESS, it has to be acknowledged that there has been suspiciously little discussion of biology. To be sure, it is fascinating to realize that a whole host of systems made of many interacting components may have the capacity to resemble life in specific ways that we would never notice if we did not know to analyze their physical properties in the right manner. Still, when the sense of marvel fades a bit, we might justifiably be left wondering what any of that has to do with the inner workings of things that actually are alive. It is one thing to say a pile of particles that exhibits dissipative adaptation is computing something and predicting its world, but, to put it bluntly, at what point does that lead to getting things like DNA, and cells, and hands? For that matter, is there anything still going on in living things that we can understand better in light of this way of thinking? By studying the patterns of variation in the sequence of bases in the DNA of various related organisms, phylogeneticists can make a compelling case for the common ancestry of different species; if dissipative adaptation helped get life going, would it leave any similar trace in the way living things are built?
The first thing to say is something that has come up already, which is that looking at evolution from the standpoint of thermodynamics does not replace the role played by natural selection in a Darwinian view of things. Rather, it just sees such processes as special cases of a potentially more general class of physical phenomena. If you have self-copying things (like living organisms capable of reproduction) in your system, then their ability to create copies of themselves is directly linked to their ability to absorb work energy, whether that be by eating or by soaking up sunlight. This means that, to whatever extent natural selection may help to explain things about how life has developed highly refined adaptations during the whole grand saga of its proliferation and diversification over the course of time, there is no additional explanatory power granted by translating that set of events into the language of work-energy influx and heat dissipation. Put another way, Darwinian evolution through natural selection is quite clearly an instance of dissipative adaptation; however, in cases where the evolutionary biology we already understand serves as a good guide, the physics side of that story does not steal the spotlight. We do not exhaust what can be understood by talking exclusively about the thermal energy released from the fish a dolphin eats and digests; it is still an important, separate point made in a different language to recognize that parent dolphins with better fins get to eat more fish and can therefore pass those fins on to more calves.
There are at least two respects, though, in which thinking about dissipative adaptation may offer a new kind of opportunity for biological understanding in settings where we need this new physical description to help us identify something going on that the Darwinian language does not capture. The first of these has nothing to do with the origins of life and everything to do with how life works now, in the present day. Every living cell is packed full of millions of proteins, and each one of these tiny molecular machines is itself made up of many amino acids that are strung together like beads on a cord. The exact way that the cord of one protein chain gets crumpled up in three-dimensional space determines many of its physicochemical properties: what it sticks to, which things it chemically reacts with, and so on. And, in general, any given protein may change its shape as the result of other proteins being stuck to its surface or of chemical fuels that it absorbs energy from as it reacts with and burns through them.
The question is, what does this kind of herd behavior look like? The classic way of thinking in biochemistry is to attribute specific functions to particular proteins that have to do with their interactions with a few other specific partner proteins they will randomly encounter in the well-mixed cellular interior. However, we have just been discussing the possibility that any such strongly driven collective of different macromolecular building blocks might be spurred by dissipative adaptation effects to exhibit group-level behaviors that have solved global energy flow problems in ways that may amount to computing something nontrivial about the external environment. This conception of cell behavior has more in common with an economist's understanding of the free market than it does with an engineer's understanding of the blueprint of a skyscraper: suddenly, there is room for a lot more spontaneous creativity and adaptive capability in the system's behavior.
From this perspective, we should be asking whether there is spatial order at the molecular level in cells that might be highly specialized, and if so, whether the cell makes use of this spatial order in ways that would seem relevant to biological function. The fact that all the properties of cells have been subject to selection at the level of their parent organisms' ability to reproduce means that part of biology always turns into a Darwinian discussion. But is all cellular function a discovery of natural selection, or might some of it be a bit more spontaneously self-organized? The question is particularly pertinent, as a whole host of new adaptive and flexible intracellular "droplet" structures are being discovered of late that reveal a breathtaking ability for proteins to reorganize themselves in space in ways customized to the demands of the occasion. It is too early to make this connection rigorous, but one does wonder whether nonequilibrium statistical thermodynamics may at some point help to put our theoretical understanding of subcellular architecture on firmer footing.
We also have to bear in mind that structures optimized for one purpose often turn out to be useful for other ones. I recall as a child hearing the eminent evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould give a public lecture in which he talked about the idea of "evolutionary spandrels," which are forms in nature whose current use suggests a misleading account of the selection pressure that helped them to emerge. In the lecture, he presented the striking example of a species of flightless African bird that used its wings to shade the water it waded in, so as to see the fish better.12 Although it is hard to show that this must be true in general, it certainly appeals to common sense that many of the things we think of as functional successes in architecture might easily have been achieved by repurposing an assemblage of matter that was not originally optimized with that purpose in mind. Accordingly, the mere fact that the effects of dissipative adaptation have already been felt in optimizing the organization of a motley collective of parts with respect to energy flow may already imply that it has become potentially useful for a broader range of applications.
Doubling down on these speculations, we may as well also wonder idly about how this potential for eventually useful self-organization could have played out before cellular life got going. As we have said, fingers and toes do not need thermodynamics to explain them, because we imagine them in any case coming eons after there already was highly developed life. But what about DNA, that magnificent molecule whose code-like structure makes the assembly of life's nanomachinery possible? It is exceedingly difficult to imagine being able to prove anything definitive about what must have happened so long ago, but on this score dissipative adaptation can at least awaken us to how little we know about something as simple as the order of events. We tend to talk about DNA—and its cousin, RNA—as being the beginning of everything, because we discovered them as messages that get copied and translated: the whole reason anyone knew DNA mattered in the first place was that it had been established that it was the heritable material, the molecule needed for genetic traits to be passed from one generation to the next. What is less frequently noted is that DNA is also a highly stable and centralized coordinating molecule: within a single cell, the relatively few atoms of the DNA barely ever change, and they exert massive influence on the behavior of a much larger number of atoms making up the rest of the cell's dry weight. If you change a few dozen atoms in the DNA of one cell, you might give the whole organism cancer and ultimately kill it, whereas changing a thousand or so protein atoms in one cell could easily go unnoticed in any biological sense. DNA is the master controller, and in that light, it is notable that dissipative adaptation predicts the emergence of a slow subset of features in a driven collective that exhibit outsize influence on the faster dynamics of the remaining particles. This does not prove where DNA came from, but should at least make us pause to ask whether the precursor to DNA must have first emerged as a coded message, as we often imagine, or if it was more like a molecular brain governing some precellular structure that was not yet capable of copying itself. Identifying opportunities of this kind may leave many questions open for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, it should simultaneously instill in us both new excitement about yet-to-be-dreamed-of possibilities for how things might have gone and a greater humility about what we might previously have rushed to declare impossible.
WE USUALLY CANNOT SEE THE AIR; VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING else in our experience of the world feels more substantive, definite, and visible. Breath and wind therefore slip easily into the role of standing for the totally immaterial in our minds. Air is material, though, albeit perhaps much less predictably or accountably so than the clunky objects we can pick up with our hands. Its touch can be devastatingly forceful when storms blow through, and even in more minor ways, it constantly tips the scales here and there to influence the course of events great and small. When snow or leaves get pulled up in a swirling gust, we suddenly glimpse the complex and multifaceted nature of the motion involved, and even may appreciate that a vast list of numbers would be needed to summarize what the wind is doing in any given place and time. Perhaps more importantly, such glimpses give us the chance to appreciate both the seeming randomness and the larger-scale correlated order that can exist in a single flow of air extended over space on various scales. Almost unavoidably, wind provokes us to ask how many of the world's events could turn out decisively differently if just a few more of the seemingly random swirls of turbulence happened to all push in the same direction at one crucial moment. Put another way, confronted by regular arrays of clouds and dunes that are borne with ease from a steady breeze in one direction, we have to wonder what kinds of shapes the wind might be able to help form and enliven if it only puffed and howled with a sufficiently complex pattern.
The thought of hidden structures bearing information on the wind unavoidably carries our thoughts in the direction of an oft-neglected aspect of breath: namely, that it allows us to smell things in our environment. Olfaction is such a remarkable sense because of how specific, holistic, and instantaneous it is in the kind of recognition it provides. Smells are typically composites, made up of many separate influences that strike our noses at once, and yet we somehow relate to the experience of an aroma first and foremost as a whole that is not easily reducible to its parts. Moreover, each separate smell somehow has the potential to leave such an impression of reality in our minds that we can have an unmistakable sense of recognition, like the matching of a fingerprint or the scanning of a barcode. Wind and breath stand for the most mysterious aspect of what life is, not because they do not form a material part of it, but because some of the material world hides its organization in the correlations of the many variables being observed, sensed, or experienced simultaneously. Life comes into being by rising to the challenges presented by the world around it, but to be aware of the subtlest challenges out there, one has to be able to sniff out the complex predictability that may be hiding in plain sight.

VOICE AND WORD



And a messenger appeared in the midst of a fire.
—EXODUS 3:2
OUR EXPLORATIONS OF BIOLOGY AND PHYSICS HAVE CARRIED us some distance since we first set out, to the point where one could almost lose track of the question that launched this whole journey in the first place. In fact, it is even fair to say that the new understanding we have developed over the course of these pages argues for a different way of posing the question. Before, we might have asked, "Does physics explain how life could have begun?" But a more precise formulation may get closer to the essence of things: "What physical conditions are needed for lifelike behaviors to emerge reliably in matter where they were initially absent?"
By way of trying to provide an answer, we have built up a collection of different concepts. We started by noting that biological and physical ways of talking constitute two different languages for addressing the same phenomena, and it is important to keep track of which of these languages one is speaking. This realization allowed us to identify a number of distinct physical properties that are strongly associated with being alive, and to see that it may help to study them separately in order to gain insight into the physics involved. In order to define these properties more clearly, however, we had to consider the difference between microscopic and coarse-grained behaviors in collections of particles, and how the rarity and diversity of those behaviors are determined by the interactions of microscopic pieces, which can be assembled in myriad ways. The exploration of this space of possible ways that matter can be assembled then turned out to be a process best understood in terms of the flow of energy through the matter in question—specifically, how the structure of the matter influences how energy gets absorbed, deployed, and dissipated. Ultimately, it is this relationship—between how energy flows, on the one hand, and how the medium it flows through becomes transformed by it, on the other—that explains the emergence of structures that recapitulate a number of different behaviors that we associate with the distinctive qualities of a living organism. This kind of effect may be especially striking in cases where sources of energy exhibit a subtle pattern that gives rise to a correlative subtlety in the resulting structure.
In tandem with all of this, though, we have also discovered something else. As I wrote at the beginning of this book, trying to understand where life might have come from impels us to start a conversation whose scope is far broader than mere physics. In order for me to have a chance of finding my way around such a conversation, it is both a practical necessity and a matter of personal conviction for me to root the discussion firmly in the interpretation of biblical text, so that is what I have done here. Thus, in a way that runs starkly counter to how the Hebrew Bible is usually viewed vis-à-vis its relationship to natural science, we have seen how particular passages in the text express a strikingly rich appreciation for numerous concepts from which we ended up weaving together the story of lifelike behaviors in the language of physics. Of course, the Bible is not in any way, shape, or form a compendium of physics knowledge, and undoubtedly it speaks its own distinct language(s). However, in its characteristic fashion of addressing itself principally to the qualitative features of everyday experience that are familiar to a technically unsophisticated audience, scripture turns out to contain a dense and multifaceted commentary on what the material basis of life is, described using a language in which most regular people are fluent. The staff and serpent point out that the same thing can look different depending on how one talks about it. The snowy skin provokes us to think about boundaries between categories, as well as between living things and their surroundings, and reminds us that complicated structures can get assembled from simpler parts that condense together. Equating river muck with blood lifts our sights to the diversity of possible outcomes when different material ingredients are kept in perpetual motion, and the swordsmith's forge reminds us how piles of matter get knocked into new situations in ways that can depend strongly on their current one.
As I have said at the outset, the point here is not to claim that an ancient and sacred text secretly "explains" all the technical details of recently discovered physical theories from our current era. In one sense, it certainly does not, insofar as the real content of these theories has to be expressed in a language of unambiguous equations that the Bible emphatically is not trying to speak. We should bear in mind, though, that the book in your hands is not a technical work, either. Rather, it is an attempt to translate some specialized ideas from physics into terms more broadly accessible, and to that extent, reading scripture in the way we have been doing helps show that the same conceptual backbone may be surprisingly available to the reasoned intuition of a person who contemplates the different phenomena of nature deeply enough.
The question of how to think about what life is, from this perspective, is not an arbitrarily selected slice of what can be understood about the world by thinking like a physicist. Some aspects of what physics has revealed to us may be very well established as scientific discoveries yet also operate in a realm totally divorced from the empirical experience of a normal person. Quantum mechanics is a beautiful theory that offers stunning successes in its predictions about, for example, the absorption and emission of light by gases of different kinds of atoms and molecules. General relativity is a similarly magnificent tour de force of abstract mathematics that can start by contemplating the possibility of light bending as it travels through space and wind up explaining why Newtonian calculations get some planetary motions slightly wrong. Practically speaking, though, an ordinary individual's ability to relate directly to these accounts of the natural world amounts to zilch, because such theories address themselves to phenomena that only become detectable once we start looking at the numbers coming out of some exquisitely engineered apparatuses and sifting things very finely.
The natural phenomenon of life is the polar opposite of abstract and otherworldly things like quantum tunneling and gravitational waves. Every person who has ever thought much about what life is also happens to be very much alive, and is therefore constantly privy to an extremely rich stream of sensory data about what life consists of. Now, of course, living things, too, comprise hidden worlds of molecular events that do not come into view until we take things into the laboratory and get very technical, but even so, it is frequently the case that there are things we can appreciate at the organismal level that parallel whatever is going on invisibly on the tiniest scales. We may not know much about our own DNA without help from modern techniques of molecular biology, for example, but it is an utter commonplace that parents pass traits like hair color and height on to their children. Similarly, we may not be able to see oxygen atoms hopping on board the hemoglobin proteins in our bloodstream when we inhale, but we certainly appreciate what kind of danger it is to stop being able to breathe.
There is also a further sense in which the physics most relevant to the emergence of lifelike behaviors is not fantastical and counterintuitive in the manner that some physics can be. In the present day, a cosmological theorist telling a popular audience about what kinds of particles were permitted to exist during different epochs spanning minuscule fractions of a second after the big bang frequently winds up sounding like a charismatic mystic addressing potential members of a newly founded cult. This happens not (one would hope) because of any intention by the scientist to lead the gathered listeners into some psychedelic abyss, but simply because there is nothing whatsoever in the empirical experience of everyday life that can substantiate or falsify a single thing that is being said. The inside baseball of exactly how this fundamental particle causes that fundamental particle to weigh more or less is, in truth, an entirely technical matter that is really about making a bunch of different highly precise and specialized measurements consistent with each other. It may be possible to couch the eventual explanation in metaphorical terms that try to make the mathematical discussion more accessible (since a normal person does get to see waves splashing back and forth between boats in a harbor, etc.), but the vividness of such metaphors does nothing to scratch the utter inaccessibility to most people of the debate over what makes these kinds of descriptions of the world more or less correct.
As the reader may have noticed in this book, however, we have by and large been talking a lot about things that one frequently trips over while out for a walk. When a ball rolls down a hill and then stops, the physics involved is absolutely the same as what we imagine for one of our metaphorical balls exploring some more complicated landscape. When a turbulent ocean wave crashes through a sandcastle, the seemingly random way in which the sand grains get tossed about is a fair enough approximation of how a protein might thermally jiggle to randomly change its shape over time. And when several water molecules stick together in a condensing liquid, it is not at all unreasonable to liken that to what may occur in a pile of knobbly magnetic toys jumbled on the floor by a toddler. Of course, in various fine details, all of these comparisons are inexact, and that is why we do not use toddler trinkets to make quantitative predictions about the physicochemical properties of water. Nonetheless, when it comes to how clumping particles with energy flowing through them can get assembled, the empirical intuition that we get from living in this world of window frost and tangled keychains is the same essence that sits at the heart of any more technical understanding of the subject. Being well versed in the natural sciences may help in talking precisely about these kinds of processes, and in devising good tests for well-articulated hypotheses, but the experts still must tread carefully; too much of what lies behind the physics of lifelikeness is just a peculiarly neglected variety of common knowledge.
The upshot is that common knowledge does not have to be expressed using multivariable calculus and differential equations, and so we certainly would be foolish to expect the Bible to speak to us in such terms. The mathematical formulations of thermodynamics or Newton's laws are highly specific ways of talking that date to particular, transformative moments in intellectual history. In contrast, the manifold qualitative differences of frost, fire, and mud are truths that any individual has had the chance to experience personally, ever since humans were human. These are the much more universal terms and conceptual touchstones that might be used to take up the subject of life's material basis in a way that seeks to be timeless. And inasmuch as the question of what life is made of may matter greatly to how one ponders the human condition as a whole, it suddenly seems obvious that the Bible should be not only able, but even eager, to provide a comment.
What kind of comment, though? A contemporary reader might be forgiven for becoming so entranced by current debates raging about "religion and science" that it seems interesting enough for biblical text to prove its intelligence on the matter of where life comes from. We hear so often that "faith" entails rejection of the truths uncovered by scientific reasoning that we might make the mistake of thinking the Bible's main goal in this discussion should be to defend itself successfully against the accusation that it is ignorant of incontrovertible facts about what the world is. Granted, it is a bit interesting to unearth evidence that the text's conceptual sophistication in regard to the material basis of life is greater than it might first have seemed, and not so misaligned with what a scientific account might say. Still, if this were the whole point, we would be left to ask what the Hebrew Bible accomplishes by talking this way. If there is some essay on natural philosophy hidden in its verses, then why cloak this understanding in cryptic poetry when the same ideas could be put more directly? Moreover, is it not a bit disappointing for the big reveal to merely be that scripture comes somewhat closer than expected to saying what science still says perfectly well? Does science remain the pinnacle toward which all other forms of understanding must strain?
Resolving this tension requires remembering what the Bible is for. It goes without saying that Moses and the other Hebrew prophets were not trying to compile a textbook, or an almanac, or any other repository of arbitrary and possibly useful facts. The unrelenting objective of the text, from start to finish, is to call the Israelite nation and humankind more broadly to the worship and service of God. Through this lens, what a reader discovers is that any subject matter taken up—whether in law, narration, song, or any other genre that appears in those pages—is trying to teach both individuals and nations about how to find meaning in life by living it with righteousness. What, then, is the purpose of talking about the materials and natural phenomena that hold the keys to what makes life possible? The treatment of such a topic may serve multiple ends, but certainly one of these must be to answer one of the most widely repeated, compelling, and sensible arguments for why life is meaningless and devoid of any value whatsoever.
Living things die, and when they do, they fall apart into constituent pieces that individually seem quite inconsequential. Long before human beings possessed any of the specialized knowledge of biology, chemistry, or physics that we now have, it must have been clear as day to any thoughtful person that his or her own body was built at least partly from stuff that becomes as lifeless as the rocks and sand underfoot when separated from the whole. The Hebrew Bible certainly does not shrink from making precisely this point ("You are formed from dust, and to dust you will return," God says in Genesis 3:19), but the ancients offer plenty of other accounts of humanity's beginnings that reference some version of this idea, imagining the human being to be a figure crafted from stone or clay. Moreover, this basic realization, which has been part of the bedrock of human experience throughout time, is bound to be a bit disturbing to some. Individual particles of dust and inanimate grit are unavoidably treated as the closest things to nothing at all, like insignificant fragments of garbage that belong to no one and can be dealt with arbitrarily by anyone. Confronting this comparison, many people might find themselves wondering a little bit why currently living piles of dust have to be treated so differently than other, less vital, more jumbled collections of the same building materials. Indeed, Abraham may have been expressing an angstier sentiment than mere humility when he said to God, "I am dust and ashes" (Gen. 18:27).
The more modern and technical version of this same kind of philosophical discomfort is only slightly more complicated. One starts by looking at the world as a physicist does, in terms of the locations and velocities of all the different particles out of which things are made. Zooming in on one particle at a time, it never seems to be a particle's fault that it is over here and moving to there, nor does it seem to be particularly meaningful, and this is the case regardless of whether its motion is completely predictable or partly random. Both in a living thing and in an ash heap, there may be the same general laws governing how the different pieces interact with each other. Particles bounce off of other particles, some stick together, some break apart: so what? If the microscopic physical description looks like the blind whim of chance or the unfeeling action of an automaton following simple, amoral rules, how can it be that one sort of collision of many particles could have so much more moral significance than any other? The physical description purports to encompass everything that exists within one, totalizing framework, and when it does so, meaning and moral value seem to vanish from the scene. Were they never more than illusions, or did the physics get something wrong?
There is a common kind of answer offered here that is frequently held up as the position of the Hebrew Bible, and, it should be admitted, arguably it is the position of much of what might be called biblical religion. The standard resolution of the problem is that physics is a theory of the behavior of the material universe, but the world has spiritual dimensions as well that operate according to their own logic. If human beings were just bags of meat and bones—so the thinking goes—then it would be fair to say their stories would not matter more than those of rocks and glaciers. However, in addition to bodies, people have souls, and it is this intrinsically divine and spiritual aspect of human existence that automatically injects value and meaning into the tangible vessel provided by physics and biology. It is not the objective of this book to get into the details of how souls are talked about in different kinds of religious traditions, which certainly must vary tremendously, even if we only restricted our discussion to different streams within Judaism and Christianity. Our only concern at the moment is how the text of the Hebrew Bible itself treats the subject of what is sometimes called "spirit," and whether this treatment is consistent with a bright separation between physical and spiritual realms.
As one may already anticipate from some of the commentary in the previous chapter, the answer almost certainly is a resounding no. Far from providing any kind of primer in the difference between physical and spiritual materials, the biblical text repeatedly indicates an opposite attitude by making the distinction as ambiguous as possible. Any apparent reference to supposedly spiritual things involves the use of an everyday Hebrew word—e.g., wind, breath, vapor, smoke, steam, cloud, fog—that always has clear natural and material correspondents. It may well be the case that in some instances, the use of these terms aims to describe something imperfectly through analogy to something more ordinary; thus, the "fierce easterly wind" that split the Sea of Reeds might have blown more birds off course than the "wind of God" that gave Joseph, son of Jacob, his great insight (Ex. 14:21; Gen. 41:38). Still, nothing in the text suggests unequivocally that the more extraordinary version of wind being talked about in the latter case has a less material basis than the breezes that move sailboats across the water. Though some may wish to read that notion into things as a way of giving Joseph's genius a mystical explanation, it is equally reasonable to suppose the reference to the idea of wind just means to bring in windy connotations of a largely invisible tempest of different colliding activities—qualities that should sound quite familiar to anyone who has puzzled a bit over how the mind works in a material sense.
It is fair to ask as well whether a mystical explanation should count as an explanation at all. Dividing the whole of creation into physical and spiritual domains simply begs the question of how these two kinds of things are supposed to interact, and what can possibly be known about the way spiritual things are supposed to work. If spiritual things do not behave in knowable and predictable ways, then their introduction in a description is a purely magical one that simply aims to shut down attempts to understand. On the other hand, if spiritual things do have a separate natural order to them from the physical, then their study amounts to a kind of dualism that essentially rejects the unity of God that the biblical text declares so vehemently and repeatedly. And, perhaps most importantly, for a person worried that life is teetering on the brink of not mattering or meaning anything, the reassurance that spiritual occurrences can make up the difference does suspiciously little to teach anything about where meaning and value come from. What is the soul, exactly, if the mere fact of its being there can successfully imbue everything with ultimate significance while never having to explain at all what is being signified?
Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, then, we find ourselves in the position of saying that although Hebrew scripture most certainly does aim to push back against the nihilism that can spring from contemplating life's material makeup, it resists the temptation to wave the problem away by invoking the idea of dualistic spirituality. Instead, within the very same signs given to Moses at Horeb that we have already been using to ponder in qualitative terms how life gets assembled, it also weaves a parallel commentary on how to react to this biophysical perspective. A staff that becomes a serpent, skin that becomes snowy, Nile mud that is blood, and a blazing tree that never burns up—we have shown how each of these wonders evokes something of the boundary between the biological and the physical. Reading them in the broader context of the Five Books of Moses, however, we can now see whole new aspects of their meaning come to the fore.
The narrative setting for the display of marvels that God demonstrates to Moses is a conversation about freeing the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Already from this one detail, the scene is set by counterposing the idea of enslavement—which reminds one of mechanistic obedience to physical laws—against a chance at liberation—a condition in which individuals get to make their own choices about how to live. Somehow, these signs are supposed to light the way from a sense of constraint and servitude to one of agency and fulfillment, in a manner that seems quite precisely to anticipate the despondence of a person who has become convinced that human beings are just jiggling piles of tiny marbles. Interestingly, the reference to the actual enslavement of people to an Egyptian pharaoh is not irrelevant to the discussion, since ideologies that refuse to acknowledge the intrinsic value of the individual person are much more likely to use men and women as beasts of burden or sacrificial pawns in some grand, coercive project. Looking at things this way, one might suddenly notice that sending Moses on a mission of liberation may even require teaching him how to argue against the dehumanizing slant of some versions of physical materialism.
The way God teaches him is with the signs, starting with the stick that turns into a snake. What we now have to remember is that the first serpent to appear in the Bible slithers onto the scene in the Book of Genesis, when man and woman are living together in the Garden of Eden. In that setting, this wily and talkative reptile is famously responsible for tempting the woman into eating a fruit that had been forbidden by God. Unavoidably, therefore, the serpent that gets presented to Moses recalls at least two things: first, that a seemingly mute part of nature might turn out to have something meaningful to say, and second, that people are capable of choosing to do things that their Creator wants them not to do. The serpent's appearance is telling us that there is sometimes meaning to be found in what might at first seem meaningless, and moreover, that questions of moral significance about what one should do—as opposed to what one merely could do—can form a part of this meaning.
Insofar as we understand the role of the serpentine staff in this way, it is notable that this point was already almost clear to us from the way we read the sign in a purely biophysical context as part of the discussion in an earlier chapter. The shifting of perspectives from a world of inanimate implements and materials (the staff) to one of living organisms with unpredictable agency (the snake) is certainly useful enough as a way of calling our attention to the difference between physical and biological ways of thinking scientifically, and the need to be careful about translating between these languages. Situating the serpent within its narrative context, however, makes the point an even weightier one, for the idea now would seem to be that physical materials are not devoid of moral meaning; instead, just as an observer can choose to make use of biological language to describe something true about the system that is harder to express in physical terms, so, too, can he or she make a similar choice that opens the door to moral meaning.
Where does it come from, though? The serpentine sign may point in general terms to the possibility of meaning being available, yet there still remains the burning question of how we find out what it is in detail. The remaining two signs given to Moses complete the argument, and to see how, it is easier to start with the third one. As we pointed out previously, blood unavoidably evokes the idea of holism. Seeing the entire organism as a unified, single phenomenon that stands above the motley assortment of simpler parts already goes some distance to establishing that something in the system can matter in a way that rises above a narrow list of its physical properties. What clinches the point, however, is the image of blood spilled onto the dry ground, a picture that unavoidably harkens back to Cain and Abel, when the ground is cursed for "opening its mouth" to receive the blood of one brother from the hand of another. The inclusion of the Nile further brings in the association of infanticide, since Pharaoh had so many infant Hebrew boys flung into the river at the start of Exodus. Murder, and human bloodshed more generally, are the brightest examples of occurrences that impress us with significance that goes beyond their material basis, and by the same token, they are activities some people might find easier to carry out once they have convinced themselves that the human form is indistinguishable from other clumps of dust. The sign of blood therefore reminds us of the stakes of the conversation.
At the center of this sequence of three signs is the one that is most arcane and easily overlooked, namely, that of the snowy and afflicted skin. Though our discussion of its biophysical aspects may already have us thinking that this wonder somehow pertains to the delineation of boundaries, its obscure and seemingly arbitrary details present a puzzle. Remarkably, though, tracing the thread of this peculiar effect through its various appearances in the Levitical law, we can quickly discover that it is the keystone that holds the other two signs aloft. For both the blood and the serpent may leave us asking how the whole idea of morality and transgression are supposed to be established in the first place. It is all very well and good to say one can recognize moral dimensions by looking at things from a certain perspective, but how does one learn to do so? It comes very easily to a moral person to see a difference between mud and blood, but how can one argue against an amoral spoiler who insists that mud is all there is?
The affliction revealed to Moses is sometimes mistranslated as leprosy, but it is best to refer to it by its Hebrew name, tzara'at, because in truth the term refers to a state of "half-[deadness]" that has no analog or equivalent outside the bounds of the biblical description. Tzara'at is discussed at length in the Book of Leviticus because of its importance to laws of ritual purity: there are procedures for identifying tzara'at, for isolating people whose bodies have been struck by it, for determining whether it has gone away, and for bringing the person whose affliction has ended back into the community. A quite intricate system of ritual procedures is elaborated at each stage: only a priest may identify it, and he must use highly specific criteria based on the appearance of whatever lesion or abnormality caught someone's attention in the first place; if the priest decides tzara'at is present, the afflicted party is excluded and sequestered in various ways for seven days, and ultimately, a ritual of purification involving birds and plants and fire is performed.
Those looking for a medical or physical equivalent of tzara'at will struggle and remain unsatisfied. It is not a dermatological phenomenon; indeed, it seeks to be the opposite of that: tzara'at arguably is introduced in the biblical law in order to provide the ultimate example of legal-fiction-as-reality—if you make a coherent set of criteria and procedures for judging and reacting to the world a certain way, then you have given expression to a new dimension of what the world is. Physical reality is assessed by one set of procedures, and medical reality by another. Moreover, both of these assessments are mutually translatable, to some degree, because they found themselves on similar kinds of scientific approaches to observation. Tzara'at offers a starkly different way of talking about the world, which is inherently more subjective (since only a priest may identify it) and inherently more social (since the same law that defines tzara'at requires that one who exhibits it be treated differently than other people). This new way of talking about skin directly takes up the question of what a normal or abnormal boundary of the human body looks like, but does so specifically in order to articulate a biblical layer of experience that is completely absent from descriptions of reality that natural science can provide.
There is plenty more that could be said about tzara'at in its own right, but for our purposes, the interesting point is that it is presented in the center of Moses' encounter at the burning bush. As we have already seen, the other signs simultaneously evoke both biophysical and other dimensions, but they leave us wondering how we are supposed to incorporate both of these ways of viewing the world into a coherent whole. In the eye of this storm of disparate concepts, tzara'at seeks to be the example that solves the puzzle. On the one hand, it roots itself in the empirical observation of a living thing and its tactile and visual properties; on the other, tzara'at's only concern is the application of human judgment and the regulation of human activity within the context of specific assigned roles. The point is: one does not do this thing or that thing because of what tzara'at already is (in the way that one would quarantine ill people to prevent a spreading infection because of what a virus is). Rather, the things one does and says, according to the rules of the game, provide the only definition of what tzara'at is: the pivotal concept in a complex social framework of practices.
In the present era, it is common to hear the distinction made between unchangeable material realities, like gravity and cancer, and pure constructions of social cooperation, like debt and divorce. Moreover, we increasingly tend to give the first group more weight in some sense of their ultimate authority; the reading goes that human games are malleable and arbitrary, but natural facts are natural facts. When the conversation turns to things like murder, though, many of us feel stuck, because the ultimate crime seems to cry for ultimate significance, yet the whole idea of what murder is looks more like another legal "fiction" than a manifestation of natural law. Put in other terms, it is common for us to prefer to think that the reason we forbid and punish murder is because of something intrinsically objectionable about what it naturally is, rather than to say it is just another contrivance like marriage or taxes. The idea of tzara'at gives us the tools to look at this issue with a fresh set of eyes. Away from the emotional extremes that death and bloodshed understandably bring us to, we are presented with an example of a different concept whose definition similarly cares both about the state of a physical body and about how people speak to and treat each other. Murder works precisely this way, because its occurrence not only requires us to talk about what is alive and what is not, but also demands certain behaviors from people depending on who is said to have caused whom to die. When the blood on the ground at Moses' feet recalls the slaughter of Abel by the hand of Cain, the all-important question is why this situation "cries out" in a way that mere mud cannot, so that the moral layer to our reality can seem so firm and undeniable. What tzara'at helps to point out is how the so-called value of human life is not a fact we assume at the outset in order to know why we should act in certain ways; instead, the way in which we insist on speaking and acting (whether that be behaving differently because of a priest's declaration about someone's skin, or catching and arraigning murderers) serves to establish the meaning of our existence. Put another way, our humanity gains value and meaning to the extent that we work together in an agreed-upon way to treat it as valuable and meaningful.
In caricature, one sometimes hears the Bible described as a compendium of moral absolutes: first, you completely accept and embrace the premise that it was given to humankind by the King and Creator of the world, and then you get to find out within its pages all of the things that are, by definition, inherently sinful. Here, however, we are making an argument that sounds shockingly opposite to this. Is murder only wrong because some people have agreed to act together like it is wrong? If they changed their minds, could it be right? What we are bumping up against here is that the hardest part of all is deciding what kind of symbols to traffic in when confronted by vast possibility. Each language has yet to express all that it can, and there is a greater infinity of whole new languages that could yet be devised. The ring of moral relativism is unmistakable in an account of morality that portrays it as an arbitrary game of social conventions that happen to be popular at the current moment.
For some, a blank canvas for the creation of new kinds of meaning in a society must seem thrilling, whereas others may fairly wonder whether a society is possible at all unless some things get nailed down at the outset. This latter tack is the one taken by the Hebrew Bible itself, which aims to be a detailed road map for a nation seeking to define itself in relation to God, with every law and ritual within bent toward this purpose. The audacious claim is that these laws are not just one of many ways of having a culture and some commonality in practice with one's neighbors. Instead, they are specific terms of a contract given from the hand of our Creator, and the things that happen in this created world are meant to be our way of judging whether or not He is keeping His side of the bargain.
Another book and then some could be written debating the question of why one would or would not think that the world, with all of its history and natural properties, testifies to the will of such a Creator; no one should pretend it is a simple matter to resolve.1 Still, it is worth pointing out, in closing, that our chosen passage in Exodus may itself hint at how best to grapple with this puzzle. Recall that the whole thing got going when Moses noticed a shrub blazing with a fire that somehow did not consume it. The image is of a process of intense, many-faceted rearrangement that generally leads to the transformation of wood into ash, but in this case does not. Put another way, the text is showing us, through a nonconsuming fire, the idea of a complex motion that looks like it should be tearing the exquisite structure of a living plant to shreds, and yet somehow fails to do so. We are talking, therefore, about a barrage of smaller-scale influences acting on this living plant that superficially seems randomizing, like a normal flame, but must somehow be carefully coordinated to leave the exquisite form of the living thing intact. As we have already pointed out, life itself seems to work this way, but now we can focus our attention instead on the fact that, for Moses, this moment is also one of encounter. The flame that does not consume speaks to Moses as he looks on with awe. Unexpectedly, and marvelously, this strange fire therefore reminds us that if we start by being willing to recognize something not so random after all in the way the world's threads are being woven together, we may just get the chance to hear something—a voice, a message—that we otherwise could not have sensed.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

1. Clearly, if we want to start playing with our definition of life, and broadening it far beyond the specific details of the life we know, even this first sentence can be made contentious. For now, the point is, presumably nothing had cells with DNA and protein right after the big bang.
2. Richard Dawkins is a representative example of those who propound this line. See, for example, Richard Dawkins, "What Are the Five Best Reasons Why There Is No God," SVT/NRK/Skavlan, YouTube, posted December 3, 2015, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyYPPTcoCiU.

The famous Urey-Miller experiment provoked the fantasy of just such a puddle, where a particular "chemically reducing" environment caused amino acids to form out of more basic chemical components. However, although it may be informative to discover in the present that it is possible to get what we consider to be complex biological components from simpler chemical reactants through a relatively primitive form of environmental stimulation (namely, electrical shocks), it is quite difficult to make the case that we know how closely such a scenario resembles what the world looked like so far in the distant past.

One should say that both Anderson and Laughlin do not mean to argue that systems with many components are wholly unpredictable; on the contrary, they both made their careers discovering predictability in such devilishly complex systems. However, what often happens in the so-called world of hard condensed matter (i.e., metals and more exotic solid-state materials) is that the way of cutting through the multitudes and seeing order in the whole is to realize that the collective behavior must be governed by some very specific symmetries of the system at hand.
This can get quite mathematically rarefied, but for a simple example imagine a flat, planar lattice of arrows pointing every which way in the plane. Suppose that each arrow's energy is lower to the extent that it points in the same direction as its neighbors. Clearly, the energy is therefore lowest for the collective when all the arrows point in the same direction. Yet symmetry tells us that the lowest energy state should not exhibit an average bias to point in any one direction, because the overall way we determine the energy of the system looks exactly the same when we rotate our perspective. The resolution is to realize that there are infinitely many equivalent lowest-energy states, with all arrows aligned with each other, but with each collectively aligned state pointing in a different direction.
3. It is worth stating specifically why one might have ever imagined something so outlandish as the idea that quantum theory could be used to predict the stock market. The point is that, from the perspective of a physicist, all the people and documents and computers and phones and factories and mines and forests and winds (and everything else) that act to determine the price of a stock are made of atoms. The way these atoms bind together into molecules is described quite well by known equations that govern the interaction of electrical charge, light, and matter on the tiniest of scales. So why do we not try to predict stocks (and indeed, all the events of the world influencing the stocks) using these equations? Not only does the sheer scale of the computation required to represent such fine details put the task far beyond reach, but we also have little way of knowing most of the numbers that would serve as input to the model. Accordingly, much the same way that the shareholders may not easily get to know all that is ailing a publicly traded company, we also, by default, know very little about exactly what each atom or molecule on the planet is doing. Instead of trying to measure every one of those details, we are much better served making predictive models that paint a simpler picture of the thing we are trying to model (for example, by just positing that prices are determined by a balance between supply and demand).

The most famous thought experiment illustrating how central the notion of information and computation should be to our understanding of thermodynamics is that of Maxwell's demon. We imagine two vessels of gas, initially at the same temperature, and separated by a wall that is perforated by a door, which may be opened or closed. At the door sits a tiny gatekeeper (a "demon") who watches the molecules bouncing around him and makes discriminatory decisions about which ones to allow through the door. If a fast molecule is moving toward the door from the left side of the wall to the right, then he opens the door and allows it to pass through before slamming the barrier shut again. However, if a slow-moving molecule is doing the same, he keeps the door closed. Fast-moving molecules going from right to left are similarly barred passage, whereas slow-moving molecules going from right to left encounter an open doorway and pass through.
Clearly, if the demon toiled away in this fashion, it would be possible over time to accumulate all the fast molecules on one side of the wall and all the slow molecules on the left side. In other words, starting with two containers of gas at the same temperature, one would eventually have a hot one (on the right) and a cold one (on the left). This would be no mean feat, as the flow of heat from hot to cold can be harnessed to operate an engine, which means that without touching the molecules, and just by knowing when to open and close the door, the demon would have created the ability to haul a load up a hill.
This sounds like a free lunch, and if it were achievable, it would be. The resolution of the paradox comes from the fact that we have to consider the demon as part of the system, and ask how he makes his decisions. In order to know when to open the door or close it, he needs to have information about the molecules that are about to be incident on it. If we think in Landauer terms about what it would take to operate a computerized demon according to the rules we have specified, it turns out that the free lunch is no longer free: operating a Maxwell's demon will require us to supply work energy that can be dissipated as heat in order to account for the information processing the demon will have to do. Thus, the proper accounting for the flow of information in the system is essential for keeping our picture of the laws of thermodynamics consistent and sound.

2. There are various kinds of wave disturbances that propagate across space (x) over time (t), and they do not all obey the same wave equation, but the typical one we are talking about in this sort of scenario is c2 ∂2 h(x,t) / ∂x2 - ∂2 h(x,t) / ∂t2= 0, where h(x,t) is the displacement of the medium from its rest position during vibration, and c is the speed at which the wave propagates. There are wave solutions to this equation of motion that both undulate over space, with a distance between wave crests of L, and oscillate up and down, in time with a frequency of f oscillations per second. The wave equation requires that these quantities obey what is known as a dispersion relation, of the form c / L = f. In other words, the shorter the wavelength (that is, the more tightly crinkled) of the undulation in space, the smaller L is, and (therefore) the faster f, the frequency of oscillation, needs to be. The same works in reverse, meaning that faster oscillations (which would sound like higher pitches) will correspond to motions in the vibrating medium that crinkle on a shorter scale. Though not by any means the only example of this kind of phenomenon, wave motions of this kind provide a clear example of how the capacity to undergo particular shape changes can end up affecting the ability of an assemblage of matter to absorb energy from a source with a particular timing to it.
3. An even subtler thing we can also start to glimpse at this point is that you need a system whose space of possible states is vast and "messy" in order for this to work well. The more it is the case that the pile of matter in question is a heterogeneous collection of different, diversely interacting parts, the more it becomes the case that the different valleys in the energy landscape serve as a sort of library of different, unique normal-mode frequency fingerprints to explore. Getting anything interesting to happen would be much more difficult in a system with very few particles, or with very constrained regularity to how its components fit together, because then it would be less likely that the resonant frequencies of the system could change dramatically as it explored the full space of possible configurations. It is notable that, from the perspective of a physicist, this is exactly what real chemistry looks like: out of a few different types of atoms it is possible to build a seemingly endless diversity of stable structures with distinct physical properties, and the structures can be thought of in a real and precise sense as different valleys in a high-dimensional, many-atom energy landscape of possibility.

5. The relationship governing how a chemical reaction rate depends on temperature and on the height of the (free) energy barrier that must be traversed during the reaction is called the Arrhenius Law of Chemical Kinetics. It states that for a reaction traversing a barrier of height U at temperature T, the logarithm of the reaction rate R should be given by log R = - a U/T + b, where a and b are constants. In other words, two things make a chemical reaction proceed faster: raising the temperature, or lowering the activation energy (that is, lowering the height of the barrier). Because the rate's logarithm has this simple dependence on U and T, that means that with each unit increase in U/T, the speed of the reaction grows by a constant multiplicative factor. Accordingly, altering a barrier height by a seemingly small amount can sometimes lead to dramatic acceleration of the reaction in question—to such an extent that the difference is qualitative, and one goes from a situation where the reaction is essentially forbidden to one where it occurs more or less instantly. Digestive enzymes in the human gut, for example, take the proteins in food that would sit inertly for a good long while in pure water and catalyze their reaction with water, so that the breakdown of their peptide bonds proceeds swiftly. This process allows the digestive system to harvest the liberated amino acid building blocks and use them to build new proteins.
Though it may at first seem a bit arcane, the Arrhenius equation has a physical origin that should sound quite sensible and familiar. The exponential dependence on energy and inverse temperature smacks of the Boltzmann distribution, and indeed it should, for the whole story here is about the relationship between thermal fluctuations and probability. The rate at which a chemical reaction happens is going to be controlled by how frequently the random kicks from a thermal environment help to lift the system up to the hilltop, so that things might roll down the other side. In essence, the question of how frequently this happens becomes equivalent to asking what the Boltzmann distribution is within each valley; the Arrhenius rate is just proportional to the tiny probability of being found on the very edge of the valley, near the ridge.
The Arrhenius Law also allows one to take things into the nonequilibrium regime and analyze instances of time-reversal symmetry breaking. In thermal equilibrium, the probability of being in two valleys of equal size has to be dictated by the difference between their heights (energies). In a circular chain of such valleys at equal height, this would mean that jumping the clockwise and counterclockwise directions would have to proceed at the same rate, and the effect of thermal equilibrium alone could not produce a bias to run around the circle one way more than the other. If one observed such a bias in a system, then this would imply that an extra kick (or escalator) was helping things to move (for example) more clockwise than counterclockwise. By taking the log of the ratio of the forward and reverse jumping rate, one may use the Arrhenius Law to quantify how much extra work the escalator has to contribute for each clockwise jump.

In our study, we started with a physical model where different types of particles had the chance to clump together into clusters whose energies were determined by the pairwise interactions between particle types. The numbers governing these interactions were randomly chosen to simulate the heterogeneity of different molecular combinations of atoms. Once the energies of these different "molecule"-like atom clusters were known, we used the Arrhenius Law to compute rates for reactions that would interconvert between different cluster types through the exchange of atoms. Once the rates of reactions were determined, it was possible to write down a "mass-action" system of differential equations for how the concentrations of these chemicals changed from moment to moment. Thus, we used the physical model of atomic interactions to figure out the kinetic rules (that is, rules for how things move), but then the kinetic rules became inputs to a dynamical model that allowed us to study how the populations of the different chemical species evolved together over time.
The question of interest with regard to self-replication is whether, once all the rates of the chemical reactions are determined, the collective dynamics of chemical concentrations get taken over by the exponential growth of one or more specific chemical species that participate in an autocatalytic cycle. The likelihood of such cycles being possible is all a question of the statistics regarding what kinds of chemicals can react with which other ones, and how rapidly. Strikingly, it turns out that the hard thing is not producing chemicals that can form part of an autocatalytic cycle, but rather, forming one such cycle whose participants are not more likely to be sucked up by other reactions instead. In a diverse chemical mixture with the right balance of fast and slow reactions, the existence of such a cycle starts to be not only possible, but even likely. Self-copying, and the natural selection that can therefore result, may turn out to be a fairly generic feature of an "ecosystem" of interreacting chemicals with some high-energy chemical fuel to churn through.

5. Indeed, it is quite easy to concoct any number of differing accounts of observed data that are each too unlikely for our intuition to accept. Attacks on Darwinian ideas from the standpoint of intelligent design (ID) frequently make use of this technique by proposing a straw-man version of an explanation of evolution by natural selection that can then be proven to be freakishly improbable. The key thing to remember when weighing such arguments is that the theoretical improbability of a badly conceived straw-man model cannot be taken as proof that a good model will never be found. By resorting to the notion of a designer as the only explanation for the data, ID advocates are essentially positing that their current inability to think of such a model is objective proof that no such model will ever be discovered. This line of reasoning is especially suspicious because one suspects that many advocates for ID may be overly eager to reach the conclusion that a designer is the only feasible explanation of the data. Of course, whenever we do not yet understand something, we always have the option of throwing up our hands and declaring that intelligent contrivance is the only way things could be this way, but we also have the option of trying harder to understand, often with a successful result.
Speaking personally, I will say this: I am fully committed to declaring that the world and everything in it was created by the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, just like the Bible says, but to give up on trying to understand the inner workings of what He created in order to be able to claim evidence for His involvement seems backward to me. The biblical way of talking about the world is a covenant to which one chooses to be a party, and the point is not to test whether God arranged all that is (as one would test a falsifiable hypothesis), but rather to assume that He did so, and then try to see what additional shades of meaning can be gleaned from human experience by employing that new language and using it to talk about the world.

This work was the first example we studied of self-organized increase in energy absorption through dissipative adaptation in a driven many-body system. The simulation modeled what was essentially a collective of bungee cords, or "catch bonds," which are like ropes that hook together at the ends in such a way that they are more likely to become unhooked when the ropes are slack than when the ropes are taut. As the ropes hook and unhook, the system explores different configurations with different normal-mode frequency spectra. Upon driving one of the nodes where the ropes hook together with a force oscillating at a chosen frequency, one finds that the network reorganizes to have modes that resonate well with the chosen frequency, so that the rate of energy absorption goes up over time as a result of high resonance. Physically, one can think of the mechanism here as follows: As the system discovers increasingly resonant states, it absorbs more energy and expands (like a sail blowing out in the wind), so that the bonds tend to stretch. The taut bonds are less likely to unhook, and are therefore stabilized, meaning that the system ends up being most stable in highly resonant states. The self-organization is therefore a matter of trying out lots of shapes until one accidentally discovers a highly resonant one and gets trapped there.

CHAPTER 8: VOICE AND WORD

1. Clearly, there are some intelligent people who behold the awesomeness of chromosomes, galaxies, and everything we can understand about the universe and feel confirmed in the idea that this is the handiwork of a transcendent Creator. Clearly, there are also plenty of intelligent people who behold these very same things and reach the opposite conclusion. So, yes, there is an attitude, best expressed in the words of King David's Psalm 104: "How manifold are your works, O Lord, you made them all with wisdom," that can easily embrace what science tells us about the universe and fit it into a framework that gives all due credit to God. But one ought not to pretend that this perspective must be the inescapable conclusion of anyone reasoning thoughtfully about the world and all its phenomena; too many smart people seem to feel they have no need for the idea of God when talking about how it all fits together.
By the same token, however, attempts to disprove the Hebrew Bible's account of the world, or to argue mockingly that there is no evidence to support it, are equal parts sophomoric and sophistic. The Bible does not propose itself as a set of falsifiable claims; instead, in part by saying some things that superficially sound like claims (such as that on the seventh day He rested), it tries to teach a method of interpretation for human history and individual experience that leads one to speak in a new language about one's life and about humanity more generally. This new language essentially is learned through backward translation, by assuming the biblical text is faithful in its account of things even given what else one knows to be true about the world, and engaging in the painstaking work of constructing arguments for what the scripture might have meant when it said something. It may well be that not everyone wishes to engage in this work, but those who scoff vociferously without ever trying wind up looking a bit foolish, as their calls for proof and evidence miss the point entirely.
