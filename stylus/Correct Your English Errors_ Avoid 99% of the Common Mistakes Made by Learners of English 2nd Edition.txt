INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this book is to identify the most common trouble spots for English language learners, to provide a basis for understanding why these trouble spots cause difficulties, and to offer guidance and practice for avoiding potential errors.
Many errors commonly made by speakers and learners of a second language are caused by transferring patterns and features of the native language to the new language. This happens in all aspects of language from pronunciation to word formation to sentence structure:
 Difficulty saying an English sound arises because the first language does not have such a sound.
 Double letters are omitted from English words because the first language's spelling system does not have double letters.
 Verb endings to show tense or noun endings to show plurals are omitted because the first language does not add such suffixes to these words.
 Adjectives are placed after, rather than before, nouns because the first language follows that pattern.
 "Taller from" is said instead of "taller than" because that's the pattern in the first language.
Another source of error is the learning process itself. That is, learners tend to overapply or misapply patterns and rules in the new language, do not learn exceptions to the rules, or do not apply the rules fully. Here are examples of these kinds of errors:
 Applying the regular -ed past-tense ending to irregular verbs: I goed home early yesterday.
 Using more with the adjective heavy (which requires the -er ending) because the rule that two-syllable adjectives ending in -y use -er, not more, was not fully learned.
 Using asleep in front of a noun because the rule that a certain small group of adjectives, including asleep, are used only after a linking verb was not fully learned.
In this book, you will find help with these and many more common errors through explanation and example. You will become aware of potential trouble spots and learn how to break the habits, learn the necessary rules, and correct your mistakes. Several examples are given for each topic, followed by exercises that test your understanding and help you avoid the pitfalls.
This book is divided into two parts: Pronunciation and Spelling and Grammar. The largest section is Grammar, which identifies the various parts of speech in traditional terminology for ease of comprehension. Each term is explained and illustrated with multiple examples, providing necessary review or clarification.
Throughout this book, all errors are presented in red type and marked by an . For maximum clarity, all errors are corrected, and each corrected version is presented with a .
The guidelines in this book are based on current standard usage in North America. However, usage varies according to region and other variables, and language is constantly changing. In cases where variants exist for formal and informal situations, details are provided.
Because individual words of a language are used in connection with other words, you will find that many topics are mentioned in more than one place. Extensive cross-referencing will help you find connections between related topics. Topics and lists are presented in logical order. For example, irregular verbs are presented in groups of verbs that follow similar patterns. Comparative and superlative forms of adjectives are presented in logical groupings according to how they are formed and spelled. Verb tenses are presented in order from the present tense to modal verbs. Complex syntactic patterns, such as the passive voice, are presented at the end of the volume, after all the prerequisite knowledge has been presented. In addition, the back of the book includes a comprehensive and detailed index, which serves as a guide to locating all the references to each topic, as well as a key with the answers to all the exercises.
I hope that the materials presented in this book will help you improve your proficiency in English and avoid the most common and vexing errors in English.

PRONUNCIATION AND SPELLING









PRONUNCIATION
English Sounds
The English language has about forty sounds, twenty-four consonants, and sixteen vowels. Knowing these sounds can help you improve your pronunciation. Special phonetic symbols are used to represent sounds. Key places in this book use phonetic symbols to clarify pronunciation. They are written between slash marks, such as /b/, to indicate that they are symbols. You do not need to memorize these symbols to learn Englishâjust use them as references. Many learners' dictionaries use these symbols, so being familiar with them will help you when you look up words. Each of these sounds can be spelled in many ways. For information on spelling, see page 9.
Consonants
This table shows the consonant sounds of English:
VOICELESS

VOICED


Voiced and Voiceless Sounds
Consonants fall into two groups, voiced and voiceless. When you say a voiced sound, your vocal chords vibrate. When you say a voiceless sound, your vocal chords do not vibrate. To feel your vocal chords vibrate, place your hand on your throat and say word pairs such as fan/van, pill/bill, or Sue/zoo. Your vocal chords should not vibrate when you say the first consonant in each pair.
Many learners have difficulty with the sounds /Î¸/ and /Ã°/. The sound /Î¸/ is not voiced (i.e., it is voiceless), which means the vocal chords do not vibrate when you say it. The sound /Ã°/ is voiced. The chords should vibrate when you say this consonant. Practice saying the following groups of words:


AVOID THE Error
To pronounce /Î¸/ and /Ã°/, your tongue must be between the upper and lower teeth. Instead, people may make the mistake of saying /d/, /f/, or another sound:

The sounds /Î¸/ and /Ã°/ may be difficult for individuals from a culture where it is not polite to show your tongue. Keep in mind that when speaking English, showing one's tongue to pronounce these sounds is perfectly normal. Nevertheless, if you are shy, you might cover your mouth when you say these sounds, until you become comfortable saying them.

To learn /r/, listen to native speakers and practice saying words with many /r/ sounds, such as refrigerator. Saying tongue twisters is also a good way to practice this sound.
Around the rough rocks the angry rascal ran.

AVOID THE Error
The sounds /l/ and /r/ are often difficult for speakers of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other Asian languages. In fact, their listeners can become confused by the wrong sound:

Word pairs that can be confused in this way include: right/light, lock/rock, grass/glass, lamp/ramp, raw/law, row/low.
The sound /l/ is produced by the tip of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth. The sound /r/ involves no contact between the tongue and the roof of the mouth.
The spelling of words in English is a reliable clue for when to pronounce each sound. The letter l is always pronounced /l/, and the letter r is always pronounced /r/. However, some words have a silent l: would, could, should, half, chalk, talk, walk, Lincoln, almond, and salmon.

Vowels
This table shows the vowel sounds of English:

The /Îµr/ sound is particularly hard to say. To learn it, practice saying words with vowel + r combinations.

Stress
Stress is the loudness with which we say a word or syllable. (A syllable is a part of a word that consists of at least one vowel and can have one or more consonants. A word can consist of one or more syllables.) A word can have one or more stressed syllables. A one- or two-syllable word can have one stressed syllable.

A word of two or more syllables can have primary stress and secondary stress. Primary stress is marked with ', secondary stress with â.

Some words, such as articles and one-syllable prepositions, are not stressed at all.

In English, unstressed vowels usually become /Ä/.


AVOID THE Error
Sometimes the meaning of a word depends on which syllable is stressed.

In suspect/suspect and many other pairs of words, the first syllable is stressed if the word is a noun, but the second syllable is stressed if the word is a verb.


Contrastive Stress
In English, we can stress any word, even one that normally is not stressed, to express a special meaning. Look at how the meaning of this sentence changes depending on the stress:
We will finish work at 1:00. (Others will finish at another time.)
We will finish work at 1:00. (We won't finish at another time.)
We will finish work at 1:00. (We won't start or do something else at that time.)
We will finish work at 1:00. (We won't work after that time.)
We will finish work at 1:00. (We will finish at exactly that time.)
We will finish work at 1:00. (We will not finish at 2:00.)
Listen carefully when English speakers give special stress to a certain word. It means that the person is using contrastive stress.
Rising Intonation for Questions
Intonation is the pitch, higher or lower, of sound. English uses rising intonation for yes/no questions. With rising intonation, the pitch goes up at the end of the sentence. The rising intonation signals that the person is asking a question. Usually, intonation begins rising with the last stressed syllable in the question.
Are you finished using the computer?
Do you want fries with that?
Can you give me a hand?
Are you going to the supermarket later this morning?
Did you do your homework last night?
Have you seen Lance today?
Chris, were you sick yesterday?

AVOID THE Error
Do not use rising intonation with wh- questions. Use falling intonation.

In wh- questions, the question word signals that the person is asking a question. Rising intonation is not necessary with wh- questions.










SPELLING
English spelling often seems difficult, but many common spelling patterns can help us spell better.
Vowels
Short Vowels
Spell short vowels /, Îµ, Ã¦, , / with only one letter.

Long Vowels
To spell long vowels /i, e, o, u/, use two letters.

Usually, the second vowel is silent. To remember this rule, children use a simple rhyme. You can use it, too: "When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking."
A vowel that comes at the end of a word or syllable also is long.

i Before e
When the letters i and e are together, they are usually spelled ie.

There are some exceptions to this rule:
 After c, e usually comes before i.

 When the combination sounds like /a/, e comes before i.

However, not all words follow this pattern:

A children's rhyme makes this rule memorable: "I before e, except after c or when sounded as /a/, as in neighbor and weigh."
Consonants
The sound /f/ can be spelled with f, ph-, -ough, or -augh.

There are some exceptions to these rules. The letter group -ough also represents /o/.

The letter group -augh represents the sounds //.


AVOID THE Error
The initial /f/ sound in Philippines (an island nation in Asia) is spelled Ph-, but Filipino (an individual from that country) is spelled with F.


The sound /k/ can be spelled c, cc, k, or ck.

The letter q is always followed by u.

The /s/ sound can be spelled with c or s. Usually c + i or e is pronounced /s/. Otherwise, c is usually pronounced /k/.

The // sound can be spelled with g or j. Usually, g + i or e is pronounced //. Otherwise, g is usually pronounced /g/.


AVOID THE Error
Don't forget the double consonant letters in English words.


Silent Letters
Many words have silent letters.
 The k is silent in the initial kn-.

 The letters gh are silent in the final -ght.

 The letter b is silent before t in words such as:

 The letters h and w are silent in these combinations: rh- and wr-.

 An initial h is silent in many words.

 The letter l is silent in these words:

 Many words end with a silent final -e.


AVOID THE Error
Take care not to forget a final silent -e.


Adding Prefixes
A prefix is a word part added to the beginning of a word to change its meaning. Common prefixes include mis-, over-, pre-, and re-. Adding a prefix to a word does not change the spelling of the word.

AVOID THE Error
If the last letter of a prefix and the first letter of a word are the same, the letter will appear double when the prefix and word are combined. Do not forget the double letter.


Adding Suffixes
Suffixes are word parts that are added to the ends of words. Common suffixes include -ed, -ing, -er, est, -s, -ful, -ly, and so on. Adding suffixes to words involves many spelling changes. Here are some simple rules.
When adding a suffix that ends in a vowel to a one-syllable word that ends in a vowel and a single consonant (hot), double the final consonant: hotter.

This is often called the 1 + 1 + 1 rule. If a word has a one-syllable word, one short vowel, and one consonant at the end, then double the consonant when adding a suffix.
If a word has more than one syllable, double the final consonant only if the final syllable is stressed.

When adding a suffix to a word that ends in consonant + -y, change the final -y to -i.

When adding a suffix to a word that ends in a vowel + -y, do not change the final -y to -i.

When adding a suffix to a word that ends in a vowel, drop the final vowel if the suffix begins with a vowel.


AVOID THE Error
Do not drop the final -e when it comes before c or g and the suffix begins in a, o, or u.


When adding -able to like or love, dropping the -e is optional:

When adding a suffix to a word that ends in a vowel, keep the final vowel if the suffix begins with a consonant.

For details on adding
 -s to nouns, see page 47.
 -s to verbs, see page 132.
 -ing to verbs, see page 139.
 -ed to verbs, see page 151.
 -er/-est to adjectives, see page 106.
 -ly to adjectives, see page 224.
 -er/-est to adverbs, see page 234.
Contractions
Contractions are short forms for two words written together. Use an apostrophe to spell a contraction. The apostrophe replaces the letters that have been deleted from the contraction.


AVOID THE Error
Don't confuse the common contractions they're, it's, and you're with other words:
 They're is the contraction of they are. Writers often confuse they're with the possessive adjective their or the adverb there.

 It's is the contraction of it is. Writers often confuse it's with the possessive adjective its.

 You're is the contraction of you are. Writers often confuse you're with the possessive adjective your.


Compound Words
Compound words are two words that come together to form a new word. Compound words can be spelled as single words, with hyphens, or as two separate words.


AVOID THE Error
Thank you is written as two words.


When compound words are pronounced, the first word is always stressed.

To spell a compound word, say the parts aloud. If the first word is not stressed, it's not a compound. Spell it as two words without a hyphen. If the first word is stressed, then the entire word is a compound. Check a dictionary to see if a space or a hyphen is needed.
Homonyms
Homonyms are words that sound the same but have different spellings and meanings. Using an incorrect homonym is very confusing to readers. The following table shows some common homonyms:


AVOID THE Error
Be careful to use the correct homonym. Using the wrong homonym is very confusing to readers.


If you type on a computer, the spell-checker can help you catch many spelling errors. However, it will not always catch errors when you type one homonym instead of another.

Make sure you use the word you really mean.

AVOID THE Error
Some common spelling errors are the result of quick or careless keyboarding. Instead of typing one word, such as or, we type a similar word by mistake, such as of. The spell check on your computer does not always catch these errors, so proofread your work carefully.

Watch for errors such as:


Good spelling takes careful proofreading. Ideally, you should check your writing for errors several times. Always double-check your writing for correct spelling.

AVOID THE Error
Avoid these common spelling errors when you proofread.


Internet Spellings
The Internet has resulted in the creation of many new words and spelling problems. Because the Internet is so new and new ideas emerge so quickly, many terms have several spellings. Here are some common Internet terms:

You should, however, capitalize technology tools that are brand names.
Twitter
Facebook
Google
Some of these brand names have related nouns and verbs. There is not complete agreement on the capitalization of these words, though the tendency is to capitalize nouns but not verbs.

Check with your teacher, coworker, or boss about exactly how you should spell these terms if you need to use them.

AVOID THE Error
People use many abbreviations on the Internet. These abbreviations are fine for informal communication online, but not for work or school settings. Use the full forms for work and school.


Of course, English has many more rules and each rule has exceptions. Some of the most difficult words to spell are summarized in the table on page 299. To help you improve your spelling, keep a spelling notebook. Note the spellings of words that you need to use often. You will be surprised how quickly your spelling improves.

PUNCTUATION
We use punctuation to make the meaning of words and sentences clear. The most important punctuation marks are the period, comma, question mark, exclamation mark, colon, semicolon, and quotation marks.

Period
Use a period in these situations:
 At the end of a sentence. Use a period to end a sentence that is not an exclamation or a question.
My car needs new tires.
Rhonda is an excellent driver.
He's watching TV in the living room.
I need a new cell phone.

AVOID THE Error
A complete sentence has a subject and a verb. Ensure each sentence and question has a complete subject and verb.


 At the end of an abbreviation
I have an appointment with Dr. Sawlani.
We need 20 lbs. of potatoes.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use periods with acronyms. Acronyms are abbreviations formed from the first letters of a name or title. Acronyms are usually pronounced as words.

Many organizations whose shortened names are not pronounced as words but as individual letters do not use periods after the letters in the shortened names.


If an abbreviation is at the end of a question or exclamation, it's followed by a question mark or exclamation mark.
Did it weigh 20 lbs.?

AVOID THE Error
If an abbreviation is at the end of a sentence, you do not need two periods.


The titles Mr. and Mrs. are abbreviations for full forms that are no longer used. Always use a period after these abbreviations. Ms. is not an abbreviation, but it uses a period.

AVOID THE Error
With Miss, do not use a period.


Periods are used in Internet addresses. If an Internet address is at the end of a sentence, use a period at the end. The reader should know not to include that period when using the address online.
My favorite source for news is www.cnn.com.

AVOID THE Error
When periods are used in an Internet address (a URL) or an e-mail address, we say dot, not period.


Exclamation Mark
Exclamation marks show emotion and excitement. We often use exclamation marks in imperatives.
Watch out!
I love my new SUV!
Be careful!
I just won $20 million in the lottery!
For more information on imperatives, see page 143.
Sometimes a writer will use a question mark and exclamation mark together to show surprise and wonder.
Did you really win the lottery?!

AVOID THE Error
Avoid multiple punctuation marks in formal and informal writing, though they are acceptable in friendly, informal communication, such as a message in a greeting card.



AVOID THE Error
Avoid excessive exclamation marks, especially in more formal kinds of writing, such as business letters. Do not use multiple exclamation marks, except in very informal kinds of writing, such as a letter to a good friend or a message in a greeting card.


We can use an exclamation point at the end of an imperative or a sentence if it's said with emotion.
You're getting married! Congratulations!

AVOID THE Error
An exclamation mark is not required at the end of every imperative. Use an exclamation mark only when the words are said with emotion.


Question Mark
Use a question mark at the end of a direct question.
Who left the door open?
Are you ready to leave yet?

AVOID THE Error
Do not use a question mark at the end of an indirect question, which is a question inside of a statement. An indirect question is a part of a statement, so use a period.


Comma
We use commas with words, phrases, or clauses that come in a series. Use commas:
 With three or more items in a series joined by and or or. Use a comma when a sentence contains a series of items (nouns, phrases, or clauses) joined by and.
He served broccoli, mashed potatoes, and carrots with dinner.
They went to the mall, shopped for new clothes, and went to the movies.
Alison vacuumed the living room, Tim washed the dishes, Diane cleaned the bathroom, and Liz shouted instructions to all of them.
The last comma in the series (before and) is optional.
He served broccoli, mashed potatoes and carrots with dinner.

AVOID THE Error
Avoid excess commas with items in a series. Do not use a comma:
 With only two items in a series

 Before the first item in a series

 After the last item in a series

 After and or or


 With such as. Such as can be used to introduce an example or examples. Use a comma before such as.
This summer, I want to learn to cook Italian food, such as lasagna, spaghetti, and linguine.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use a comma after such as.


 Between two or more adjectives in a series. Use a comma between two or more coordinate adjectives in a series. (Coordinate adjectives can have their order changed and can be joined with and.)
He bought some ugly red T-shirts. (You cannot say "red ugly T-shirts," so a comma is not needed.)
The intelligent, hardworking students got high grades. (You can say "hardworking, intelligent," so a comma is needed.)
 Between two independent clauses in a sentence. Use a comma when two independent clauses are joined into a single sentence with and, but, or, nor, for, yet, or so. An independent clause has a complete subject and verb and can stand alone as a sentence.
My dog likes to go outside, and my cat likes to sleep in front of the fireplace.
He went to the supermarket, but he forgot to buy milk.
The mechanic will fix the problem, or I will have to buy a new car.
She was locked out of her apartment, for she lost her keys on the bus.
He spent the whole day at the water park, yet he never got wet.
They didn't check a map before leaving, so they got lost almost right away.

AVOID THE Error
Do not join two independent clauses with only a comma. This error is often called a "comma splice."
 Franklin cut the lawn in the morning, his brother cleaned the garage.
Correct a comma splice by joining the clauses with a semicolon or with a comma and and, but, or, nor, for, yet, or so.
 Franklin cut the lawn in the morning, and his brother cleaned the garage.
 Franklin cut the lawn in the morning; his brother cleaned the garage.

A comma is not needed when the clauses are very short.
She got up and he made breakfast.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use a comma to join only two compound elements, such as compound subjects or predicates, or compound objects of prepositions. Compound elements are joined with words such as and, but, and or.


 Between a dependent clause and an independent clause. Use a comma to join a dependent clause followed by an independent clause. A clause has a complete subject and a complete verb. An independent clause can stand alone. A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence. A subordinating conjunction (such as when, if, though, while, etc.) joins the two clauses.
If I win the grand prize in the lottery, I'll buy a new house and a new car.
Though she wasn't hungry, Mavis ate a slice of pizza.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use a comma to join an independent clause followed by a dependent clause.


Other subordinating conjunctions include so that, that, and in order that.

AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse so with so that. So introduces an independent clause. A comma is needed before so.

So that means "in order that" and introduces a dependent clause. A comma is not needed before so that, because a comma is not needed when an independent clause is followed by a dependent clause.

A comma is needed when the clause with so that begins the sentence.


 Before and after an appositive. An appositive is a noun or noun phrase that uses other words to restate the noun just before it. Commas always come before and after an appositive.
George Washington, the first president of the United States, was elected in 1789.
I'd like to introduce my uncle, Don Mantle. He owns a used bicycle shop, Don's Bikes.
For more information on appositives, see page 57.
 After an introductory prepositional phrase. A prepositional phrase is formed with a preposition and a noun. Prepositional phrases can modify nouns, verbs, or a whole sentence. An introductory prepositional phrase is at the beginning of a sentence and modifies the whole sentence. Use a comma after an introductory prepositional phrase, unless the phrase is very short.
At the beginning of the winter driving season, motorists should check their radiator fluid.
In summer check your coolant. (no comma necessary)
For more information on prepositions and prepositional phrases, see page 239.
 After an introductory participial phrase. A present participle is a verb + -ing. A past participle is a verb + -ed. Participles are used with forms of be or have to form various tenses. Participles can also be used as modifiers. An introductory participial phrase is formed with a present or past participle and its objects and modifiers. An introductory participial phrase is followed by a comma.
Quickly running downstairs, Dale tripped and fell down.
Bored by the long speeches, Laura and Julie dozed off.

AVOID THE Error
A comma is not needed after but or although when one of these words begins a sentence.


 After an introductory adverb. When an adverb begins a sentence and modifies the whole sentence, it is set off with a comma.
Exceptionally, employees may be granted time off if they make up the time.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use a comma after an adverb at the beginning of the sentence if it modifies only one part of the sentence, such as an adjective that follows it.


 Before and after an interrupting phrase. Use commas before and after a word or phrase that interrupts a sentence.
John wants to go to Florida on vacation. Mary, however, wants to go to California.
 Before and after words in direct address. Use commas before and after a word that is said in direct address (i.e., said directly to the listener).

Colon
Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list.

Semicolon
Use a semicolon to link independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction.

Some people deny that global warming is a problem; most scientists disagree with them.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use a semicolon in place of a colon.


Quotation Marks
Use quotation marks for titles of books, movies, stories, TV shows, and so on.
I love watching "Friends."

AVOID THE Error
In formal writing, writers use quotation marks for short works (such as stories) and italics or underlining for longer works.

In informal writing, quotation marks are acceptable.
 "Star Wars" is my favorite movie.

Use quotation marks to show a speaker's exact words.
The bride quietly answered, "I do."
Lincoln's most famous speech begins with the words, "Four score and seven years ago."

AVOID THE Error

Place a question mark or exclamation mark inside the quotation marks if it's part of the quotation. If not, place the punctuation mark outside the quotation marks.


Use a comma before and after a quotation.
He said, "It's time for lunch."
"Flight 291 for Chicago is ready for passenger boarding," she announced.

GRAMMAR









NOUNS
A noun is a word that names a person, place, animal, thing, event, idea, quality, action, or state. Here are examples of each kind of noun:

Singular and Plural
A noun that refers to one thing is singular. A noun that refers to two or more things is plural.

Spelling Plural Nouns
To form most plurals, add -s or -es to the end of the noun.


AVOID THE Error
Do not use an apostrophe (') when forming a plural noun.

You can use an apostrophe to form the plural of single letters.
Make sure you dot all the i's and cross all the t's.

This table sums up the rules for spelling plural nouns:
FORMING PLURAL NOUNS

For most nouns, add -s to form the plural:

For nouns that end in a consonant + -y, change the y to i and add -es:

For nouns that end in a vowel + -y, add -s to the noun:

For nouns that end in -s, -ss, -x, -ch, and -sh, add -es to the noun:

For nouns that end in a consonant + -o, add -es to the noun:

For nouns that end in a vowel + -o, add -s to the noun:

For nouns that end in -fe, change f to v, and add s:

For nouns that end in -f, change f to v, and add -es:


AVOID THE Error
There are some exceptions to these rules:


Only a few nouns end in -z. Double the final consonant and add -es:
quizzes
For acronyms and numbers, add -s:
I bought two DVDs.
I lived here in the 1990s.
Several VIPs attended the meeting.

AVOID THE Error
Avoid common spelling errors with regular plurals.


A few nouns only occur in the plural form:


AVOID THE Error
Do not use words such as trousers, pants, jeans, and so on in the singular.


Some plural nouns are irregular:


AVOID THE Error
Use irregular plurals correctly.


A few nouns have the same form for the singular and the plural:

I bought a new fish for my fish tank.
I bought some new fish for my fish tank.

AVOID THE Error
Fish can be made plural only when it refers to many varieties of fishes, especially in science.


Pronouncing Plural Nouns
The plural ending of nouns is pronounced in one of three ways: /z/, /s/, or /z/. Pronounce the plural ending as:
 /z/ after /s, z, â«, tâ«, d

For information on these phonetic symbols, see pages 3 and 4.
 /s/ after a voiceless consonant such as /f, t, k, p/ (The vocal chords do not vibrate when you say voiceless sounds.)

 /z/ after a vowel or a voiced consonant such as /v, d, g, n, m, l/ (The vocal chords vibrate when saying vowels and voiced consonants.)

For more information on voiced and voiceless sounds, see pages 3 and 4.
Countable and Uncountable Nouns
In English, nouns can be divided into two groups: nouns you can count (countable nouns) and nouns you can't count (uncountable nouns).
Countable Nouns
You can count countable nouns. They have plural forms. You can use the indefinite articles a and some with countable nouns.

Uncountable Nouns
Uncountable nouns include things such as water, meat, cheese, and so on. They are called uncountable because you usually can't count them. You can use the article the with uncountable nouns. You can also use the indefinite article some with uncountable nouns. But you cannot use the indefinite article a with uncountable nouns.


AVOID THE Error
Do not use the indefinite article a with uncountable nouns.

Do not use another, every, few, or many with uncountable nouns.


Uncountable nouns do not have plural forms.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use plural forms with uncountable nouns.


A few words are both countable and uncountable nouns.

A few words have the same form for countable and uncountable meanings.


AVOID THE Error
The words clothes and clothing have the same meaning, but different usage. Clothes is a plural count noun. It does not have a singular form.

The related word cloth refers to fabric, the material clothing is made from. This word is not the singular form of clothes.

Cloth is an uncountable noun. Therefore, it doesn't have a plural form.

Clothing is an uncountable noun.


Using Partitives with Uncountable Nouns
We can use partitive expressions to make uncountable nouns countable. Partitives are words that express containers or units, such as bottle, box, loaf, and so on. Partitives usually are followed by a phrase beginning with of, such as "a bottle of mineral water." Here are some common partitives:

Questions with How Much and How Many
We use how much to ask questions about uncountable nouns.
How much flour do you need for that bread recipe?
We use how many to ask questions about countable nouns.
How many loaves of bread do you want to make?
Possessive Nouns
A possessive noun shows who or what another noun belongs to.
Megan's book (Megan owns the book.)
the car's door (The door belongs to the car.)
We use an -s and an apostrophe (') to form possessive nouns. Follow these rules:
 Add an apostrophe and an -s to singular-count nouns.
John's book
the school's new building
the dog's collar

AVOID THE Error
To make a singular noun that ends in -s or -es possessive, do not add only an apostrophe (')âadd 's.

A few words that end in -s can add only an apostrophe to form the possessive, such as Jesus or a few Greek writers, to avoid an unpleasant repeating of the /s/ sound.


 Add an apostrophe to regular plural count nouns.
the girls' backpacks (two girls have backpacks)
the wheels' new hubcaps

AVOID THE Error
Do not add 's to regular plural nouns to make them possessive.


Add 's to irregular plurals that do not end in -s.


AVOID THE Error
Do not add the before a possessive proper noun.

You can use the with a possessive proper noun when the is part of the noun.
 This year, the Boy Scouts' annual holiday wreath sale will be December 10-23.

We can also form possessives with an of phrase and a possessive noun.
Raymond is a neighbor of Tim's.

AVOID THE Error
When we use possessives with a phrase with of, use a possessive noun.

However, when we use an of phrase following a person, the object of of can be a noun or a possessive.
 A friend of John is coming to the party.
 A friend of John's is coming to the party.

Use whose to ask questions about possessive nouns.
Whose car is parked in front of the house?
Whose phone rang in the middle of the wedding?
Whose keys are these?

AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse whose (question word) with who's (abbreviation of question word who + is).


Comparing Nouns
We use fewer ... than, the fewest, less ... than, and the least to compare quantities of nouns. Use fewer ... than and the fewest with countable nouns.
We have fewer apples than oranges.
We have the fewest grapefruit.
Use less ... than and the least with uncountable nouns.
We have less salt than sugar.
We have the least pepper.
Appositives
An appositive is a noun that restates another noun in new or different words.
Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth president, ended the Civil War.
My best friend, Ray, works downtown.

AVOID THE Error
An appositive must refer to the noun it precedes or follows.
 A talented singer, they hired Susan Alexander to perform in the opera.
To correct a misplaced appositive, move it nearer to the noun or rewrite the sentence.
 They hired Susan Alexander, a talented singer, to perform in the opera.
 A talented singer, Susan Alexander, was hired to perform in the opera.

NUMBERS
Cardinal Numbers


Decimals and Fractions

Ordinal Numbers

Ordinal numbers above 10 are unusual, but you may need them from time to time.

Writing and Saying Cardinal Numbers
We use cardinal numbers to count. Most numbers are written in the same way around the world.

AVOID THE Error
There are several differences in how North Americans and Europeans write numbers:
 North Americans write 1 with a single stroke. In many other places, this number has an additional stroke.
 In other places, people write the number 7 with an additional stroke. North Americans do not use this stroke.
Do not use extra strokes with the numbers 1 and 7 in North America.
 North America: 1 7
 Other parts of the world: 1 7

Zero
For the number zero, people say "zero" or "oh." In ordinary speech, people usually say "oh" for zero.
Odd and Even Numbers
Odd numbers are numbers that cannot be divided evenly by two. Even numbers can be divided evenly by two.
Even: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
Odd: 1, 3, 5, 7
So when an English speaker mentions an odd number, he or she doesn't mean the number is strange or unusual. The person means that the number can't be divided evenly by two.
Dozen
Dozen means "twelve." Baker's dozen means "thirteen." This comes from a common practice of bakers giving a free item when the customer buys twelve. English speakers often use dozen to describe an approximate number.
Dozens of people were inconvenienced when the bus broke down.
Tens and Teens
To clearly say numbers such as thirteen and thirty, stress the last syllable of numbers ending in -teen (such as thirteen), but stress the first syllable of numbers ending in -ty (such as thirty).

In general, we say numbers in groups of hundreds, tens, and ones.

We can shorten numbers from 101-999 by leaving off the word hundred.


AVOID THE Error
Do not use and before the last word of a number.


Using Numbers and Number Words
In informal writing, such as notes and e-mails, use numbers for all numbers. In formal writing, such as reports for school or business letters, use number words for numbers you can write in one or two words. Use numbers for larger or more complicated numbers.
This table shows when to use numbers or number words in more formal kinds of writing:


AVOID THE Error
In formal writing, always use number words when a number is first in a sentence. If the number is very long, rewrite the sentence so the number is not at the beginning of the sentence.


Writing and Saying Larger Numbers
Say longer numbers in groups of ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, and so on. When you write longer numbers, use commas to separate groups of three numbers.


AVOID THE Error
Do not use a period to separate groups of numbers in a larger numberâuse a comma.


The largest numbers frequently used in everyday speech are million (1,000,000) and billion (1,000,000,000). A millionaire is a person who has at least a million dollars. A billionaire has at least a billion dollars. Larger numbers, such as trillion (1,000,000,000,000), are rarely used.

AVOID THE Error
You may hear English speakers use words such as zillion or gazillion to refer to very large numbers or amounts. These words express a large quantity or number, but they are not actual numbers. Do not use these numbers in formal speech or writing.


Write and say very large approximate numbers this way:


AVOID THE Error
Do not make the words million and billion plural when they are accompanied by a number.

You can use millions and billions when they are not accompanied by a specific number:
 Each year, millions of people visit Disney World.
 McDonald's has served billions of hamburgers worldwide over the years.

Decimals and Fractions
We use decimals and fractions for numbers smaller than one and greater than zero.

Follow these rules for writing and saying decimals and fractions:
 When saying numbers with a fraction, we say and before the fraction.
You see: 
You say: two and three-fourths
 When a number includes the fraction , we say a or one.
You see: 
You say: five and a half or five and one-half
 For decimals (except money), we can use and or the word point.
You see: 2.2
You say: two and two-tenths or two point two
 For numbers less than one, we can say point or omit it. We can also say oh (for zero) or omit it.
You see: 0.3
You say: oh point three, point three, or three-tenths

AVOID THE Error
When writing decimal fractions, use a decimal point (.), not a comma.


In the United States, people express temperature in Fahrenheit, except in scientific contexts, when Celsius is used. Use the degree symbol (Â°) with F or C to indicate the temperature scale.
Water boils at 212Â°F or 100Â°C.
Amounts of Money
In general, people say amounts of money in groups indicating dollars and cents. Join the dollars and cents groups with and.

However, people sometimes leave off the words dollars and cents and some of the number words, especially when it's clear they are talking about money.

When the amount of cents is less than ten, we can say the number of cents in two ways:
Twenty-nine dollars and three cents
Twenty-nine oh three
The value of U.S. coins in numbers does not appear on all coins. U.S. coins have special names, but they appear only on some coins. The size of a coin does not indicate relative value, either. Nickels are bigger than dimes, but they are worth less. Dimes are slightly smaller than pennies, but they are worth more. The following table gives the value of each coin:

In everyday speech, a popular slang expression for dollar is buck. People use this word in friendly, casual conversation.
Hey, you owe me five bucks for lunch!
I just won fifty bucks in the lottery! Let's go out for pizza!
Telephone Numbers
In general, people say telephone numbers as single numbers, with a very short pause after each group of numbers,

Phone numbers with many zeros may be pronounced differently, especially if the number is for a large company.

In general, in the United States, always give the area code with your phone number. Americans write the area code in several ways.


AVOID THE Error
In text messages and emails, people may omit punctuation marks from phone numbers. This is acceptable only in very informal messages and communications. In North America, you will see phone numbers written with and without the initial 1. That initial number is always dialed, however.


Addresses
In general, people say addresses as follows:

You may occasionally hear small differences in larger numbers:
One-oh-oh-five Evergreen Terrace
One thousand five Evergreen Terrace

AVOID THE Error
In street addresses, write the building number before the street name, not after it. Do not use a comma between the building number and street name.


Time
In general, you can spell out the time in whole hours (e.g., five o'clock) or use numbers (5:00) when you are writing sentences. Write the time in numbers when you want to emphasize a specific time.
I always get up at 5 o'clock in the morning.
I always get up at five o'clock in the morning.
The first bus leaves at 5:41 in the morning.

AVOID THE Error
When we state in a sentence the time of an appointment or a departure, we use at, not to.


In date books and schedules, always write the time in numbers.
SCHEDULE FOR SATURDAY
  9:30 Dentist
10:30 Go to bank, post office, and supermarket
12:00 Meet David for lunch
In informal writing, you can express time in whole hours with or without ":00". If the meaning is clear, you can also omit o'clock.


AVOID THE Error
When saying the time written with ":00", you do not need to say anything for ":00". Just state the hour and o'clock if it's needed for clarity.
You see: 9:00
You say:


Here are some common ways of saying the time:


AVOID THE Error
O'clock is always written with an apostrophe. It's a contraction of of the clock, but no one says the full form.

Use o'clock with the time only when the time is a full hour.


Use A.M. for times from 12:00 midnight to 11:59 in the morning. Use P.M. for times from 12:00 noon to 11:59 at night.
Please be at work at 9:30 A.M. sharp!
The restaurant opens at 11 A.M. and closes at 11 P.M.

AVOID THE Error
Unlike many countries, the United States does not use a twenty-four-hour system to write the time. For example, in many parts of the world "4 P.M." is written "16:00". Always write the hours in numbers from 1 to 12, and use A.M. and P.M. to clarify whether the time is before or after noon.

You will see the A.M. written with and without periods. Both styles are correct.
Your appointment is at 9:00 AM tomorrow.
Your appointment is at 9:00 A.M. tomorrow.

English speakers use morning to describe times from midnight (12:00 A.M. to 11:59 A.M.), afternoon to describe times from 12:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M., evening from 6:00 P.M. to about 10:00 P.M., and night from 8:00 P.M. to midnight.
She came home from the party at 2:00 A.M. in the morning!
We always eat dinner at 7:00 in the evening.
The kids go to bed at 8:30 at night.

AVOID THE Error
Many English speakers confuse 12:00 A.M. (midnight) and 12:00 P.M. (noon).

To tell the difference, remember that we eat lunch in the afternoon (P.M.).

To say approximate times, use about, almost, around, or nearly.
It's nearly 8 o'clock.
Let's eat dinner at about 6:00.

AVOID THE Error
Almost and nearly can be used only after the verb be or the preposition until.


Using Ordinal Numbers
We use ordinal numbers to show order. We usually write ordinal numbers in number words when we talk about the order of events.
Megan finished first in the marathon.
In casual writing, we can use numbers.
She won 2nd place in the contest!
Dates
We use a mixture of ordinal and cardinal numbers to write and say dates. Use cardinal numbers to write the day. Use ordinal numbers to say the day. This table shows how to write and say dates:


AVOID THE Error
Do not use ordinal numbers to write the date.


When writing the complete date, write:
 The month
 The day in cardinal numbers
 A comma
 The year in cardinal numbers

Say years in two groups of numbers.

People say years in the twenty-first century in two ways:

This table shows how to write and say dates:


AVOID THE Error
In the United States, people do not write the day before the month when writing dates. Take care to write dates in this order: the month, the day, a comma, and the year.


You can also write the date with slashes and numbers: 7/20/2009. You can leave off the first two digits of the year, as long as the meaning is clear: 7/20/09. When filling our official forms, it's best to use the complete year: 3/6/2017.
In the United States, Independence Day is written in words or number words when it refers to the holiday. To save space, often the ordinal number is used in posters and announcements of holiday events.
People love to watch fireworks on the Fourth of July.
People love to watch fireworks on the 4th of July.
Centuries
Use ordinal numbers to say centuries.
We live in the twenty-first century.
George W. Bush was elected president at the end of the twentieth century.

DETERMINERS
Determiners are words that come before adjectives and nouns. They include a/an, some, the, this, that, these, and those. Determiners tell whether we are talking about a specific noun or a kind of noun in general.
He wiped the badly cracked windshield with a grimy, old rag.
We cooked some delicious vegetarian fried rice this morning.
That handsome young gentleman is my nephew.
Please put these new wooden chairs with those old reading tables at the other end of the room.
For more information on the order of words before a noun, see page 104.
A/An
A/An means "one thing or person." You can use a or an before a singular countable noun.
I just bought a new car.
Mrs. Wallace is a very nice neighbor.
I received a nice birthday present from my sister.
I'd like a double cheeseburger, please.
Look! An elephant!
For more information on countable and uncountable nouns, see page 51.

AVOID THE Error
Use the after a second reference to the same noun. Do not repeat a.


Use a/an to say what something or someone is.
A Porsche is an expensive car.
A Lhasa Apso is a kind of dog from Tibet.
Morocco is a country in Africa.
Sue is a professor.

AVOID THE Error
Do not omit a or an when stating someone's profession.

That company lost more than a/one hundred thousand dollars in the stock market yesterday.
That watch costs over a/one thousand dollars.
We need a/one hundred more boxes of cookies for the cookie sale.

AVOID THE Error
In situations other than numbers such as hundred and so on, do not substitute one for a.

Use one only to give emphasis to the number.
 Please bring me one doughnut, not two.
If you give special stress (loudness) to the word one, you can say:
 Please bring me one doughnut.

A is usually pronounced //.
Give me a hand, please.
When a is stressed to show special importance, it is pronounced /e/.
Please give me a pencil, not two.
Use a + day to talk about the day.
Today is a beautiful late September day.

AVOID THE Error
Use one day to talk about an indeterminate day in the past.


Use a to talk about prices by weight, such as per-pound prices.

Bananas are only 33 cents per pound this week.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the to talk about prices per pound, ounce, and so on. Use a.


Choosing Between A and An
Follow these rules for choosing between a and an.
 In general, use a before a consonant and an before a vowel.
I'd like a salad and a large orange juice, please.
Please give me an apple and an orange.
 Use an before a silent initial h. Words with silent h include hour, honor, herb, and honest.
Please be ready to leave in an hour.

She is from a European country.

AVOID THE Error
Another is one word, not two. It means "a different."


Some
Some means "an amount of something." Use some with uncountable nouns and plural countable nouns.
I'd like some orange juice.
John sent his wife some flowers on Valentine's Day.

AVOID THE Error
Never use a or an with uncountable nouns. Use some.


We can use some to mean "a few" or "not all."
I like some cats. (I don't like all cats.)
With plural countable nouns, we can use a number instead of some:

With uncountable nouns, we can use a number plus a partitive:


AVOID THE Error
In casual speech, you may hear speakers use some with a singular count noun, especially a person. They do this to show dislike. Avoid using some with a person to prevent misunderstanding.



AVOID THE Error
The following nouns are uncountable in English but not in many other languages: bread, news, information, furniture, work, research, and spaghetti. Do not use a with these nouns. Use some, and do not make these nouns plural.

Do not confuse job and work. Job is a countable noun that means "an employment" or "a task." Work is an uncountable noun. When we use work with an article such as some or this, this word refers to tasks we have to do. We can use work without an article to mean "a job."


To ask questions about a word preceded by some, use any in place of some.
Do you have any pens?
Do we need any apples?
In informal English, we can use some in these questions, usually with the idea that the answer is affirmative.
Do we have some apples?
The

I need to go to the bank, the post office, and the library.
The cashier gave me too much change.

Tom went camping with the Boy Scouts this weekend.
She joined the army when she graduated from high school.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the when referring to organizations' acronyms. An acronym is an abbreviation that is said as a word.


Use the with rivers, seas, and oceans.
The Mississippi is the longest river in the United States.
I've never seen the Pacific Ocean.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the with lakes.


Do not use the for most countries.

Use the with nationalities.
The British settled North America.
The French are famous for excellent cooking.
The ancient Greeks invented democratic government.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the with languages.


Zero Article
A noun with a zero article has no article.
He ordered ham and eggs.
I smell roses.
Do you want coffee or tea?
He has lots of luggage.
Use the zero article with an uncountable noun or a plural countable noun when the noun has a general meaning.
Fresh bread smells delicious.
Flowers grow in spring.
Let's make cookies tomorrow.
Use the zero article with meals, sports and games, cities, countries, and towns.
What do you want for breakfast?

He lives in Paris, France.
Let's play cards tonight.
The is used with a few countries. For information, see page 82.

Next week we will have a test.
Your appointment is on Monday.

AVOID THE Error
Articles with the names of sicknesses are complicated.
 Use a/an with cold, headache, and fever.

 Use the with flu.

 Use the zero article with serious maladies such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, arthritis, and hepatitis.


This, That, These, and Those
Use this, that, these, and those + noun to talk about specific objects or people that are near or far. This and that are singular; these and those are plural. Use this and these for nearby objects or people; use that and those for distant people or objects. This table summarizes the meaning of this, that, these, and those:


AVOID THE Error
You may hear some people use the improper form them in place of these and those. The correct forms are these and those.


Here are some examples of this, that, these, and those.
Would you like this baked potato?
These French fries are too salty.
I never want to visit that town again!
Please take those shirts to the laundromat.

AVOID THE Error
This, that, these, and those should agree in number with the nouns they go with. If the noun is singular or uncountable, use this or that. If the noun is plural, use these or those. Be careful to use the correct form when modifiers come between the demonstrative adjective and the noun.


This, that, these, and those are also used as pronouns. See page 98 for more information.

PRONOUNS
Pronouns take the place of nouns. Pronouns include I, you, he, she, it, we, they, me, him, her, us, and them. We use pronouns such as he, she, it, and them to avoid repeating nouns. We use the pronouns I, you, we, me, and us to refer directly to people who are present in a place or situation. A pronoun has the same meaning as the noun it replaces or refers to.
I think that we are ready to begin. Are you ready, too? (I, we, and you refer to people who are present while the speaker is talking.)
Chuck is a good friend of mine. He lives in Chicago.
Tom visited Barcelona. It's a beautiful city.
Mary Jane likes these shoes. She wants to buy them.
Mark only has a little cut. Mark didn't hurt himself badly.
These are the subject, object, and reflexive pronouns in English:

One is an indefinite subject pronoun. Oneself is an indefinite reflexive pronoun. They are used for making general statements that are used in more formal contexts.
One needs to be careful going out late at night.
It's easy to hurt oneself on a large waterslide.
In most settings, especially informal ones, English speakers use you to make general statements. In these statements, you refers to people in general, not to the listener.
You need to be careful going out late at night.
It's easy to hurt yourself on a large waterslide.

AVOID THE Error
Usually, you is not acceptable in formal writing, such as essays for school. One is too formal for essays or business letters. In these types of writing, avoid using you and one by paraphrasing.


For information on possessive pronouns, see page 112. For demonstrative pronouns, see page 98.
Subject Pronouns
Here are all the subject pronouns:

Subject pronouns refer to another noun or person in the situation who is the subject of the sentence.
He lives here.
I am a construction worker.
We use it to form impersonal expressions. In impersonal expressions, it is not a pronoun and does not replace or refer to another word.

For information on expressions with the impersonal it, see page 267.
Some languages have only one pronoun for singular nouns. English has three separate pronouns for singular nouns:


AVOID THE Error
Do not change pronouns when referring to the same person.


In addition to gender (he, she, or it), English pronouns have number (singular or plural). He, she, and it are singular. They is plural.

AVOID THE Error
Subject pronouns should agree in gender with the words they replace.

Subject pronouns should agree in number with the words they replace.


In general, use it and they to refer to people and animals. Use he and she to refer to people.
Many Americans have a special fondness for their pet dogs and cats, and refer to them with he and she.
My dog is a Lhasa Apso. She is a really nice dog.
Lassie is a very famous dog. She was featured in several movies and TV shows.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use he and she to refer to objects or things. It's possible to use he and she to refer to animals, especially pets. (Many people say he or she to refer to pets.)


We use object pronouns after the verb be.
It was me who spilled coffee all over the break room floor.

AVOID THE Error
English speakers no longer use subject pronouns after the verb be, though some very traditional grammar books may tell you differently.


A subject is required in all English sentences.

AVOID THE Error
Do not omit the subject of an English sentence.


Compound Subjects
A compound subject consists of two or more nouns or pronouns.
Phil and Erica are getting married next year.
He and she met each other three years ago.

AVOID THE Error
For the sake of politeness, people usually mention themselves last in a compound subject.

Do not use object pronouns in compound subjects.

Do not use we in a compound subject in place of I.


Subject Pronouns with Than and As
In comparative sentences with than and as, use a subject pronoun when the pronoun is the subject of the comparison.
He is nicer than she.
He is as nice as she.

AVOID THE Error
In informal speech and writing, native speakers often use an object pronoun after than and as. This is acceptable in everyday speech, but should be avoided in more formal kinds of writing, such as papers for school.
 Formal English

 Informal English
â He is nicer than her.

Object Pronouns
Object pronouns receive the action of the verb.

Object pronouns can also be the object of a preposition.

Indirect Objects
An indirect object tells who or what the action was done for. We can express an indirect object in two ways:
 For or to and the indirect object or pronoun
Sam moved to Chicago last month, so we gave a going-away party for him.
We gave presents to them.
 The verb followed by the indirect and direct objects
Sam moved to Chicago last month, so we gave him a going-away party.
We gave them presents.
With some verbs, we state the indirect object with for or to. Usually, the preposition for implies that someone is being helped.
We sent it to them. (They received it.)
We sent it for them. (We helped them by mailing it.)
I wrote a letter for him. (I helped by writing the letter.)
I wrote a letter to him. (I sent him the letter.)
Compound Objects
A compound object consists of two or more nouns or pronouns.
He gave Mary and him a thoughtful wedding gift.
For the sake of politeness, people usually mention themselves last in a compound object.
The boss gave Vickie and me a difficult assignment.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use subject pronouns in compound objects.


Indefinite Pronouns
English has a number of indefinite pronouns, such as all, neither, several, everybody, oneself, both, and so on.
Everyone loves ice cream!
Do you want chocolate or vanilla? I don't want either. I want strawberry.
Some indefinite pronouns are singular; others are plural.
Singular: another, anybody, anyone, anything, each, either, everybody, everything, nobody, no one, neither, nothing, one, oneself, somebody, someone, something
Plural: both, few, many, others, several
A few indefinite pronouns are singular or plural, depending on the use: all, any, more, most, none, some.
All the neighbors are invited to the block party. (Neighbors is plural.)
All the furniture was covered in dust. (Furniture is an uncountable noun.)
English speakers use you and they to make general statements.
You should always stop completely at a red light.
I wonder if the train is late. I hope they make an announcement.
English speakers often use they and them in place of he or she when they do not know if the person is male or female.
Who's knocking at the door? I don't know, but don't let them in.
If an employee loses their ID badge, they have to go to the security office to request a new one.

AVOID THE Error
In very formal writing, avoid using they, their, and them to refer to unknown or indefinite singular nouns. Use he or she, or rewrite the sentence.


We can use it to refer to conditions in general. This it is impersonal and does not refer to a specific noun.
I like it here.
Reflexive Pronouns
A reflexive pronoun is an object pronoun that refers to the same person as the subject of the verb. A reflexive pronoun can be a direct or indirect object.
He cut himself. (direct object)
I bought myself a new car. (indirect object)

AVOID THE Error
You may hear some people use the improper forms hisself, themself, and theirselves. The correct forms are himself and themselves.


Reflexive pronouns are: myself, yourself, himself, yourself, yourselves, and themselves.

AVOID THE Error
Reflexive pronouns always agree with the subject of the sentence.


The reflexive pronouns are the only pronouns in English that have singular and plural forms for you: yourself and yourselves.
Laura, did you hurt yourself when you slipped?
You kids need to stop running around, or you'll hurt yourselves.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use yourself or yourselfs in place of yourselves.


English speakers use reflexive pronouns to emphasize that they are doing the action. In these cases, the word is not a true reflexive.
I cleaned the whole house myself.
Mary Lou knitted this sweater herself.

AVOID THE Error
Avoid pronoun shift. Pronoun shift happens when you refer to a noun with pronouns of a different person, number, or gender. For example, you first refer to a person with you, and then switch to they. When you refer to a noun with a pronoun, all of the pronouns that refer to that noun should be in the same person, gender, and number.

Do not use a reflexive pronoun in place of a subject pronoun.


Reflexive verbs often use reflexive pronouns. Common reflexive verbs include cut, hurt, look at, and admire. For more information on reflexive verbs, see page 204.

AVOID THE Error
In English, reflexive pronouns are used less frequently than in many other languages.

In English, it's unusual to have a reflexive pronoun and a direct object, unlike other languages.


Demonstrative Pronouns
This, that, these, and those can be used as pronouns. This and that are singular; these and those are plural. Use this and these for nearby objects or people; use that and those for distant objects or people.

This is delicious.
Please hand me that.
I don't like these.
Please give me one of those.

AVOID THE Error
Avoid unclear reference with pronouns. Unclear reference happens when a pronoun can refer to more than one word or has no clear reference.


Interrogative Pronouns
We use the interrogative pronouns to form questions. The main interrogative pronouns include who, what, where, when, why, and how.
Who did you call?
What did you order?
Where did you go on vacation?
When did you arrive?
Why did you sell your car?
How did you know?
Use the interrogative pronoun what to ask for the definition of a job or role.
What is an ambassador? (a country's representative to a foreign government)

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the pronoun who to ask for the definition of a job or position.

ADJECTIVES
An adjective is a word that modifies, or describes, a noun or a pronoun. Adjectives usually come before the noun.
The clouds are heavy and dark.
For information on nouns, see page 47.

AVOID THE Error
In general, adjectives do not appear after nouns in English.


In a few cases, however, adjectives appear after the noun. Adjectives go after:
 Indefinite words
Let's go someplace warm.
 Measurement words
The pool is six feet deep.
 Direct objects
She painted her car purple.
 Linking verbs
She is busy in the kitchen.
For more information on linking verbs, see page 122.

AVOID THE Error
Some adjectives do not appear before a noun. They appear only after a linking verb. These verbs include afraid, alive, alone, asleep, ready, sorry, sure, and unable.

Some of these errors can be corrected by using a different adjective.


Common linking verbs include be, become, appear, smell, taste, and look. Smell, taste, and look can be action verbs or linking verbs.
He tasted the ice cream. (action verb)
The ice cream tasted delicious. (linking verb)

AVOID THE Error
Use an adjective, not an adverb, after verbs such as feel, taste, and smell, when they are linking verbs.

For more information on adverbs, see page 222.

Formation of Adjectives
We can use a number of suffixes to form adjectives from verbs and nouns. The following table shows some of these suffixes and the adjectives they form:


AVOID THE Error
Adjectives do not have plural forms in English.


-ed and -ing Adjectives
A number of adjective pairs are formed by adding -ed or -ing to a verb.

Each adjective in the pair has a different meaning. Adjectives ending in -ing describe the feeling produced by an object or person. Adjectives ending in -ed describe the feelings of a person.


AVOID THE Error
Not all adjectives that end in -ed are formed from verbs. Some are formed from nouns. These adjectives do not have -ing forms.


Nouns as Modifiers
Sometimes, a noun can modify another noun.


AVOID THE Error
When a noun modifies another noun, the first noun is usually singular.

If a noun is usually plural or refers to people, it can be plural when modifying another noun.


Order of Adjectives
When more than one adjective comes before a noun, the adjectives often are ordered according to the following table:

If the noun has a purpose (a word that says what the noun is used for or used to do), the adjective that describes the purpose goes right before the noun.
a beautiful flower vase
a red delivery van
a large neoprene water bottle
a small plastic drinking bottle
Put possessive nouns, possessive adjectives, determiners, and numbers before the first adjective.
Mike's brand-new SUV looks great.
He took several beautiful photographs of the parade.
I'd like four fresh loaves of Italian whole wheat bread, please.
Mack wants to see an exciting action movie, but Sienna wants to see a romantic love story.

AVOID THE Error
When adjectives come after a linking verb, we usually put and before the last adjective.

When adjectives come before a noun, we usually leave out and.


For information on using commas with adjectives, see page 36.
An intensifier such as really or very can come before an adjective or group of adjectives.
This chocolate cake is really delicious.
He bought a very expensive new imported bicycle last year.
An intensifier is a kind of adverb. For information on adverbs, see page 222.
Comparison of Adjectives
We use comparatives and superlatives to compare two or more things. We can talk about which person or thing is bigger, smaller, taller, older, more expensive, and so on. Comparatives are formed with ... -er than and more ... than. We use comparatives to talk about two things. Superlatives are formed with the ... -est and the most. ... We use superlatives to talk about three or more things.


AVOID THE Error
Do not use the comparative to compare three or more things; use the superlative.


... -er than and the ... -est
Use ... -er than and the ... -est with one-syllable adjectives and two-syllable adjectives that end in -y.
Chicago's John Hancock Center is taller than New York's Empire State Building.
Taipei 101 is the tallest building in the world.
This box is heavier than that box.
The red box is the heaviest.

AVOID THE Error
Do not say taller from. Use taller than.


To spell comparatives with -er and -est, follow these rules:
 Add -er or -est to most adjectives.

 When an adjective ends in a consonant + y, change the y to i and add -er or -est.

 When an adjective ends in a vowel + consonant, double the final consonant and add -er or -est.

 When an adjective ends in a vowel, add -r or -st.

More ... Than and The Most ...
Use more ... than and the most ... with most adjectives of two or more syllables.
English is more difficult than Spanish. Arabic is the most difficult language.

AVOID THE Error
A few two-syllable adjectives use -er: simple, quiet, narrow, and shallow.

A few adjectives have two forms, such as handsome and angry.
 Joel is more handsome than Conroy.
 Joel is handsomer than Conroy.


AVOID THE Error
Avoid double comparatives and superlatives.

Do not use then in place of than.


Irregular Comparatives and Superlatives
Some adjectives do not follow the regular pattern. The following table shows some important irregular comparatives and superlatives:


AVOID THE Error
Do not use more good for better or the most good for the best.


Here are some sentences with examples of adjectives that do not follow the regular pattern.
His grades this year are much worse than last year's.
He wore his best suit to the party.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use best in place of an adjective such as great, excellent, or another positive adjective. Use best only when you are comparing three or more things.

When the comparison is equal, we use as ... as. ...
John is as nice as Mary.

Expressions with So + Adjective + That
We can use so + adjective + that to talk about extreme conditions and their consequences.
She is so intelligent that she graduated from high school when she was sixteen.
I'm so tired that I need to take a nap.
Expressions with Too ... To
Too ... to can be used to talk about extreme conditions and their consequences.
I am too tired to work.
John's son is still too young to talk.
We can say too + adjective in shortened versions of too ... to expressions, especially in informal settings.
It's too hot. (meaning that it's too hot to be comfortable, to do anything, etc.)
Expressions with So ... To ...
So ... to can be used to describe our feelings about doing something.
I am so excited to meet her.
I am so happy to have passed that test.

AVOID THE Error
Be careful about substituting too for very, so, or really. Sometimes doing so changes the meaning.
He is very proud to meet her. (He is extremely proud.)
He is too proud to meet her. (Because of his pride, he won't meet her.)
Sometimes, the substitution does not make sense.


We can also use so + adjective to express a strong feeling. This is especially common in informal language. Usually speakers say so with special emphasis.
This yogurt is so good!
Allen is so cute!

AVOID THE Error
In formal English, use very, extremely, or another qualifier instead of so.


Adjectives + Infinitives and Adjectives + That Clauses
These adjectives can be followed with an infinitive or a that clause to tell how someone feels about a situation:

Use a that clause if the subjects are different.
I am happy that you came.
I was surprised that we won.
Use a that clause or an infinitive if the subjects are the same.

These adjectives are often used with an infinitive that gives more information:

We are ready to leave.
I'm sorry. I'm not able to go to your party.

POSSESSIVE WORDS
Possessive words show who owns something. These words also show who or what something belongs to. We use possessive words in place of possessive nouns. There are two kinds of possessives: possessive adjectives and possessive pronouns. For information on possessive nouns, see page 54.
We use possessive adjectives in front of nouns. The possessive adjective shows who or what the noun belongs to.
His computer isn't working today.
Marianne parked her car down the street.
We use possessive pronouns in place of nouns. A possessive pronoun can be the subject of a sentence, be the object, or follow a verb such as be.


AVOID THE Error
Do not use apostrophes with possessive adjectives or pronouns.


This table shows all the possessive adjectives and possessive pronouns:


AVOID THE Error
Do not use the + possessive adjective. Use the or the possessive adjective.

Do not use the + possessive pronoun. Use only the possessive pronoun.


Your and yours are both singular and plural.


AVOID THE Error
There is no possessive pronoun its.


His and her agree with the possessor.
I heard that Mary has a new boyfriend. Her new boyfriend is really cute!

AVOID THE Error
His and her should agree with the possessor, not with the thing possessed.


His is both a possessive pronoun and a possessive adjective.
His name is Max. (possessive adjective)
That car is his. (possessive pronoun)

AVOID THE Error
Mines is not a possessive pronoun. The correct word is mine.


In many languages, speakers use possessive adjectives less frequently than English speakers do. English tends to use these words where other languages use the.

AVOID THE Error
With objects that are closely associated with us, such as clothing or possessions, use a possessive adjective, not the.


Use possessive adjectives to talk about parts of our bodies.
I need to wash my hands.
I hurt my knee while I was rock climbing.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the to talk about body parts. Use a possessive adjective.

However, if another part of the sentence makes the owner of the body part clear, use the.


In English, we use possessive adjectives to talk about our serving of food.
I'd like some ice cream with my pie, please.

AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse the possessive adjective:
 Their with there or they're

 Its with the contraction it's (it is)

 Your with the contraction you're (you are)


Possessive adjectives and possessive pronouns should agree with the words they replace.


AVOID THE Error
Avoid pronoun shift.


When a noun has adjectives before it, the possessive adjective goes before the adjectives.
What is your favorite food?
I lost my new green pen.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the before a possessive adjective or pronoun.


We can use possessive pronouns in expressions with of.
Raymond is a good friend of mine.
Do you know Ron Pope? A friend of his can get us tickets to the big basketball game!
Some relatives of mine will be visiting me next month.

AVOID THE Error
Avoid unclear references with pronouns. An unclear reference happens when a pronoun can refer to more than one word or has no clear reference.


We can use own and of (my) own to emphasize possessive adjectives.


AVOID THE Error
Avoid overusing own. Use own only when necessary to clarify that something belongs to oneself and not another person, or is separate from another's.


Own is also a verb.
John owns that apartment building.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use possessive pronouns with own. Use possessive adjectives.


We can form possessives with a phrase with of and a possessive pronoun.
I saw a good friend of mine yesterday.

AVOID THE Error
Use a possessive pronoun, not a possessive adjective, after of.


We use whose to ask questions about who owns something. The answer to a question with whose is a possessive word.
Whose book is this? It's mine.
Whose is this? It's hers.

AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse who's and whose. Who's is the abbreviation for who is.

VERBS
Verbs are words that indicate an action or a state.
He is running. (action)
He feels tired. (state)
A sentence can have a single verb or a verb phrase.
Rabbits love carrots.
The rabbit is eating a carrot now.
A verb phrase is formed with an auxiliary verb (be or have) plus a present or past participle.
He is eating now.
He has eaten dinner already.
For information on present participles, see page 137. For information on past participles, see page 162-164.
A verb phrase can also be formed with a modal verb and a verb.
He will arrive soon.
He might bring a present.
For information on modal verbs, see page 175.
Verb Tense
Verbs change forms to show different tenses. A tense tells when the action happened.
She loves her new home. (present)
He shopped at the supermarket yesterday. (past)
They will arrive tomorrow. (future)
Verb forms also show whether the action is always true, completed, or in progress.
Giraffes have long necks. (always true)
She is running. (in progress)
He's been a teacher for three years. (began in the past and is true now)
Many verbs are related to nouns or adjectives and have the same forms.
We raced each other. She won the race.
The room is clean. Let's clean the room.
They put the juice in bottles. They bottled the juice.
Sometimes, a suffix will change a word into a verb.
He lowered the shades to darken the room..
He will authorize the employees to leave early.
This table shows suffixes that can change words to verbs:


AVOID THE Error
Do not make new verbs from nouns or adjectives.


Transitive and Intransitive Verbs
Verbs can be transitive or intransitive. Transitive and intransitive verbs are all action verbsâthey show actions. Transitive verbs can have a direct object.
He ate an apple.
An intransitive verb cannot have a direct object.
He swims every morning.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use a direct object with an intransitive verb.


In the last sentence, with her is a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb. It is not a direct object.
Linking Verbs
A linking verb connects the subject of a sentence to information about the subject. Linking verbs are not action verbs. Linking verbs show a state. Common linking verbs include be, become, and seem.
Rhonda is a teacher.
Marylou is sick today.
Jane became a teacher in 2007.
Mark seems tired today.
A linking verb can be followed by an adjective, adverb, or noun.
The book is expensive. (adjective)
The book is on the table. (prepositional phrase that functions as an adverb)
The book is a masterpiece. (noun)
A noun can follow a verb such as be or become, but these nouns are not direct objects. These nouns are complements of verbs. A complement refers to the subject of the sentence.
He became a teacher in 2008. (Teacher refers to he.)
She is our neighbor. (Neighbor refers to her.)

AVOID THE Error
Even though complements are not objects of the verb, speakers normally do not use subject pronouns for them. They use object pronouns.


For more information about pronouns, see page 88.
Some verbs, such as feel, taste, smell, look, and turn, can be linking verbs or action verbs with different but related meanings. This table shows related linking and action verbs:

The following chapters will give more detail on each verb tense.
VERBSBe: Simple Present Tense
We use the present tense of be to show a state or a quality of something at present.
I am happy to meet you.
He's very sleepy this morning.
She is sick today.
The sky is gray today.
Are you ready to order?
They're very busy today.
We also use the present tense of be to show a state or quality that is always true.
The sky is blue.
Marge is a very nice person.
We can follow the verb be with a noun, an adjective, or an adverb.
She's an engineer. (noun)
She's happy today. (adjective)
He's in his office. (prepositional phrase that functions as an adverb)

AVOID THE Error
Do not use have with adjectives or nouns such as hot, cold, hunger/hungry, or thirst/thirsty. Use be + adjective.

Do not use have or having to state one's age. Use be + the age.


Formation
This table shows the affirmative forms of the verb be:


AVOID THE Error
Do not use be in place of am, is, are, and so on.


This table shows the negative forms of the simple present tense of be:


AVOID THE Error
Do not insert no into a sentence to make it negative. Use not or a contraction of not.


In everyday speech and writing, we use contractions. In formal writing, avoid contractions.


AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse homonyms such as its and it's, we're and were, or they're, their, and there. Pronoun + verb contractions (such as it's and they're) always have an apostrophe. The possessive its never has an apostrophe.


For more information on homonyms, see page 15.
He, she, it, we, you, and they + be + not all have two contracted forms. The two forms can be used interchangeably.

I am not has only one contracted form: I'm not.
I'm not in my car. I'm on the bus.

AVOID THE Error
Do not omit the verb be.

Do not use amn't or ain't. Use I am not or I'm not.


Forms of be can also be in contractions with nouns, proper nouns, and question words in speech and informal writing.
Where's the bathroom?
When's the meeting?
How's the salad?
Pat's the boss.
The door's open. Please close it.

AVOID THE Error
In a contraction, an apostrophe replaces the deleted letter or letters.


Questions with Be in the Simple Present Tense
Yes/No Questions
To form yes/no questions (questions that can be answered with either yes or no), invert the subject and the verb and add a question mark:


AVOID THE Error
In informal speech and writing, you may indicate a yes/no question with rising intonation only (that is, without the inversion of subject and verb) and a question markâoften when expressing surprise. In formal writing, always invert the subject and verb and use a question mark.


Wh- Questions
To form wh- questions, add a wh- word (question word) and invert the subject and verb.
Where's the bathroom?
How's the weather today?

AVOID THE Error
When who is the subject of a question, the subject and verb are not inverted. Who is the first word in the question.


Normally, when speaking, people do not say am I not in questions. They usually say aren't I.
Why aren't I getting a raise?
Aren't I a good student?

AVOID THE Error
Do not use I + aren't in statements.

know
like
love
mean
need
own

This table shows the negative forms of the simple present tense:


AVOID THE Error
Do not add -s (or -es) to the main verb in negative sentences.


Spelling the Simple Present Tense
To spell the he, she, and it forms of simple present tense verbs, follow these rules:
 Add -s to the base forms of most verbs.

 Add -es to the base forms of verbs that end in -s, -sh, -ch, -z, or -o.

 For verbs that end in consonant + y, change the y to i and add -es to the verb.

 For verbs that end in vowel + y, add -s.

 Have is irregular: has.
He has a brand-new car.
Pronouncing Simple Present-Tense Verbs
To pronounce the he, she, and it forms of simple present-tense verbs, follow these rules:
 With verbs that end in /s, z, â«, tâ«/, and //, pronounce the ending /z/.

 Pronounce the ending as /s/ with verbs that end in a voiceless consonant such as /f, t, k, p/. (The vocal chords do not vibrate when you say voiceless sounds.)

 Pronounce the ending as /z/ with verbs ending in a vowel or a voiced consonant such as /v, d, g, n, m, l/. (The vocal chords vibrate when you say vowels and voiced consonants.)

For more information on voiced and voiceless sounds, see page 4.
Adverbs with the Simple Present Tense
We often use adverbs such as always, sometimes, never, usually, and rarely with the simple present tense.
He always arrives late.
She never gets sick.
Sometimes, traffic to the beach is backed up for miles.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the present tense of use to to talk about habits in the present. Use the simple present tense. Use to is used in the past tense (used to).


Use be + used to + gerund to talk about things you are accustomed to.
A gerund is a verb ending in -ing that functions as a noun. For more information on gerunds, see page 211.
I am used to getting up at 5:00 A.M. every day.
Questions in the Simple Present Tense
To form questions with the simple present tense, we use the auxiliary verb do.

AVOID THE Error
When you form a question where the main verb is do, do not omit the word do.


Wh- Questions
To form wh- questions, add a question word, delete the ending from the verb (if any), and add a form of do and a question mark.


AVOID THE Error
Delete -s from the main verb in questions in the simple present tense, and add it to do (does). Do not repeat -s (or -es) with the main verb in questions.

When the question word is the subject of the question, do not use do. Add a question word and a question mark.
Mr. and Mrs. Elliott live in this house.
Who lives in this house?

 Actions that are happening right now
He's cooking dinner.

For a list of verbs normally not used in the progressive tenses, see pages 130-131.
Verbs that refer to the senses, such as taste, smell, and so on, have slightly different meanings in the present progressive and simple present tenses. In the simple present tense, they refer to the feeling or sensation that something causes. In the present progressive tense, they refer to the action of smelling, tasting, and so on.
That cheese tastes terrible!
He is tasting the cheese.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the simple present tense to talk about an action that is in progress in the present. Use the present progressive.


Spelling Present Participles
A few simple spelling rules help you write present participles correctly.
 Add -ing to most base verbs.

 If a verb ends in -ie, change -ie to y and add -ing.

 If a verb ends in a consonant and -e, drop the -e and add -ing.

 If a one-syllable verb ends in a vowel and a consonant, double the consonant and add -ing.

 If a two-syllable verb is stressed on the last syllable and ends in a vowel and a consonant, double the consonant and add -ing.
beginning

AVOID THE Error
When adding -ing, do not double the final consonant of a two-syllable verb if the first syllable of the verb is stressed.

When adding -ing, do not double the final consonant if the verb ends in two consonants.

When adding -ing, do not double the final -w, -x, or -y.

AVOID THE Error
If the question word is the subject of the sentence, do not invert the subject and be. Who is the first word in the question.

VERBSImperatives
We use imperatives to give commands, make offers or invitations, give directions, and give warnings.
Formation
Form imperatives using the base form of the verb.
Be quiet! (command)
Stop talking! (command)
Have a can of soda! (offer)
Turn left at the fountain. (directions)
Watch out! A bus is coming. (warning)
For negative imperatives, use do not or don't.
Don't walk on the grass.
Do not drink coffee at bedtime.

AVOID THE Error
We use exclamation marks with imperatives to express strong emotion. If the imperative is a simple instruction or explanation, an exclamation mark is not needed.

For more information on exclamation marks, see pages 32-33.

Use let's to make suggestions and give commands that include the speaker. Let's is short for let us.
Let's go shopping.
Let's hurry up.
The negative form of let's is let's not:
Let's not forget our umbrellas today. It looks like rain.

AVOID THE Error
Let's is almost always used as a contraction.

Let us may be used in highly formal settings, such as speeches.
 On this holiday, let us remember the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King.
Let's is always spelled with an apostrophe.


We can add you to an imperative to soften the imperative or to get the listener's attention.
You sit here for the present.
Making Polite Requests
Imperatives are not always the best way to make a suggestion or a polite request. To make polite requests, you can add the word please to an imperative. Please can come at the beginning or end of a sentence.
Please hang your coat in the hall closet.
Hang your coat in the hall closet, please.
English speakers can also use let's to soften the imperative.
Let's hang your coat in the hall closet.
In addition, English speakers can use sentences and questions with modal verbs such as can or could as a kind of polite request or imperative.
You can hang your coat in the closet.
Can you hang your coat in the closet?
Could you hang your coat in the closet?
English speakers may also make polite requests in the form of advice with the modal verb should.
You should hang your coat in the closet.
For more information on modal verbs, see page 175.

AVOID THE Error
When a polite request is phrased as a question, a question mark is needed.


We can also form polite requests with I'd like and we'd like.
I'd like you to hang your coat in the closet. (In this situation, I'd like is stronger than can or could.)
I'd like is common in restaurants and other situations when you are ordering.
I'd like a large orange juice, please.

AVOID THE Error
In polite situations, use polite requests, not imperatives.


Imperatives with Have and Enjoy
English uses have and enjoy in many expressions in the imperative. We use these expressions to offer invitations and express hopes and wishes.
Have a seat.
Have some more vegetables.
Have a good day!
We hope you have happy holidays!
Have fun on your vacation!
Enjoy your dinner!
Enjoy the movie!

AVOID THE Error
Avoid these translated expressions. Use expressions with have and enjoy instead.


Exercise
A Read each situation, and write an imperative or a polite request.

Yesterday they went to the beach.

AVOID THE Error

Most English verbs are regular and follow these patterns in the simple past tense.
Add -d to verbs that end in a vowel.

If a verb ends in a consonant + stressed vowel + consonant, double the consonant and add -ed.


AVOID THE Error
Do not double a final consonant if the last syllable is not stressed.


Don't double a final w or x. Just add -ed.

If a verb ends in a consonant + y, drop the y and add -ied.

If a verb ends in a vowel + y, add -ed.

Add -ed to all other verbs.


AVOID THE Error
Do not double a final consonant when there are two vowels before it.

Do not drop a final y if a verb ends in vowel + y; just add -ed.


Pronouncing Regular Simple Past-Tense Verbs
The -ed ending is pronounced:
 /t/ after voiceless consonants such as /p, t, k, f, â«, tâ«/ (Your vocal chords do not vibrate when you say voiceless sounds.)

 /d/ after vowels and voiced consonants such as /b, v, g, , z/ (Your vocal chords vibrate when you say vowels and voiced consonants.)

 /d/ after /t/ and /d/

For more information on voiced and voiceless consonants, see page 4.
Irregular Simple Past Verbs
Many verbs are irregular in the simple past tense, though some verbs fall into broad groups with similar changes. The following table summarizes the most common patterns:


For an alphabetical list of irregular verbs, see the section "Irregular Verb List" at the end of the book.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the regular simple-past tense ending with irregular verbs.


Questions in the Simple Past Tense
Yes/No Questions
To form yes/no questions in the simple past, insert did before the subject, change the verb to the base form, and add a question mark:

Wh- Questions
To form wh- questions in the simple past, insert a question word, insert did before the subject, change the verb to the base form, and add a question mark:


AVOID THE Error
Do not use the simple past-tense form of the main verb in questions. Use the base form.

Do not use did in questions with who.


Used to
We can use the simple past tense with used to to describe past habits or actions that we no longer do.
He used to smoke, but he quit more than seven years ago.
I used to live on Mulberry Street.

AVOID THE Error
In questions, used to becomes use to.


Simple Past Tense for Politeness
Sometimes, English speakers will use the simple past tense instead of the present tense to show politeness or respect:
Did you want me to hand in my paper?
We were wondering if you are ready.

AVOID THE Error
Avoid shifts in tense. A shift in tense happens when a sentence or paragraph begins in one tense and then changes tense for no reason.

VERBSPast Progressive Tense
We use the past progressive tense to talk about actions that were in progress in the past.
Last night I was watching old movies on TV.
We also use the past progressive tense to stress that an action took place for an extended period of time.
Last Thanksgiving, we were cooking all morning.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the past progressive tense for habitual actions in the past. Use the simple past tense.


Formation
The past progressive tense is formed with the past tense of be (was or were) and the present participle (verb + -ing). For information on spelling present participles, see page 139.
This table shows how to form affirmative and negative statements in the past progressive tense:

When and While and the Past Progressive Tense
We often use the past progressive tense with the simple past tense. The past progressive tense describes a longer action, while the simple past tense describes a shorter action. The shorter action interrupts or occurs during the longer action. We often use a clause with while to introduce the longer action. The clauses can come in any order.
While I was cooking dinner, the phone rang.
The phone rang while I was cooking dinner.
We can also use a clause with when to introduce the shorter action. The clauses can come in any order.
I was cooking dinner when the phone rang.
When the phone rang, I was cooking dinner.

AVOID THE Error
In sentences with a when or while clause, a comma is needed only if the clause with when or while is first in the sentence.


Questions in the Past Progressive Tense
Yes/No Questions
To form yes/no questions, invert was or were and the subject and add a question mark.

Wh- Questions
To form wh- questions, add a question word, invert was or were and the subject and add a question mark.

Exercises
A Look at Joanne's schedule, and answer the questions.

1. What was Joanne doing at 9:00?
_____________________________________________________
2. What was she doing at 9:30?
_____________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________
4. What was she doing at 12:00?

5. What was she doing at 5:00?

B Complete the sentences by writing the verb in parentheses in the simple past tense or past progressive tense.
1. While I _________________ (wash) the dishes, I _________________ (broke) a glass.
2. She _________________ (drive) home when she _________________ (have) an accident.

5. We _________________ (ate) popcorn while we _________________ (watch) the movie.

VERBSPresent Perfect Tense
We use the present perfect tense to talk about actions that began in the past and continue to the present.
I have lived in Chicago for seven years.
We also use the present perfect tense to talk about actions that have taken place from some indefinite time in the past up to the present.
I've been to Paris three times.
And we use the present perfect tense to describe actions that have been recently completed. We often use just to indicate that an action recently happened.
We've just arrived.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the present perfect tense in place of the simple past tense. The present perfect is a present tense that describes actions that have continued to the present or are important now. The simple past tense describes actions that were completed and finished in the past.


Formation
The present perfect tense is formed with the verb have (have or has) and the past participle.

AVOID THE Error
The verb have is irregular. Remember to use has when the subject is he, she, or it.


This table shows how the present perfect tense is formed:


AVOID THE Error
Use a complete verb phrase in the present perfect tense. Do not omit have or has.


Use the contractions of have ('s and 've) interchangeably with the full forms, has and have, in spoken English.


AVOID THE Error
Do not use contractions of have in formal, written English.


Have is also a full verb. A full verb can stand alone. As a full verb, have means "possess or own." Have does not have contractions when used as a full verb.

AVOID THE Error
When have is a full verb, do not use contractions.


The contractions of has and is are the same: 's.
She's a teacher. ('s is a contraction of is)
She's been a teacher for twenty-seven years. ('s is a contraction of has)

AVOID THE Error
Avoid confusing contractions of is and have when you write the complete forms.


Spelling Past Participles
With regular verbs, the simple past tense and the past participle are the same.

With many irregular verbs, the simple past and past participle are also the same. This table summarizes many irregular verbs whose simple past and past participles are the same:

With other irregular verbs, the simple past and the past participle are different. This table summarizes some of those verbs:

The verb read is spelled the same in the present tense, simple past tense, and past participle forms, but is pronounced like the color word red in the past tense and past participle forms.


AVOID THE Error
Do not use a simple past-tense verb in the present perfect tense. Use the past participle.


For a list of irregular verbs, see the Irregular Verb List at the back of the book.
Adverbs of Time with the Present Perfect Tense
We use certain adverbs of time with the present perfect tense.
For and Since
We use for and since to talk about how long an action has lasted from the past up until the present.
How long have you lived in Chicago?
I've lived in Chicago for seven years.
I've lived in Chicago since 2003.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use:
 A period of time with since. Give the starting time in the past.

 A starting time in the past with for. Give the period of time the action has taken place.


Already and Yet
We use yet to ask whether someone has completed an action up to now. We also use yet to say that we have not completed an action up to now. We use already to state that we have completed the action up to now.
Have you finished your ice cream yet?
No, we haven't finished our ice cream yet.
Yes, we've already finished our ice cream.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use yet in affirmative sentences. Use already.


Ever and Never
We use ever and never to talk about whether we have done an activity anytime up to the present.
Have you ever seen the President in person?
No, I've never seen the President in person.
Yes, I saw him give a speech last year.

AVOID THE Error
In general, do not use ever in affirmative sentences. Only use it in questions.


We can use ever in sentences with superlative adjectives and the present perfect tense or simple past tense.
This is the biggest pumpkin I have ever seen.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use never in sentences with superlative adjectives and the present perfect tense or simple past tense. Use ever.


Just
We use just to describe an action that was recently completed.
She's just arrived.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use an adverb of time such as yesterday or last week, which implies a completed action, with the present perfect tense. If the action is not yet completed or is recently completed, remove the adverb. If the action is completed, keep the adverb and use the simple past tense.


Questions in the Present Perfect Tense
Yes/No Questions
To form yes/no questions, invert have or has and the subject, and add a question mark.

Wh- Questions
To form wh- questions, add a question word, invert have or has and the subject, and add a question mark.


AVOID THE Error
The contraction for who has is who's, not whose.

Who's is also the contraction for who is. Do not confuse these when you write the full forms.


Exercises
A Complete the sentences by writing the correct form of the verb in the present perfect tense.
1. I _________________ (live) in Chicago for five years.

VERBSFuture Tense with Going to and Will
We can talk about the future in several ways. We can use:
 The simple present tense to talk about future actions that are a part of a schedule
My plane leaves tomorrow morning at 9:30.
 The present progressive tense to talk about future plans
On my way home, I'm stopping at the supermarket and the gas station.
We also use:
 Going to or will to talk about predictions about the future

 Going to to talk about plans for the future
I'm tired of cooking. Tonight I am going to eat dinner out.
 Will (or its contraction 'll) to make promises about the future


AVOID THE Error
People often pronounce going to as "gonna." Use gonna in informal speech. In writing and more formal speech, use going to.


Formation
This table shows how to form sentences with will:


AVOID THE Error
Use the apostrophe correctly in the contraction won't. The apostrophe replaces the missing o in not.


This table shows how to form sentences with going to:


AVOID THE Error
Do not omit a form of the verb be (am, is, or are) in sentences with going to.


Questions with Going to and Will
Yes/No Questions
To form yes/no questions, invert be (is or are) or will and the subject, and add a question mark.

Wh- Questions
To form wh- questions, add a question word, invert be or will and the subject, and add a question mark.

Exercises
A Complete the sentences by using going to with the verb in parentheses.
1. Tomorrow, it __________________________ (rain).
2. I __________________________ (get up) early and go swimming every day this week.
3. We __________________________ (go) shopping Saturday morning.
4. I __________________________ (do) the laundry this afternoon.

4. I __________________________ (send) you a postcard from Mexico.
5. I hope you __________________________ (have) lunch with us tomorrow.
VERBSModal Verbs
A modal verb is used with another verb to express ability, permission, obligation and prohibition, necessity, requests, offers and invitations, speculation, and advice.
I can speak three languages. (ability)
You may go to the library. (permission)
You must pay your taxes by April 15. (obligation)
He might be lost. (speculation)
You should arrive on time every day. (advice)

AVOID THE Error
Do not add -s, -ed, or -ing to modal verbs.


Formation
Modal verbs include:


AVOID THE Error
The modal verbs can, could, may, might, must, should, or would are followed by the base form of a verb. Do not use to after these modal verbs. Use the base form of the verb without to. Do not add -s, -ed, or -ing to the base form of the verb.

Use to after ought.

Do not add -s, -ed, or -ing to the infinitive that follows ought.


To form the negative forms of modal verbs, insert not or -n't after the modal verb.
I can't dance very well.
You shouldn't go to bed so late on a work night.

AVOID THE Error
Can + not is written as one word: cannot.


Meanings of Modal Verbs
A modal verb can have more than one meaning. Here are the meanings of the main modal verbs.
Can and Could
Can expresses an ability in the present. Could expresses ability in the past.
I can dance, but I can't sing.
When I was twenty, I could dance all night.
I couldn't finish my dinner, because I had a stomachache.

AVOID THE Error
To express ability in the future, use able to, not can.


Can and could express requests in the present and the future.
Can you help me with my math homework?
Could you bring me a cup of coffee?
Can expresses permission in the present or future.
You can use this computer to send e-mail.
John, you can't stay out past 10:30 tonight.

AVOID THE Error
Normally, we don't turn down a request with "No, you can't," or "No, you couldn't," without giving a reason or more information.


Can and could express possibility in the present or future.
If we have time, we can go to the mall after the movie.
We could get some ice cream after dinner.
Could expresses a suggestion in the present or future.
We could have a mechanic check that used car before we buy it.

AVOID THE Error
Modal verbs cannot be used as infinitives. Use a verb or an expression with a related meaning. For example, for can, use to be able to.


Must
Must expresses an obligation in the present or future.
You must wear a seat belt when you are in a car.
You must not smoke in a movie theater.
The opposite of must is don't have to.
You don't have to take the bus to work. You can walk, drive, or take the subway.
To talk about an obligation in the past, use had to:
I had to file my tax return yesterday.
Have to has a meaning similar to must, but have to is not a modal. It has a past-tense form (had to) and is followed by an infinitive, not a base verb.
We have to leave now.
Our car wouldn't start, so we had to call a tow truck.
Should and Ought To
The modal verbs should and ought to make recommendations or suggestions.
You should see the new Harry Potter movie! It's great!
You should get eight hours of sleep every night.
You shouldn't stay out late at night before work.
You ought to visit your mother more often.
You ought to sell that old car and buy a new one!
You ought to go for a walk in the park since the weather's so nice.

AVOID THE Error
The negative form of ought to is oughtn't to, but English speakers normally do not use this form. Use should not or shouldn't instead.


Had better is also used to make recommendations or suggestions. Generally, had better is a stronger recommendation than ought to or should. The contraction for had better is 'd better.
You'd better hurry up, or you'll be late for work!
You'd better not be late for work again, or you'll get fired!
Would
We use would to talk about what was going to happen in the past.
He said that he would come.
The contraction of would is 'd.
He said he'd come.

AVOID THE Error
The contraction 'd can stand for had or would. Be careful when writing the full form.


Would and was/were going to have similar meanings. Would sounds a bit more formal than was/were going to.

We use would like (or its contraction 'd like) to make polite offers and requests.
I'd like a double cheeseburger, please.
Would you like fries with that?

AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse 'd like (want) with like (prefer).


Would expresses repeated actions in the past.
Every winter we would go sledding and skating.
May and Might
May expresses permission in the present or future.
You may have another piece of cake.
You may not go out after ten o'clock at night.

AVOID THE Error
May is not normally used in ordinary speech to talk about permission. Most speakers use can.


Might expresses an optional action in the future or present.
If you miss the bus, you might take a cab to work.
You might add a bit of lemon juice to your iced tea.
May and might express possibility in the present and future. Generally, may is considered more likely than might.
Where is Mike? He may be in the bedroom.
Tomorrow it might rain.
We may be lost.
We might be lost.

AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse may be (modal verb may and verb be) with may be (an adverb expressing uncertainty).


Must Be, Could Be, Might Be
Three modal verb + be combinations express speculation.
John is absent today. He must be sick. (very certain)
John is absent today. He could be sick. (somewhat certain)
John is absent today. He might be sick. (not very certain)
To speculate that something is not the case, use can't be or couldn't be.
Mr. Fox has been in the hospital for days. He can't be well.
George left for the store ten minutes ago. He couldn't be back already.
Polite Requests with May, Can, and Could
We can make polite requests with may, can, and could.
May I have a glass of water?
Can you close the window, please?
Can I have some sugar for my coffee?
Could you put more paper in the printer, please?
Could you pass me the salt, please?
Normally, we agree to these requests with words such as:
Of course.
Sure.
Yes, you can (may).
Here you go!
Sure, help yourself!

AVOID THE Error
Normally, people do not turn down polite requests with "No, you can't," "No, you may not," or "No, you couldn't," which listeners interpret as impolite. Instead, give a reason.
Can/Could/May I have some stamps?

For more information on polite requests, see page 144.

When can/could, will/would, or may/might follow another clause + that, such as "he says that," use can, will, or may if the first verb is in the present tense. Use could, would, or might if the first verb is in the past tense.
Malcolm says that he will come.
Malcolm said that he would come.
If Malcolm said that he is coming, and the speaker and listener are still waiting for Malcolm to arrive, they might say:
Malcolm said that he will come.
Questions with Modal Verbs
To form yes/no questions with modal verbs, invert the subject and the modal verb, and add a question mark. For wh- questions, insert a question word, invert the subject and modal verb, and add a question mark.
Can you help me shovel the snow?
Where can I buy some stamps?
What time could you leave?
Who should we invite for dinner next weekend?
For questions where the question word is the subject, do not invert the subject and modal verb.
Who can help me fix dinner?
What could cause this problem?

AVOID THE Error
Do not use do or forms of do to form questions or negatives with modal verbs.

VERBSSubject-Verb Agreement
Subjects and verbs should match, or agree: singular subjects need singular verbs and plural subjects need plural verbs.
Abbie loves her dogs. (singular subject and verb)
John and Larry are farmers. (plural subject and verb)

AVOID THE Error
Singular nouns that end in -s, such as politics, news, gymnastics, and mathematics, need a singular verb.



AVOID THE Error
Verbs should agree with the subject of the sentence and not with nouns in phrases or clauses that come between the subject and the verb.


Sometimes subject-verb agreement can be tricky, such as in the following situations:
 In impersonal expressions with there, there is not the subject. The noun that follows the verb is the subject, and the verb agrees with that noun.
There is a snake under the table.
There are some snakes under the table.

AVOID THE Error
In impersonal expressions with there, the verb agrees with the subject of the sentence. The subject of the sentence may not be the word closest to the verb.


For more information on impersonal expressions with there, see pages 270-271.
 A compound subject consists of two nouns joined by and. A compound subject is plural and has a plural verb.
Madonna and Prince are my favorite singers.

AVOID THE Error
Not all subjects joined with and are plural.


 Collective nouns are nouns that include groups of people, animals, and objects but are considered singular and take singular verbs. Collective nouns include team, committee, family, class, pack, and herd.
Our team is winning!
My family always orders vegetarian pizza on Friday nights.
A herd of elephants lives in this zoo.

AVOID THE Error
Police is always plural, so it needs a plural verb.


 The words somebody, anyone, nobody, someone, no one, either, neither, everyone, everybody, anybody, each, and each one are singular and need singular verbs.
Nobody knows the future.
Someone ate all the doughnuts.
Everyone is here.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use plural verbs with words such as somebody, anyone, nobody, someone, no one, either, neither, everyone, everybody, anybody, each, and each one.



AVOID THE Error
No one is written as two words, not one.


 The indefinite pronouns both, few, many, others, and several are plural.
Both are important.
Few people are here.
Are you looking for envelopes? Several are on the table.
Most people are sitting on the main floor, but many are in the balcony.
Some of the wedding guests already sent their presents. Others are sending them after the ceremony.
 A few indefinite pronouns are singular or plural, depending on the use: all, any, more, most, and some.
All (the neighbors) are invited to the block party. (Neighbors is plural.)
All (the furniture) is covered in dust. (Furniture is an uncountable noun.)
 Many grammar books say that none is singular because it means "not one."
None of the girls is here.
However, in ordinary speech, people often use a plural verb with none.
None of the girls are here.
 Money is an uncountable noun, so it takes a singular verb.
Money isn't everything, but it sure makes life easier.

AVOID THE Error
The word dollars is plural, but it takes a singular verb when it is used to indicate an amount of money.

However, people sometimes use dollars with a plural verb when talking about amounts of money.
 Here are twelve dollars.
 Here is twelve dollars.

 Words such as scissors, pants, trousers, and pajamas are plural, so they take plural verbs.
The scissors are on the table.
These trousers need washing.
My pajamas are hanging on a hook.
In formal usage, such as written instructions, you may see scissors treated as a singular word.
Use a scissors to cut the package open.
A scissors is on the table.

AVOID THE Error
When we use pair of with scissors, pants, trousers, and pajamas, the word pair is the subject and takes a singular verb.


 Numbers are usually plural.
Five are here.
However, in some cases, a singular verb is used if we imagine the number as a unit of something.
Eight is enough.
Ten is plenty.
Two miles is not long for a hike.

AVOID THE Error
Total, number, and majority can be singular or plural depending on the words that follow them.


Exercise
A Circle the correct form of the verb.
1. I think that politics (is/are) fascinating.
2. That pair of pajamas (is/are) very old. Let's throw them away.

VERBSPassive Voice
We use the active voice to give importance to the subject of the sentence.
John sold that car weeks ago.
The barking scared off the robbers.
We use the passive voice to give importance to the action.
That car was sold weeks ago.
The robbers were scared off.
Only transitive verbs can be used in passive-voice sentences. Transitive verbs can have direct or indirect objects. This table shows active- and passive-voice sentences with direct and indirect objects:

For more information on transitive verbs, see page 121.

AVOID THE Error
Intransitive verbs, which do not have objects, cannot be used in the passive voice.


Formation
To form the passive voice:
 The subject is deleted.
 The object of the verb becomes the subject of the passive sentence.
 A form of the verb be is added.
 The main verb becomes a past participle.
Here are some examples of active-voice and passive-voice (in bold) sentences.

For a list of past participles, see pages 165-166.
If a verb has a direct object and an indirect object, either one can become the subject (bold) of the passive-voice sentence:


AVOID THE Error
When an object pronoun of an active-voice sentence becomes the subject of a passive-voice sentence, change the object pronoun to a subject pronoun.


To form the passive voice:
 In the simple present or simple past. Use a form of be and the past participle of the main verb.

 In the present progressive tense or the past progressive tense. Use a form of be, the present participle being, and the past participle of the main verb.

 In the present perfect tense. Use have or has, the past participle of be (been), and the past participle of the main verb.

 With modal verbs (including the future tense with will). Use the modal verb, the verb be, and the past participle of the main verb.

 With going to. Use a form of be, going to be, and the past participle of the main verb.

 With an infinitive. Add be before the infinitive.

This table summarizes the forms of active- and passive-voice verbs:


AVOID THE Error
Do not omit be from passive-voice sentences.


To state the doer of the action in a passive-voice sentence, use the subject of the active-voice sentence in a phrase with by.


AVOID THE Error
When the subject of an active-voice sentence is a pronoun and it moves to a by-phrase in a passive-voice sentence, change the subject pronoun to an object pronoun.


Indirect objects from an active-voice sentence can be stated in a passive-voice sentence with to or for.
The girls bought a present for Alice.
The girls gave a present to Alice.
When the indirect object becomes subject of a passive-voice sentence, remove for or to.
Alice was bought a present.
Alice was given a present.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use for or to when an indirect object becomes subject of a passive-voice sentence.



AVOID THE Error
Sometimes the noun that follows to or for is not an indirect object. Rather, the prepositional phrase is really an adverb. When the prepositional phrase is an adverb, the noun cannot become the subject of a passive-voice sentence. Only the direct and indirect objects can become the subjects of a passive-voice sentence.
Active: After the accident, the insurance company gave me money for a new car.


Expressing the doer of the action in a by phrase is optional.
For selling the most cars this month, Mr. Baldus was given a free trip to Jamaica by the sales manager.
For selling the most cars this month, Mr. Baldus was given a free trip to Jamaica.

AVOID THE Error
Because the passive voice focuses on the action, and not on the doer of the action, we usually do not state the doer of the action in a by phrase. Avoid stating the doer of the action in passive-voice sentences. If stating the subject is important, consider using the active voice instead.


Sometimes, the meaning of the sentence changes slightly in the passive voice.
Many people attended the party.
The party was well-attended.

AVOID THE Error
When the doer of the action uses a tool to complete the action, use a phrase with with to show the tool.

When a tool or object does the action itself, use a phrase with by.


Uses of the Passive Voice
We use the passive voice when:
 We are more concerned about the action or the receiver of the action than about the doer.
In Maine Park, more than two hundred trees were damaged by the storm.
An oak tree more than four hundred years old was completely destroyed by the storm.

AVOID THE Error
Reflexive verbs are not used in the passive voice.


 The subject is unknown or indefinite.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
The explosion was heard all over the city.
 We want to avoid assigning responsibility for something.
His car was totaled in the accident.
Your application will be reviewed, and you will be informed of the outcome.
 The subject is vague or unknown.
English is understood in most hotels around the world.
This form needs to be signed.

AVOID THE Error
Do not overuse the passive voice. The passive voice is acceptable in speech and informal writing. But good writers avoid the passive voice in more formal kinds of writing, such as business letters and school papers, when it's possible to use the active voice. Overuse of the passive voice makes writing flat and uninteresting. Use the active voice instead.
 That new house was put up in about three months. First a big hole was dug. Then cement was poured to make the foundation. After that, brick walls were built. Finally, the roof was put on. The house was moved into about a month ago.
 The builders put up that new house in about three months. First, workers dug a big hole. Then a cement truck poured cement to make the foundation. After that, bricklayers built the walls. Finally, carpenters and roofers put the roof on. A family moved into the house about a month ago.

The Get Passive
We can use a form of the verb get and a past participle to form passive-voice sentences. We use the "get passive" in informal English.
Fred got robbed.
They got hurt in the accident.
We got invited to the party.
The students are getting confused.
Max got fired.

AVOID THE Error
Avoid using the get passive in formal, written English.

VERBSTwo-Word Verbs
English has many two-word verbs. Sometimes these are called "phrasal verbs." They are formed with a verb plus a preposition or adverb.
He woke up at 5:30 yesterday.
Then he turned over and went back to sleep.
Please sit down.
He got out of the car.
Like other verbs, two-word verbs can have an object.
Let's turn on the headlights.
Please wake up Jim and Dan.
We will get off the train in another hour.
Two-word verbs are either separable or inseparable, depending on whether the object can come before or after the preposition.

Inseparable Two-Word Verbs
With inseparable two-word verbs, the object of the verb must come after the preposition. It cannot come between the verb and the preposition.


AVOID THE Error
Don't separate inseparable two-word verbs with an object.


Common inseparable two-word verbs include:


AVOID THE Error
Return back is not an English construction. Use return or return + a place.


Separable Two-Word Verbs
With separable two-word verbs, the object of the verb can come after the preposition or between the verb and the preposition.
He turned the TV off. He turned off the TV.
However, a pronoun can go only between the verb and the preposition. A pronoun cannot go after the preposition.
He turned it off.

AVOID THE Error
Don't put the pronoun after a separable two-word verb.


Common separable two-word verbs include:

Exercise

1. He brought up a problem.
2. She turned the lights off.

9. Let's finish up our work so we can go home.
10. He ran into his best friend at the mall.
B Look at the two-word verbs in Exercise A. Based on these examples, are they separable or inseparable? Complete the chart.

VERBSReflexive and Reciprocal Verbs
Reflexive Verbs
We use a reflexive pronoun with a verb when the subject and the object are the same. When a verb can be used with a reflexive pronoun, we call it a reflexive verb.
He taught himself Mexican cooking.
She introduced herself to the audience.
I slipped and hurt myself.
The reflexive pronouns are shown in the following table:


AVOID THE Error
The only pronouns with singular and plural forms are yourself and yourselves.


We often use reflexive pronouns with verbs such as blame, cut, enjoy, hurt, introduce, repeat, and teach.
Mrs. O'Dowd always repeats herself when she's talking.
Phyllis sometimes blames herself for her son's problems.
It's easy to hurt yourself driving recklessly on a scooter.
Let's go around the room and introduce ourselves.

AVOID THE Error
Verbs such as wash and shave imply that the subject and the object are the same, but we normally do not use a reflexive pronoun with these verbs.

In some languages, a reflexive pronoun is used with verbs such as wash and shave, along with a direct object (the part of the body being washed). In English, use only the direct object.

We can use a reflexive pronoun with verbs such as wash, dry, and shave for emphasis.
I dried myself off completely before I got dressed.

Speakers sometimes use reflexive pronouns to emphasize that the subject performed the action personally.
The boss told me himself that we can leave work early today.
If you won't clean the kitchen yourself, then you shouldn't use it.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use a reflexive pronoun as the subject of a sentence.


The verb enjoy is used with a direct object or a reflexive pronoun.
I enjoyed my trip to Spain.
I enjoyed myself in Spain.
When enjoy is used as an imperative, it can be used without a direct object or reflexive pronoun.
Here is your hamburger. Enjoy!
Reciprocal Verbs
Reciprocal verbs have two subjects or a plural subject and imply that the subjects of the verb did the action of the verb to or with one another. With verbs like these, we can use a phrase such as each other or one another.
They met each other in 2007 and got married in 2008.
Those boys keep hitting one another.
Common reciprocal verbs include:

Exercise
A Complete the sentences by writing the correct reflexive pronoun on the line.

2. I am going to buy _________________ a new computer this year.
3. Did you and Mark enjoy _________________ at the party?
4. John always repeats _________________ when he speaks.
5. Alan and Frank introduced _________________ to each other at the meeting.
6. Please let us introduce _________________.
7. I made this bread _________________.
8. Enjoy _________________ in Hollywood, Fred and Ethel!
9. Please don't help me. I want to do it _________________.
10. She sang quietly to _________________ as she sewed.
VERBSInfinitives, Gerunds, and Participles
Infinitives
An infinitive is the base form of the verb with to in front of it.

An infinitive can come after:
 An action verb. As this term implies, action verbs show action.
I hope to go to China this year.
They want him to go to college.
He needs to find his car keys.
 The object of a verb. In this case, the object of the verb is similar to a "subject" of the infinitive.
I want my kids to go to the circus tomorrow.
He asked his neighbors to be quiet after 10:00.
He told his son to do his homework.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use a that clause after want. Use an infinitive.


 A verb such as be, seems, and so on.
Their usual pastime is to watch TV every night.
Andrew seems to be tired today.
You appear to like classical music.
An infinitive can be the subject of a sentence.
To know her is to love her.
To stay indoors on such a nice day would be silly.
To win is my only goal.
An infinitive and all the words that go with it are called an infinitive phrase. An infinitive can have:
 An object
The teacher wants all the students to take their seats.
We need to buy some vegetables.
My boss told me to clean the bathroom.
 An adverb
The librarian told the children to speak quietly.
She wants to leave soon.
I like to work a crossword puzzle every morning.

AVOID THE Error
In formal writing, do not split an infinitiveâthat is, insert another word, such as a negative word or an adverb, between to and the base form of the verb.


An infinitive can follow:
 It's + adjective
It's easy to make homemade bread.
It's fun to ride roller coasters.
It's illegal to drive without a seat belt.
 It's + noun
It's a pleasure to see you.
It's an adventure just to get there!
For more information on impersonal expressions with it's, see page 267.
 A question word, such as how, what, or which
He told us how to get to the train station.
I don't know what to do.
She knows where to buy delicious imported Greek olives.
 A noun such as plan, proposal, recommendation, or suggestion
Her plan to drive for twenty-four hours straight seems unsafe.
His proposal to buy the newspaper company surprised everyone.
I don't like his suggestion to have the picnic on July 18.
 Certain direct objects
I have some phone calls to return.
I have some emails to answer.
She has a lot of work to do these days.
An infinitive can tell the purpose of an action. You can also use in order to + infinitive with this meaning.
She moved to Texas to take a job.
She went to her cottage in order to get away from the city for a few days.
We went to the theater to see Transformers 3.
We went to the theater in order to see Transformers 3.
Use infinitives in expressions with too + adjective + infinitive.
I am too busy to take a lunch break. I am going to eat at my desk.
It's too cold to go to the beach. Let's go to a museum instead.
I am too tired to keep walking. Let's take a rest.

AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse two, to, and too.


Use infinitives in expressions with an adjective + enough + infinitive.
Tanya is old enough to vote.
Ward is smart enough not to buy the first used car he sees.
You are intelligent enough to get into Harvard University.

AVOID THE Error
In everyday speech, when an infinitive follows going, want, and got, people shorten the verb + infinitive to gonna, wanna, and gotta. These short forms are OK in everyday speech, but avoid them in more formal situations and in writing.

Gotta is often short for have got to.


Infinitives Without To
Some verbs are followed by an infinitive without to. Do not use to after let, make (force), feel, watch, hear, or see.
The boss let us leave early yesterday.
The teacher made the boys stay after school.
I heard the choir sing a beautiful song.
I watched a bird build its nest.
The police officer saw a car run a red light.
Can you feel your pulse beat?
We can also use a gerund after watch, hear, see, or feel without a change in meaning.
I heard the choir singing a beautiful song.
I watched a bird building its nest.
The police officer saw a car running a red light.
Can you feel your pulse beating?
For information on gerunds, see page 211.
To is optional after help.


AVOID THE Error
Do not use to with these verbs:
 The modal verbs will, can, could, may, might, would, should, or must

For information on modal verbs, see pages 175-183.
 The auxiliary verb do (did, do, does)

 The verb let's

Use an infinitive with to with the modal verbs ought to and have to/had to.


Gerunds
A gerund is a verb + -ing that is used as a noun.
Swimming is great exercise.
Gerunds are spelled in the same way as present participles. For spelling rules, see page 139.
A gerund can be:
 The subject or object of a sentence
Skiing is fun.
I love skiing in winter and playing golf in summer.
They started laughing.
As subjects, gerunds are more common than infinitives. Using an infinitive as the subject occurs mainly in writing.

For more information on infinitives, see page 207.
 The complement of a verb
Her favorite pastime is sewing.
 The object of a preposition
He's interested in learning English.
This pan is good for frying fish.
She accused him of stealing her purse.
For more information on prepositions, see pages 239-256.
 The object of a verb
I hate ironing, but I like washing dishes.
English has many expressions with go + gerund:
He likes to go fishing.
She loves to go shopping.
Abbie loves to go hiking.

AVOID THE Error
Not all gerunds are used as verbs, and sometimes the gerunds and related verbs have different forms.
These gerunds usually are not used as main verbs: boating, rock climbing, canoeing, mountain climbing, skateboarding, and weight-lifting. These verbs are usually used in expressions with go + gerund.

Others are used as a verb with a direct object.


A gerund can have:
 A direct object
He is good at fixing bikes.
 An adverb
She likes playing music loudly.
 An adjective
The team needs better training.
Mr. Smith has poor hearing.
We can use a name, a possessive noun, or a possessive adjective as the "subject" of a gerund.
I worry about Victor getting into an accident.
Chuck is upset about her asking for a divorce.
A gerund, its subject, its objects, and its modifiers are often called a gerund phrase.

AVOID THE Error
A gerund phrase usually does not require any special punctuation. Do not use a comma, a semicolon, or a colon to set off a gerund phrase.


Most gerunds are uncountable nouns. However, a few are countable nouns. These are some common countable gerunds.

For more information on countable and uncountable nouns, see page 51.

AVOID THE Error
To can come before an infinitive but not before a gerund. However, a few two-word verbs and other expressions with to can be followed by a gerund. Do not omit to from these expressions before a gerund: used to, look forward to, and take to.

For more information on two-word verbs, see page 201.

Verbs Followed by Gerunds or Infinitives
Some verbs can be followed by a gerund, some verbs can be followed by an infinitive, and other verbs can be followed by either.
They want to go to the video store. (only infinitive)
I enjoy reading Harry Potter books. (only gerund)
She loves to dance. She loves dancing. (gerund or infinitive)
She started working as soon as she graduated from college.
She started to work as soon as she graduated from college. (gerund or infinitive)

AVOID THE Error
In sentences with two phrases joined by another word, always join two gerund phrases or two infinitive phrases. Do not join one of each.


Verbs Followed Only by Gerunds
These verbs are followed only by gerunds:


AVOID THE Error
Do not use an infinitive with verbs followed only by a gerund.


Verbs Followed Only by Infinitives
These verbs are followed only by infinitives:



AVOID THE Error
Do not use a gerund with verbs followed only by an infinitive.


Verbs Followed by Gerunds and Infinitives
These verbs are followed by both gerunds and infinitives:

These verbs are followed by gerunds and infinitives without to:

For information on infinitives with and without to, see page 210.
These verbs are followed by gerunds and infinitives but with a difference in meaning:


AVOID THE Error
With verbs such as remember, forget, try, and stop, use a gerund or infinitive appropriately to match your intended meaning.


Participles
There are two kinds of participles: present participles and past participles.
Present participles end in -ing. Present participles are used with a form of the verb be to form the present progressive and past progressive tenses.
He is eating lunch.
They were watching TV.
For rules on spelling present participles, see page 139. For more information on the present progressive tense, see pages 137-138. For more information on the past progressive tense, see page 159.
Regular past participles end in -ed. There are many irregular past participles. For a list of irregular past participles, see page 165. Past participles are used with the verb have to form the present perfect tense.
He has lived here for many years.
They have moved to Texas.
For more information on the present perfect tense, see page 162.
Present and past participles can be used as adjectives.
Freezing temperatures are expected tonight and tomorrow.
Frozen food is very convenient.
This computer is broken.
I need to use a working computer.
This is a fascinating TV show.
The party was very exciting.
Present-participle adjectives describe the feeling produced by an object or person. Past-participle adjectives describe the feelings of a person produced by an object, person, or activity.

Present-participle adjectives can be used in front of a noun or after a verb such as be, feel, and seem.
This is a really boring movie.
Past-participle adjectives can be used before a noun.
The bored children went outside to play.
Only a few past-participle adjectives are used after verbs such as be, seem, and become.
He seems bored.
She became scared.
We felt pleased.
A participle and all the words that go with it, such as adverbs or objects, are called a participial phrase. A participial phrase can modify a whole sentence. An introductory participial phrase is set off with a comma.
Getting ready for the ball, Cinderella had the help of her fairy godmother.
Bored with her homework, Linda decided to watch TV.

AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse an introductory participial phrase with a gerund as subject. A participial phrase requires a comma, but a gerund phrase as the subject does not.


An introductory participial phrase needs to refer to the same person as the subject of the clause that follows it.
Driving to work, I stopped to buy a doughnut.
In this sentence, the person who was driving to work stopped to buy the doughnut.

AVOID THE Error
When a participial phrase doesn't refer to the subject of the main clause, it's called a "dangling participle." Dangling participles can be very confusing to readers. Fix a dangling participle by rewriting the sentence.
 Driving to work, a traffic jam slowed me down. (This sentence implies that the traffic jam was driving to work.)
 Driving to work, I was slowed down by a traffic jam.
 Running to the bus stop, her packages fell on the ground. (This sentence implies that her packages were running.)
 Running to the bus stop, she dropped her packages on the ground.

ADVERBS
Adverbs are words and phrases that modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, and whole sentences. Adverbs modify:
 Verbs
He ran quickly and completed the race in less than a minute.
She gets up early every day.
They already finished their work.
We stayed up late.

AVOID THE Error
An adjective, not an adverb, follows verbs such as be, seem, become, feel, look, sound, taste, and smell.


 Adjectives
This book is extremely interesting.
The meat isn't completely cooked.
His hand was slightly hurt.
I am afraid we are totally lost.
The adverbs quite, really, and very can be used to make many adjectives stronger.
The office is quite clean.
Mr. Williams is really nice.
That question is very difficult.

AVOID THE Error
English speakers usually do not use very with delicious. They say really delicious.


 Other adverbs
He worked exceptionally slowly.
She ran extremely fast.
Chef Smith cooks wonderfully well.
The adverbs quite, really, and very can be used to make many adverbs stronger.
He worked really fast and finished his work in no time.
This sports car can go quite fast.
Ted always listens very carefully.
 Entire sentences
Unexpectedly, the train left the station.
Luckily, I found my car keys in my jacket pocket.
Suddenly, some fireworks exploded in the air above us.

AVOID THE Error
When an adverb is first in a sentence, it's followed by a comma.


Forming Adverbs
Many adverbs are formed by adding -ly to an adjective.

A few -ly words are both adjectives and adverbs.

My son has a weekly piano lesson. (adjective)
Turn in your time card weekly, every Thursday. (adverb)
I am going to take the early bus to work today. (adjective)
I want to get to work very early. (adverb)

AVOID THE Error
Not all words that end in -ly are adverbs. Words such as friendly, lovely, and silly are all adjectives.


Spelling Rules for -ly Adverbs
Follow these rules for spelling -ly adverbs:
 Add -ly to most adjectives.


AVOID THE Error
To form the adverb form of full, add -y, not -ly.


 If an adverb ends in consonant + -le, drop the -e and add -ly.

 If an adjective ends in -y, drop the -y and add -ily.

 If an adjective ends in -ic, add -ally.


AVOID THE Error
The adverb form of public is publicly.


 If an adjective ends in -ue, drop e and add -ly.

 The adverb form of good is irregular.

I didn't sleep well last night.

AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse good and well. Good is an adjective, and well is an adverb.


Many common adverbs do not end in -ly.


AVOID THE Error
Do not add -ly to adverbs such as fast and soon.


Hard is both an adjective and an adverb. Hardly is not the adverb form of the adjective hard. These words have unrelated meanings. The adjective hard means "difficult":
That driving test is very hard.
Preparing a Thanksgiving turkey is not hard, but it takes a lot of time.
The adverb hard means "with great energy or effort."
She studied hard for the test.
Kelly always works hard.
The adverb hardly means "barely."
I've hardly lived here a year.
Conroy, you're hardly eating. Have some more food.

AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse the adverbs hard and hardly.


Phrases can also function as adverbs.
I like to drink hot cocoa before bed. (prepositional phrase)
I rode the bus for half an hour. (prepositional phrase)
We hiked in the park all afternoon. (noun phrase)
My brother hardly ever writes me a letter. (adverb phrase)
He went to the supermarket to buy milk. (infinitive phrase)
They went to the party laughing and singing. (participial phrase)
For information on prepositional phrases, see pages 239-240.
For information on infinitive phrases, see page 208.
For information on participial phrases, see page 219.

AVOID THE Error
Quick and loud are both adjectives and adverbs. These words also have -ly forms. Use the -ly forms in more formal settings.


Kinds of Adverbs
Adverbs are divided into groups depending on how they modify the verb. The kinds of adverbs include adverbs of manner, time, frequency, duration, place, purpose, and probability.
Adverbs of Manner
Adverbs of manner tell how something happens. Common adverbs of manner include:

He installed the new switch wrong, so now the washing machine won't start.
Let's finish our work quickly so we can go home before the blizzard hits.
Adverbs of Time
Adverbs of time tell when an action happens. Common adverbs of time include:

I need to go to the bank today.
Later, we went for a hike.
Victor always arrives late.

AVOID THE Error
Lately is not the adverb form of late. Both words are adverbs and have different meanings.
Late means "after the expected time."

Lately means "recently."


Late is also an adjective.
That teacher is very strict. She won't accept late work.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the adverb lately in place of the adjective late.


When days of the week are used as adverbs, on is optional. We can say Monday or on Monday.


AVOID THE Error
Do not use the definite article the with days of the week.


Phrases with ago act as adverbs of time. These phrases tell how much time passed since an action happened.
He left an hour ago.
The party ended two hours ago.
Frank called a minute ago.

AVOID THE Error
Use the simple past tense, and not the present perfect tense, with adverbs of time that imply a completed action, such as yesterday, last year, and phrases with ago.

For more information on the simple past tense, see page 149.
For more information on the present perfect tense, see page 162.

We often use already and yet with the simple present, present progressive, present perfect tense, or simple past tenses. Use already in statements. Use yet in questions and negative statements.

Adverbs of Frequency
Adverbs of frequency tell how often an action happens. Some adverbs of frequency are:

I never walk to work. I usually drive.
Adverbs of Duration
Adverbs of duration tell how long an action happens. Some adverbs of duration include:

I have lived in Canada since 2006.
We camped in the state park all week.
Adverbs of Place
Adverbs of place tell the location of an action. Some adverbs of place include:


AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse there (adverb) with their (possessive) or they're (contraction of they are).


Adverbs of Purpose
Adverbs of purpose tell why an action happens. Often adverbs of purpose are prepositional phrases, infinitive phrases, and participial phrases.
I walked to work to get some exercise. (infinitive phrase)
I went to the park in order to get some fresh air. (prepositional phrase)
I went to the supermarket for milk. (prepositional phrase)
She walked down the street looking for a restaurant.
For information on infinitive phrases, see page 208.
For information on participial phrases, see page 219.
For information on prepositional phrases, see pages 239-240.

AVOID THE Error
Introductory infinitive, prepositional, and participial phrases are set off with commas:


An introductory participial phrase should refer to the subject of the clause that follows it.
Feeling hungry, I headed to the kitchen.

AVOID THE Error
If an introductory participial phrase does not refer to the same subject as the clause that follows it, readers may feel confused. To fix this problem, rewrite the sentence.


Adverb of Probability
Adverbs of probability talk about whether an action will happen. Some adverbs of probability include:

It will probably rain tonight.
Maybe we can go for a bicycle ride later.
Many children believe that Santa Claus really exists.
Position of Adverbs
Adverbs can be put in many different places in a sentence.
Suddenly, a car came out of nowhere and hit us.
A car suddenly came out of nowhere and hit us.
A car came out of nowhere and suddenly hit us.
A car came out of nowhere and hit us suddenly.

AVOID THE Error
In formal writing, do not split an infinitive by inserting an adverb between to and the base verb.


Adverbs of time, manner, purpose, and place are often put at the end of the sentence.
There was a terrible rainstorm last night. (time)
The rain fell hard and fast. (manner)
She went shopping in order to buy a wedding present. (purpose)
He lives here. (place)
When adverbs of time, manner, purpose, and place are together, they are usually in the order shown in the following table:

An adverb of manner also can go before the main verb.
She happily (manner) planted flowers in the flower beds (place).

AVOID THE Error
Do not place an adverb of time, place, or purpose before the main verb.


An adverb of time, manner, place, or purpose can come at the beginning of a sentence for special emphasis.
Last night, there was a terrible rainstorm.
Busily, she planted flowers in the flower beds.
In the garden, there are many beautiful flowers.
In order to get some rest, he went to his cottage in the country.

AVOID THE Error
In formal English, people usually avoid putting hopefully at the beginning of a sentence. Use the verb hope instead. In informal English, putting hopefully first in a sentence is acceptable.


Adverbs of duration usually go at the end of the sentence.
He was in town (place) for a week (duration).
Adverbs of duration often go before an adverb of time.
My mother-in-law visited us for a month (duration) last year (time).
The adverb of duration still goes before the main verb. Still can go before or after be as a main verb.
He still lives in Texas.
He still is a doctor.
He is still a doctor.
Already usually goes before the main verb or after be as the main verb.
Already can go first or last in the sentence for special emphasis.
We've already seen this Harry Potter movie.
We've seen this Harry Potter movie already.
The children are already asleep.
Yet is usually at the end of the sentence.
We haven't finished eating yet.
Adverbs of frequency and probability go before the main verb. These adverbs go after be when it is the main verb.
We often have to work late.
His plane has probably landed by now.
I am usually busy.
They are probably lost.

AVOID THE Error
The adverb of probability maybe is usually first in a sentence.


Adverbs such as very and really usually go before a main verb, an adjective, or another adverb.
We are really going to Disneyland.
I am very busy.
She answered me very angrily.
The order of adverbs is complex, and English speakers often change the order for special emphasis. Pay attention as you listen and read to see how people change the order to emphasize different parts of the sentence.
Comparison of Adverbs
We use comparatives to talk about two things and superlatives to talk about three or more things.
Forms
ADVERBS OF ONE SYLLABLE

Tim walks faster than Max. Harry walks the fastest.
Mary ran harder than Jane. Katie ran the hardest.
The comparative form of well is better. The superlative of well is best.

The comparative form of badly is worse. The superlative of badly is worst.

ADVERBS OF TWO SYLLABLES OR MORE

Fred finished the test more quickly than Anne. Irene finished the most quickly.
Eleanor writes more beautifully than Jean. Barbara writes the most beautifully.

AVOID THE Error
The comparative form of early is irregular. It adds -er/-est.


Sometimes we can omit than from comparisons.
Work more carefully, please.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use double comparatives or superlatives.



AVOID THE Error
You may hear louder/loudest and more loudly/most loudly. You may also hear both quicker/quickest and quickly/most quickly. Use the -ly versions in formal speech and writing.


For rules on spelling words with -er/-est, see pages 106-107.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the comparative when the superlative is required.

Do not use the superlative when the comparative is required.


Comparisons with As ... As ...
When the two things being compared are equal, we use as ... as. ...
John ran as quickly as Mary.
Michael speaks Chinese as well as a native.
Expressions with So + Adverb + That
We can use so + adverb + that to talk about actions that are extreme and their results.
She worked so quickly that she was finished in an hour.
He was so tired that he slept for ten hours.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use so ... as. Use so ... that.

PREPOSITIONS
We use prepositions and nouns to form prepositional phrases. Prepositional phrases modify, or give information about, other parts of a sentence. Common prepositions include in, on, at, until, since, for, before, after, during, under, behind, opposite, by, above, below, with, and about.
The book is on the table.
Your appointment is at 2:30.

This book is about the history of China.
I need a sip of water.
A noun or a gerund follows a preposition.

On seeing the movie star, the fans began to scream.
A bus stop is near my house.
An infinitive can follow the prepositions but and except.
You can't park here except to unload.
You can't park here but to unload.

AVOID THE Error
An infinitive cannot follow most prepositions. Use a gerund or a related noun instead.


A pronoun can follow a preposition.
I bought this present for you.
I think that this book is by him, too.

AVOID THE Error
If a pronoun follows a preposition, it must be an object pronoun.

For more information on object pronouns, see page 88.

Prepositional phrases modify other parts of a sentence. A prepositional phrase can modify a noun, a verb, an adjective, an adverb, another prepositional phrase, or a sentence.
A woman with bright red hair just entered the room. (modifies the noun woman)
Your shift begins at seven o'clock. (modifies the verb begins)
Your shift ends at three o'clock in the afternoon. (modifies the phrase three o'clock)
I am worried about these bills. (modifies the adjective worried)
He isn't old enough to join the army. (modifies the adverb enough)

Prepositional phrases often give information about time, location, direction, and purpose.

In
Use in to talk about months, years, and seasons.

Your appointment is on April 25.

Use on, not in, with the day of the week + morning, afternoon, evening, or night.


In general, on is optional with days of the week:

Use on with weekend.
On weekends, I often go to the zoo.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use at with weekend in American English. Use on.

Over the weekend, I will paint the kitchen and back stairs.
We use on time and on schedule to state that someone or something is following the schedule.
The train is on time today.
We need to stay on schedule, or we won't finish our work on time.

When we are early, we can say early, ahead of time, or ahead of schedule.
The train is early.
The train is ahead of schedule.
We finished ahead of time.
At
We use at to state specific times of appointments, meetings, classes, and so on.
Your appointment is at two o'clock.

For
We use for to state a period of time.

While
We can use while + gerund to talk about actions that take place during another action.
While running, she hurt her foot.
While driving to the store, I saw an accident.
In sentences such as these, the subject of the main clause is assumed to be the subject of the gerund.
While can also be used to introduce a clause.
While she was running, she hurt her foot.
While I was driving to the store, I saw an accident.

AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse during and while. Different words follow these words. We use during + noun. We use while + gerund or while + clause.

For more information on gerunds, see page 211. For more information on while, see page 160.

In sentences with while + gerund, before + gerund, and after + gerund, the gerund must refer to the same subject as the main clause.
While talking on the phone, she read her e-mail.
Before getting on the train, get your ticket punched.

CONDITIONAL SENTENCES
We use conditional sentences to speculate about the results of actions in the present, future, and past.
If I win the lottery, I'll buy a new car. (future)
If I had time, I'd go to the movies with you. (present)
If we had arrived at the station sooner, we wouldn't have missed the train. (past)
Conditional sentences are formed with two clauses, an independent clause and a dependent clause. A clause has a complete subject and verb.
I am a teacher.
She will get a raise.
An independent clause can stand alone as a sentence.
They are my neighbors.
Dogs are great pets.
A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence.
If I win the lottery
When she arrives
A dependent clause must be linked to another clause. We link dependent clauses to other clauses with words such as if and when. These words are called subordinating conjunctions.
I will always fly in first class if I win the lottery.
This table shows the clauses in future, present, and past conditional sentences:

Conditional sentences have one independent clause and one dependent clause. Since the dependent clause begins with a word such as if, unless, or when, this clause is sometimes called the if clause.
If you lose your apartment keys, you'll need to call a locksmith.
We are going to go to the beach today unless it rains.
When the campfire is ready, we'll cook our hot dogs.

AVOID THE Error
Use a comma between the clauses of a conditional sentence only when the dependent (if) clause is first in the sentence.


The three types of conditional sentences are called conditional 1, conditional 2, and conditional 3.
Conditional 1 Sentences
Conditional 1 sentences talk about actions that are true or possible in the present or future.
If you are ready, we can begin the test.
If my car doesn't start, I'll call a tow truck.
If he has to work tomorrow, we won't go to the mall.
Formation
Conditional 1 sentences are formed with:
 A dependent (if) clause in a present tense (simple present, present progressive, and present perfect)
 An independent (main) clause in the simple present tense or future tense
If he finishes work early, he will go home.
If he's cooking dinner now, he won't want to go out to dinner with us.
If she has received my e-mail, she will come to work early tomorrow.
If you find his mobile phone, return it to him.
For more information on the present tense, see pages 124 and 130.
For more information on the imperative, see page 143.
For more information on the future tense, see page 172.
For more information on modal verbs, see page 175.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use the simple future tense or going to in an if clause. Use a present tense or imperative.


We can also use going to, an imperative, the present progressive tense, or a modal auxiliary verb in the main clause.
When we finish dinner, we can have some ice cream for dessert.
If you lose your driver's license, you should get a new one right away.
If you park near a fire hydrant, you might get a ticket.
If he wins the lottery, he's going to quit his job.
If you smell the odor of gas, turn off your stove and open a window. If the odor continues, leave your home immediately and call the gas company.
For more information on going to, see page 172. For more information on modal verbs, see page 175.

AVOID THE Error
We can also have conditional sentences with the simple present tense in the if clause and the simple present tense or imperative in the main clause. These sentences are often used for giving instructions or stating simple cause-and-effect relationships. These sentences are sometimes called "Conditional 0."


Clauses with Unless
Unless means "if not" or "except if."
Unless it rains, we will go swimming.
They should arrive in a few minutes unless they are lost.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use unless when it does not mean "except if."


Conditional 2 Sentences
We use the conditional 2 to talk about actions that are not true in the present or future. We form the conditional 2 with an if clause in the simple past tense and a main clause with would or could. Even though the verbs appear to be in the past tense, the meaning of the sentence is in the present or future.
If I had a million dollars, I would buy stocks and bonds.
If your car was working, you could pick up Joan at work.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use would in an if clause. Use the simple past tense.


English speakers frequently use were instead of was in the if clause, especially when giving advice with, "If I were you, ..."
If I were you, I'd stop smoking.

AVOID THE Error
In formal settings, use were in place of was in the if clause. In informal settings, you may hear speakers use was or were in these clauses.
 If I was rich, I'd move to New York. (formal)
 If I were rich, I'd move to New York.
 If I were rich, I'd move to New York. (informal)
 If I was rich, I'd move to New York. (informal)

Conditional 3 Sentences
We use conditional 3 sentences to talk about past actions that are contrary to fact. We often use conditional 3 to express regret about things that didn't happen.
If I had finished high school, I would have gotten a better job.
If she had driven straight home, she wouldn't have had an accident.
We form the conditional 3 sentence with a modal verb such as would, could, or should + have + a past participle in the main clause.

For a list of past participles, see pages 165-166.
The contractions of these verb forms are would've, could've, and should've.
If we had left home earlier, we would've arrived on time.
The contractions of the negative forms are wouldn't have, couldn't have, and shouldn't have.
If you had paid attention to the traffic, you wouldn't have had an accident.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use would of, could of, or should of in place of would've, could've, and should've.

Do not use wouldn't of, couldn't of, or shouldn't of in place of wouldn't have, couldn't have, and shouldn't have.


Use the past perfect tense in the if clause. The past perfect tense is formed with the past tense of have (had) and a past participle.


AVOID THE Error
In the past perfect tense, do not use the simple past-tense form of the verb in place of the past participle.


The past perfect form of have is had had. Though this construction sounds unusual, it is perfectly correct.
If we had had a first aid kit, we could have bandaged his wound.
Nevertheless, you may want to revise your sentence to avoid the repetition.
If we had brought a first aid kit, we could have bandaged his wound.

AVOID THE Error
In independent clauses, do not use the past perfect tense in place of the simple past tense.

IMPERSONAL EXPRESSIONS
Impersonal Expressions with It
A number of impersonal expressions are formed with the pronoun it. A pronoun is a word that replaces another noun. I, me, you, he, him, her, and it are all pronouns. We use the pronoun it as a subject or an object of a verb:
What's that? It's Tim's new car. (subject)
I bought it for Mary. (object)
For more information on pronouns, see page 88.
We also use it in several impersonal expressions. In these expressions, it doesn't replace a noun.
It's 3 o'clock.
It's sunny and warm.
It's getting cooler.
It's nice to go to the beach in hot weather.
We use impersonal expressions with it + be to say the time, to describe the weather, to describe actions, and to describe commonly held beliefs.

AVOID THE Error
Do not confuse it's (contraction of it + is) with its (possessive form of it). Use it's in impersonal expressions with it.


Saying the Time
We use it and a form of be to say the time.
It's noonâtime for lunch.
What time is it? It's five o'clock.
We can also use it + morning, afternoon, or evening.
It's morning.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use a plural subject or verb when saying the time. Do not omit the subject.


Describing the Weather
We use it + be + adjective to describe the weather.
It's very rainy this afternoon.
It was sunny and warm at the beach.
It will be hot all afternoon.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use make to describe the weather. Use a form of be.


We use it + verb to describe the weather. The verbs include rain, snow, sleet, hail, and pour.
It snowed all day yesterday.
It's hailing now.
It never rains in the Mojave desert.
It snows every winter in the Rocky Mountains.
We also use it + adjective to describe the weather. The adjectives include sunny, dark, light, rainy, stormy, cloudy, cool, damp, hot, humid, icy, misty, muggy, warm, wet, and windy.
It's stormy tonight.
It was cold yesterday.
It will be hot and muggy again tomorrow.
It's freezing outside this morning.

AVOID THE Error
Do not use it's + participle to describe the weather when an adjective is required.


We can also use other linking verbs in impersonal expressions with it.
It looks sunny.
It seems hazy.
It appears cloudy.
For more information on linking verbs, see page 122.
We use it and a form of get or become to describe changes to the weather.
It's getting colder and colder.
It's becoming cloudy.
Describing Actions
Expressions with it, a form of be, and an adjective are used to describe actions. A gerund or an infinitive can follow the adjective. For more information on gerunds and infinitives, see page 207.
It's easy to make chocolate chip cookies.
It's interesting living in a foreign country.
It was stupid to drive the car on the beach.
Expressing Ideas Many People Hold
Expressions with it and a form of be are used with verbs such as believe and think to express ideas that many people hold.
It's thought that nearly three million visitors come to our city each year.
It's said that Lincoln was one of the best U.S. presidents.
It's believed that Lincoln was born in 1809.
Describing Conditions

It was difficult during the Depression.
Impersonal It as an Object
We can use the impersonal it as the object of a verb such as like, dislike, or hate to describe our feelings.
I like it here in Taiwan.

AVOID THE Error
Do not omit the impersonal it.


Impersonal Expressions with There
There is an adverb used to describe location.
He moved to Los Angeles in 2004. He lived there for three years.
For more information on adverbs, see page 222.

AVOID THE Error
When two nouns follow there, use a singular verb if the first noun in the series is singular or an uncountable noun.

A My friends and I went out together on Saturday. First we went to see a movie at the Downtown Cinema at around 5 o'clock (or 5:00). After seeing the movie, we went to Patricca's Pizza to have pizza.

We also bought some yogurt and a big bottle of laundry detergent. Next, we are going to go the laundromat to wash our clothes.
C I had a bad day yesterday. First, I woke up late because the alarm didn't go off. So I put on my clothes and ran out the door. I hurried to the bus stop, but just as I came around the corner the bus was pulling (orpulled) away. I had to wait twenty minutes for the next one. I tried to call my boss, but my cell phone wasn't working. Then it started to rain. I hid under a tree until the bus came. When I finally got to work, the boss yelled at me. He said, "If you are late again, you will be fired!" So at lunch, I bought a new alarm clock.
D Robert's favorite sport is rock climbing. He practices at a gym near his house. The gym has a high wall with some rocks in it. He wears special equipment to climb up the wall. Last weekend, he invited me to join him at the gym. I took one look at the rock wall and said that I never would climb up. Then Robert began climbing. But while he was climbing, he slipped. Luckily, the harness caught him, so he wasn't hurt. After that, I was really glad I didn't climb the wall.
E My uncle Don is an amazing man. He is over seventy years old, but he still gets up at 5:30 every day and walks for five miles. Even if it is raining, he still walks. If the weather is very bad, he goes to an indoor swimming pool near his house. Then he swims for an hour. Then he goes to work. On weekends, he has a stand at the flea market. He sells and repairs old bicycles. On Saturday nights he is never too tired to go dancing with his girlfriend. When I am old, I hope I am like my uncle.
