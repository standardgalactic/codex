Preface
To the Student
My advice to students reading this book is very simple: Don't believe anything you read in this book.
Perhaps I should explain further. You may be used to studying mathematics by memorizing formulas and procedures for solving different types of problems. This method can be successful in high school math, but when you get to more advanced subjects like calculus, it doesn't work well. There are just too many different types of problems in calculus to memorize a procedure for solving each one. And for some types of calculus problems, there is no step-by-step procedure you can follow to get the answer.
An approach that works better is to grasp the concepts of calculus, so that you can understand why problems are done the way they are. With that understanding, when you come to a problem that is a little different from ones you have seen before, you can figure out how to solve it, rather than trying to apply a memorized procedure for solving it. When calculus is approached in this way, solving problems is not just a matter of calculation; it involves reasoning.
For reasoning in mathematics to be effective, it must be held to a very high standard. Our standard will be certainty: when reasoning about a problem, our goal will be not just to determine the answer, but to become certain of the answer. This pursuit of certainty should be evident throughout this book. Whenever we solve a problem, we will present a solution that is intended not merely to find the answer, but to convince you, with complete certainty, that the answer is correct. You should read this book with a skeptical attitude, refusing to believe that an answer is correct unless the solution is completely convincing. (That's why you shouldn't believe anything you read in this book.) And you should take a similar skeptical attitude toward your own solutions to problems: your goal is not merely to get the answer, but to be certain of the answer.
This skeptical attitude is important for success in calculus. In calculus there are often many different approaches that could be taken to a problem, some of which work and some of which don't. It is sometimes impossible to know in advance which approach will work. When trying to solve a problem, you may have to try one approach, recognize that it doesn't work, and then switch to a different approach. Thus, success in calculus requires not only the ability to find correct solutions, but also the ability to reject incorrect ones.
In your previous study of mathematics, you may have focused mainly on learning how to find correct solutions. Learning to recognize, and reject, incorrect solutions may be a new skill for you. How do you know when to reject a proposed solution? The best answer we can give is that you must insist on certainty. If your reasoning on a problem does not completely convince you of the answer, then it is insufficient and must be either improved or rejected. Your best defense against incorrect solutions is the skeptical attitude that we try to encourage in this book.
For reasoning to achieve certainty, it must be expressed with precision. We introduce many technical terms in this book, and when a term is introduced we always provide a precise definition. It is important to understand that terminology and notation in mathematics are always used to mean exactly what the definitions say—no more and no less. You should pay close attention to definitions, referring back to them if necessary. In many cases, the best way to get started on a problem is to be guided by the definitions of the words and notation appearing in the statement of the problem.
Often the methods we use to solve problems are based on general principles that are stated in the form of theorems. We have provided proofs of almost all of the theorems stated in this book. You may choose to skip some of these proofs, especially on a first reading. But we hope that your skeptical attitude will make you want to read them, so that you can be convinced that the theorems are true, rather than merely accepting them. These proofs demonstrate one of the fundamental principles of mathematics, without which the skeptical approach would be impossible: everything in math has a reason. Reading the proof of a theorem can not only help you understand why the theorem is true, it can also deepen your understanding of the meaning of the theorem. The proofs also provide you with good models of how mathematical reasoning should be carried out and expressed in writing.
This book requires no previous knowledge of calculus, but it does require a good background in algebra and trigonometry. Chapter 1 gives a brief review of the ideas from algebra and trigonometry that will be most important to us. If this review is not sufficient for you, then you may need to refer back to other resources on algebra and trigonometry.
To the Instructor
The topics covered in this book are the usual topics of first-year calculus: limits, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series. We have tried to give a mathematically rigorous treatment of these topics, while keeping the focus on the use of calculus to solve problems, rather than on the theoretical foundations of the subject. This is a rigorous calculus book, not an analysis book.
Some instructors may believe that rigor is an advanced topic that shouldn't be introduced until a student is taking analysis. This book is an attempt to justify the opposite point of view: rigor is a useful guide to beginning students that can help them learn to distinguish between correct mathematical reasoning and reasoning that is plausible but flawed. Calculus is full of such tempting but incorrect approaches to problems, and success requires learning to recognize them. Doing so when reasoning is kept at an intuitive level can be extremely difficult. Our point of view is that rigor is not an advanced topic; it is intuitive reasoning that is an advanced topic.
One of the most difficult ideas in calculus is the precise definition of limits, but a rigorous approach to the subject is not possible without such a definition. We devote an entire section to motivating and explaining the definition, using words, pictures, and formulas. A second section gives practice using the definition to prove limit statements. Reasoning based on this definition occurs at various points throughout the book.
Another essential theoretical idea is the completeness of the real numbers. Our fundamental completeness statement is the nested interval theorem, which says that for any nested sequence of closed intervals whose lengths approach 0, there is a unique number that is in all of the intervals. We state the nested interval theorem without proof, but a diagram makes it very plausible. We then use the theorem in a number of proofs throughout the book, including a proof of another version of completeness, the existence of least upper bounds and greatest lower bounds.
Our discussion of the nested interval theorem uses sequences and their limits, so these concepts are introduced early, in the last two sections of Chapter 2. The study of sequences also provides an opportunity to introduce the method of mathematical induction, which is used in a number of places later. For example, we use induction to prove that for every positive integer n, the derivative of xn is nxn−1.
We have chosen to restrict our discussion of definite integrals to continuous functions, and to use only uniform partitions in our definition of the integral. This is sufficient for everything we do with integrals in first-year calculus. Our definition of definite integrals also makes use of sequence limits: the definite integral is defined to be the limit of a sequence of Riemann sums that are based on uniform partitions.
We have included complete proofs of a number of theorems that are often stated without proof in calculus books, such as the extreme value theorem, the integrability of continuous functions, and the term-by-term differentiability and integrability of power series. All of these proofs use only high school algebra (and the nested interval theorem). The proof of the integrability of continuous functions is given in an optional final section in Chapter 5. That section introduces two new concepts that are used in the proof, but are not needed anywhere else in the book: uniform continuity and Riemann sums based on nonuniform partitions. Readers who don't want to be sidetracked by these topics can safely skip this section. The proof of term-by-term differentiability and integrability of power series is similarly put off until the final section of Chapter 10, since it requires the introduction of uniform convergence and summation by parts. Again, some readers may want to skip this section.
There are a number of paradoxes, such as Zeno's paradox, that are usually associated with calculus. We introduce two new paradoxes in this book; we call them the paradox of precision through approximation and the paradox of generalization.The paradox of precision through approximation is the fact that calculus is a subject in which we use approximations to find precise answers. The paradox of generalization is the observation that in calculus, generalizing a problem often makes it easier. This paradox first arises in the study of derivatives: the rules for computing derivatives make it easier to find the formula for f'(x) than to find, say, f'(2).We appeal to the paradox of generalization later to motivate the shift from  that leads to the fundamental theorems of calculus, and again to motivate the shift from series of numbers to power series.
In order to make our presentation rigorous, we have had to take novel approaches to some topics. We summarize the most noteworthy features of our presentation here.
•Many calculus books introduce the informal notation "as x →a, f(x) → L" to express the idea that limx→a f(x) = L. But this notation misses a crucial distinction between the way in which x approaches a and the way in which f(x) approaches L, namely, that x must never be equal to a, but f(x) can equal L.We have therefore changed the notation slightly by writing "as x → a+, f(x) → L," with the superscript "=" indicating that x = a. This use of superscripts is in keeping with other common variants of the arrow notation, such as "as x →a+, f(x) → L," which means that limx→a+ f(x) = L. We use similar superscripts on L; for example, "as x→a+, f(x) → L−" means that when x approaches a from the positive side, f(x) approaches L from the negative side. These small changes in notation turn out to be extremely valuable: they make it possible for us to give an intuitive and rigorously justifiable method for computing limits of compositions of functions in Section 2.6. And such limit computations are often useful in calculus. For example, see the calculation of the derivative of  in Theorem 3.3.7. This calculation is a preview of the method used to find derivatives of inverse functions in Theorem 7.2.2.
•We motivate the study of derivatives with several examples of rates of change of real-world quantities. While we explain how these rates of change can be visualized as slopes of tangent lines, the focus is on rates of change in the real world, not tangent lines. Similarly, integration is motivated by real-world examples of quantities that accumulate at varying rates. Again, the connection to areas is used to help the intuition, but the emphasis is on accumulating quantities in the real world.
•Our proof of the mean value theorem is different from the one given in most books. Although our proof is probably a bit longer than the usual proof, it has the virtue that it does not depend on the extreme value theorem. This makes it possible to put off the extreme value theorem until after the discussion of curve sketching techniques, in which the idea of maximum and minimum values arises naturally.
•Differentiation is a pointwise operation, but antidifferentiation must be done on intervals. When we introduce antidifferentiation, we define one-sided derivatives, to allow for antiderivatives on closed intervals, and we state a version of the chain rule on intervals that uses one-sided derivatives at the endpoints of intervals (Theorem 4.9.5). This theorem is needed to justify integration by substitution. To see why, consider the following integration example, using the substitution u = 1+sin x:

This answer is correct, but the usual version of the chain rule does not suffice to justify it, because u3/2 has only a one-sided derivative at u = 0. However, our chain rule on intervals justifies it.
•We present trigonometric substitutions in integrals as an instance of a general method of substitution with inverse functions. A justification of this method is given in Section 8.4.
•Integrals for arc length and surface area are introduced in the context of curves given by parametric equations, which is the most natural and general context for these topics. The formulas in the case of graphs of functions follow easily from the formulas for parametric curves.
•All of the power series representations of familiar functions that are given in most calculus books are derived without the use of any formulas for the Taylor remainder. This keeps the focus of attention on calculus with power series, rather than intricate error estimates. In each case, we show that the function in question is the unique solution to some differential equation that meets some initial condition, and then we show that the Taylor series satisfies the differential equation and initial condition. We do present the Lagrange formula for the Taylor remainder, but it is put off until near the end of the chapter on series and power series.







Chapter 1
Preliminaries
1.1 Numbers and Sets
The numbers we will use in this book are the real numbers. These are all the numbers that can be written in decimal notation. We often think of them as corresponding to points on a number line (see Figure 1.1). The simplest real numbers are the integers: the numbers 0, 1, −1, 2, −2, 3, −3, and so on. A real number is said to be rational if it can be written as an integer divided by an integer; for example, 2/3 and −13/5 are rational numbers. Notice that every integer is also a rational number, since, for example, we can write 3 as 3/1. Real numbers that are not rational are called irrational. For example, it can be shown that  . . . and π = 3.14159 . . . are irrational. Both rational and irrational numbers are spread throughout the number line; in fact, between any two real numbers there are infinitely many rational numbers and also infinitely many irrational numbers.
We will also often work with collections of numbers. In mathematics, a collection of objects is called a set, and the objects in the collection are called elements of the set. The simplest way to specify a set is to list the elements of the set between braces. For example, {−1, 0, 3/2} is the set whose elements are the three numbers −1, 0, and 3/2. If we let the letter A stand for this set, then we write 3/2 ∈ A to say that 3/2 is an element of A, while 4  A means that 4 is not an element of A.
Another way to specify a set is to give a rule for determining which objects belong to the set and which do not. For example, if we write



Figure 1.1: The number line.

then this means that B is the set whose elements are all values of x that satisfy the equation 2x3 − x2 −3x = 0. Equation (1.1) is read "B is equal to the set of all x such that 2x3 − x2 −3x = 0." The equation 2x3 − x2 −3x = 0 that appears in the definition of B is a statement that is true for some values of x and false for others. You should think of it as an elementhood test for the set B; those values of x that make the equation true pass the test and are elements of B, while those that make the equation false are not. To determine which numbers belong to B we simply have to solve the equation, which we can do by factoring the left-hand side. We have
2x3 − x2 −3x = x(x +1)(2x −3),
so the equation can be rewritten x(x + 1)(2x −3) = 0, and the solutions are 0, −1, and 3/2. These are the elements of the set B. Notice that these are exactly the same as the elements of the set A defined earlier. Thus B = A; they are both the same collection of numbers, described in two different ways.
Although we will usually use the letter x when writing an elementhood test to define a set, as we did in the definition of B, in fact any letter can be used. For example, the set C = {y : 2y3 − y2 −3y = 0} is the set of all values of y that satisfy the equation 2y3 − y2 −3y = 0. Of course, this is the same equation that we used in the definition of B, but with x replaced by y. The values of y that satisfy the equation are therefore once again the numbers 0, −1, and 3/2. Therefore C = B = A; we have the same set of numbers described in yet another way.
Here is another example of a set defined by an elementhood test: I = {x : 2 < x < 5}. This time the elementhood test is 2 < x < 5, which is a shorthand way of saying that 2 < x and x < 5. In this case 3 ∈ I, since the statement 2 < 3 < 5 is true, but 5  I, since the statement 2 < 5 < 5 is false. The elements of I are all the numbers strictly between 2 and 5. There are infinitely many numbers in this range, so we cannot list all the elements of I, as we did for A. But we can mark them on a number line, as in Figure 1.2.


Figure 1.2: I = {x : 2 < x < 5}. The open circles indicate that 2 and 5 are not elements of I, while the thick line shows that all numbers between 2 and 5 are elements.

The set I is an example of a kind of set called an open interval. For any numbers a and b with a < b, the set of all numbers strictly between a and b is an open interval, and it is denoted (a, b). In other words,
(a, b) = {x : a < x < b}.


Figure 1.3: The closed interval [2, 5], and the half-open intervals (2, 5] and [2, 5). Black dots indicate points that are included in a set.

The numbers a and b are called the endpoints of the interval. Thus I = (2, 5); it is the open interval with endpoints 2 and 5.
The endpoints of an open interval are not elements of the interval. But sometimes we will want to include the endpoints, so we define
[a, b] = {x : a ≤ x ≤ b}.
This set is called a closed interval. For example, [2, 5] = {x : 2 ≤ x ≤ 5}. This set is exactly the same as the open interval (2, 5) considered earlier, except that it includes the endpoints 2 and 5 as elements. If we include only one endpoint, we get a half-open interval. As you might guess, we write half-open intervals like this:
(a, b] = {x : a < x ≤ b},
[a, b) = {x : a ≤ x < b}.
In general, we use a square bracket to indicate that an endpoint is included in an interval, and a parenthesis to indicate that it is not. Figure 1.3 shows examples of closed and half-open intervals.
The interior of an interval is the set containing all numbers in the interval except the endpoints. Thus, the interior of the closed interval [2, 5] is the open interval (2, 5). The interiors of (2, 5] and [2, 5) are also (2, 5), and we will even say that the interior of (2, 5) is (2, 5).
Finally, we sometimes want to consider intervals that extend infinitely far in some direction, so we introduce the notation:
(a,∞) = {x : x > a},
[a,∞) = {x : x ≥ a},
(−∞, b) = {x : x < b},
(−∞, b] = {x : x ≤ b}.
Some examples of infinite intervals are shown in Figure 1.4. The interior of [a,∞) is (a,∞), and the interior of (−∞, b] is (−∞, b). The set of all real numbers is often denoted R, but we could also think of it as the interval (−∞,∞). We consider any interval that does not include its endpoints to be an open interval. Thus, the intervals (a,∞), (−∞, b), and (−∞,∞) are open intervals, and the interior of any interval is an open interval.


Figure 1.4: Infinite intervals.

Since this is our first use of the infinity symbol∞, it might be worthwhile to pause at this point to explain what this symbol means. The most important thing to understand about the infinity symbol is that there is no such number as infinity. You might wonder, then, how it can be correct to use this symbol in mathematical notation like (a,∞). The answer is that, according to the definition we have given, this notation is simply a shorthand for {x : x > a}, and this last expression makes no mention of infinity. Every time we make a statement using the symbol ∞, it will be a similar shorthand for a statement that makes no mention of infinity. We will never use the symbol ∞ as if it stood for a number. Thus, for example, wewould never set x equal to ∞in some formula, and we would never talk about the "closed interval" [2,∞].
There are two ways of combining sets that we will sometimes make use of. If A and B are sets, then the intersection of A and B, denoted A ∩ B, is the set whose elements are those objects that belong to both A and B. Thus
A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}.
For example,
[2,∞) ∩(−∞, 5) = {x : x ∈ [2,∞) and x ∈ (−∞, 5)}
= {x : 2 ≤ x and x < 5} = [2, 5).
Looking at Figure 1.4, you can see that the elements of [2,∞) ∩(−∞, 5) are those numbers that are in the overlap of the sets [2,∞) and (−∞, 5). In general, you can think of A ∩ B as the overlap of A and B.
The union of A and B, denoted A ∪ B, is the set whose elements are all those objects that are elements of either A or B (or both). That is,
A ∪ B = {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B}.
You could think of A ∪ B as the set you get if you take all the elements of A, and all the elements of B, and throw them together into one set. For example, if we take all the numbers in the intervals (2, 4] and [4, 5] and put them together into one set, we get the interval (2, 5]. That is,
(2, 4] ∪[4, 5] = {x : x ∈ (2, 4] or x ∈ [4, 5]}
= {x : 2 < x ≤ 4 or 4 ≤ x ≤ 5} = {x : 2 < x ≤ 5} = (2, 5].
If A and B are sets, then A is called a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B. We write A ⊆ B to indicate that A is a subset of B. For example, (2, 4) ⊆ [2, 4], and [2, 4] ⊆ (1, 5).
One reason that intervals are important in calculus is that they often come up as solution sets of inequalities. In particular, we will often be concerned with inequalities involving absolute values. Recall that the absolute value of a number x is defined as follows:

This notation means that if x ≥ 0 then|x| = x, and if x < 0 then |x| = −x. For example, |3| = 3 and |−4| = −(−4) = 4.
The fact that |x| is defined by cases, with one formula when x ≥ 0 and a different formula when x < 0, suggests a method that can be used when solving any problem involving absolute values: reasoning by cases. As a simple example of this kind of reasoning, notice that if x ≥ 0 then we have |x| = x ≥ 0, and if x < 0 then|x| = −x > 0. In both cases the statement |x| ≥ 0 is true, so we conclude that for every number x, |x| ≥ 0. You can also use reasoning by cases to show that for every number x,  (see Exercise 15).
Here's an example of how reasoning by cases can be used to solve an inequality involving absolute values:
Example 1.1.1. Solve:
|x| < 3.
Solution. Motivated by the definition of |x|, we will consider x ≥ 0 and x < 0 separately.
Case 1. x ≥ 0. In this case, according to the definition of absolute value we have |x| = x, so the inequality |x| < 3 means x < 3.
Case 2. x < 0. Now the definition of absolute value says that |x| = −x, and substituting this into our inequality |x| < 3 gives us −x < 3. Multiplying by −1 (and remembering that when multiplying an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality) we get x > −3.
So what's the solution to our inequality? Is it x < 3, as we found in case 1, or x > −3, as in case 2? To answer this question, we must think about what it means to solve an inequality. To solve the inequality |x| < 3 means to determine which values of x make the inequality true. Our reasoning in case 1 shows that, for x ≥ 0, the inequality means x < 3. Thus the inequality is true if 0 ≤ x < 3 and false if x ≥ 3. We can't tell from this reasoning whether the inequality is true or false when x < 0; that's the purpose of case 2. Case 2 tells us that, for x < 0, the inequality will be true precisely when x > −3. Thus, the inequality is true if −3 < x < 0 and false if x ≤ −3. Putting all this information together, we conclude that the inequality is true if −3 < x < 3 and false if either x ≥ 3 or x ≤ −3, as shown in Figure 1.5. This means that the solution set of the inequality is an open interval:


Figure 1.5: The solution to Example 1.1.1.The parts of the number line marked with solid lines are in the solution set, and outlined areas are not. The blue lines were determined in case 1 of the solution, and the red lines in case 2.

{x : |x| < 3} = {x : −3 < x < 3} = (−3, 3).
Notice that in case 1 we determined that all numbers in the interval [0, 3) are in the solution set, and in case 2 we determined that the numbers in (−3, 0) are also in the solution set. The solution set is therefore the union of these two intervals: [0, 3) ∪ (−3, 0) = (−3, 3).
Here's another way of describing the answer to Example 1.1.1. Our reasoning shows that the statements |x| < 3 and −3 < x < 3 are true for exactly the same values of x; the two statements are equivalent. In other words, for any number x, if |x| < 3, then −3 < x < 3, and if −3 < x < 3, then |x| < 3. Mathematicians usually describe this situation by saying that |x| < 3 is true if and only if −3 < x < 3. The phrase "if and only if" comes up often in mathematics, and we will see it many times later in this book.
Of course, there is nothing special about the number 3 in this example. Similar reasoning, using the variable y in place of the number 3, can be used to establish the following theorem. Parts 3 and 4 of the theorem follow directly from parts 1 and 2, by negating the statements involved.
Theorem 1.1.2. For any numbers x and y, the following statements are true:
1.|x| < y if and only if −y < x < y.
2.|x| ≤ y if and only if −y ≤ x ≤ y.
3.|x| ≥ y if and only if either x ≤ −y or x ≥ y.
4.|x| > y if and only if either x < −y or x > y.
The most important use of absolute values in calculus is to compute distances between numbers on the number line. To find the distance between two numbers, we subtract the smaller number from the larger. For example, the distance from −4 to 3 on the number line is 3−(−4) = 7. In general, if a ≤ b then the distance from a to b is b−a. But if a > b then the distance is a −b. Is there a single formula that gives the distance from a to b no matter which of the numbers is larger?
It turns out that the formula |b−a| does the trick. We can see this by once again using reasoning by cases.
Case 1. a ≤ b. Then b−a ≥ 0, so |b−a| = b−a, which, in this case, is the distance from a to b on the number line.
Case 2. a > b. Now b−a < 0, so |b−a| = −(b−a) = a −b, which is, once again, the distance from a to b in this case.
Thus, no matter which of the numbers a and b is larger, we have
|b−a| = the distance from a to b on the number line.
This fact provides a nice way to see why our solution to Example 1.1.1 makes sense. We have
|x| = |x −0| = distance from 0 to x on the number line.
With this interpretation for |x|, the inequality |x| < 3 can be thought of as saying
(distance from 0 to x on the number line) < 3.
It is clear geometrically that the values of x for which this statement is true are the numbers in the open interval (−3, 3), exactly as we found in our solution to Example 1.1.1.
Example 1.1.3. Solve:
|3t + 2| ≤ 4.
Solution. By part 2 of Theorem 1.1.2, the inequality to be solved is equivalent to
−4 ≤ 3t + 2 ≤ 4.
Subtracting 2 all the way through the inequality gives us
−6 ≤ 3t ≤ 2,
and then dividing by 3 we get
−2 ≤ t ≤ 2/3.
Thus the solution set for this inequality is a closed interval:
{t : |3t + 2| ≤ 4} = {t : −2 ≤ t ≤ 2/3} = [−2, 2/3].
Sometimes it is useful to be able to simplify absolute values of complicated expressions. In such situations, the following theorem can be helpful.
Theorem 1.1.4. For any numbers x and y, the following statements are true:
1.|xy| = |x||y|.

Proof. We will just prove part 1; the proof of part 2 is similar. First note that if either x or y is 0 then both sides of the equation |xy| = |x||y| are 0, so the equation is true.
If neither of them is 0, then each is either positive or negative. This leaves us with four cases to consider:
Case 1. x > 0, y > 0. Then by the definition of absolute value, |x| = x and |y| = y. Also, since the product of two positive numbers is positive, xy > 0. Therefore |xy| = xy = |x||y|.
Case 2. x > 0, y < 0. Then |x| = x and |y| = −y. Since a positive number times a negative number is negative, xy < 0. Thus |xy| = −xy = x(−y) = |x||y|.
Case 3. x < 0, y > 0. Then |x| = −x, |y| = y, and xy < 0, so |xy| = −xy = |x||y|.
Case 4. x < 0, y < 0. Then |x| = −x and |y| = −y. Since a negative times a negative is positive, we have xy > 0, so |xy| = xy = (−x)(−y) = |x||y|.
To illustrate the use of Theorem 1.1.4, we briefly revisit Example 1.1.3. Notice that |3t + 2| = |3(t + 2/3)| = |3||t + 2/3| = 3|t −(−2/3)|, where we have used part 1 of Theorem 1.1.4 in the second step. Thus, the inequality in Example 1.1.3 can be rewritten
3|t −(−2/3)| ≤ 4.
Dividing through by 3, this is equivalent to
|t −(−2/3)| ≤ 4/3,
which can be interpreted as meaning
(distance from t to −2/3 on the number line) ≤ 4/3.
Thus the solution set of the inequality is
[−2/3−4/3,−2/3+ 4/3] = [−2, 2/3],
exactly as we found in Example 1.1.3.
Theorem 1.1.4 tells us how to simplify an absolute value of a product or a quotient. What about the absolute value of a sum? Is it always true that |x + y| = |x| + |y|? A little experimentation shows that, unfortunately, this equation is not always true. For example, |5+(−3)| = 2, but |5| + |−3| = 8. However, we do have the following important fact, which is known as the triangle inequality.
Theorem 1.1.5 (Triangle Inequality). For all numbers x and y, |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|.
Proof. According to part 2 of Theorem 1.1.2, the triangle inequality is equivalent to the statement

so it will suffice to prove this inequality. We will leave it to you to verify (using reasoning by cases) that
−|x| ≤ x ≤ |x|
and
−|y| ≤ y ≤ |y|
(see Exercise 18). Adding these two inequalities gives inequality (1.2).
The theorems we have proven about absolute values could be regarded as shortcuts that allow us to solve problems more easily. For example, using Theorem 1.1.2 we were able to solve Example 1.1.3 without having to resort to reasoning by cases. This is a pattern that we will see repeated many times in this book. When a new concept is introduced, we will initially rely on the definition to tell us how to solve problems involving that concept. But often solutions based on the definition will be long and complicated, so we will develop theorems that provide shortcuts that allow us to solve problems more easily.
You may wonder, why bother learning the definitions? Why not just learn the shortcuts, if they provide easier ways of solving problems? One answer is that shortcuts, while helpful, are also often somewhat limited. They usually allow us to solve only a restricted range of problems. Sometimes you come across a problem for which the shortcuts are not helpful, and then you have no choice but to return to the definitions of the relevant concepts to solve the problem.
As an illustration of this, we close this section by solving an inequality involving absolute values for which our various shortcuts don't seem to be very helpful.
Example 1.1.6. Solve:
2|x|−3 ≥ |x −1|.
Solution. Although it is possible to use Theorem 1.1.2 to solve this inequality (see Exercise 16), the solution is not easy. Here we use the more straightforward approach of working from the definition of absolute value, which suggests reasoning by cases. Since we need to work with both |x| and |x −1|, we are led to consider three cases: x < 0, 0 ≤ x < 1, and x ≥ 1.
Case 1. x < 0. In this case we also have x −1 < 0, so according to the definition of absolute value, |x| = −x and |x −1| = −(x −1) = 1− x. Substituting into our inequality, we find that we must solve
−2x −3 ≥ 1− x.
Adding 2x to both sides and subtracting 1, we get −4 ≥ x. Thus, for negative values of x, the inequality is true if and only if x ≤ −4. In other words, it is true if x ≤ −4 and false if −4 < x < 0.
Case 2. 0 ≤ x < 1. We have x ≥ 0, so |x| = x, and x < 1, so x −1 < 0 and therefore |x −1| = 1− x. Thus in this case the inequality means
2x −3 ≥ 1− x,
which can be simplified to x ≥ 4/3. But this inequality is false for all values of x in the range 0 ≤ x < 1. Thus, none of the numbers in the interval [0, 1) will be included in the solution set of our inequality.
Case 3. x ≥ 1. Then x ≥ 0 and x −1 ≥ 0, and therefore |x| = x and |x −1| = x −1. Filling in these formulas in our inequality we get
2x −3 ≥ x −1,
and simplifying leads to x ≥ 2. Thus, the inequality is true for x ≥ 2 and false for 1 ≤ x < 2.


Figure 1.6: The solution set for Example 1.1.6 is (−∞,−4] ∪[2,∞).

Combining the information from all three cases, we find that the solution set is the set containing all numbers in the interval (−∞,−4] and also all numbers in the interval [2,∞). In other words,
{x : 2|x|−3 ≥ |x −1|} = {x : either x ≤ −4 or x ≥ 2} = (−∞,−4] ∪[2,∞).

1.2Graphs in the Plane
In Section 1.1 we considered statements involving a single variable, usually x, and we illustrated these statements by marking on a number line the values of the variable for which the statement is true. Often in calculus we will work with statements involving two variables, usually x and y. To illustrate such statements we use the coordinate plane. Each point in the plane represents an ordered pair of numbers (x, y), as illustrated in Figure 1.7.1
For example, consider the statement

The points (x, y) whose coordinates make this statement true are shown in Figure 1.8. This set of points is called the graph of the statement. For example, the statement is true if x = 3 and y = −2, and therefore the point (3,−2) is included in the graph. On the other hand, it is false if x = 3 and y = 1, so the point (3, 1) is not included.
The statements we will be most concerned with in this book are equations involving two variables, most often x and y. The graph of such an equation is usually a curve in the plane. Among the most important examples are equations whose graphs are straight lines. We assume you are familiar with equations of straight lines, but since they will be so important in calculus we briefly review the most important facts.
For any numbers m and b, the graph of the equation y = mx +b is a straight line with slope m and y-intercept b. This equation is called the slope-intercept equation of the line. For example, the line y = 2x −3, which has slope 2 and y-intercept −3, is shown in Figure 1.9a. The fact that the y-intercept is −3 means that the line crosses the y-axis at −3. In other words, the line passes through the point (0,−3), as you can verify by checking that the equation y = 2x −3 is true when x = 0 and y = −3. To understand the meaning of the slope, it might be helpful to imagine a point (x, y) moving along the line from left to right. The fact that the slope is 2 means that every time the x-coordinate of our moving point increases by 1, the y-coordinate increases by 2. More generally, if we add some number h to the x-coordinate of a point on the line, then we must add 2h to the y-coordinate to reach another point on the line. To see why this is true, suppose that some point (x1, y1) is on the line y = 2x −3. This means that the equation y = 2x −3 is true when x = x1 and y = y1, or in other words, y1 = 2x1 −3. It follows that y1 + 2h = 2x1 −3+2h = 2(x1 +h)−3, so the point (x1 +h, y1 + 2h) is also on the line. For example, Figure 1.9a shows that if we move along the line from (0,−3) to (3, 3), x increases by 3 and y increases by 2 · 3 = 6. The change in y is always twice as big as the change in x, and we therefore say that the slope gives the rate of change of y with respect to x.


Figure 1.7: The coordinate plane. The black dot is located at the point with coordinates (3, 2).



Figure 1.8: The graph of statement (1.3). The shaded region, solid lines, and black dot are included in the graph; the dotted lines and open circles are not.



Figure 1.9

Lines with positive slope slant upwards as we move from left to right, and lines with negative slope slant downwards. For example, Figure 1.9b shows the line  This time, when we add h to x, we must add to y—in other words, if x increases by h, then y decreases by  Figure 1.9b shows that when we move from (0, 4) to (3, 3), x increases by 3 and y decreases by 
A line with slope 0 has an equation of the form y = 0 · x + b, or in other words y = b. The graph of this equation is a horizontal line passing through the point b on the y-axis. Similarly, the equation of a vertical line passing through the point a on the x-axis is x = a. Vertical lines are the only lines whose equations cannot be written in the slope-intercept form y = mx +b. The slope of a vertical line is undefined.
Example 1.2.1. Find an equation of the line with slope 3 that passes through the point (−1, 2).
Solution. The slope-intercept equation of the line must have the form y = 3x +b, where b is the y-intercept. We must find b.
Since the line passes through the point (−1, 2), the equation for the line must be true when x = −1 and y = 2. In other words, 2 = 3(−1)+b, and therefore b = 5. So the equation of the line is y = 3x +5.
More generally, suppose we are looking for the line with slope m passing through the point (x1, y1). As in Example 1.2.1, we can substitute x1 and y1 for x and y in the equation y = mx +b to conclude that y1 = mx1 + b, and therefore b = y1 −mx1. Thus, the slope-intercept equation for the line is y = mx + (y1 −mx1). It is sometimes convenient to rearrange this equation to put it in the form

Equation (1.4) is called the point-slope form of the equation for the line.
If a line with equation y = mx +b passes through two different points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), then we can substitute the coordinates of both points into the equation of the line to conclude that y1 = mx1 + b and y2 = mx2 + b. Subtracting the first equation from the second we conclude that y2 − y1 = m(x2 − x1), and therefore

This gives a convenient formula for the slope of a nonvertical line, given two points on the line. The formula confirms our earlier interpretation of the slope as the rate of change of y with respect to x, since it says that if you move along the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2), then the slope is equal to the number of units of change in y per unit of change in x.
Example 1.2.2. Find an equation of the line through the points (−2, 3) and (4,−1).
Solution. Applying equation (1.5), we find that the slope of the line is

Plugging this slope and the given point (−2, 3) into the point-slope formula (1.4), we see that one equation for the line is

Of course, we could have used the other given point (4,−1) in the point-slope formula, so another answer is

These two answers are equivalent, as you can see by checking that both can be rearranged to give the same slope-intercept equation

Example 1.2.3. Find the intersection point of the two lines
y = 4x +1,
y = −2x +3.
Solution. We are looking for the unique point (x, y) whose coordinates satisfy both equations. If both equations are to be true, then we must have 4x +1 = −2x +3, and therefore 6x = 2 and x = 1/3. Substituting this value into the first equation, we find that y = 4(1/3)+1 = 7/3. (Of course, substituting into the second equation would give the same answer for y.) Thus, the intersection point is (1/3, 7/3).
Since the slope of a line measures how steeply it is inclined, parallel lines have the same slope. Figure 1.10 illustrates that if a line has slope m = 0, then a perpendicular line will have slope −1/m. (Of course, if a line has slope 0 then it is horizontal, so a perpendicular line will be vertical.)


Figure 1.10: Let m be the slope of line L1. Then m = b/a, and the slope of the perpendicular line L2 is −a/b = −1/m.

In Section 1.1, we determined that the distance between two points x1 and x2 on the number line is |x2 − x1|. How do we compute the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in the plane? Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the triangle in Figure 1.11, we see that the distance d satisfies the equation d2 = (x2 − x1)2 + (y2 − y1)2, and therefore

Equation (1.6) is known as the distance formula.
Example 1.2.4. Find the area of the triangle whose vertices are the points (−1, 0), (5, 3), and (1, 6).
Solution. See Figure 1.12. We take the side from (−1, 0) to (5, 3) as the base of the triangle. By the distance formula, it has length

Let L1 be the line containing the base of the triangle. Then L1 has slope m = (3−0)/(5− (−1)) = 1/2, and by the point-slope formula its equation is y −0 = (1/2)(x −(−1)),or equivalently y = (1/2)x +1/2. To find the altitude of the triangle, we need to find the line L2 that is perpendicular to L1 and passes through the point (1, 6). This line will have slope −1/m = −2, so the point-slope formula now tells us that L2 has equation y −6 = −2(x −1), or equivalently y = −2x +8. As in Example 1.2.3, by solving the equation (1/2)x +1/2 = −2x +8 we find that L1 and L2 intersect at the point (3, 2). Thus, the altitude of the triangle is the distance from (3, 2) to (1, 6), which is

Finally, we can conclude that the area of the triangle is



Figure 1.11: By the Pythagorean theorem, d2 = |x2 − x1|2 +|y2 − y1|2 = (x2 − x1)2 + (y2 − y1)2.



Figure 1.12: The solution to Example 1.2.4.

Note that in our solution to Example 1.2.4 we left the base and altitude of the triangle in the form  and  We could have used a calculator to determine that b ≈ 6.708 and h ≈ 4.472, leading to the area calculation (1/2)bh ≈ 14.999. But notice that this approach involves more work and leads to a less accurate answer. We usually find it easier and more useful to leave all of our numbers in exact form, as we did in Example 1.2.4, even when this means using an expression like 
So far we have focused on equations whose graphs are straight lines. Perhaps the most fundamental geometric shape other than a straight line is a circle. The circle of radius r centered at the point (a, b) consists of all points (x, y) whose distance from (a, b) is equal to r. Thus, to find an equation for this circle, we simply have to write an equation that expresses the statement
(distance from (x, y) to (a, b)) = r.
Using the distance formula for the left-hand side of this equation, we get

Squaring both sides gives the simpler, equivalent formula
(x −a)2 + (y −b)2 = r 2.
For example, the graph of the equation
x2 + y2 = 1
is the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin, (0, 0).

1.3 Functions
High school mathematics is mostly concerned with numbers and operations on numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. One of the most distinctive features of calculus is that it is primarily concerned with operations on functions rather than operations on numbers.
A function is a rule that associates, with every number, exactly one corresponding number. For example, the rule might associate with any number x the square of that number, x2. Or it might associate with each number x the number 3x5 −7x.


Figure 1.13: An alternative solution to Example 1.2.4.

We will often use letters to stand for functions, most often the letters f and g. If f is a function, then we write f(x) to denote the number associated with x by the function f. For example, if f and g are the two functions defined in the last paragraph, then we could say that for every number x, f (x) = x2 and g(x) = 3x5 −7x. The fact that these equations hold for every number x means that we can substitute any number we please for x. For example, we have f (5) = 52 = 25 and g(2) = 3(25)−7(2) = 82. In other words, the number associated with 5 by the function f is 25, and the number associated with 2 by the function g is 82. We can also replace x in these formulas by a more complicated formula. For example, for any numbers a and b we have g(a −3b) = 3(a −3b)5 −7(a −3b).
In a formula like f (x) = x2, it may be helpful to think of the number x as the input to the function f. The function can be thought of as an operation or calculation that is performed on this input to find the number associated with x by the function—in this case, x2. We therefore sometimes speak of the function f as being applied to the number x, and we say that f(x) is the result of applying the function f to x. It is also sometimes called the value of f at x, or simply f of x. Another image that may be helpful is to think of a function f as a machine, as shown in Figure 1.14. We feed a number x into the machine, and the machine spits out the number f(x), which in this example is x2. For example, if we feed the number 5 into this machine, the number 25 comes out.


Figure 1.14: The function f viewed as a machine.

We usually define a function f by giving a formula that tells us, for any number x, the value of f(x). For example, here are two more definitions of functions:
For every number x
For every number x,
However, a function need not be defined by a formula. Any rule that specifies unambiguously, for each number x, the corresponding value f(x) counts as a function. For example, here are two more examples of functions:
For every number x, f(x) = the greatest integer that is less than or equal to x.
For every number x, 
Of course, you recognize g(x) as |x|, the absolute value of x. Thus, we may speak of the absolute value function. The function f is called the greatest integer function, and f(x) is often denoted [x]. For example, ⎿3.7⏌ = 3, ⎿−3.7⏌ = −4, and ⎿6⏌ = 6.
Although we usually define a function f by specifying the value of f(x) for every x, it is important to understand the distinction between the expressions f and f(x). The letter f is the name of a function, and the expression f (x) denotes the number associated with x by f. In particular, f is a function, while f(x) is a number.
Can we define a function f by saying that for every number x,  There is a problem with this definition: the formula for f(x) can't be used for every number x, since  is undefined if x < 0. But we will certainly want to be able to work with formulas like  in calculus. We are thus led to extend our definition by allowing a function to be a rule that applies to only some numbers. The set of numbers to which the function applies is called the domain of the function, and it could be any subset of R, the set of all real numbers. Thus, our new definition is that if D ⊆ R, then a function f with domain D is a rule that associates, with each number x ∈ D, exactly one corresponding number f(x). We write f : D → R to indicate that f is a function with domain D; in other words, it is a rule that associates, with each element of D, a corresponding element of R. In all of our previous examples we had D = R, but sometimes our functions will have smaller domains. For example, the equation  can be used to define a function with domain {x : x ≥ 0} = [0,∞). For this example we would say f : [0,∞) →R.
Here are two more examples of functions whose domains are not all of R. In each case, we define the function by first specifying the domain and then giving the result of applying the function to any element of the domain.
The domain of f is [−1, 1], and for all x ∈ [−1, 1], 
The domain of g is (0,∞), and for all x ∈ (0,∞), g(x) = 1/x.
For example,  and g(7) = 1/7. However, g(−7) is undefined, because −7 is not in the domain of g; the equation g(x) = 1/x was declared to hold only for x ∈ (0,∞), so it does not apply to x = −7.
There are certain shortcuts that mathematicians often take when defining a function. First, mathematicians often don't specify the domain of the function they are defining. If no domain is specified, it is understood that the domain is the set of all values for which the definition of the function makes sense. Second, when defining a function f by giving a formula for f(x), mathematicians usually don't say explicitly that this formula applies to all x in the domain of the function. Again, this is to be understood. Finally, mathematicians sometimes write things like "the function f(x) = x2," when what they really mean is "the function f defined by the equation f(x) = x2."
Example 1.3.1. Find the domains of the functions f, g, and h defined by the following formulas:

Solution. The formula for f(x) makes sense for all values of x except x = 2, for which we have a 0 in the denominator. Thus, the domain of f is {x : x = 2}; we could also write this set as the union of two intervals, (−∞, 2) ∪(2,∞). Of course, the formula for g(x) makes sense for all values of x, so the domain of g is R.
The formula for h(x) involves the expressions  and  and these are undefined for some values of x. In order for  to make sense we must have x ≥ 0, and in order for  to make sense we must have 3− x ≥ 0, and therefore x ≤ 3. But there is one more restriction; if x = 3 then the formula for h(x) will involve division by 0, so we must exclude 3 from the domain. Thus, the domain of h is the half-open interval [0, 3).
The formula for f(x) in Example 1.3.1 can be simplified by factoring the numerator and then canceling:

You might think, therefore, that the functions f and g in Example 1.3.1 are really the same. However, the algebraic simplification we have done is correct only for x = 2; when x = 2, the fraction (x −2)(x + 2)/(x −2) is undefined, whereas x +2 is equal to 4. In other words, for all x = 2 we have f(x) = g(x), but f (2) is undefined, whereas g(2) = 4. Thus, we will insist that f and g are different functions. It may seem that we are being unnecessarily fussy about this, but as we will see in the next chapter, maintaining this distinction will be crucial to understanding some of the central concepts of calculus.
The graph of a function f is the graph of the equation y = f(x). For example, if we define a function f by the equation f(x) = 2x −3, then the graph of f is the graph of the equation y = 2x −3, which is the line in Figure 1.9a. In the equation y = f(x), the variable x is sometimes called the independent variable, and y is the dependent variable. The reason for this terminology is that we are free to choose any value for x (as long as the value is in the domain of f), but once a value for x has been chosen, the equation y = f (x) determines a corresponding value for y. Thus, the value of y depends on the value of x, but the value of x doesn't depend on anything. We may sometimes use other letters for the independent and dependent variables, but the letters x and y are used most often.
You can learn a lot about a function f very easily by looking at its graph, and we will therefore use graphs of functions extensively throughout this book. Perhaps most important is the fact that the value of f (a) for any particular number a can be read off from the graph. To see how, simply note that a point (a, b) will be on the graph of f if and only if the assignment of values x = a, y = b makes the equation y = f(x) true, that is, if and only if b = f (a). Thinking of the function f as a machine, this means that a point (a, b) will be on the graph of f if and only if when you feed the number a into the machine, the number b comes out. Thus, if a is in the domain of f then there will be exactly one point on the graph of f whose x-coordinate is a; the y-coordinate of that point will be f (a). If a is not in the domain, then there will be no point on the graph with x-coordinate a.
Another way to say this is that if a is in the domain of f then the vertical line x = a intersects the graph of f exactly once, at the point (a, f (a)), and if a is not in the domain of f then the vertical line x = a does not intersect the graph of f at all. Thus, no vertical line intersects the graph of f more than once. Conversely, if some curve does not intersect any vertical line more than once, then the curve is the graph of some function f. We can define f by saying that the domain of f is the set of numbers a such that the line x = a intersects the curve, and for each such number a, f (a) is the y-coordinate of the unique point where the line x = a intersects the curve. Thus, we can say that a curve is the graph of a function if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once. This is sometimes called the vertical line test.
We have seen that the domain of a function f is equal to the set of all numbers that appear as the x-coordinate of a point on the graph of f. There is also a name for the set of numbers appearing as the y-coordinate of a point on the graph of f; it is called the range of f. Thinking of f as a machine, we could say that the domain of f is the set of all numbers that can be fed into the machine, and the range is the set of all numbers that come out.
Let's try out these ideas in some examples. The curve in Figure 1.15a passes the vertical line test, so it is the graph of a function f. Although we don't have a formula for f(x), we can see that f(−1) = 3, f(1) = 2, f(3) = 4, and f(4) = 5, because the points (−1, 3), (1, 2), (3, 4), and (4, 5) are on the graph. We can also see that the domain of f is the interval [−1, 5), and the range is the interval [2, 5]. On the other hand, the black curve in Figure 1.15b is not the graph of a function, because it fails the vertical line test. The line x = 2, shown in red, crosses the curve three times.
Figure 1.16 shows the graphs of the functions g(x) = |x| and h(x) = ⎿x⏌. The graph of g is the graph of the equation y = |x|, and filling in the definition of |x| this means



Figure 1.15: The curve in (a) is the graph of a function, but the curve in (b) is not.



Figure 1.16: Graphs of the functions g(x) = |x| and h(x) = ⎿x⏌.

For x ≥ 0 this is the same as the graph of y = x, which is a line with slope 1 and passing through the origin. For x < 0, it is the same as the graph of y = −x, a line through the origin with slope −1. Putting these two pieces together gives us the graph shown in Figure 1.16a. Similarly, the equation y = h(x) = ⎿x⏌ means that y = 0 when 0 ≤ x < 1, y = 1 when 1 ≤ x < 2, and so on. This leads to the infinitely many horizontal line segments that make up the graph of h in Figure 1.16b. The domains of g and h are both R. The range of g is the interval [0,∞), and the range of h is the set of all integers, which is usually denoted Z.
To illustrate the usefulness of graphs of functions, let us return to Example 1.1.6, in which we solved the inequality 2|x|−3 ≥ |x −1|. Define functions f and g by the formulas
f(x) = 2|x|−3,g(x) = |x −1|.


Figure 1.17: The red curve is the graph of y = f(x) = 2|x|−3, and the blue curve is the graph of y = g(x) = |x −1|.

To graph f, we graph the equation y = 2|x|−3. As in Figure 1.16a, this consists of the line y = 2x −3 for x ≥ 0 together with the line y = −2x −3 for x < 0. Thus, the graph of f is the red curve in Figure 1.17, and similar reasoning shows that the graph of g is the blue curve. We will leave it to you to compute the intersection points that are shown in Figure 1.17. The inequality from Example 1.1.6 is f (x) ≥ g(x), and since f(x) and g(x) give the y-coordinates of points on the red and blue curves, the solution set of the inequality is just the set of x values for which the red curve is at least as high as the blue curve. Looking at Figure 1.17, it is clear that this solution set is (−∞,−4] ∪[2,∞), exactly as we found in Example 1.1.6.
Since graphs of functions are so useful, given a function it will be important to be able to draw its graph. We will see later how calculus can be used to draw accurate graphs of functions, but for now we will just mention a method that can be used to get started on drawing the graph of a function f. Pick a collection of values of x in the domain of the function and compute, for each value of x, the corresponding value of y = f(x). This will give you the coordinates of a collection of points on the graph of f.
For example, in Figure 1.18 we have computed a table of values for the function f defined by the equation f(x) = x3 −4x2 + 2x +2 and plotted the corresponding points. The points seem to lie along a smooth curve, so we have filled in such a curve passing through the plotted points as the graph of f. Filling in this curve is, at this point, guess-work. The only points we can be sure are on the graph are the ones whose coordinates we computed. The graph of f might have extra wiggles between the plotted points, and it might have further bends beyond the part of the graph we have drawn. Of course, we could plot more points to try to detect further features of the graph, but no matter how many points we plot we will always be guessing if we fill in a curve connecting these points. One important application of calculus is that it will allow us to get many important features of the graph of a function right without guesswork.


Figure 1.18: Graphing the function f(x) = x3 −4x2 + 2x +2.

You might think that another way to get an accurate graph of a function without guesswork is to use a computer or graphing calculator. But what does a computer do when you ask it to graph a function? The answer is that it simply plots some points and then draws a smooth curve through those points! Thus, the computer-produced graph is also based on guesswork. In practice, computer-drawngraphs are usually fairly accurate, because the computer is able to plot many more points than you could plot by hand. For example, in Figure 1.18 we plotted 10 points, but a computer might plot hundreds of points when graphing a function. But computers do sometimes miss important features of graphs of functions. In contrast, the calculus-based methods we will learn later never miss important features of graphs of functions, because they involve no guesswork.

1.4 Combining Functions
Sometimes we will want to combine functions to create new functions. For example, suppose f and g are functions. We can define a new function h by the equation

The function h is called the sum of f and g, and it is denoted f + g. Thus, we can write h = f + g, and substituting f + g for h in equation (1.7) we have

It is important to understand that the two plus signs in equation (1.8) have different meanings. On the right-hand side of the equation, the plus sign appears between f (x) and g(x), which are numbers, and the plus sign stands for ordinary addition of numbers. But on the left-hand side, it appears between f and g, which are functions, and it stands for a new kind of addition, addition of functions. The expression f + g is the name of a function—the function that we originally called h in equation (1.7). Equation (1.8) tells us how to apply the function f + g to a number x. Figure 1.21 shows the function f + g as a machine, constructed from machines for the functions f and g.


Figure 1.21: The function f + g, viewed as a machine.

For example, suppose f and g are the functions defined by the equations

Then f + g is the function defined by

This is just the function that we called h in Example 1.3.1. Notice that in order for the formula for (f + g)(x) to make sense for some particular value of x, both f (x) and g(x) must make sense; in other words, x must be in the domains of both f and g. It follows that the domain of f + g is the intersection of the domains of f and g. We will leave it for you to verify that in this example, the domain of f is [0,∞) and the domain of g is (−∞, 3), so the domain of f + g is [0,∞) ∩(−∞, 3) = [0, 3). Of course, this is in agreement with what we got for the domain of h in Example 1.3.1.
The ideas we have just discussed for addition of functions can also be applied to subtraction, multiplication, and division. We summarize these ideas with the following definition.
Definition 1.4.1. Suppose f and g are functions. Then the functions f + g, f − g, f · g, and f / g are defined as follows:
(f + g)(x) = f (x)+ g(x),
(f − g)(x) = f (x)− g(x),
(f · g)(x) = f (x) · g(x),
(f/g)(x) = f (x)/g(x).
Notice that if the domains of f and g are D f and Dg, then the domains of f + g, f − g, and f · g are all D f ∩ Dg. For f/g, we must add the further restriction that g(x) must not be 0. Thus, the domain of f/g is

There is one more important way of combining functions that we will make extensive use of:
Definition 1.4.2. Suppose f and g are functions. Then the composition of f and g is the function f ◦ g defined by the formula
(f ◦ g)(x) = f (g(x)).
Thus, to apply the function f ◦ g to a number x, we first apply the function g to x to get g(x), and then we apply f to g(x) to get f (g(x)). Figure 1.22 shows how machines for the functions f and g can be combined to construct a machine for f ◦ g.


Figure 1.22: The function f ◦ g, viewed as a machine.

For example, let f (x) = 3x +1 and g(x) = x2 −2. To compute (f ◦ g)(3) = f (g(3)), we first compute g(3) = 32 −2 = 7, and then we apply f to get f (g(3)) = f (7) = 3(7)+1 = 22. More generally, for every number x we have
(f ◦ g)(x) = f (g(x)) = f (x2 −2) = 3(x2 −2)+1 = 3x2 −5.
Notice that
(g ◦ f)(x) = g(f (x)) = g(3x +1) = (3x +1)2 −2 = 9x2 +6x −1,
which is an entirely different function. For example, we have seen that (f ◦ g)(3) = 22, but (g ◦ f)(3) = 9(32)+6(3)−1 = 98. Thus, f ◦ g is not the same as g ◦ f.
For any functions f and g, in order for the formula (f ◦ g)(x) = f (g(x)) to make sense, x must be in the domain of g, so that g(x) is defined, and then g(x) must be in the domain of f, so that f (g(x)) is defined. Thus, if the domains of f and g are Df and Dg, as before, then the domain of f ◦ g is
Df ◦g = {x : x ∈ Dg and g(x) ∈ Df }.
Example 1.4.3. Let f, g, and h be the following functions:

Find (f − g)(x), (f/g)(x), ((f − g) ◦ h)(x), and (f −(g ◦ h))(x). What are the domains of these functions?
Solution.

where we got a common denominator in order to be able to combine the fractions and simplify. We also do some algebraic simplifications in our next calculation:

Using our answer for (f − g)(x), we can compute that

Finally, the difference in grouping in the third function leads to a different answer:

To find the domains of these functions, we first note that the domains of f, g, and h are

The domain of f − g is

The domain of f / g is the same, except that we must also rule out any values of x for which g(x) = 0. Since the only such value is x = 0, we find that

You might think that, since our formula for (f/g)(x) simplified to 1+3/x, the only number missing from the domain of f / g should be 0, but this is incorrect. As in Example 1.3.1,our algebraic simplifications have hidden the fact that the formula f (x)/g(x) makes no sense for x = ±3.
Similarly, since our formula for ((f − g) ◦ h)(x) simplified to 3/(x −5), you might think at first that the domain of (f − g) ◦ h is {x : x = 5}, but this would be incorrect. The correct calculation is

Now,  can never be equal to −3, since the notation  means √the nonnegative square root of x +4, so we always have  But solving  we get x +4 = 9, or x = 5. So the domain of (f − g) ◦ h is
D(f−g)◦h = {x : x ≥ −4 and x = 5} = [−4, 5) ∪(5,∞).
Finally, the domain of f −(g ◦ h) is

In Example 1.4.3, we started with formulas for the functions f, g, and h and then worked out combinations of these functions. Sometimes it will be useful to be able to go in the opposite direction: given a complicated function, can we figure out how it could have been constructed by combining simpler functions?
Example 1.4.4. Let f, g, and h be defined as follows:

Write each of these functions as a combination of simpler functions.
Solution. A good way to approach this problem is to imagine that you are computing the value of one of these functions at some particular value of x, and think about what the last step in this computation would be. For example, if you were computing f (x) for some particular value of x, you would first compute x −3 and x2 +1, and then you would divide the first by the second. The last step in this computation is division, which suggests that f could be written as a quotient of two functions. Indeed, if we define f1(x) = x −3 and f2(x) = x2 +1, then

so f = f1/f2.
For the function g, to compute g(x) you would first compute x3 +1 and then take the cube root of that number. The last step is taking the cube root, which suggests that we could write g = g1 ◦ g2, where  The quantity that we must take the cube root of is x3 +1, so we define g2(x) = x3 +1 and then check that

Finally, the last step in computing h(x) is to apply the greatest integer function, which suggests that h = h1 ◦ h2, where h1(x) = ⎿x⏌. You can check that if h2(x) = (x +7)5 then h = h1 ◦ h2. But notice that h2 can itself be written as a composition of two simpler functions: to compute h2(x) we first compute x +7 and then raise that number to the fifth power, so h2 = h3 ◦ h4, where h3(x) = x5 and h4(x) = x +7. So we have h = h1 ◦ h2 = h1 ◦ (h3 ◦ h4).
Example 1.4.4 shows that a complicated function can sometimes be written as a combination of simpler functions, and these simpler functions might themselves be expressible as combinations of still simpler functions. This suggests that we ask the question: What are the simplest possible functions?
Surely the simplest functions are those functions f defined by equations of the form f (x) = c, for some real number c. For example, consider the function f defined by the equation
f (x) = 13.
You might think at first that this can't be a definition of a function, because the formula for f (x) doesn't have an x in it. But remember that what this function definition really means is:
For every real number x, f (x) = 13.
Thus, f is the rule that associates, with any number x, the number 13. If we think of this function as a machine, then when a number x is fed into the machine, the machine simply ignores the input x and outputs the number 13. The graph of f is the graph of the equation y = 13, which is a horizontal line passing through the number 13 on the y-axis. The graph of any function defined by an equation of the form f (x) = c, where c is a number, will be a horizontal line. Such functions are called constant functions.
The simplest function that is not a constant function is the function g defined by the formula
g(x) = x.
A machine for computing g(x) would take its input x and simply spit it back out unchanged. The output of this machine is identical to its input, so the function g is called the identity function. Its graph is the line y = x, a line with slope 1 passing through the origin (0, 0).
Starting with just constant functions and the identity function, we can construct many more complex functions. For example, if g is the identity function then
(g · g)(x) = g(x) · g(x) = x · x = x2,
((g · g) · g)(x) = (g · g)(x) · g(x) = x2 · x = x3,
(((g · g) · g) · g)(x) = ((g · g) · g)(x) · g(x) = x3 · x = x4,
etc.
Thus, any function of the form f (x) = xn, where n is a positive integer, can be obtained by multiplying the identity function by itself repeatedly. Multiplying such a function by a constant function, we can obtain any function of the form h(x) = cxn, where c is a real number. For example, the functions f1(x) = 3x5, f2(x) = −5x2, and f3(x) = 7x can all be obtained by multiplying constant functions and the identity function. Adding these functions, we obtain the function ((f1 + f2)+ f3)(x) = 3x5 −5x2 + 7x. In fact, it should be clear now that if we start with constant functions and the identity function and use multiplication and addition of functions, we can obtain any function of the form

where c0, c1, ..., cn are all real numbers. Functions of this form are called polynomials, and the number ck is called the coefficient of xk in the polynomial. The highest power of x appearing in the formula with a nonzero coefficient is called the degree of the polynomial. For example, p(x)= −2x4 + 8x2 +3 is a polynomial of degree 4. Functions of the form h(x) = mx +b are called linear functions, because their graphs are straight lines. If m = 0 then h is a polynomial of degree 1. If m = 0, then it is a constant function, which can also be thought of as a polynomial of degree 0. Polynomials of degree 2 have the form h(x) = ax2 +bx + c, where a = 0. Such functions are called quadratic functions, and their graphs are parabolas.
Why does it matter that polynomials can be built up from constant functions and the identity function by addition and multiplication? Later in this book we will introduce several new operations on functions, and we will want to learn how to apply these operations to many functions. A strategy we will use repeatedly is to first learn how to apply a new operation to constant functions and the identity function, and then learn how to apply the operation when functions are combined, for example by addition or multiplication. What we have just discovered is that this strategy will allow us to apply our new operation to any polynomial. In fact, we will push this idea much further in order to deal with a very wide range of functions.
If we divide two polynomials, we get a function of the form

where p and q are polynomials. Functions of this form are called rational functions. For instance, the function f in Example 1.4.4 is a rational function. We leave it as an exercise for you to check that if you add, subtract, multiply, or divide two rational functions, the result can be simplified so that it is once again in the form of a rational function. In fact, even a composition of two rational functions can be expressed as a rational function. Thus, we have reached the end of the line: starting with constant functions and the identity function, the functions you can construct by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and composition are the rational functions.
Of course, there are many functions that are not rational functions. For example, the function  is not a rational function. Combining this function with previously constructed functions, we can construct functions like these:

As we continue to study more functions, we will always be able to combine any new function we introduce with functions we have already studied to create and investigate more and more complicated functions.
Before closing this chapter we briefly mention a family of functions that we will want to include in all of our investigations: the trigonometric functions. We assume that you have studied trigonometric functions before, but here we review their definitions and some of their most important properties.
When defining the trigonometric functions, it is traditional to use the Greek letter θ (theta) as the independent variable. Some people define the trigonometric functions in terms of right triangles, but we prefer to base the definitions on the unit circle—the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin, whose equation is x2 + y2 = 1. Let P be the point (1, 0), which is on the unit circle. For any number θ, to compute the cosine and sine of θ, we begin at the point P and travel a distance of θ units counterclockwise along the circle, reaching a point Q. We define cos(θ) to be the x-coordinate of Q, and sin (θ) the y-coordinate, as shown in Figure 1.23. (A negative value of θ means that we should go in the opposite direction. In other words, if θ is negative, we travel clockwise |θ| units.) When working with trigonometric functions we often leave out the parentheses and write cos θ and sin θ.


Figure 1.23: The definitions of cos θ and sin θ.

We have specified the point Q in Figure 1.23 by giving the length of the arc PQ, but we could also think of Q as being determined by the measure of the angle POQ, where O is the origin. In calculus, we always measure angles in radians, not degrees. In Figure 1.23, the measure of angle POQ is θ radians; in other words, the radian measure of an angle is, by definition, the length of the arc of the unit circle cut off by the angle. Thus, in Figure 1.23 the number θ has two meanings: it is the length of the arc PQ, and it is also the measure, in radians, of the angle POQ. Since the circumference of the unit circle is 2π, 2π radians is the same as 360 degrees. Thus, an angle of π radians is 180 degrees, and an angle of π/2 radians is 90 degrees, a right angle.
Some facts about the cosine and sine functions are clear from the definition. Since the point (cos θ, sin θ) is always on the unit circle, we have the identity
cos2 θ +sin2 θ = 1,
where cos2 θ and sin2 θ mean (cos θ)2 and (sin θ)2. It should also be clear that −1 ≤ cos θ ≤ 1 and −1 ≤ sin θ ≤ 1. If we start at the point Q in Figure 1.23 and travel an additional distance 2π counterclockwise around the unit circle, then we just go all the way around the circle and end up back at Q. It follows that cos(θ + 2π) = cos θ and sin(θ +2π) = sin θ. We say that cos and sin are periodic, with period 2π. And if we reflect Q across the x-axis we reach the point (cos(−θ), sin(−θ)). Therefore cos(−θ) = cos θ and sin(−θ)= −sin θ; we say that cos is an even function, and sin is an odd function. The graphs of the functions cos and sin are shown in Figure 1.24, and some important values of these functions are given in Table 1.1.


Figure 1.24: The graphs of y = cos θ (red) and y = sin θ (blue).



Table 1.1: Some important values of the sine and cosine functions.



Figure 1.25: Triangle ABC in (a) is similar to triangle QOR in (b).

The other trigonometric functions are tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant, and they are defined as follows:

Although we have not used right triangles to define the trigonometric functions, it is important to know how the functions can be used to relate the sides and angles in a right triangle. In the right triangle in Figure 1.25a, we have cos θ = a/c, sin θ = b/c, and tan θ = b/a. You can see this by observing that triangle ABC in Figure 1.25a is similar to triangle QOR in Figure 1.25b. You can now read off cos θ and sin θ from the coordinates of the point Q, using the definitions of the cosine and sine functions.

1It is an unfortunate fact that the notation for a point in the plane is the same as the notation for an open interval, namely a pair of numbers in parentheses. You will have to tell from context whether, for example, the notation (3, 5) stands for the open interval from 3 to 5 or the point in the plane whose coordinates are 3 and 5.

2.1 What is Calculus About?
What is calculus about? One way to answer this question is to list topics that are studied in calculus: slopes of tangent lines, velocities and other rates of change, areas, volumes, and so on. But this answer doesn't explain what these topics have in common, and what sets them off from the topics studied in other branches of mathematics such as algebra.
In fact, there is something that all of these topics have in common, and that makes calculus different from algebra. All of the topics studied in calculus involve computing something that, it seems at first, can only be computed approximately and not exactly. For every topic we study, we will begin with a method that can be used to find an approximate answer to the problem we are trying to solve. And there is a second ingredient that will be a part of every calculus topic: given an approximate answer to the problem, there will be a way to make the answer more accurate, although still not exactly correct.
Thus, in calculus we study problems for which we can find better and better approximate answers, but we have no direct way of finding an exact answer. It might seem at first that this is all we can accomplish: that we will have to settle for approximate answers that are good enough for all practical purposes, and we will never know the exact answers to our problems. But in fact we can do better. The central idea in calculus is a very clever method of finding exact answers in these situations in which it seems impossible to do so. The idea is to compute the exact answer by finding the unique number that the approximations get closer and closer to as they get more accurate.
There are many paradoxical features of calculus, and we will mention some others as we come to them, but this is the first and most central paradox: calculus is a subject in which we find exact answers by means of approximation. We will call this the paradox of precision through approximation.
To explain how it is possible to achieve precision through approximation, let us consider an example. Suppose you throw a ball straight up with an initial velocity of 160 feet per second. Physicists have determined that the height of the ball after t seconds will be 160t −16t2 feet, for 0 ≤ t ≤ 10. Of course, this is an example of a function. If we let h(t) stand for the height of the ball, in feet, after t seconds, then h is a function with domain [0, 10], and for 0 ≤ t ≤ 10 we have
h(t) = 160t −16t2.
If we think of the ball as moving along a vertical number line, with the origin at ground level and units marked off vertically in feet, then we could also think of h (t) as giving the position of the ball on this number line at time t. The graph of h is shown in Figure 2.1. (Note that this is the graph of h, not a picture of the trajectory of the ball; the ball is thrown straight up, so it simply goes up and then down along our vertical number line, without traveling horizontally at all.)


Figure 2.1: The graph of y = h(t).

A number of properties of this function can be seen immediately in the graph. For example, we can see that h(0) = 0, h(5) = 400, and h(10) = 0. As t increases from 0 to 5 to 10, the value of h(t) increases from 0 to 400 and decreases back to 0. In terms of the behavior of the ball, this means that the ball begins at ground level, rises to a height of 400 feet after 5 seconds, and then comes back down, hitting the ground after 10 seconds.
A closer examination of the graph reveals more details of the ball's motion. The first part of the graph—say, for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2—slopes up steeply. This tells us that as t increases through the interval [0, 2], h(t) increases quickly, which means that the ball is rising quickly. In the time interval [3, 5], the graph is still sloping upwards, but more gently. Thus, during this interval, h(t) is increasing more slowly, and therefore the ball is rising more slowly. Similarly, for t ∈ [5, 7] the ball is falling slowly, and for t ∈ [8, 10] it is falling more quickly.
Can we quantify these statements? Let us define the displacement of the ball during a time interval [a, b] to be h(b)−h(a). The displacement tells us how much the position of the ball has changed over this time interval, with a positive value indicating that it is higher at the end of the time interval than at the beginning, and a negative value indicating that it is lower. The average velocity of the ball during this time interval is the displacement divided by b−a, the length of the time interval, and it tells us how far the ball has moved per unit of time that has elapsed. Since we are measuring distances in feet and time in seconds in this example, the average velocity will be measured in feet per second, abbreviated ft/sec.
For example, the average velocity of the ball during the time interval [0, 2] is

But during the interval [3, 5] the average velocity is only

This confirms our informal observation that the ball was rising more quickly during the time interval [0, 2] than during the interval [3, 5]. Notice that these average velocities could also be interpreted as the slopes of two lines. The first is the slope of the line passing through the points (0, h(0)) = (0, 0) and (2, h(2)) = (2, 256), and the second is the slope of the line through (3, h(3)) = (3, 336) and (5, h(5)) = (5, 400).All of these points are on the graph of h. Thus, each line is determined by two points on the graph of h, as shown in Figure 2.2; such lines are called secant lines for the curve y = h(t). Of course, the secant line for the interval [0, 2] slants up more steeply than the one for the interval [3, 5], so its slope is larger.
The average velocities during the intervals [5, 7] and [8, 10] are

The negative values here mean that the height of the ball is decreasing, and it is falling more quickly during the time interval [8, 10] than during the interval [5, 7]. Once again these average velocities can be interpreted as slopes of secant lines, as illustrated in Figure 2.2.
So far we have found exact answers for all of the questions we have asked, but now let us ask a more difficult question: What is the velocity of the ball at the time t = 3? Since we are asking for the velocity at a single instant, rather than over an interval of time, this is called the instantaneous velocity of the ball at t = 3.
As a first step, we note that 3 is the beginning of the interval [3, 5], and we have already computed that the average velocity of the ball during this time interval is 32 ft/sec. So 32 ft/sec might be a good approximation to the velocity at the time t = 3.


Figure 2.2: Average velocities interpreted as slopes of secant lines. The slopes of the four blue secant lines shown in the graph are 128, 32, −32, and −128. These are the average velocities of the ball during the time intervals [0, 2], [3, 5], [5, 7], and [8, 10].

But in Figure 2.1 it appears that the ball is slowing down during this time interval, so the velocity is probably more than 32 ft/sec at the beginning of the time interval and less than 32 ft/sec at the end. Indeed, if we split the interval in half and compute the average velocity in the first and second halves of the interval, we find that the average velocity during the time interval [3, 4] is

while the average velocity during the interval [4, 5] is

Thus, 48 ft/sec is probably a better estimate of the instantaneous velocity of the ball at t = 3. However, it is still only an approximation, since the velocity of the ball changes during the time interval [3, 4] as well.
Figure 2.3 shows the secant lines whose slopes give the average velocity of the ball during the intervals [3, 5] and [3, 4].We see in the figure that as the right endpoint of the time interval decreases from 5 to 4, the secant line rotates counterclockwise and its slope increases. It appears that if we continue to decrease the right endpoint, the secant line will continue to rotate, coming closer and closer to the line that just touches the graph of h at the point (3, h(3)). This line is said to be tangent to the graph at t = 3.


Figure 2.3: Secant lines whose slopes give the average velocity of the ball during the intervals [3, 5] and [3, 4]. As the right endpoint of the interval decreases, the secant line rotates counterclockwise and comes closer to the tangent line at t = 3, shown in red.



Table 2.1: Average velocity of the ball during some short time intervals.

Perhaps to get a really good approximation to the velocity of the ball at t = 3 we should compute the average velocity over a time interval so short that the velocity doesn't have time to change much. Table 2.1 shows the average velocity during the intervals [3, 3.1], [3, 3.01], and [3, 3.001]. We could also consider time intervals that come before t = 3, so the table shows the average velocity during the intervals [2.9, 3], [2.99, 3], and [2.999, 3]. If we were to add the secant lines corresponding to these average velocities to Figure 2.3, they would be almost indistinguishable from the tangent line.
It appears from the table that the instantaneous velocity at t = 3 is close to 64 ft/sec, and it seems reasonable to say that this is also the slope of the line tangent to the graph of h at the point (3, h(3)). However, the data in the table are consistent with other answers, such as 63.99 ft/sec or 64.01 ft/sec. For many purposes this approximate answer might be good enough. But remember that the central idea of calculus is to achieve precision through approximation. The question we want to ask is, can we determine the exact velocity at t = 3, even though all of our calculations give only approximate answers?
We could compute even better approximations by using even shorter time intervals, but that won't solve our problem. If we are to discover a precise answer, we need to see if there is a pattern to how the approximations change as they improve. As a step in this direction, let's find the general formula for the average velocity of the ball during the time interval between t = 3 and t = 3+ x, for any number x = 0. For x > 0 this would be the interval [3, 3+ x], and the average velocity would be

For x < 0 we have 3+ x < 3, so the time interval would be [3+ x, 3], with average velocity

Thus, for both x > 0 and x < 0 the average velocity is given by the function

What is the domain of the function f ? In order for the term h(3+ x) that appears in the formula for f (x) to make sense, 3+ x must be in the domain of h, which is the interval [0, 10]. Thus, we must have 0 ≤ 3+ x ≤ 10, or equivalently −3 ≤ x ≤ 7. But the formula for f (x) is also undefined when x = 0, since we would have a 0 in the denominator. Therefore the domain of f is [−3, 0) ∪(0, 7].
We have already computed several values of f (x). For example, the first three rows of Table 2.1 show that f (0.1) = 62.4, f (0.01) = 63.84, and f (0.001) = 63.984. By computing f (x) for values of x closer and closer to 0, we should be able to get better and better approximations to the velocity of the ball at time t = 3. It seems that if only we could find the value of f (x) at x = 0 we would have the exact answer. But 0 is the one value of x in the interval [−3, 7] that we cannot use, because it is not in the domain of f.
Maybe we can learn something by examining the graph of f. To find the graph, we first simplify the formula for f (x).We have already computed that h(3) = 336, and we have
h(3+ x) = 160(3+ x)−16(3+ x)2
= 480+160x −16(9+6x + x2)
= 336 +64x −16x2.
Thus, for all x ∈ [−3, 0) ∪(0, 7],



Figure 2.4: The graph of the function f. As x approaches 0, f (x) approaches 64.

The graph of y = f (x) is therefore the same as the graph of y = 64 −16x, except that we must include only points whose x-coordinates are in the set [−3, 0) ∪(0, 7], since this is the domain of f. The graph of y = 64 −16x is a straight line with slope −16 and y-intercept 64, so the graph of f is a line segment with one point removed, as shown in Figure 2.4. The line y = 64 −16x passes through the point (0, 64), but this point is missing from the graph of f, as indicated by the open circle in Figure 2.4, because 0 is not in the domain of f.
We can think of a number x that is getting closer and closer to 0 as a point on the x-axis that is moving toward the origin. Directly above this point is a point P on the graph of f. The coordinates of P are (x, f (x)), so a horizontal line through P crosses the y-axis at the number f (x). As x gets closer and closer to 0, the point P moves along the graph of f toward the point (0, 64), and therefore f (x) gets closer and closer to 64, as shown in Figure 2.4. The figure shows x approaching 0 from the right, but the situation would be similar if x were approaching 0 from the left. Thus, as x gets closer and closer to 0 from either side, f (x) gets closer and closer to 64. We can also see this from the formula f (x) = 64 −16x: as x gets closer and closer to 0, the term 16x gets closer and closer to 0, and the value of 64 −16x approaches 64. We say that 64 is the limit of f (x) as x approaches 0, and we write limx→0 f (x) = 64. We will give a more careful explanation of this statement later in this chapter, but for the moment we simply rely on intuition.
Recall that our strategy for finding the exact velocity of the ball at time t = 3 was to determine the value that the approximations get closer and closer to as they are made more and more accurate. We have now carried out this strategy: we can make the approximations more and more accurate by taking x closer and closer to 0, and when we do this the approximations approach 64 ft/sec. Thus, the exact velocity of the ball at t = 3 is 64 ft/sec. We can also say that the slope of the line tangent to the curve y = h(t) at the point (3, h(3)) is 64.
In the end, the problem of finding the instantaneous velocity of the ball turned into the problem of evaluating limx→0 f (x). For the rest of this chapter we set aside problems like the ball velocity problem and address the issue of evaluating limits of functions. Once we have learned how to evaluate limits, we will be ready to develop a systematic approach to solving problems involving velocities, tangent lines, and other related concepts. In all of these problems, the use of limits is what will allow us to achieve precision through approximation.
In the example above, once we found a simple formula for f (x) and drew its graph, the value of the limit became intuitively clear. But this is not always the case. For example, consider the limit

To investigate this limit, we must see if (sin θ)/θ gets closer and closer to some particular number as θ gets closer and closer to 0. We cannot actually set θ = 0 in the formula (sin θ)/θ, since we would be dividing by 0. But plugging in values of θ close to 0 gives the values shown in Table 2.2. In this table, it appears that (sin θ)/θ is getting very close to 1 as θ approaches 0. But can we be sure that this trend will continue? Can we be sure that 1 is the exact answer, rather than, say, 1.001? In this case, in contrast to the case of the function f, we have no explanation for why the values of (sin θ)/θ are getting close to 1. We don't know anything about the pattern of how (sin θ)/θ will continue to change as θ gets even closer to 0, so we cannot be confident that we have found the value of the limit.
Or consider the limit

Notice that the expression  is undefined not only when x = 2, but also when x is negative. However, it is defined for all values of x that are sufficiently close to 2 but not equal to 2. More specifically, if the distance between x and 2 is less than 2 but not 0, then x is positive and x = 2, so f (x) is defined. Since the distance between x and 2 is |x −2|, we can express this by saying that if 0 < |x −2| < 2 then f (x) is defined. In general, we will only study a limit of the form limx→a f (x) if there is a number d > 0 such that for all x, if 0 < |x −a| < d then f (x) is defined. It is only in this situation that it makes sense to ask what happens to the value of f (x) as x gets closer and closer to a.


Table 2.2: Values of (sin θ)/θ for θ close to 0. (Note that θ is measured in radians here.)



Table 2.3: Values of  for x close to 2.

Some values of  for x close to 2 are given in Table 2.3. The values seem to be settling on a number a bit larger than 0.35, but are they really settling on some particular number, or are they just wandering around a certain small region on the number line? Is there a way to discover an exact value for this limit?
In fact, the value of limθ→0(sin θ)/θ √is exactly 1, and the precise value of  turns out to be  your calculator will tell you that the decimal value of this number is about 0.3535534. The graphs of the equations y = (sin θ)/θ and  are shown in Figure 2.5. By the end of this chapter, we will have developed the tools necessary to determine the values of both of these limits, and many more.

2.2What Does "Limit" Mean?
It is surprisingly difficult to put one's finger on exactly what the word "limit" means. In the last section we suggested that "limx→a f (x) = L" means that as x gets closer and closer to a, f (x) gets closer and closer to L. While this description may give you an intuitive feeling for what we mean by the word "limit," it turns out to be unhelpful when it comes to developing the kind of precise understanding of the limit concept that is necessary for solving difficult limit problems.
To begin to develop a better understanding of limits, let's consider another example. Let

Of course, the domain of g is {x : x = 2} = (−∞, 2) ∪(2,∞).We can't compute g(2), since 2 is not in the domain of g, but we can investigate limx→2 g(x).
Factoring the numerator of g(x), we find that for all x ∈ (−∞, 2) ∪(2,∞),

It follows that the graph of g is the same as the graph of the equation y = 2x −1, except that we must leave out the point with x-coordinate 2. In other words, the graph of g is the line with slope 2 and y-intercept −1, but with the point (2, 3) removed. The graph of g is shown in Figure 2.6.
It seems clear from Figure 2.6 that limx→2 g(x) = 3. But now we would like to develop a more precise understanding of exactly what this means. We begin with the idea that when x is close to 2, g(x) should be close to 3. Of course, we can't actually let x = 2, since g(2) is undefined, so a more careful statement is that when x is close to 2, but not equal to 2, g(x) should be close to 3. To say that two numbers are close is the same as saying that the distance between them is small, and we know that the distance between two numbers a and b is |a −b|. So another way to express the idea we are interested in is that whenever |x −2| is small, but not 0, |g(x)−3| should be small. In other words, statements of the following form should be true:
For every number x, if 


Figure 2.6: The graph of g.

It remains to determine what numbers to put in the blanks. Of course, these numbers will measure how close x is to 2, and how close g(x) is to 3.
As a first step in understanding statement (2.3), let's try putting particular numbers in the blanks. A little experimentation with different numbers leads to the following fact:
Proposition 2.2.1. For the function g defined in equation (2.1), the following statement is true:
For every number x, if 0 < |x −2| < 1/2 then |g(x)−3| < 1.
Proof. Suppose 0 < |x −2| < 1/2. Since |x −2| > 0, x = 2, so g(x) is defined, and by equation (2.2), g(x) = 2x −1. Therefore
|g(x)−3| = |(2x −1)−3| = |2x −4| = |2(x −2)| = |2||x −2| = 2|x −2|,
where we have used part 1 of Theorem 1.1.4 in the fourth step. We know that |x −2| < 1/2, and multiplying both sides of this inequality by 2, we find that 2|x −2| < 1. Since |g(x)−3| = 2|x −2|, we conclude that |g(x)−3| < 1.
Figure 2.7 illustrates Proposition 2.2.1. The values of x for which 0 < |x −2| < 1/2 are those that are within 1/2 of 2,except for 2 itself. In other words, they are the values that lie between the vertical dashed lines in Figure 2.7. Looking at the part of the graph of g between these vertical dashed lines, which is shown in blue in the figure, we see that for all these values of x, g(x) is between 2 and 4, which means that |g(x)−3| < 1.


Figure 2.7: For every number x, if 0 < |x −2| < 1/2 then |g(x)−3| < 1.

Proposition 2.2.1 shows that when x gets close enough to 2, g(x) gets fairly close to 3—specifically, g(x) gets to be within 1 of 3. But our hope is to achieve precision through approximation, so we need to do better than this. As at least a step in the right direction, can we show that g(x) will get closer to 3—say, within 1/10 of 3? The answer is yes, but to make it happen we will need to require that x be closer to 2. Perhaps you can guess how close x will have to be to 2. Imitating the proof of Proposition 2.2.1, you should be able to establish the following fact:

There is a pattern here, and rather than working out more particular examples let's state the general pattern. It is customary to use the Greek letter ε (epsilon) to measure how close g(x) is to 3. Using this notation, we can state the general pattern like this:
Proposition 2.2.2. Let g be the function defined in equation (2.1). Then for every positive number ε, the following statement is true:
For every number x, if 0 < |x −2| < ε/2 then |g(x)−3| < ε.
Proof. Let ε be any positive number, and suppose that 0 < |x −2| < ε/2. Since |x −2| > 0, x = 2, so g(x) is defined and g(x) = 2x −1. Therefore
|g(x)−3| = |2x −4| = |2(x −2)| = |2||x −2| = 2|x −2| < 2(ε/2) = ε.
Notice that the second-to-last step above is justified by multiplying both sides of the known inequality |x −2| < ε/2 by 2.
Setting ε = 1 in Proposition 2.2.2 we get Proposition 2.2.1, and setting ε = 1/10 we get statement (2.4). Proposition 2.2.1 achieves a fairly low level of accuracy about the value of g(x) when x is close to 2; statement (2.4) achieves a somewhat higher level of accuracy. But Proposition 2.2.2 achieves complete precision by allowing for all possible positive numbers ε. Proposition 2.2.2 tells us that g(x) will get within 0.001 of 3, or within 0.0001, or within whatever positive distance you might choose, if only we make sure that x is sufficiently close to 2. (Notice that only positive numbers make sense for ε. It would make no sense to talk about g(x) being within, say, −0.01 of 3!) We have therefore achieved our goal of precision through approximation.
We will express the fact established in Proposition 2.2.2 by saying that as x approaches 2, without being equal to 2, g(x) approaches 3. And it will be convenient to have a shorthand notation for this, so we write: as x →2=, g(x)→ 3. We should warn you that, although many calculus books use similar arrow notation, the use of the superscript "=" is not common. However, we prefer to include this in our notation to remind you that although x gets close to 2, it is never equal to 2.
In the future, we will leave out the phrase "for every number x" in statement (2.3), leaving it as understood that we are making a general statement about all values of x. And it will be convenient to have names for the numbers that go in both of the blanks in this statement. We have already introduced the use of the letter ε for the number that goes in the second blank. There is also a customary letter that is used in the first blank: the Greek letter δ (delta). Using these conventions, we could restate the conclusion of Proposition 2.2.2 as follows. For every ε > 0, if we let δ = ε/2, then the following statement is true:
If 0 < |x −2| < δ then |g(x)−3| < ε.
Notice that the equation δ = ε/2 implies that for different values of ε, we will have different values of δ. For each value of ε there is a corresponding value of δ.
Much of what we have said about this example will also apply to other cases. In general, when we are investigating a limit of the form limx→a f (x), we will want to find a number L such that if x is close to a, but not equal to a, then f (x) is close to L. Thus, we will be interested in the statement "if 0 < |x −a| < δ then | f (x)− L| < ε." To achieve complete precision we will want this statement to be true for every positive number ε, as long as we make a suitable choice for δ. But the choice δ = ε/2 that worked for our example g might not be the right choice in other cases. We are therefore led to make the following definition.
Definition 2.2.3. For any function f and numbers a and L, we write "as x → a=, f (x)→ L" to mean that for every numberε > 0, there is some corresponding number δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ then | f (x)− L| < ε.
To put it more informally, the statement "as x → a=, f (x) → L" means that we can get f (x) to be as close as we please to L by making x sufficiently close to a (but not equal to a).
Perhaps you have guessed by now that we are going to define limx→a f (x) to be the number L such that as x →a=, f (x)→ L. But there is a potential problem with this definition. Might there be more than one number L such that as x →a=, f (x) → L? If so, the notation limx→a f (x) would be ambiguous. Fortunately, this never happens:
Theorem 2.2.4. There cannot be more than one number L such that as x →a=, f (x)→ L.
You might regard Theorem 2.2.4 as confirming that the statement "as x →a=, f (x)→ L" pins down the value of L with complete precision. We will see in the next section why Theorem 2.2.4 is true. For now, we ask you to accept it so that we can make the following definition.
Definition 2.2.5. If there is a number L such that as x →a=, f (x)→ L, then we define limx→a f (x) to be the unique such number L. If there is no such number L, then limx→a f (x) is undefined.
We have seen that Definitions 2.2.3 and 2.2.5 accurately describe our example limx→2 g(x) = 3. But do they agree with our intuitions about all limits? To try to answer this question, let's try out these definitions on a few more examples. It will be most illuminating to examine these examples graphically, so we begin by getting a better idea of the graphical meaning of Definitions 2.2.3 and 2.2.5. According to Definition 2.2.5, to say that limx→a f (x) = L means that as x → a=, f (x)→ L. The meaning of this statement is given by Definition 2.2.3, which we might regard as describing a challenge and response. The challenge is given by the positive number ε: can we ensure that f (x) is within ε of L? And the response is the positive number δ. The response succeeds in meeting the challenge if whenever x is within δ of a, but not equal to a, f (x) is within ε of L. In other words, the response succeeds if the following statement, which we will call the ε-δ criterion, is true:

To say that as x →a=, f (x)→ L means that every challenge can be met successfully.
What is the graphical meaning of the ε-δ criterion? By part 1 of Theorem 1.1.2, the inequality |x −a| < δ is equivalent to −δ < x −a < δ, or in other words a −δ < x < a +δ. So to say that 0 < |x −a| < δ means that x is between a −δ and a +δ, but x = a. Similarly, to say that | f (x)− L| < ε means that L −ε < f (x) < L +ε. Thus, the ε-δ criterion tells us to look at the part of the graph of f that is between x = a −δ and x = a + δ, except for x = a. For the criterion to be met, the y-coordinates of the points on this part of the graph must be between L −ε and L +ε.
Perhaps it would be helpful to see what it would mean for the ε-δ criterion to be false. For the ε-δ criterion to fail, there would have to be a number x such that a −δ < x < a + δ and x = a, but | f (x)− L| ≥ ε. This number would correspond to a point on the graph of f that is either between the vertical lines x = a −δ and x = a or between the vertical lines x = a and x = a + δ, but not between the horizontal lines y = L −ε and y = L +ε. This point would be in the region that is shaded red in Figure 2.8. We call this region the forbidden region. Thus, for the ε-δ criterion to fail, the graph must include a point in the forbidden region. The ε-δ criterion could be thought of as saying that the graph of f does not go into the forbidden region.
Figure 2.8 shows the graph of a function f and some examples of values of ε and δ that might be used to test whether or not limx→a f (x) = L. In Figure 2.8a, the graph does not go into the forbidden region, and the ε-δ criterion is true. In Figure 2.8b, ε has been decreased, creating a more demanding challenge. The graph now goes into the forbidden region (where the graph is colored red), so the ε-δ criterion is false and the challenge has not been met. But the challenge could have been met, by using a smaller value of δ. Figure 2.8c shows the same challenge with a choice for δ that is small enough to meet the challenge. In fact, if you imagine ε being decreased further in Figure 2.8, you should be able to see that δ could always be decreased enough to make the ε-δ criterion true. Thus, in Figure 2.8 every challenge can be met, and therefore limx→a f (x) = L.


Figure 2.8: The graph of a function f for which limx→a f (x) = L. The red shaded region is the forbidden region. In (a), the graph does not enter the forbidden region, and the ε-δ criterion is true. In (b), ε has been decreased, and the ε-δ criterion is false. In (c), δ has also been decreased, and the ε-δ criterion is true again.

On the other hand, Figure 2.9 shows a function f for which limx→a f (x) is undefined. In Figure 2.9a the ε-δ criterion is satisfied, but in Figure 2.9b the value of ε is smaller and the ε-δ criterion is false. Notice that the point at (a, f (a)) is not in the forbidden region; the forbidden region includes only points whose x-coordinates are between a −δ and a+δ but not equal to a. However, there are points on the graph of f just to the left of (a, f (a)) that are in the forbidden region. Furthermore, this part of the graph goes right up to (a, f (a)), so no matter how small we make δ, we will not be able to avoid having points on the graph of f just to the left of (a, f (a)) that are in the forbidden region. Thus, for the value of ε shown in Figure 2.9b there is no corresponding value of δ for which the ε-δ criterion is true, and therefore according to Definition 2.2.3 it is not the case that as x → a=, f (x) → L. Similar reasoning shows that in fact there is no value of L for which as x →a=, f (x)→ L; you should try picking other values for L in the figure and checking that, in each case, you can draw an ε challenge that cannot be met. Therefore limx→a f (x) is undefined. This should make intuitive sense: When x is close to a but less than a, f (x) has one value, but when x is close to a but greater than a it has a different value. Thus, there is no single number that f (x) gets close to when x is close to a.

Table 2.4: Values of sin(π/(2x)) for x = ±1,±1/2,±1/3, . . . .

An interesting function that is helpful in elucidating the limit concept is the function h1 defined by the formula

Clearly h1(x) is defined for all x = 0, but h1(0) is undefined.
Table 2.4 gives values of h1(x) for x = 1, 1/2, 1/3, . . . and also for x = −1,−1/2,−1/3, . . . . It is not hard to see that the pattern in this table will continue, and as x approaches 0 from either the positive or the negative side, the value of h1(x) swings back and forth infinitely many times between −1 and 1. For values of x between the values shown in the table, h1(x) takes on all values between −1 and 1. It never takes values outside of this range, because the value of the sine function is always in the interval [−1, 1]. The graph of h1 is shown in Figure 2.10. The black area in the middle of the figure is actually infinitely many up-and-down wiggles that are crowded so close together that they are indistinguishable from each other.
Another interesting function related to h1 is the function h2 defined by the formula

The graph of h2, like that of h1, wiggles up and down infinitely many times. However, multiplying the inequality −1 ≤ sin (π/(2x)) ≤ 1 by |x|, we see that

Thus, although the wiggles in the graph of h1 go down to y = −1 and up to y = 1, the wiggles in the graph of h2 stay between the curves y = −|x| and y = |x|. The graph of h2 is shown in Figure 2.11.
What can we say about limx→0 h1(x) and limx→0 h2(x)? We see in Figure 2.11 that h2(x) appears to home in on 0 as x approaches 0, so intuitively it seems that limx→0 h2(x) should be 0. Do Definitions 2.2.3 and 2.2.5 lead us to this conclusion? Figure 2.12 shows an ε challenge for this limit that has been successfully met by a suitable δ response. The graph does not go into the forbidden region, and therefore the ε-δ criterion is true. Furthermore, since the wiggles in the graph of h2 get smaller and smaller as the curve approaches the origin, it appears that we could meet any similar ε challenge by using a sufficiently small δ. We will be able to confirm this more carefully later, but for the moment we will simply say that in the graph it appears to be the case that as x →0=, h2(x)→0, and therefore limx→0 h2(x) = 0.

Figure 2.12: Testing whether or not limx→0 h2(x) = 0. For this choice of ε and δ, the ε-δ criterion is true.

Can we also say that as x →0=, h1(x) →0? Figure 2.13 shows an ε challenge for this statement that has not been successfully met. And it should be clear from the figure that in fact this challenge cannot be met: since the wiggles continue right up to the y-axis, no positive number δ, no matter how small, can make the graph avoid the forbidden region and make the ε-δ criterion true. Thus, according to Definition 2.2.3, it is not the case that as x →0=, h1(x)→ 0. And similar reasoning leads to the conclusion that there is no number L such that as x → 0=, h1(x) → L: no matter what value we choose for L, if ε is small enough then the range L −ε < y < L +ε will be too small to contain the wiggles in the graph of h1, which extend from y = −1 to y = 1 (see Exercise 9). Thus, limx→0 h1(x) is undefined. Looking at Figure 2.10, this should make intuitive sense: unlike h2(x), h1(x) does not seem to home in on any number as x approaches 0.
We will consider one more function that is related to h1 and h2. Let h3 be the function defined by the formula

The graph of h3 is shown in Figure 2.14. This time the wiggles stay between the curves y = −|x|−0.01 and y = |x|+0.01. At first glance, the graph of h3 looks very similar to the graph of h2, so you might be tempted to say that limx→0 h3(x) = 0. But a closer look shows that this is incorrect.
Figure 2.15 shows a closeup of the graph of h3 near x = 0. In this figure we can see that, although the wiggles in the graph get small as x approaches 0, they don't go away altogether. In fact, the tops of the wiggles are at y = |x|+0.01 > 0.01 and the bottoms are at y = −|x|−0.01 < −0.01, so the wiggles always extend more than 0.01 above and below 0. As a result, the challenge ε = 0.05 can be met, as you can see in Figure 2.15a, but the challenge ε = 0.01 cannot, as shown in Figure 2.15b. We conclude that limx→0 h3(x) is not 0, and in fact, as in the case of h1, the limit is undefined. This should agree with your intuition. As x gets close to 0, h3(x) narrows down to a very small range of values, but it doesn't home in on a single number. Since we expect limits to be determined with complete precision, it makes sense that limx→0 h3(x) is undefined.


Figure 2.13: Testing whether or not limx→0 h1(x) = 0. For this choice of ε and δ, the ε-δ criterion is false.

2.3 Limits by the Definition
Now that we have a careful definition of what the word "limit" means, we are ready to begin applying this definition to answer questions about limits. We begin by using the definition to verify the values of some particular limits. In all of the examples in this section the value of the limit in question will be given, and we will simply practice using the definition to prove that this value is correct. In the next section we will begin to learn how to find the values of limits.
According to Definitions 2.2.3 and 2.2.5, to verify a statement of the form limx→a f (x) = L, we must show that for every ε > 0 there is some corresponding δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ then | f (x)− L| < ε. This definition guides the form our solutions will take. When we want to prove that such a limit statement is true, we will usually specify, for any given ε, how to choose the corresponding δ, and then verify that with this choice for δ, if 0 < |x −a| < δ then | f (x)− L| < ε. Thus, we will generally write our proofs in the following form:
Supposeε > 0.
Let 
Suppose 0 < |x −a| < δ.
Then | f (x)− L| = · · · < ε.
There are just two parts of these proofs that will vary from one example to another. First, for different limits we will use different values for δ. For example, for the limit statement limx→2 g(x) = 3 in the last section, the choice δ = ε/2 worked, as we showed in Proposition 2.2.2,but other limit statements will require different choices for δ.Usually we will give a formula expressing δ in terms of ε, and according to the definition of "limit" we must make sure that this formula gives a positive value for δ. Second, there will usually be some algebraic steps involved in working out a formula for | f (x)− L| and verifying that it is less than ε, and this algebra will vary from one example to the next.
Often the hardest part of working out a proof of a limit statement is finding the right formula to use for δ.One strategy we sometimes use for this is simply to leave the formula for δ blank, continue with the proof, and then, when we reach a point in the proof where we can see what value would work for δ, go back and fill in the blank. We illustrate this strategy in our next example.
Example 2.3.1. Show that

Solution. We begin by leaving the formula for δ blank, filling in the particular function f and numbers a and L in this example, and trying to work out the algebra at the end of the proof:
Supposeε > 0.

Suppose 0 < |x −(−1)| < δ.
Then x = −1, so (2− x −3x2)/(x +1) is defined and

Now, we know that |x −(−1)| < δ, so 3|x −(−1)| < 3δ, and we wanted to show that |(2− x −3x2)/(x +1)−5| < ε. If only 3δ were equal to ε, the proof would work out perfectly. This suggests that we go back and fill in the blank for the value of δ with ε/3, which is positive because ε is positive. Here is the resulting proof:
Proof. Suppose ε > 0. Let δ = ε/3 > 0. Suppose 0 < |x −(−1)| < δ. Then x = −1, so (2− x −3x2)/(x +1) is defined and

In most of our examples so far we have studied limits limx→a f (x) in which f (a) was undefined. For example, this was the case when we computed the velocity of the ball in Section 2.1, the example that motivated our study of limits. But there is nothing in the definition of limits that requires that f (a) be undefined, and it will turn out to be useful to study limits in which f (a) is defined. Our next example is such a limit.
Example 2.3.2. Show that

Solution. Once again, we begin by leaving the choice for δ blank and trying to work out the algebra at the end of the proof:
Supposeε > 0.
Let 
Suppose 0 < |x −2| < δ. Then

Note that in the last step we used part 2 of Theorem 1.1.4, and we used the fact that x2 ≥ 0, so x2 +1 ≥ 1 and therefore |x2 +1| = x2 +1. Dividing both sides of the inequality 1 ≤ x2 +1 by the positive number x2 +1 we conclude that 1/(x2 +1) ≤ 1, and multiplying this inequality by the positive number |x −2| we conclude that

Thus |(2x2 + x)/(x2 +1)−2| < δ. Since we wanted to end up with |(2x2 + x)/(x2 +1)−2| < ε, it appears that the choice δ = ε would work. Filling this in, we get the following proof:
Proof. Supposeε > 0. Let δ = ε > 0. Suppose 0 < |x −2| < δ. Then

Finding a suitable choice for δ in our next example is much harder than it was in the previous ones.
Example 2.3.3. Show that

Solution. As usual, we begin by leaving the choice for δ blank:
Supposeε > 0.
Let 
Suppose 0 < |x −1| < δ.
Next we would like to compute |1/x −1| and show that it is less than ε, but our first worry is that x could be 0, giving us a 0 in the denominator. One way to deal with this worry would be to choose δ = 1. Then from |x −1| < δ = 1 we would get 0 < x < 2, so x can't be 0. Now we can go ahead and compute

where we have used the fact that x > 0 to allow us to rewrite |x| as just x. Unfortunately, the factor 1/x will be much harder to deal with than the factor 1/(x2 +1) in the previous example. The reason is that if x is close to 0 then 1/x will be very large, leading to very large values for |1/x −1|. For example,

It appears that if we want to be able to prove that |1/x −1| is small—smaller than ε, which might itself be very small—then we have to make sure not only that x isn't equal to 0, but also that it isn't too close to 0. So let's try a smaller value of δ—say, δ = 1/2. Now from |x −1| < δ = 1/2 we can conclude that 1/2 < x < 3/2. From this we can show that 1/x won't be very large: multiplying the inequality 1/2 < x by 2 and then dividing by x, we conclude that 1/x < 2, and therefore

Since we want |1/x −1| < ε, we now see that if δ = ε/2, then we will be able to finish the proof.
But wait! We seem to be using two different choices for δ. In the first part of the proof we assumed δ = 1/2, and at the end of the proof we decided we wanted to have δ = ε/2. Which one should we choose? The number δ can have only one value.
In situations like this, when we have two choices for δ and we don't know which to use, there is a trick that is often helpful: use whichever candidate for δ is smaller. We introduce the notation min (a, b) to denote the smaller of the two numbers a and b. In other words,

Notice that in general, min(a, b) ≤ a and min(a, b) ≤ b. Also, if a > 0 and b > 0 then min(a, b) > 0. Our choice for δ will be δ = min(1/2, ε/2).
Proof. Supposeε > 0. Let δ = min(1/2, ε/2). Notice that we haveδ > 0, δ ≤ 1/2, and δ ≤ ε/2. Now suppose that 0 < |x −1| < δ. Then |x −1| < δ ≤ 1/2, so 1/2 < x < 3/2, and therefore 1/x is defined and 1/x < 2. Thus,

In later examples we will usually just give the final proof, without discussing how we came up with the choice for δ. We suggest that on a first reading of such a proof you simply try to follow the steps without worrying about how δ was chosen. After you have been through the proof once, you can then go back and try to figure out what motivated the choice of δ.
So far we have used x as the variable in all of our limits, but sometimes it is convenient to use other variables. In our next example, we use the variable t. This time we present the proof first, and then explain how we chose δ afterwards.
Example 2.3.4. Show that

Solution. Suppose ε > 0. Let δ = min(1, ε/7). Then δ > 0, δ ≤ 1, and δ ≤ ε/7. Suppose 0 < |t −3| < δ. Note that
|t2 −9| = |(t +3)(t −3)| = |t +3||t −3|.
Since |t −3| < δ ≤ 1, we have 2 < t < 4. Thus, 5 < t +3 < 7, so −7 < t +3 < 7 and therefore |t +3| < 7. Hence
|t2 −9| = |t +3||t −3| < 7|t −3| < 7δ ≤ 7(ε/7) = ε.
What is the motivation for the formula we used for δ in Example 2.3.4? We start by considering the quantity |t2 −9|, which will have to come out less than ε at the end of the proof. Since |t2 −9| = |t + 3||t −3|, we should try to make sure that both |t +3| and |t −3| are small. We know we will have |t −3| < δ, but what about |t +3|? Since t will be close to 3, |t +3| will be close to 6, but how close? How much larger than 6 could it be? It depends on how close t is to 3, which in turn depends on the value of δ. So we seem to be going in circles: we need to know something about δ in order to know how big |t +3| could be, in order to decide how to choose δ! The solution to this dilemma is to consider a formula for δ of the form (The choice of the number 1 here was completely arbitrary; see Exercise 14 to see how the proof might have come out if we had used the number 2 instead of 1.) Although this doesn't pin down δ completely, it does tell us that we will have δ ≤ 1. This allows us to show that if 0 < |t −3| < δ then |t +3| < 7, and therefore |t2 −9| = |t + 3||t −3| < 7δ. Finally, in order to end up with ε at the end of the proof, we fill in the blank in our formula for δ with ε/7.
We end this section with one more example of a proof of a limit statement. This time you're on your own to figure out the motivation for our choice of δ!
Example 2.3.5. Show that

Solution. Supposeε > 0. Let δ = min(4, 2ε). Then δ > 0, δ ≤ 4, and δ ≤ 2ε. Suppose 0 < |w−4| < δ. Then since δ ≤ 4 we have |w−4| < 4 and therefore 0 < w < 8, so  is defined. Note that since denotes the nonnegative square root of w, we always have  To complete the proof we begin with a tricky algebraic step, multiplying by

2.4 Limit Theorems
The examples in the last section show that using the ε-δ definition to verify limits of even fairly simple functions can be quite difficult. How will we ever be able to deal with limits of complicated functions? Fortunately, there is a better way. We already hinted at this better way in Section 1.4, when we discussed the fact that many complicated functions can be built up from simple functions. Our strategy will be to figure out limits of the simplest functions, and then work out what happens to limits of functions when the functions are combined. As we saw in Section 1.4, the simplest functions are constant functions and the identity function, so we begin with their limits. Fortunately, they are quite easy:
Theorem 2.4.1. Let a be any number.
1.For any number c, limx→a c = c.
2.limx→a x = a.
Proof. The first statement says that if x is close to a, but not equal to a, then c is close to c. The second says that if x is close to a, but not equal to a, then x is close to a. Both statements should be intuitively obvious, but they can also be proven easily by the ε-δ method:
1.Suppose ε > 0. Let δ = 1 > 0. Suppose 0 < |x −a| < δ. Then |c−c| = 0 < ε.
2.Suppose ε > 0. Let δ = ε > 0. Suppose 0 < |x −a| < δ. Then since δ = ε, |x −a| < ε.
For limits of combinations of functions, we have the following theorem:
Theorem 2.4.2. Suppose limx→a f (x) = L and limx→a g(x) = M. Then:
1.limx→a(f (x)+ g(x)) = L + M.
2.For any number c, limx→a cf (x) = cL.
3.limx→a(f (x)− g(x)) = L − M.
4.limx→a(f (x) · g(x)) = LM.
5.If M = 0 then limx→a(f (x)/g(x)) = L/M.
Once again, these statements should make intuitive sense. For example, if f (x) is close to L and g(x) is close to M, it should make sense that f (x)+ g(x) will be close to L + M. But does this intuitive reasoning provide the complete precision that we expect in our limit statements? The only way to be sure that these statements are correct is to give a careful proof based on the definition of limits.
Before giving the proof, we make a few remarks about the strategy for the proof. We are told in the statement of the theorem that limx→a f (x) = L and limx→a g(x) = M, so we know that the following statements are true:
(a)For every ε1 > 0 there is someδ1 > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ1 then | f (x)− L| < ε1.
(b)For every ε2 > 0 there is some δ2 > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ2 then |g(x)− M| < ε2.
(We have added subscripts to the letters ε and δ here so that we won't confuse the ε's and δ's for f with those for g, or with the ε's and δ's we will use to prove the limit statements in parts 1-5 of the theorem.) Notice that we are not trying to prove statements (a) and (b); these are statements that we know are true, and that we can use in the course of the proof. Since statement (a) says that something is true about every ε1 > 0, when using statement (a) we are free to assign any positive value we please to ε1. Similarly, we can choose any positive value for ε2 in statement (b). One of the key ideas in proving all parts of this theorem will be making appropriate choices for ε1 and ε2.
In the proof of part 1, as usual we will start with "Supposeε > 0," and then we will specify a choice for δ and assume that 0 < |x −a| < δ. At the end of the proof we will need to show that |(f (x)+ g(x))−(L + M)| is smaller than ε. To relate this quantity to the ones mentioned in statements (a) and (b), we begin by using the triangle inequality (Theorem 1.1.5):
|(f (x)+ g(x))−(L + M)| = |(f (x)− L)+(g(x)− M)| ≤| f (x)− L| + |g(x)− M|.
Our plan is to get both | f (x)− L| and |g(x)− M| to be smaller than ε/2, since it will follow then that their sum is smaller than ε. Looking back at statements (a) and (b), this suggests letting ε1 = ε2 = ε/2. Statements (a) and (b) will then give us two numbers δ1 and δ2, and these seem like good candidates to use for the δ in the proof of part 1. But which one should we use? The smaller one, of course!
Proof. 1. Supposeε > 0. Applying statement (a) above with ε1 = ε/2, we conclude that there is some number δ1 > 0 such that
(a′) if0 < |x −a| < δ1 then | f (x)− L| < ε/2.
Similarly, statement (b) with ε2 = ε/2 tells us that there is a number δ2 > 0 such that
(b′) if0 < |x −a| < δ2 then |g(x)− M| < ε/2.
Let δ = min(δ1, δ2). Then δ > 0, δ ≤ δ1, and δ ≤ δ2.
Suppose 0 < |x −a| < δ. Then since δ ≤ δ1, 0 < |x −a| < δ1, so by statement (a′), | f (x)− L| < ε/2. Similarly, 0 < |x −a| < δ2, and statement (b′) tells us that |g(x)− M| < ε/2. Therefore

2. If c = 0, then by part 1 of Theorem 2.4.1, limx→a cf (x) = limx→a 0 = 0 = cL. Now suppose c = 0, and suppose ε > 0. By statement (a) with ε1 = ε/|c| > 0, there must be some number δ1 > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ1 then | f (x)− L| < ε/|c|. Let δ = δ1.
Suppose 0 < |x −a| < δ. Then 0 < |x −a| < δ1, so | f (x)− L| < ε/|c| and therefore

3. This follows from parts 1 and 2. Applying part 2 to the function g with c = −1, we get limx→a(−1)g(x) = (−1)M. Therefore by part 1,

4. As in the proof of part 1, we need to bring the quantities f (x)− L and g(x)− M into the proof somehow. We begin with following equation:
(f (x)− L)(g(x)− M) = f (x)g(x)− Lg(x)− Mf (x)+ LM.
Rearranging, we get

Our plan now is to find the limit of f (x)g(x) by finding the limit of the right-hand side of (2.5), using parts 1-3, which we have already proven. By part 2, we have limx→a Lg(x) = LM and limx→a M f (x) = ML, so by part 1,

Thus, by part 3, limx→a(Lg(x)+ Mf (x)− LM) = 2LM − LM = LM. If we can show that limx→a(f (x)− L)(g(x)− M) = 0, then by one more application of part 1 we can conclude from (2.5) that

as required.
Thus, we just need to prove that limx→a((f (x)− L)(g(x)− M)) = 0. For this, we begin as usual by assumingε > 0. Applying statements (a) and (b) with ε1 = ε2 =  we conclude that there are numbers δ1 > 0 and δ2 > 0 such that
(a′′) if0 < |x −a| < δ1 then | f (x)− L| < 
(b′′) if0 < |x −a| < δ2 then |g(x)− M| < 
Let δ = min(δ1, δ2). Then δ > 0, δ ≤ δ1, and δ ≤ δ2.
Suppose 0 < |x −a| < δ. Then 0 < |x −a| < δ1 and 0 < |x −a| < δ2, so by statements (a′′) and (b′′) we have | f (x)− L| <  and |g(x)− M| <  Therefore

5. We leave it as an exercise for you to verify that limx→a(1/g(x)) = 1/M (see Exercise 28). Applying part 4, we conclude that

Using Theorems 2.4.1 and 2.4.2, we can now find many limits very easily. For example, according to part 2 of Theorem 2.4.1, for any number a, limx→a x = a. Since x2 = x · x, we can use part 4 of Theorem 2.4.2 to conclude that

Since x3 = x2 · x, applying part 4 of Theorem 2.4.2 again we get

Repeating this reasoning, we find that for every positive integer k,

Next we apply part 2 of Theorem 2.4.2 to see that for any number c,

Adding functions of this form, and applying part 1 of Theorem 2.4.2, we conclude that for any numbers c0, c1, ..., cn,

Recall that functions like the one in this limit are called polynomials. Thus, we have proven the following fact:
Theorem 2.4.3. If f is a polynomial, then for any number a,

Example 2.4.4. Find the following limits:

Solution. (a) According to Theorem 2.4.3,

(b) Part (a) gives the limit of the numerator. Similarly, the limit of the denominator is limx→3(x2 −5x +1) = 32 −5(3)+1= −5. Since the limit of the denominator isn't 0, by part 5 of Theorem 2.4.2,

To appreciate the power of the theorems we have proven, we suggest that you try to verify the limits in the last example using the ϵ-δ method! This example also illustrates a principle that we will see repeatedly in this book: theorems are not just for advancing the theoretical side of mathematics; they also often provide useful methods for solving problems.
Part 5 of Theorem 2.4.2 gives us a method that we can use to compute limits of the form limx→a(f (x)/g(x)) if limx→a g(x) = 0. But what if limx→a g(x) = 0? Theorem 2.4.2 does not tell us what happens in this case. You might be tempted to say that limx→a(f (x)/g(x)) must be undefined in this case because we would have a 0 in the denominator, but this is not true. In fact, we saw in Example 2.3.1 that limx→−1(2− x −3x2)/(x +1) = 5, even though the limit of the denominator is limx→−1(x +1) = 0. How is this possible? Isn't division by 0 always undefined?
To resolve this apparent paradox, we must think more carefully about what "limit" means. Remember that to compute limx→a(f (x)/g(x)) we must look at f (x)/g(x) for values of x that are close to a but not equal to a. If limx→a g(x) = 0, then for such values of x, g(x) will be close to 0, but it might not be equal to 0. And although division by 0 is not allowed, there is nothing wrong with dividing by a number close to 0. Thus, there is no reason why limx→a(f (x)/g(x)) couldn't be defined.
How, then, do we evaluate limx→a(f (x)/g(x)) if limx→a g(x) = 0? For such limits, our next theorem is often helpful. The idea behind this theorem is that in computing a limit as x approaches a, only values of x close to a, but not equal to a, should matter. So if f1 and f2 are functions such that f1(x) and f2(x) are the same for all values of x that are close to a but not equal to a, then their limits as x approaches a should also be the same. The theorem is illustrated in Figure 2.20.


Figure 2.20: Theorem 2.4.5. The red and blue curves are the graphs of two functions f1 and f2. For all x, if 0 < |x −a| < d then f1(x) = f2(x). Also, limx→a f1(x) = limx→a f2(x) = L.

Theorem 2.4.5. Suppose that d > 0, and f1 and f2 are functions such that for all x, if 0 < |x −a| < d then f1(x) = f2(x). Then limx→a f1(x) = limx→a f2(x), where we interpret this equation to mean that either both limits are defined and they are equal, or both limits are undefined.
Proof. We will show that if as x →a=, f1(x)→ L, then as x → a=, f2(x)→ L. Similar reasoning would show that if as x →a=, f2(x)→ L, then as x →a=, f1(x)→ L, and the theorem follows.
So suppose that as x → a=, f1(x)→ L. To prove that as x →a=, f2(x)→ L, we begin as usual by assuming that ε > 0. Since we have assumed that as x →a=, f1(x)→ L, we know that there is some number δ1 > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ1 then | f1(x)− L| < ε.
Now let δ = min(δ1, d), and suppose that 0 < |x −a| < δ. Then0 < |x −a| < δ1, so | f1(x)− L| < ε, and also 0 < |x −a| < d, so f1(x) = f2(x). Combining these two facts we conclude that | f2(x)− L| < ε, as required.
Theorem 2.4.5 says that if you are trying to compute limx→a f1(x), you can get the answer by computing limx→a f2(x) instead, as long as f1 and f2 agree on values of x close to a but not equal to a. Whatever answer you get for limx→a f2(x)—whether you find a numerical value for the limit or you discover that the limit is undefined—the answer has to be the same for limx→a f1(x).
Example 2.4.6. Find

Solution. Since the limit of the denominator is limx→−1(x2 −1) = 0, we cannot apply part 5 of Theorem 2.4.2. However, for all x = ±1 we have

In other words, if we let

then for all x except ±1, f1(x) = f2(x). Notice that f1 and f2 are not the same function, since f1(−1) is undefined, but f2(−1)= −5/2. Also, neither f1(1) nor f2(1) is defined. However, neither of these facts is relevant when we are computing a limit as x approaches −1. For such limits, only values of x close to −1 but not equal to −1 matter, and for these values of x, both functions are defined and they are equal. More specifically, if 0 < |x −(−1)| < 2 then −3 < x < 1 and x = −1, so x = ±1; therefore f1(x) and f2(x) are defined and equal. We want to find limx→−1 f1(x), and according to Theorem 2.4.5 we can get the answer by evaluating limx→−1 f2(x) instead.
Fortunately, limx→−1 f2(x) is easy to compute: By Theorem 2.4.3 we have limx→−1(x2 +4) = 5 and limx→−1(x −1) = −2. Since the limit of the denominator is not 0, part 5 of Theorem 2.4.2 tells us that

Thus, this is the answer to the original limit problem.
Recall that a quotient of two polynomials is called a rational function. For example, the function whose limit we computed in the last example is a rational function. When computing the limit of a rational function, if the limit of the denominator is 0 then it is often helpful to factor the numerator and denominator and see if a factor can be canceled, as in the last example.
Usually when we use Theorem 2.4.5, we won't spell out the steps in quite so much detail. For example, here is another application of Theorem 2.4.5.
Example 2.4.7. Find

Solution. The hardest part of this limit is the term |x −4|. According to the definition of absolute values, |x −4| is either x −4 or −(x −4), but which should we use in this problem? Since we are computing a limit as x approaches 2, we are only interested in values of x that are close to 2 but not equal to 2. For such values of x, x −4 is negative, and therefore |x −4| = −(x −4). Thus, this is the formula we should use in our calculations:

Notice that in steps one and four of this solution, we changed the function whose limit is being computed, but by Theorem 2.4.5 in each case the change has no effect on the limit. In the first step this is because for all x < 4, |x −4| = −(x −4), and in the fourth step it is because canceling the factor of x −2 leaves the function unchanged for x = 2. Thus, in both cases the function has not been changed for values of x that are close to 2 but not equal to 2. Since the final limit turns out to equal 4, we conclude that the original limit is also 4.
You might have noticed that in Example 2.4.7, not only was the limit of the denominator equal to 0, but the limit of the numerator was as well: limx→2(3x2 −7x + |x −4|) = limx→2(3x2 −7x −(x −4)) = 0. And you can check that the same is true in Examples 2.3.1 and 2.4.6. Is this just a coincidence? No, it is part of a general pattern:
Theorem 2.4.8. If limx→a(f (x)/g(x)) is defined and limx→a g(x) = 0, then limx→a f (x) = 0 as well. Thus, if limx→a g(x) = 0 but limx→a f (x) = 0, then limx→a(f (x)/g(x)) must be undefined.
Proof. Suppose that limx→a(f (x)/g(x)) is defined—say it is equal to L—and limx→a g(x) = 0. Notice that for limx→a(f (x)/g(x)) to make sense, f (x)/g(x) must be defined for x close to a but not equal to a. Thus, in particular, although g(x) must be close to 0 for such values of x, it cannot be equal to 0. To compute limx→a f (x), we begin with the equation

This equation may not be true for all values of x. For example, it would not be true if g(x) = 0 or g(x) is undefined. But as we have just observed, for x close to a but not equal to a, f (x)/g(x) is defined, and therefore the equation is correct. We can therefore compute

Example 2.4.9. Find the following limits:

Solution. For limit (a), we have

In the last limit, the denominator approaches 0 and the numerator approaches 2, so by Theorem 2.4.8, the limit is undefined.
For limit (b), we have limx→1 x = 1 and limx→1(x −1) = 0, so by Theorem 2.4.8, limx→1(x/(x −1)) is undefined, and similar reasoning shows that limx→1(1/(x2 − x)) is also undefined. You might be tempted to conclude that limit (b) is also undefined, but this would be a misuse of Theorem 2.4.2. Part 3 of Theorem 2.4.2 says that if the limits of f (x) and g(x) are L and M, respectively, then the limit of f (x)− g(x) is L − M. It does not say that if the limits of f (x) and g(x) are undefined then the limit of f (x)− g(x) is undefined. In fact, limit (b) is defined, as we can see by getting a common denominator and combining the fractions:

We prove one more theorem in this section to deal with functions like our example h2(x) = |x| sin(π/(2x)) from Section 2.2. Recall that the graph of y = h2(x) was a complicated curve squeezed between the much simpler curves y = |x| and y = −|x|. For functions like this the following theorem is often useful:
Theorem 2.4.10 (Squeeze Theorem). Suppose that d > 0, and for all x, if 0 < |x −a| < d then g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ h(x). Suppose also that limx→a g(x) = limx→a h(x) = L. Then limx→a f (x) = L.
Proof. Supposeε > 0. Since limx→a g(x) = L, there is a number δ1 > 0 such that
(a) if 0 < |x −a| < δ1 then |g(x)− L| < ε.
Similarly, since limx→a h(x) = L, there is a number δ2 > 0 such that
(b) if 0 < |x −a| < δ2 then |h(x)− L| < ε.
Let δ = min(δ1, δ2, d). In other words, δ is the smallest of the three numbers δ1, δ2, and d, and therefore δ > 0, δ ≤ δ1, δ ≤ δ2, and δ ≤ d. Suppose 0 < |x −a| < δ. Then 0 < |x −a| < δ1, so by statement (a), |g(x)− L| < ε, which means that
L −ε < g(x) < L + ε.
Similarly, 0 < |x −a| < δ2, so by statement (b),
L −ε < h(x) < L + ε.
And finally, 0 < |x −a| < d, so
g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ h(x).
Putting all of this information together, we get
L −ε < g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ h(x) < L + ε,
so | f (x)− L| < ε.
The squeeze theorem says that if the value of f (x) is "squeezed" between two quantities g(x) and h(x) that both approach the same limit L, then f (x) is forced to approach L as well. This is illustrated in Figure 2.21. As an example, recall the inequality −|x| ≤ |x| sin(π/(2x)) ≤ |x|, which holds for all x = 0. We will leave it to you to use the ε-δ method to verify that limx→0 |x| = 0 (see Exercise 1), and therefore limx→0 −|x| = −1 · 0 = 0. (A second demonstration that limx→0 |x| = 0 will be given in the next section.) By the squeeze theorem, it follows that limx→0 |x| sin(π/(2x)) = 0, as claimed in Section 2.2.


Figure 2.21: The squeeze theorem. For 0 < |x −a| < d, the graph of f (black) is squeezed between the graphs of g (blue) and h (red).

As another example of the use of the squeeze theorem, we prove the following useful fact. (For an alternative approach to the proof, see Exercise 2.)
Theorem 2.4.11. If limx→a | f (x)| = 0, then limx→a f (x) = 0.
Proof. Since f (x) = ±| f (x)|, we have −| f (x)| ≤ f (x) ≤ | f (x)|. (Another way to see this is to apply Exercise 18 from Section 1.1.) If limx→a | f (x)| = 0, then limx→a −| f (x)| = 0 as well, and we can apply the squeeze theorem to conclude that limx→a f (x) = 0.
We end this section by returning to an issue we left unresolved in Section 2.2. Now that we have had some practice with the ε-δ definition of limits, we are ready to prove Theorem 2.2.4:
Theorem 2.2.4 (restated). There cannot be more than one number L such that as x →a=, f (x)→ L.
Proof. Suppose there are two different numbers L1 and L2 such that as x →a=, f (x) → L1 and as x → a=, f (x)→ L2. Let ε = |L1 − L2|/2 > 0. The idea behind the proof is that no number can be within ε of both L1 and L2, as you can see in Figure 2.22. Therefore it can never be the case that both | f (x)− L1| < ε and | f (x)− L2| < ε are true.
Since as x →a=, f (x)→ L1, there is some δ1 > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ1 then | f (x)− L1| < ε. Similarly, since as x →a=, f (x) → L2, there is some δ2 > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ2 then | f (x)− L2| < ε. But now consider a value of x close enough to a that 0 < |x −a| < δ1 and also 0 < |x −a| < δ2. For example, we could let x = a + min(δ1, δ2)/2. Then | f (x)− L1| < ε and | f (x)− L2| < ε, which as we saw in Figure 2.22 is impossible.


Figure 2.22: If ε = |L1 − L2|/2, then the solution sets of the inequalities |y − L1| < ε (blue) and |y − L2| < ε (red) do not overlap at all.

1. Use the ε-δ definition of limits to show that limx→0 |x| = 0.
2.Use the ε-δ definition of limits to give an alternative proof of Theorem 2.4.11.
3-27: Evaluate the limit.


28.(a)Show that if limx→a h(xm) = 1 then lix→a(1/h(x)) = 1. (Hint: Suppose ε > 0. Show that there is some number δ1 > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ1 then 1/2 < h(x) < 3/2, and there is some δ2 > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ2 then |h(x)−1| < ε/2. Let δ = min(δ1, δ2).)
(b)Show that if limx→a g(x) = M and M = 0 then limx→a(1/g(x)) = 1/M. (Hint: Let h(x) = g(x)/M and apply part (a).)
29.Suppose that f and g are functions that agree on all values except one. In other words, there is some number c such that for all x = c, f (x) = g(x), but f (c) = g(c). Show that for every number a, limx→a f (x) = limx→a g(x), where we interpret this equation to mean that either both limits are defined and they are equal, or both limits are undefined. (Note: We could state this result more informally by saying that the value of the limit limx→a f (x) will not be affected if we change the value of f (c), for any number c. This may seem paradoxical: it suggests that none of the values of the function f are relevant to the value of limx→a f (x)!)
30.Prove the following version of the squeeze theorem: Suppose that b < a < c, and for all x, if b < x < c and x = a then g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ h(x). Suppose also that limx→a g(x) = limx→a h(x) = L. Then limx→a f (x) = L.
31.Prove that if limx→a f (x) is undefined and limx→a g(x) is defined, then limx→a(f (x)+ g(x)) is undefined. (Hint: Let L = limx→a g(x). Suppose that limx→a(f (x)+ g(x)) is defined, and let M = limx→a(f (x)+ g(x)). Now derive a contradiction by showing that limx→a f (x) is defined.)
2.5 Variations on Limits
Consider the function f whose graph is shown in Figure 2.23. Clearly limx→a f (x) is undefined, since there is no single number that f (x) is close to when x is close to a but not equal to a. However, it appears that if x is close to a but less than a then f (x) is close to L1, and if x is close to a but greater than a then f (x) is close to L2. This suggests that we could define one-sided versions of limits.
We write "as x →a<, f (x) → L" to indicate that if x is close to a but less than a, then f (x) is close to L. Similarly, "as x → a>, f (x)→ L" means that if x is close to a but greater than a then f (x) is close to L. For example, in Figure 2.23 we would say that as x →a<, f (x) → L1, and as x →a>, f (x)→ L2. Here are the precise definitions:
Definition 2.5.1. To say that as x → a<, f (x) → L means that for every ε > 0 there is some δ > 0 such that if a −δ < x < a then | f (x)− L| < ε. To say that as x → a>, f (x)→ L means that for every ε > 0 there is some δ > 0 such that if a < x < a + δ then | f (x)− L| < ε.


Figure 2.23: The graph of a function f for which limx→a f (x) is undefined.

The only difference between these new definitions and our original definition of the statement "as x → a=, f (x) → L" is that where the original definition contained the inequality 0 < |x −a| < δ, the new definitions contain the inequalities a −δ < x < a and a < x < a + δ. The inequality 0 < |x −a| < δ says that x is within δ of a, but not equal to a. Similarly, the inequality a −δ < x < a says that x is within δ of a but less than a, and a < x < a + δ says that x is within δ of a but greater than a. Thus, the new definitions are simply one-sided versions of the same limit concept that we captured with our original definition.
You could think of the statement "as x →a<, f (x)→ L" as meaning that when x approaches a from the negative side (i.e., from the left on the x-axis), f (x) approaches L. For this reason, another notation that is often used for this statement is "as x →a−, f (x)→ L." The two notations mean exactly the same thing, and are interchangeable. Similarly, the notation "as x →a+, f (x)→ L" is an alternative way of saying that as x →a>, f (x)→ L, and it means that as x approaches a from the positive side (the right), f (x) approaches L. The notations with the superscript + or − are more common in other books, so from now on we will usually use those notations.
As before, we can show that there cannot be more than one number L such that as x →a−, f (x)→ L, and there cannot be more than one number L such that as x →a+, f (x)→ L. We can therefore make the following definitions:
Definition 2.5.2. If there is a number L such that as x → a−, f (x)→ L, then we define limx→a− f (x) to be the unique such number L. If there is no such number L, then limx→a− f (x) is undefined. Similarly, limx→a+ f (x) is the unique number L such that as x →a+, f (x) → L, if there is such a number L.
All of the theorems about limits from the last section apply to one-sided limits as well. For example, if limx→a− f (x) = L and limx→a− g(x) = M, then limx→a−(f (x)+ g(x)) = L + M, and similar statements hold for limits of differences, products, and quotients, and for limits as x approaches a from the right (see Exercise 1). In some cases, simple adjustments are needed in the theorems. For example, when computing limx→a− f (x), only values of x close to a but less than a should matter, so we have the following one-sided version of Theorem 2.4.5:
Theorem 2.5.3. Suppose that d > 0, and f1 and f2 are functions such that for all x, if a −d < x < a then f1(x) = f2(x). Then limx→a− f1(x) = limx→a− f2(x).
We leave it to you to prove this theorem, and to formulate the similar theorem that holds for limits as x approaches a from the right (see Exercise 2).
Example 2.5.4. Find the following limits:

Solution. For limit (a), we start with the fact that if x > 0, then |x| = x. Thus,

For limit (b), recall that x⏌ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Therefore for 2 < x < 3 we have x⏌ = 2. Thus, by Theorem 2.5.3 the value of limit (b) is

If you look back at Figure 1.16, these answers should make sense.
One reason that one-sided limits are important is that they can sometimes be used to help us compute ordinary two-sided limits. The reason is that we can study what happens to f (x) when x approaches a from both sides by studying what happens when x approaches a from each side separately. Spelling this idea out more carefully proves our next theorem.
Theorem 2.5.5. For any function f and numbers a and L, limx→a f (x) = L if and only if both limx→a− f (x) = L and limx→a+ f (x) = L.
Proof. Recall that according to the meaning of the phrase "if and only if," we must prove that if limx→a f (x) = L then limx→a− f (x) = L and limx→a+ f (x) = L, and we must also prove that if limx→a− f (x) = L and limx→a+ f (x) = L then limx→a f (x) = L. We will give only the second proof, leaving the first as an exercise for you (see Exercise 3).
Suppose that limx→a− f (x) = L and limx→a+ f (x) = L. We use the ε-δ method to prove that limx→a f (x) = L. Suppose that ε > 0. Since limx→a− f (x) = L, there must be some number δ1 > 0 such that
(a)if a −δ1 < x < a then | f (x)− L| < ε.
Similarly, since limx→a+ f (x) = L, there is some δ2 > 0 such that
(b)if a < x < a +δ2 then | f (x)− L| < ε.
Of course, we let δ = min(δ1, δ2). Now suppose 0 < |x −a| < δ. Then a −δ < x < a +δ and x = a, so either x < a or x > a. Suppose first that x < a. Then since δ ≤ δ1, we have a −δ1 ≤ a −δ < x < a. It follows, by statement (a), that | f (x)− L| < ε. Similarly, if x > a then a < x < a +δ ≤ a +δ2, and by (b) we again have | f (x)− L| < ε. Thus | f (x)− L| < ε holds in both cases, which completes the proof.
Example 2.5.6. Find the following limits:

Solution. For limit (a), since the formula for |x| will be different depending on whether x > 0 or x < 0, it is easier to evaluate the two one-sided limits than to evaluate the ordinary (two-sided) limit directly. Indeed, we have already computed that limx→0+ |x| = 0 in part (a) of Example 2.5.4. For the other one-sided limit, we note that for x < 0, |x| = −x, so

Since both one-sided limits are equal to 0, we conclude by Theorem 2.5.5 that limx→0 |x| = 0.
For limit (b), we again compute the two one-sided limits, because if x < −1 then 2x +2 < 0, and therefore |2x +2| = −(2x +2), and if x > −1 then 2x +2 > 0, so |2x +2| = 2x +2. Thus, in each one-sided limit we can eliminate the absolute value signs:

If limit (b) were defined, then by Theorem 2.5.5, the two one-sided limits would have to be equal; since they are not, we can conclude that limit (b) must be undefined. The graph of the equation y = (x2 −1+|2x + 2|)/(x2 + x) near x = −1 is shown in Figure 2.24, where the two different one-sided limits lead to a break in the graph.
There is one more limiting process that we will be interested in. We will sometimes want to know what happens to f (x), not when x gets close to some number a, but rather when x gets larger and larger. We will write "as x →∞, f (x)→ L" to mean that as x gets larger and larger, f (x) approaches L. Figure 2.25 shows the graph of a function f for which this statement is true. The dashed line in the figure is the line y = L. The graph of f gets close to the line y = L at the right side of the figure, and therefore when x is very large, f (x) is close to L. The horizontal line y = L is called an asymptote of the graph of f.


Figure 2.24: The graph of y = (x2 −1+|2x +2|)/(x2 + x) near x = −1.



Figure 2.25: The graph of a function f for which as x →∞, f (x) → L. The dashed line is the graph of y = L.

To state more carefully exactly what it means to say that as x →∞, f (x) → L, we begin with the statement that if x is large then f (x) is close to L, which we can express as follows:
If x > N then | f (x)− L| < ε.
In this statement, ε measures how close f (x) is to L, and N measures how large x is. To ensure that f (x) is very close to L we would let ε be a very small positive number, and to make x very large we would take N to be very large. As usual, we think of ε as representing a challenge, and this time the response is given by the number N. And once again our precise definition says that every challenge can be met:
Definition 2.5.7. To say that as x →∞, f (x) → L means that for every ε > 0 there is some N such that if x > N then | f (x)− L| < ε. We define limx→∞ f (x) to be the unique number L such that as x →∞, f (x)→ L, if there is such a number L.
Similarly, we can consider the limit of f (x) as x gets smaller and smaller—i.e., as x gets to be a large magnitude negative number:
Definition 2.5.8. We say that as x →−∞, f (x) → L if for everyε > 0 there is some N such that if x < N then | f (x)− L| < ε. We define limx→−∞ f (x) to be the unique L such that as x →−∞, f (x)→ L, if there is such a number L.
If limx→−∞ f (x) = L, then the horizontal line y = L will again be an asymptote of the graph of f. In this case the left side of the graph of f will approach the asymptote.
Example 2.5.9. Show that

Solution. These limit statements say that if x is a very large magnitude number, either positive or negative, then 1/x is close to 0. This should make intuitive sense. For example, both 1/1000000 and 1/(−1000000) are close to 0. But, as usual, to be certain that our answers are exactly correct we need to have a proof. We will prove only the first limit statement, since the second is similar. We use our usual methods for proving limit statements from the definition, with adjustments for the new features of Definition 2.5.7. In particular, note that we respond to an ε challenge by producing a value for N.
Suppose ε > 0. Let N = 1/ε. Suppose x > N. Notice that since ε is positive, N = 1/ε is positive as well, so we have x > N > 0. Dividing this inequality by the positive number xN, we get 1/N > 1/x > 0. Therefore

All of our previous limit theorems also apply to limits as x approaches ∞ or −∞, with obvious minor adjustments where necessary. For example, we can combine limits as x approaches ∞ or −∞ by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Thus, we have limx→∞(1/x2) = limx→∞[(1/x) · (1/x)] = 0 · 0 = 0, limx→∞(1/x3) = limx→∞[(1/x2) · (1/x)] = 0 · 0 = 0, and so on. In general, for any positive integer n, limx→∞(1/xn) = limx→−∞(1/xn) = 0.
When computing a limit as x approaches ∞ or−∞ of an expression that contains a polynomial, an algebraic trick that is often helpful is to factor out of the polynomial the highest power of x appearing in the polynomial. In particular, when computing a limit as x →±∞of a rational function we will usually apply this trick to both the numerator and denominator, as in the next example.
Example 2.5.10. Find the following limits:

Solution. For (a), we factor out an x2 from both numerator and denominator, cancel, and then apply Example 2.5.9:

The computation of limit (b) is exactly the same:

The graph of the function f (x) = (x2 −1)/(x2 +1) is shown in Figure 2.26. Since limx→−∞ f (x) = limx→∞ f (x) = 1, f (x) is close to 1 when x is very large or very small. Therefore the graph of f approaches the horizontal asymptote y = 1 at both the left and right sides of the figure.


Figure 2.26: The graph of y = (x2 −1)/(x2 +1). The dashed line is the graph of y = 1.

For limit (c), we factor out x2 from the numerator and x3 from the denominator:

Example 2.5.11. Find

Solution. For all x, we have −1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1. If x is positive then we can divide this inequality through by x to conclude that

(For negative x we would have to reverse the direction of the inequalities, but for the limit we are computing this doesn't matter; since we are taking the limit as x →∞,we are only interested in large values of x, so we can restrict attention to positive x.) We have already seen that limx→∞(1/x) = 0, and therefore limx→∞(−1/x) = (−1) · 0 = 0. Thus, by the squeeze theorem, limx→∞ sin x/x = 0.
So far, all of the variations on the limit idea that we have considered have involved making changes to the "x →a=" part of the definition. But we can also make similar changes to the " f(x) → L" part of the definition. By now you should understand how these changes work, so rather than listing all of the possibilities we simply give a few examples in Table 2.5.
For example, consider the limit

This means that if x is close to 0 but not equal to 0 then 3− x2 is close to 3, which we can express by saying that as x →0=, (3− x2) →3. However, it is clear that if x = 0 then x2 > 0, and therefore 3− x2 < 3. So we could make our limit statement slightly more informative by saying that as x →0=, (3− x2) → 3−. This statement says that if x is close to 0 but not equal to 0, then 3− x2 is close to 3 and less than 3. Alternatively, we could express this idea by saying that as x →0=, (3− x2) →3<.We will occasionally find it useful to add such extra information to our limit statements.


Table 2.5: Some examples of limit statements and their meanings.

Limit statements involving f (x)→∞ or f (x)→−∞ will be particularly useful.
Example 2.5.12. Show that as x →0+, 1/x →∞, and as x →0−, 1/x →−∞.
Solution. The two statements are similar, so we only prove that as x →0+, 1/x →∞. Our proof is guided by the meaning of the statement to be proven, which is: for every number M, there is some δ > 0 such that if 0 < x < δ then 1/x > M.
Let M be any number. Let δ = 1/max(M, 1), where of course max(M, 1) denotes the larger of the two numbers M and 1. Note that max(M, 1) ≥ 1, so δ is positive.
Now suppose 0 < x < δ. Dividing this inequality by xδ, we conclude that 0 < 1/δ < 1/x. Thus,

The result established in Example 2.5.12 is sometimes expressed by writing limx→0+(1/x)=∞ and limx→0−(1/x)= −∞. This notation can be misleading, because it appears to be giving values for these limits. However, you must remember our rule that ∞is not a number, and any mathematical notation involving the symbol∞ is just a shorthand for something else. In general, if limx→a f (x)= ±∞, then there is no number that f (x) approaches as x approaches a, so the limit is considered to be undefined. The notation limx→a f (x)= ±∞does not give a value for the limit, so it does not say that the limit is defined; rather, it expresses the way in which the limit is undefined.


Figure 2.27: The graph of y = 1/x. The lines x = 0 and y = 0 are asymptotes.

The graph of y = 1/x is shown in Figure 2.27. Since limx→0+(1/x)=∞, the graph goes up very high just to the right of the y-axis. Similarly, the fact that limx→0−(1/x) = −∞tells us that just to the left of the y-axis, the graph goes down very low. Thus, at the top and bottom of the figure the graph gets close to the y-axis, which is the line x = 0, so this vertical line is considered to be an asymptote of the graph. In general, for any function f, if f (x) approaches either ∞or −∞as x approaches some number a, then the vertical line x = a will be an asymptote of the graph. Notice that in Figure 2.27, the horizontal line y = 0 (that is, the x-axis) is also an asymptote, since as we showed in Example 2.5.9, limx→∞(1/x) = limx→−∞(1/x) = 0.
Many of our previous results about limits can be adapted to the case of infinite limits. For example, we have the following version of the squeeze theorem (see Exercise 28 for the proof):
Theorem 2.5.13. Suppose that d > 0, and for all x, if 0 < |x −a| < d then f (x) ≥ g(x). Suppose also that limx→a g(x)=∞. Then limx→a f (x)=∞.
We can also extend our previous results about limits of sums and products to include the case of infinite limits:
Theorem 2.5.14.
1.If limx→a f (x)=∞ and either limx→a g(x) = L or limx→a g(x)=∞, then limx→a(f (x)+ g(x))=∞.
2.If limx→a f (x)= −∞ and either limx→a g(x) = L or limx→a g(x)= −∞, then limx→a(f (x)+ g(x))= −∞.
3.If limx→a f (x)=∞ and either limx→a g(x) = L > 0 or limx→a g(x)=∞, then limx→a(f (x) · g(x))=∞.
4.If limx→a f (x)=∞ and either limx→a g(x) = L < 0 or limx→a g(x)= −∞, then limx→a(f (x) · g(x))= −∞.
5.If limx→a f (x)= −∞ and either limx→a g(x) = L > 0 or limx→a g(x)=∞, then limx→a(f (x) · g(x))= −∞.
6.If limx→a f (x)= −∞and either limx→a g(x) = L < 0 or limx→a g(x)= −∞, then limx→a(f (x) · g(x))=∞.
Proof. We will just prove part of statement 1, since the proofs are all quite similar. Suppose that limx→a f (x)=∞ and limx→a g(x) = L. To prove that limx→a(f (x)+ g(x))=∞, suppose that M is any number. Since limx→a f (x)=∞, there is some δ1 > 0 such that
if 0 < |x −a| < δ1 then f (x) > M − L +1.
Since limx→a g(x) = L, there is some δ2 > 0 such that
if 0 < |x −a| < δ2 then |g(x)− L| < 1, and therefore L −1 < g(x) < L +1.
Now let δ = min(δ1, δ2), and suppose that 0 < |x −a| < δ. Then 0 < |x −a| < δ1, so f (x) > M − L +1, and also 0 < |x −a| < δ2, so L −1 < g(x) < L +1. Putting these together, we have
f (x)+ g(x) > (M − L +1)+(L −1) = M.
We have stated Theorem 2.5.14 for ordinary two-sided limits, but it also applies to one-sided limits and to limits as x approaches ±∞. There are thus so many cases to consider that it would be tedious to check all of them. But we hope that by now you have had enough experience with limits that you have begun to develop some intuition about how to think about them. All of the statements in Theorem 2.5.14 should make intuitive sense. For example, part 1 of the theorem says that if f (x) gets very large, and either g(x) gets close to some number L or g(x) also gets very large, then f (x)+ g(x) will get very large. You should be able to give similar informal interpretations of all parts of the theorem, and see that they make intuitive sense. Theorem 2.5.14 doesn't discuss limits of differences or quotients, but they can be handled by rewriting f (x)− g(x) as f (x)+(−g(x)) and f (x)/g(x) as f (x) · (1/g(x)). Limits of quotients will be discussed further in the next section.
For example, let's use Theorem 2.5.14 to compute limx→−∞(5x3 −7). You should be able to verify that limx→−∞ x = −∞ (see Exercise 29). By part 6 of Theorem 2.5.14, limx→−∞ x2 = limx→−∞(x · x)=∞, and by part 4, limx→−∞ x3 = limx→−∞(x2 · x) = −∞. By part 5, limx→−∞ 5x3 = −∞, and by part 2, limx→−∞(5x3 −7) = limx→−∞(5x3 +(−7)) = −∞.
Perhaps just as important as understanding what the theorem says is understanding what it doesn't say. For example, the theorem doesn't say anything about the limit of f (x)+ g(x) in the case when the limit of f (x) is ∞ and the limit of g(x) is −∞. The reason is that if f (x) is very large, and g(x) is a very large magnitude negative number, then f (x)+ g(x) could be anything—positive or negative, large or small—depending on the relative sizes of f (x) and g(x). Since f (x) is getting very large, you might think of f (x) as "pulling" f (x)+ g(x) in the positive direction. At the same time, since g(x) is a large magnitude negative number, g(x) is "pulling" f (x)+ g(x) in the negative direction. The two terms f (x) and g(x) are pulling in opposite directions, and the outcome will depend on which one pulls harder. For example, suppose that f (x) = x +17 and g(x)= −x. Then limx→∞ f (x) = limx→∞(x +17) =∞ and limx→∞ g(x) = limx→∞(−x)= −∞, but limx→∞(f (x)+ g(x)) = limx→∞(x +17− x) = 17. Clearly we could replace 17 here with any other number, leading to similar examples in which the limit of f (x)+ g(x) is anything we please. Another case that is not covered by the theorem is the limit of f (x) · g(x) when the limit of f (x) is ∞ and the limit of g(x) is 0. You should think about how, in this case, we could also think of f (x) and g(x) as pulling in opposite directions. In Exercise 30 you are asked to give examples showing that the limit of f (x) · g(x) could be anything in this case as well.
Example 2.5.15. Find the following limits:

Solution. To evaluate limit (a), we first rewrite the quotient as a product:

Since limx→0−(2x −3)= −3 and limx→0−(1/x)= −∞(by Example 2.5.12), we can apply part 6 of Theorem 2.5.14 to conclude that

For part (b), we begin as in Example 2.5.10 by factoring out the highest powers of x in the numerator and denominator:

Since

we can conclude by part 3 of Theorem 2.5.14 that

We could think of the limit in part (c) as limx→∞(f (x)+ g(x)), where f (x) = x2 and g(x)= −x −7, but this doesn't help: we have limx→∞ f (x) = limx→∞ x2 =∞and limx→∞ g(x) = limx→∞(−x −7) = −∞, and this case is not covered by Theorem 2.5.14. However, once again factoring out the highest power of x leads to a solution:

Since limx→∞ x2 =∞ and limx→∞(1−1/x −7/x2) = 1−0−0 = 1, part 3 of Theorem 2.5.14 tells us that limx→∞(x2 − x −7)=∞.

2.6 Limits of Compositions
In previous sections we have studied limits of sums, differences, products, and quotients of functions. But what about compositions of functions? How should we figure out limx→a(f ◦ g)(x)?
For example, suppose that f (x) = x2 +1 and g(x) = 5x −2, and we wish to compute limx→1(f ◦ g)(x) = limx→1 f (g(x)). It will be convenient to introduce names for the important quantities in this problem, so we let u = g(x) and y = f (g(x)) = f (u). Thus, the value of x determines the value of u via the equation u = g (x), and the value of u determines the value of y via the equation y = f (u). We want to know what happens to y = f (g(x)) as x approaches 1, and we will investigate this by studying what happens to u as x approaches 1, and then what this behavior of u tells us about y.
We have limx→1 g(x) = limx→1(5x −2) = 3, so we can say that as x →1=, g(x)→ 3. Since we have introduced the letter u to stand for g(x), another way to say this is that

Similarly, we can compute that limu→3 f (u) = limu→3(u2 +1) = 10, and since we have let y = f (u), this means that

Statement (2.6) says that if x is close to 1 but not equal to 1, then u is close to 3, and statement (2.7) says that if u is close to 3 but not equal to 3 then y is close to 10. Unfortunately, there is a slight mismatch between the right side of (2.6) and the left side of (2.7); statement (2.6) doesn't tell us that u = 3, and it seems that we need to know this to be able to apply (2.7). But let us look more closely at (2.6).We have u = g(x) = 5x −2, and it follows from this equation that if x = 1 then u = 3 (indeed, if x > 1 then u > 3, and if x < 1 then u < 3). Thus, we can give a slightly more informative version of statement (2.6):

We can now combine statements (2.6′) and (2.7) to conclude that

In other words, limx→1 f (g(x)) = 10.
Since this is our first time combining statements like (2.6′) and (2.7), perhaps we should check more carefully that our reasoning here can really be justified. We begin by writing out what these statements mean. Statement (2.6′) tells us that
(a)for every ε1 > 0 there is some δ1 > 0 such that if 0 < |x −1| < δ1 then 0 < |u −3| < ε1,
while by (2.7),
(b)for every ε2 > 0 there is some δ2 > 0 such that if 0 < |u −3| < δ2 then |y −10| < ε2.
Recall that when using statements (a) and (b), we can assign whatever values we please to ε1 and ε2. Now let's see if we can use these two statements to prove that as x →1=, y → 10.
Suppose ε > 0. Since we want our proof to end with |y −10| < ε, we first apply statement (b), plugging in ε for ε2, to conclude that there is some number δ2 > 0 such that
(b′) if0 < |u −3| < δ2 then |y −10| < ε.
Next, we apply statement (a) with ε1 = δ2 to conclude that there is some δ1 > 0 such that
(a′) if0 < |x −1| < δ1 then 0 < |u −3| < δ2.
Now let δ = δ1, and suppose that 0 < |x −1| < δ. Then 0 < |x −1| < δ1, so by statement (a′), 0 < |u −3| < δ2, and therefore by (b′), |y −10| < ε. This shows that as x → 1=, y →10.
In the future, we'll just combine statements like (2.6′) and (2.7) without providing any justification, but in every case our conclusion could be justified by similar ε-δ reasoning.
For the problem we just solved, there is actually another way we could have gotten the answer. We could simply have computed that f (g(x)) = f (5x −2) = (5x −2)2 + 1 = 25x2 −20x +5, and therefore

Of course, it is reassuring to see that both methods lead to the same answer! However, in other examples there is sometimes no easy alternative to the composition method we have developed.
Example 2.6.1. Find

Solution. We can write the requested limit as limx→0 f (g(x)), where f (x) = x⏌ and g(x) = 3− x2. Imitating our last example, we let u = g(x) = 3− x2 and y = f (u) = u⏌ = 3− x2⏌.We begin with the fact that limx→0 g(x) = limx→0(3− x2) = 3, which tells us that as x →0=, u →3. But as we observed in the last section, for x = 0 we have u = 3− x2 < 3, so we can actually say that

This tells us that for our next step we should compute limu→3− f (u) = limu→3−u⏌. Fortunately, we solved this limit in Example 2.5.4, where we found that the answer is 2. Thus,

Since the right side of (2.8) matches the left side of (2.9), we can combine the two limit statements to conclude that as x →0=, y → 2, and therefore limx→03− x2⏌ = 2.
When combining two limit statements like (2.8) and (2.9), is it really necessary to make sure the right side of the first matches the left side of the second exactly? The answer is yes; you can get wrong answers if you're not careful about this. For example, suppose f is the function defined by the equation

(The function f is called the sign or signum function, and is sometimes denoted sgn.) Clearly f (0) = 0, limx→0+ f (x) = 1, limx→0− f (x) = −1, and limx→0 f (x) is undefined. We will consider limx→0 f (g(x)) for several different choices of the function g(x).
Let g1(x) = x2, g2(x) = −x2, g3(x)= −x, and g4(x) = 0. Clearly all four of these functions approach 0 as x approaches 0, and this may make you think that when we compose these functions with f, the limit as x approaches 0 will be the same in every case. But in fact these four functions approach 0 in different ways, and this will lead to different limits when they are composed with f.
First we consider limx→0 f (g1(x)). If we let u = g1(x) = x2, then for every x = 0 we have u = x2 > 0. It follows that as x → 0=, u →0+. Since limu→0+ f (u) = 1, we can say that as u →0+, f (u) →1. Combining our two limit statements, we conclude that as x →0=, f (u) = f (g1(x)) →1. In other words, limx→0 f (g1(x)) = 1.
Similarly, if u = g2(x) = −x2, then for every x = 0 we have u < 0, and therefore as x →0=, u →0−. Since limu→0− f (x)= −1, we find that limx→0 f (g2(x)) = −1.
The function g3 is more complicated, because g3(x) approaches 0 from both sides. If u = g3(x)= −x, then u is negative when x is positive, and u is positive when x is negative. This suggests that we should consider the one-sided limits as x approaches 0 from the left and the right. We see that as x → 0+, u →0−, and as x →0−, u →0+, and as before this leads to the conclusions limx→0+ f (g3(x)) = −1 and limx→0− f (g3(x)) = 1. Thus, limx→0 f (g3(x)) is undefined.
Finally, in the case of g4, for every x we have g4(x) = 0, and therefore f (g4(x)) = f (0) = 0. Thus, limx→0 f (g4(x)) = 0. To summarize, even though all four of g1(x), g2(x), g3(x), and g4(x) approach 0 as x approaches 0, we have limx→0 f (g1(x)) = 1, limx→0 f (g2(x)) = −1, limx→0 f (g3(x)) is undefined, and limx→0 f (g4(x)) = 0. To get these answers, we had to pay careful attention to how u approached 0 in each case.
We can discover some useful limit facts by studying limits of compositions f ◦ g in which f (x) = 1/x. In this case, f (g(x)) = 1/g(x). Suppose, for example, that g is a function such as x → a=, g(x)→0+. Letting u = g(x), we can say that as x →a=, u → 0+. We saw in the last section that as u → 0+, 1/u→∞. Combining these limit statements, we conclude that as x →a=, 1/g(x) = 1/u→∞. This establishes the first statement in our next theorem. The proofs of the other three are similar.
Theorem 2.6.2.
1.If as x →a=, g(x)→ 0+, then as x → a=, 1/g(x)→∞.
2.If as x →a=, g(x)→ 0−, then as x → a=, 1/g(x)→−∞.
3.If as x →a=, g(x)→∞, then as x → a=, 1/g(x)→ 0+.
4.If as x →a=, g(x)→−∞, then as x → a=, 1/g(x)→0−.
As usual, the theorem also applies to one-sided limits and limits as x approaches ±∞.We can use this theorem to extend our understanding of limits of quotients, as our next example shows.
Example 2.6.3. Find the following limits:

Solution. In limit (a), the numerator approaches −7 and the denominator approaches 0, so the limit is undefined. But we can give a more informative answer by using Theorem 2.6.2. We begin by asking whether the denominator approaches 0 from the right or the left. It is not easy to tell with the denominator written in the form x3 − x2, but if we rewrite it as x2(x −1), then we see that when x is close to 0 but not equal to 0, x2 is positive and x −1 is negative, and therefore x3 − x2 = x2(x −1) is negative. Thus, as x →0=, x3 − x2 → 0−, and therefore by part 2 of Theorem 2.6.2, as x → 0=, 1/(x3 − x2)→−∞. Combining this with the fact that as x →0=, x −7→−7, we can use Theorem 2.5.14 to conclude that

Notice that this answer does not contradict our earlier conclusion that the limit is undefined. We have simply said more specifically why it is undefined. Intuitively, what is happening in this limit is that when x is close to 0 but not equal to 0, x −7 is close to −7 and x3 − x2 is a negative number close to 0, and therefore their quotient is a large positive number.
In limit (b), the numerator also approaches −7. It is not easy to see what the limit of the denominator is unless we factor out the highest power of x: x3 − x2 = x3(1−1/x). Now we can see that as x →∞, x3→∞and 1−1/x →1, and therefore x3 − x2 = x3(1−1/x)→∞. By part 3 of Theorem 2.6.2, as x →∞, 1/(x3 − x2) →0+, so

See Exercise 1 for another way of computing this limit.
Example 2.6.4. Let f be the function whose graph is shown in Figure 2.28, and let

Find the following limits:



Figure 2.28: The graph of y = f (x).

Solution. For limit (a), it is useful to let u = g(x) = 1/(3− x). We have limx→2+(1/(3− x)) = 1, so as x →2+, u →1. But looking at Figure 2.28 we see that limu→1+ f (u) and limu→1− f (u) are different, so we need to know whether u approaches 1 from the positive side or the negative side before we can tell what happens to f (g(x)) = f (u). Since x is approaching 2 from the positive side, we are interested in values of x that are close to 2 but larger than 2. For 2 < x < 3 we have 0 < 3− x < 1, and therefore u = 1/(3− x) > 1. Thus, as x →2+, u → 1+. The vertical asymptote in Figure 2.28 indicates that as u →1+, f (u)→∞, so as x → 2+, f (g(x)) = f (u)→∞. In other words, limx→2+ f (g(x))=∞.
Limit (b) is similar, except this time we are interested in values of x that are smaller than 2. If x < 2 then 3− x > 1, and therefore u = 1/(3− x) < 1. Thus, as x →2−, u → 1−, and we see in the figure that as u → 1−, f (u) →2. Therefore limx→2− f (g(x)) = 2.
To evaluate limit (c) we let u = f (x), and we read off from Figure 2.28 that as x →0+, u = f (x) →3−. Thus, we must compute limu→3− g(u). As u →3−, 3 −u → 0+, and therefore g(u) = 1/(3−u)→∞. Putting everything together, we conclude that limx→0+ g(f (x))=∞.
We also let u = f (x) for limit (d), and observe that if x is close to 4 but not equal to 4, then f (x) is close to 3 but larger than 3. Thus, as x →4=, u = f (x) →3+. As u →3+, 3 −u → 0−, and therefore g(u) = 1/(3−u)→−∞. We conclude that limx→4 g(f (x)) = −∞.

23.Show that for any number c ≥ 0, there are functions f and g such that limx→0 f (x)=∞, limx→0 g(x)=∞, and limx→0(f (x)/g(x)) = c.
2.7 Continuity
In Section 2.4, we saw that if f is a polynomial, then for every number a, limx→a f (x) = f (a). There is a name for this important property.
Definition 2.7.1. Suppose that f is a function and a is a number. We say that f is continuous at a if f (a) is defined, limx→a f (x) is defined, and limx→a f (x) = f (a).
According to this definition, f will fail to be continuous at a if either f (a) is undefined, or limx→a f (x) is undefined, or both are defined but they are not equal. These three possibilities are illustrated in Figure 2.30. We could describe the function in Figure 2.30a as having a missing point at x = a. The function in Figure 2.30b has a jump at x = a, and the function in Figure 2.30c has a misplaced point at x = a.


Figure 2.30: Three kinds of discontinuous functions. In (a), f (a) is undefined. In (b), limx→a f (x) is undefined. In (c), f (a) and limx→a f (x) are both defined, but they are not equal.

You might think of limx→a f (x) as what f (a) should be, if it is to be in line with the values of f (x) for x close to a. With this interpretation, we could say that f is continuous at a if the value f (a) is what it should be. In Figure 2.30a, f (a) is not what it should be because it is undefined. In Figure 2.30b, there is no single number that f (a) should be in order to be in line with nearby points. And in Figure 2.30c, f (a) is defined but not equal to what it should be.
Definition 2.7.2. We say that a function f is continuous on an open interval I if for every a ∈ I, f is continuous at a.
Thus, to say that f is continuous on an open interval I means that if you look at the points on the graph of f whose x-coordinates are in I, each of these points is in line with the points on either side of it. Intuitively, this means that you could draw this part of the graph of f without picking up your pencil. We restrict attention to open intervals for the moment because continuity at endpoints of an interval will require special treatment. We discuss continuity on closed and half-open intervals later in this section.
Since polynomials are continuous at all numbers, we can say that any polynomial is continuous on the interval (−∞,∞). Thus, the graph of a polynomial is always a curve with no jumps and no missing or misplaced points; you could draw it without lifting up your pencil. For example, in Chapter 1 we graphed the function f (x) = x3 −4x2 + 2x +2 by plotting some points and then drawing a curve through those points (see Figure 1.18). We pointed out in Chapter 1 that by drawing this curve we were guessing at the values of f between the plotted points. While we still have not justified all aspects of the shape of the graph we drew, we have at least seen why the graph of f must be a curve with no breaks in it passing through the plotted points.
Theorem 2.4.2 allows us to see that many other functions are continuous:
Theorem 2.7.3. Suppose f and g are continuous at a. Then so are f + g, f − g, and f · g. If g(a) = 0, then f/g is also continuous at a.
Proof. Since f and g are continuous at a, limx→a f (x) = f (a) and limx→a g(x) = g(a). Therefore by part 1 of Theorem 2.4.2,

so f + g is continuous at a. The proofs of the other parts of the theorem are similar.
According to Theorem 2.7.3, a rational function is continuous at all points except where the denominator is 0. For example, consider the function f (x) = (x2 −2x +7)/(x3 −3x2). The denominator of f (x) is 0 only when x = 0 or x = 3, so the domain of f is (−∞, 0) ∪(0, 3) ∪(3,∞), and f is continuous on the intervals (−∞, 0), (0, 3), and (3,∞). The graph of f is shown in Figure 2.31, and it consists of three pieces, each of which you can draw without picking up your pencil. We leave it as an exercise for you to check that limx→0 f (x) = −∞, limx→3− f (x) = −∞, limx→3+ f (x)=∞, limx→∞ f (x) = 0, and limx→−∞ f (x) = 0 (see Exercise 26). As a result, the lines x = 0, x = 3, and y = 0 are all asymptotes of the graph of f, as you can see in Figure 2.31.


Figure 2.31: The graph of the rational function f (x) = (x2 −2x + 7)/(x3 −3x2). The dashed line is the asymptote x = 3.



Figure 2.32: The graph of a function f that is continuous from the right at a and continuous from the left at b.

Since we have one-sided versions of limits, we can also define one-sided versions of continuity:
Definition 2.7.4. We say that f is continuous from the right at a if f (a) is defined, limx→a+ f (x) is defined, and limx→a+ f (x) = f (a).We say that f is continuous from the left at a if f (a) is defined, limx→a− f (x) is defined, and limx→a− f (x) = f (a).
It is not hard to see, using Theorem 2.5.5, that f is continuous at a if and only if it is continuous from both the left and the right at a. Of course, Theorem 2.7.3 applies to one-sided continuity as well.
For example, consider the function whose graph is shown in Figure 2.32.This function is discontinuous at a and b. However, limx→a+ f (x) = f (a) and limx→b− f (x) = f (b), so f is continuous from the right at a and continuous from the left at b. Intuitively, this means that the point (a, f (a)) does not seem out of place if we approach it from the right; it is only if we approach from the left that we see a sudden jump in the graph when x = a. Similarly, the point (b, f (b)) is in line with the points to its left, but not those to its right.
In Figure 2.32, consider the points on the graph of f whose x-coordinates are in the closed interval [a, b]. These points lie on a part of the graph that has no breaks or jumps in it; you could draw this part of the graph without lifting your pencil. It seems natural, therefore, to say that f is continuous on the interval [a, b]. This suggests the following definition of continuity on a closed interval.
Definition 2.7.5. We say that a function f is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] if it is continuous on (a, b), continuous from the right at a, and continuous from the left at b.
Similarly, we would say that a function f is continuous on a half-open interval [a, b) if it is continuous on (a, b) and continuous from the right at a, and it is continuous on the interval (a, b] if it is continuous on (a, b) and continuous from the left at b. The general rule is that for f to be continuous on an interval I, we require that it be continuous on the interior of I, and that it have the appropriate one-sided continuity at any endpoints that are included in I. For example, the function whose graph is shown in Figure 2.33 is continuous on the intervals (−∞, a), [a, b), and [b,∞). Looking back at Figure 1.16b, it should be clear that for every integer n, the function h(x) = x⏌ is continuous on the interval [n, n +1). Notice that if f is continuous on an interval I, and J is another interval such that J ⊆ I, then f is also continuous on J.


Figure 2.33: The graph of a function f that is continuous on the intervals (−∞, a), [a, b), and [b,∞).

One of the reasons why continuous functions are so important in calculus is the following theorem.
Theorem 2.7.6 (Intermediate Value Theorem). Suppose that f is continuous on the interval [a, b], and either f (a) < r < f (b) or f (a) > r > f (b). Then there is some number c such that a < c < b and f (c) = r.


Figure 2.34: The intermediate value theorem. In (b), f is not continuous on [a, b], and there is no c such that f (c) = r.

The intermediate value theorem is illustrated in Figure 2.34a. It may seem that the theorem is so obvious that it hardly requires proof. How could the value of the function possibly get from f (a) to f (b) without hitting the intermediate value r somewhere along the way? However, Figure 2.34b illustrates that it is possible for there to be no c such that f (c) = r, even though f (a) < r < f (b). Of course, the function f in Figure 2.34b is not continuous, so it does not contradict the theorem. But it does illustrate that we have to include the assumption that f is continuous in the statement of the theorem; if that assumption were dropped, then the theorem would be incorrect. Thus, the proof will have to make use of the continuity of f, which makes the proof more subtle than one might expect. We will discuss the proof of the intermediate value theorem in the next section.
Example 2.7.7. Show that there is at least one solution to the equation

Solution. We could try to solve the equation, but there is an easier way. Let f (x) = x3 −6x2 + 5x +2. Table 2.6 shows some values of f (x). Notice that f (−1)= −10 < 0 < 2 = f (0). Since f is a polynomial, it is continuous everywhere. Therefore it is continuous on the interval [−1, 0], and we can apply the intermediate value theorem to conclude that there must be some number c such that −1 < c < 0 and f (c) = 0. Such a number c is a solution to equation (2.10). Similarly, since f (1) = 2 > 0 > −4 = f (2) and f (4)= −10 < 0 < 2 = f (5), there must be two more solutions to the equation, one between 1 and 2 and another between 4 and 5.


Table 2.6: Some values of the function f (x) = x3 −6x2 + 5x +2.

As another example of the intermediate value theorem, consider the function g(x) = x2. Since g(1) = 1, g(2) = 4, and g is continuous on the interval [1, 2], there must be some number c such that 1 < c < 2 and g(c) = c2 = 2. In this case you may be thinking that you don't need the intermediate value theorem to show that there is such a number c; you can just let  . After all,  is, by definition, the unique positive number whose square is 2. But how do we know that there is a positive number whose square is 2? When you first learned about square roots, this question was probably not discussed; it was probably simply assumed that, since 12 = 1 < 2 and 22 = 4 > 2, there is obviously a number between 1 and 2 whose square is exactly 2. We have now seen that this assumption is, indeed, correct, but it is not quite as obvious as you might have thought. What justifies it is the continuity of the function g and the intermediate value theorem.
Similar reasoning can be used to show that for every r ≥ 0, there is some c ≥ 0 such that c2 = r. Furthermore, one can show that if 0 ≤ a < b then a2 < b2, and therefore the value of c for which c2 = r is unique (see Exercise 27). This is what justifies us in defining  to be the unique c ≥ 0 such that c2 = r, for every r in the interval [0,∞).
In fact, the function  is continuous on the interval [0,∞). Too see why, suppose a ≥ 0. We first show that f is continuous from the right at a; in other words, we must show that  We use the √ε-δ method.
Suppose ε > 0. Let  so that  and notice that since 

Thus, we can let δ = b−a > 0 (see Figure 2.35). Now suppose that a < x < a + δ; to complete the proof, we must show that  Since a + δ = b, we have a < x < b. It follows (see part (c) of Exercise 27) that

and therefore  as required.


Figure 2.35: The proof that 

Similar reasoning can be used to show that if a > 0 then f is continuous from the left at a (see Exercise 28). Thus, f is continuous on (0,∞) and continuous from the right at 0, so it is continuous on [0,∞).
Generalizing this reasoning leads to our next theorem. Recall that if n is even then  is undefined when x is negative, but if n is odd then  is defined for all x.
Theorem 2.7.8. Let n be any positive integer and let 
1.If n is even, then f is continuous on [0,∞).
2.If n is odd, then f is continuous on (−∞,∞).
Many other familiar functions are continuous on their entire domains. For example, it is easy to show that the function f (x) = |x| is continuous on (−∞,∞). The trigonometric functions are also continuous everywhere they are defined. To show this we will need the following lemma. (A lemma is a fact that is proven just for the purpose of using it to prove something else.)
Lemma 2.7.9. For any numbers α and β,
|cos β −cos α| ≤ |β −α|, |sin β −sin α| ≤ |β −α|.
Proof. Let Qα be the point on the unit circle with coordinates (cosα, sin α), and similarly let Qβ be the point (cos β, sin β). Recall that according to the definitions of the cosine and sine functions, we can reach Qα by beginning at the point (1, 0) and traveling α units along the unit circle, with a positive value for α indicating counterclockwise motion and a negative value indicating clockwise motion, and a similar statement holds for Qβ. Thus, if β ≥ α, then starting at Qα and traveling β −α units counterclockwise along the unit circle we would reach Qβ, while if α > β, then from Qβ we would travel α −β units counterclockwise to reach Qα. In either case, we can travel | β −α| units along the unit circle to move between Qα and Qβ, as indicated in Figure 2.36.


Figure 2.36: The proof of Lemma 2.7.9.

Now let d be the straight-line distance from Qα to Qβ. Since a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, d ≤ |β −α|. Thus, by the distance formula,

But we also have

Combining inequalities (2.11)-(2.13) proves the lemma.
Theorem 2.7.10. All of the trigonometric functions are continuous everywhere they are defined.
Proof. We first verify that the cosine function is continuous on (−∞,∞). To do this, we use the ε-δ definition to show that for any number a, limx→a cos x = cos a.
Supposeε > 0. Let δ = ε. Suppose 0 < |x −a| < δ. Then by the lemma,
|cos x −cos a| ≤ |x −a| < δ = ε.
Similarly, the sine function is continuous on (−∞,∞). By definition, tan x = sin x/cos x, so it is undefined when cos x = 0, which happens when x = π/2, 3π/2, 5π/2,..., −π/2, −3π/2,.... But by Theorem 2.7.3 it is continuous on the intervals that make up its domain: (−π/2, π/2), (π/2, 3π/2), ..., (−3π/2,−π/2), .... Similarly, the other trigonometric functions are continuous everywhere they are defined.
Theorem 2.7.3 tells us that when we add, subtract, multiply, and divide continuous functions, the result is continuous. We can therefore  now recognize many more functions as continuous. For example, the function  is continuous on (−∞,∞), while  is continuous on [0, π/2), (π/2, 3π/2), ....
What about compositions of continuous functions? Are they continuous as well? To answer this question, we begin by taking a closer look at the definition of continuity.
If a function f is continuous at a number a, then according to the definition of continuity, limx→a f (x) = f (a), which means that as x →a=, f (x)→ f (a). In other words, if x is close to a, but not equal to a, then f (x) is close to f (a). But notice that the restriction in this statement that x must not be equal to a is unnecessary; if x is equal to a then it is still true that f (x) is close to f (a), because in fact f (x) is equal to f (a)! Thus, we can simply say that if x is close to a, then f (x) is close to f (a). In other words, we have established the following theorem:
Theorem 2.7.11. Suppose that f is continuous at a. Then as x →a, f (x) → f (a). In other words, for everyε > 0 there is some δ > 0 such that if |x −a| < δ then | f (x)− f (a)| < ε.
Notice that in this theorem we have eliminated the superscript "=" in our limit notation, which indicates that we have dropped the restriction that x cannot equal a.
A similar idea applies to one-sided continuity. If f is continuous from the left at a, then we can say that as x →a<, f (x) → f (a). But once again there is no need to exclude the possibility that x = a. We therefore introduce the notation "as x →a≤, f (x)→ L" to mean that if x is close to a and x ≤ a, then f (x) is close to L; more precisely, we define this notation to mean that for everyε > 0 there is some δ > 0 such that if a −δ < x ≤ a then | f (x)− L| < ε. You should be able to formulate a similar precise definition for the notation "as x →a≥, f (x) → L," to express the idea that if x is close to a and x ≥ a then f (x) is close to L. We can now use this new notation to state a one-sided version of Theorem 2.7.11:
Theorem 2.7.12.
1.If f is continuous from the left at a, then as x →a≤, f (x) → f (a).
2.If f is continuous from the right at a, then as x → a≥, f (x)→ f (a).
Theorems 2.7.11 and 2.7.12 makes it easy to work with limits of compositions f ◦ g when f is continuous:
Theorem 2.7.13.
1.Suppose that limx→a g(x) = L and f is continuous at L. Then limx→a f (g(x)) = f (L).
2.Suppose that g is continuous at a and f is continuous at g(a). Then f ◦ g is continuous at a.
3.Suppose that g is continuous on an interval J, f is continuous on an interval I, and for every x ∈ J, g(x) ∈ I. Then f ◦ g is continuous on J.
Proof. 1. As usual, we begin by letting u = g(x). Since limx→g(x) = L, we can a say that as x →a=, u → L. And according to Theorem 2.7.11, as u → L, f (u) → f (L). Combining these two statements we conclude that as x →a=, f (u) → L, so limx→a f (g(x)) = L.
2. Since g is continuous at a, limx→a g(x) = g(a), and by part 1 it follows that limx→a f (g(x)) = f (g(a)). Thus, f ◦ g is continuous at a.
3. Suppose a ∈ J. Then by the assumptions in this part of the theorem, g(a) ∈ I. If a is in the interior of J and g(a) is in the interior of I, then g is continuous at a and f is continuous at g(a), and therefore f ◦ g is continuous at a by part 2. If either a is an endpoint of J or g(a) is an endpoint of I, then similar reasoning can be used, with small adjustments to deal with one-sided limits. For example, suppose that a is in the interior of J but g(a) is the left endpoint of I, and let u = g(x). Then as x → a, u = g(x)→ g(a)≥, and as u → g(a)≥, f (u) → f (g(a)). Therefore as x → a, f (g(x)) = f (u) → f (g(a)). For an alternative approach to this proof, see Exercise 31.
Example 2.7.14. On what intervals are the following functions continuous?

Solution. We have h1 = f ◦ g, where f (x) = sin x and g(x) = 3x5 −2x3 +7. Since f and g are continuous at all numbers, by part 2 of Theorem 2.7.13, h1 is continuous on (−∞,∞).
Since h2(x) is undefined if x2 −1 < 0, the domain of h2 is (−∞,−1] ∪[1,∞). We have h2 = f ◦ g, where  and g(x) = x2 −1. The function g is continuous on the interval [1,∞), f is continuous on [0,∞), and for every x ∈ [1,∞), g(x) = x2 −1 ∈ [0,∞). Therefore, by part 3 of Theorem 2.7.13, h2 = f ◦ g is continuous on [1,∞). Similar reasoning shows that it is also continuous on (−∞,−1].
Example 2.7.15. Find the following limits:

Solution. For limit (a), we begin by finding the limit of the rational function inside the cube root. Since numerator and denominator both approach 0 as x approaches 2, we factor and cancel:

Since the cube root function is continuous at −8, by part 1 of Theorem 2.7.13,

We could try to find limit (b) by evaluating limθ→π/2 sec θ and limθ→π/2 tan θ separately. But limθ→π/2 sec θ = limθ→π/2(1/cos θ), and by the continuity of the cosine function, limθ→π/2 cos θ = cos π/2 = 0. Thus, limθ→π/2 sec θ is undefined, and similar reasoning shows that limθ→π/2 tan θ is also undefined. You might be tempted to conclude that limit (b) is undefined, but as we saw in Example 2.4.9(b), this reasoning is not correct. In fact, the limit is defined. To find its value, we begin by writing out the definitions of the secant and tangent functions:

By the continuity of the sine and cosine functions, the numerator and denominator of the last fraction both approach 0, so we try to find a factor we can cancel. A tricky algebraic step accomplishes this; we multiply numerator and denominator by 1 +sin θ and then apply the identity cos2 θ +sin2 θ = 1:

For limit (c), it appears intuitively that  but none of our theorems seem to apply. With no theorems to help us, we fall back on the definition of this limit statement, which is: for every number M, there is some number N such that if t > N then  To prove  this statement,  let M be any number. Let N = M 5. Now suppose t > N. Then  as required. Similar reasoning can be used to show that for every positive integer n,  and for odd n, 
Finally, for limit (d) we begin with an algebraic step we've seen before that allows some terms to cancel each other out. Since this step eliminates the radical sign in the numerator of a fraction, it is sometimes called "rationalizing the numerator":

Next, we factor out the highest power of x in the polynomial inside the square root:

Notice that we have used the continuity √of the square root function to conclude that since

We end this section by returning to the two √limits we introduced at the end of Section 2.1: limθ→0(sin θ)/θ and  We promised that by the end of this chapter we would be able to compute these limits, and now we are ready to do so.
We begin with the second, which is a little easier. Once again, rationalizing the numerator turns out to be the key:

In the last step, we have rationalized the denominator, putting the answer into the form in which we gave it in Section 2.1.
Finally, for limθ→0(sin θ)/θ, we begin with some inequalities. Figure 2.37 shows an angle of θ radians in the unit circle, with 0 < θ < π/2. In the figure, triangle OPQ is contained in the sector of the circle cut off by OP and OQ, so

Since the coordinates of Q are (cos θ, sin θ), the height of triangle OPQ is AQ = sin θ, so

The area of the entire unit circle is π(1)2 = π, and the fraction of the circle contained in sector OPQ is θ/(2π) (since θ is measured in radians, and a full circle is 2π radians), so

Thus, inequality (2.14) means

and it follows that



Figure 2.37: Finding limθ→0 sin θ/θ.

Next, notice that sector OPQ is contained in triangle OPT, and therefore

Triangle OPT is similar to triangle OAQ, so

Thus, the area of triangle OPT is (1) tan θ = (tan θ)/2, and inequality (2.16) says

Rearranging, we have

and putting this together with (2.15) gives us

We have derived inequality (2.18) under the assumption that 0 < θ < π/2, but similar reasoning can be used to show that it holds for −π/2 < θ < 0 as well (see Exercise 32).
You may not have known where we were headed with these calculations, but now you should see that inequality (2.18) is exactly what we need to apply the squeeze theorem. Since limθ→0 cos θ = cos 0 = 1 and limθ→0 1 = 1, the squeeze theorem implies that limθ→0(sin θ)/θ = 1. Note that in our reasoning we have assumed that θ is measured in radians. If we were to measure angles in degrees, the answer for this limit would be different (see Exercise 29). The fact that the use of radians leads to such a simple answer for this limit is one of the reasons why we always use radians to measure angles in calculus.

Verify the following limits, thus confirming the asymptotes shown in Figure 2.31.

30.(a)Suppose that as x →a=, g(x)→ L≤, and f is continuous from the left at L. Show that limx→a f (g(x)) = f (L). Of course, this is a one-sided version of part 1 of Theorem 2.7.13
(b)State and prove a similar statement for continuity from the right.
31.Suppose f is a function, I is an interval contained in the domain of f, and a ∈ I. We define "as x →a∈I, f (x) → L" to mean that if x is close to a and x is in I, then f (x) is close to L.More precisely, it means that for everyε > 0 there is some δ > 0 such that if |x −a| < δ and x ∈ I then | f (x)− L| < ε.
(a)Show that a function f is continuous on an interval I if and only if for every a ∈ I, as x →a∈I, f (x)→ f (a).

(b)Suppose that−π/2 < θ < 0. Then 0 < −θ < π/2, so by the reasoning in the text, 
Use this fact to show that inequality (2.18) holds.
2.8 Sequences and the Nested Interval Theorem
As you no doubt know, π = 3.14159 . . ., where the digits go on forever. But what does it mean to specify a number with a sequence of digits that we can never completely write down? According to the meaning of decimal notation, the 1 after the decimal point stands for 1/10, the following 4 stands for 4/100, and so on, so the decimal representation of π says that

But, again, it is not clear what this means: there are infinitely many terms in this sum, so we could never finish adding them up. (We will study such infinite sums in Chapter 10.)
One thing that is clear from the decimal expansion of π is that π is approximately 3.1. The complete infinite decimal expansion of π is hard to understand, but there is nothing mysterious about the finite decimal expansion 3.1, which represents the finite sum 3+1/10. Unfortunately, it isn't a very good approximation of π, but if we want a better approximation we could say that π ≈ 3.14 = 3+1/10+4/100, or π ≈ 3.141 = 3+1/10+4/100+1/1000.
You should recognize that we now have the crucial ingredients for applying the methods of calculus: a way of approximating a number, and a way of making the approximations better and better. We can therefore use a limit to achieve precision through approximation: the exact value of π is the limit that the approximations approach as we take more and more digits from the decimal expansion. In fact, this is how the value of an infinite decimal expansion is defined.
Unfortunately, this limit doesn't quite fit the pattern of the limits we have studied so far in this chapter. Up until now we have studied limits of functions, but what is the function whose limit we are computing in this case? We could define f (1) = 3.1, f (2) = 3.14, and, in general,

where dn is the nth digit after the decimal point in the decimal expansion of π. We would then want to say that the exact value of π is π = limn→∞ f (n), but this limit is slightly different from the limits we have studied previously. The reason is that f (n) only makes sense if n is a positive integer, so the domain of f is the set of all positive integers, usually denoted Z+. (It would make no sense to take, say, the first three and a half digits of π!) A function whose domain is Z+ is called a sequence. So we need to say exactly what it means to take the limit of a sequence. Of course, we follow the pattern of our previous definitions, and just add in the restriction that only positive integer values are considered for n.
Definition 2.8.1. If f is a sequence, then to say that as n →∞, f (n) → L means that for every ε > 0 there is some number N such that if n is a positive integer and n > N, then | f (n)− L| < ε. We define limn→∞ f (n) to be the unique L such that as n →∞, f (n) → L, if there is such an L.
Figure 2.38 shows the graph of a sequence f for which limn→∞ f (n) = L. Since f (n) is defined only for positive integers n, the graph consists of a sequence of dots rather than a curve. Since f (n) gets close to L when n is large, the dots gets close to the line y = L toward the right side of the graph.
Sometimes you will have to tell from context whether a limit is a limit of a sequence or an ordinary limit of a function. We will usually use the letter n as the independent variable for sequences to help make the distinction clear. For the most part, working with limits of sequences is very similar to working with other limits. All of our previous theorems still apply, with some obvious small adjustments. We also use the notation limn→∞ f (n)=∞ (or limn→∞ f (n) = −∞) to mean that when n is a very large positive integer, f (n) is very large (or f (n) is a very large magnitude negative number).


Figure 2.38: The graph of y = f (n), for a sequence f such that limn→∞ f (n) = L.

For example, clearly limn→∞ n =∞, and therefore limn→∞ 1/n = 0. Also,

However, there are occasionally subtle differences between ordinary limits of functions and limits of sequences. For example, Figure 2.39 shows the graph of the equation y = cos(2πx), and it is clear from this figure that limx→∞ cos(2πx) is undefined; as x gets larger and larger, cos(2πx) oscillates back and forth between −1 and 1 and does not approach any single number. However, if n is any positive integer then cos(2πn) = 1, and therefore the graph of the equation y = cos(2πn) (where the horizontal axis now represents n, and it is understood that n stands for a positive integer) consists of just the dots in Figure 2.39 at the points (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), .... Thus, limn→∞ cos(2πn) = 1.


Figure 2.39: limx→∞ cos(2πx) is undefined, but limn→∞ cos(2πn) = 1.

This example illustrates that it is possible for limx→∞ f (x) to be undefined, but for limn→∞ f (n) to be defined. However, the reverse situation is not possible. If limx→∞ f (x) = L, then for large real numbers x, f (x) is close to L. This is true for all large real numbers, so in particular it is true for large integers. In other words, if n is a large integer, then f (n) must be close to L, which means that limn→∞ f (n) = L. Thus, the following theorem is true.
Theorem 2.8.2. If limx→∞ f (x) = L, then limn→∞ f (n) = L, where in the second limit n stands for an integer.
The theorem is illustrated in Figure 2.40. Since the curve y = f (x) approaches the horizontal asymptote y = L, the dots on the curve at integer x-coordinates, which make up the graph of y = f (n), must also approach the asymptote. For a more careful proof of the theorem, see Exercise 22.
We usually think of a sequence f as representing a list of numbers f (1), f (2), f (3), .... The number f (n) is called the nth term of the sequence. We often write


Figure 2.40: The curve is the graph of y = f (x), and the dots are the graph of y = f (n).

 to denote the sequence f (1), f (2), f (3), .... The subscript "n = 1" and superscript "∞" indicate that the terms of the sequence are generated from the expression f (n) by plugging in values of n starting with 1 and running through all the positive integers. Sometimes we may want to start at a value of n other than 1. For example,  would denote the sequence f (7), f (8), f (9), ....
If limn→∞ f (n) = L, then as we go through the list f (1), f (2), f (3), ..., the numbers in the list eventually get close to L. In this situation, we say that the sequence converges to L. For example,  denotes the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, .... Since limn→∞ 1/n = 0, this sequence converges to 0. If limn→∞ f (n) is undefined, then we say that the sequence  diverges. For example, since  the sequence  diverges.
Example 2.8.3. Do the following sequences converge or diverge?

Solution. For every integer n, (−1)n is equal to 1 if n is even and −1 if n is odd. Thus,  is the sequence −1, 1, −1, 1, .... This sequence will continue to alternate between the values −1 and 1 forever, so limn→∞(−1)n is undefined and the sequence diverges.
Sequence (b) is the sequence 1/4, −1/5, 1/6, −1/7, .... The numerators of these fractions alternate between −1 and 1, as in part (a). Notice that

By Theorem 2.4.11 (or, more precisely, the sequence version of the theorem), it follows that limn→∞(−1)n/n = 0. In other words, sequence (b) converges to 0.
Finally, in part (c) we have limn→∞ 2π(n2 + 1)/n = limn→∞ 2π(n + 1/n)=∞. Since cos x oscillates up and down between −1 and 1 as x →∞, you might be tempted to think that sequence (c) diverges. But if n is an integer then

since the cosine function is periodic with period 2π. Therefore

so sequence (c) converges to 1.
When thinking of a sequence  as a list of numbers, we often use subscript notation rather than function notation. For example, we might let an = f (n), so that the sequence would be denoted  This sequence is the list of numbers a1, a2, a3, ..., and the nth term of the sequence is an.
Sometimes we define a sequence by specifying how each term in the sequence can be used to compute the next term. Such a definition is called a recursive definition. For example, we might define a sequence  as follows:

It might seem at first that this definition is circular, because an+1 is defined in terms of an. But in fact the definition can be used to compute all the terms of the sequence in order. For example, since a1 = 0, we can use equation (2.19b), with n = 1, to conclude that

But then applying equation (2.19b) with n = 2 we see that

Continuing in this way, we can compute

These calculations reveal a surprising pattern: for values of n up to 6 we have an = (n −1)/n. Will this pattern continue? Is there a way to be sure?
In the last step of our calculations above, we saw that the value a5 = 4/5 could be used to compute a6 = 5/6. In general, will a value an = (n −1)/n always lead to an+1 = n/(n +1)? According to equation (2.19b), if an = (n −1)/n then

Thus, the pattern we have observed for n up to 6 will always be carried over from one number to the next. Since we have already checked that a6 = 5/6, we can conclude that a7 = 6/7. But then this statement in turn implies that a8 = 7/8, which implies that a9 = 8/9, and so on. We can now see that the pattern will hold for every positive integer n.
The reasoning we have just used is an example of an important kind of reasoning called mathematical induction. Mathematical induction is a method that can be used to prove that all positive integers have some property. There are two parts to a proof by mathematical induction. In the first part, called the base case, we verify that the number 1 has the property in question. In the second part, called the induction step, we prove that if any positive integer n has the property, then n +1 does as well. For example, here is a formal proof by mathematical induction of the pattern we just verified.
Proposition 2.8.4. Suppose that a sequence  is defined recursively by equations (2.19). Then for every positive integer n, an = (n −1)/n.
Proof. We use mathematical induction.
Base case. If n = 1, then an = a1 = 0 = 0/1 = (n −1)/n.
Induction step. Suppose that n is a positive integer for which an = (n −1)/n. Then

Why does this proof establish that every positive integer n has the property that an = (n −1)/n? The induction step shows that if any positive integer n has the property, then so does n +1. In particular, if 1 has the property, then so does 2. But the base case confirms that 1 does have the property, so we can conclude that 2 has the property. Since 2 has the property, it follows by the inductions step that 3 does as well. This implies that 4 has the property, and so on. Thus, all positive integers have the property.
By the way, now that we have a simple formula for an, we can see that

In other words, the sequence defined by equations (2.19) converges to 1.
In general, when writing the induction step of a proof by mathematical induction, we begin by assuming that n is a positive integer that has the property in question, and then we must prove that n +1 has the property. The assumption that n has the property is known as the inductive hypothesis, and it is often the key step in proving that n +1 has the property.
Example 2.8.5. Prove that for every positive integer n, 2n > n.
Solution. We use mathematical induction.
Base case. 21 = 2 > 1.
Induction step. Suppose n is a positive integer and 2n > n. Then
2n+1 = 2 · 2n > 2 · n (by the inductive hypothesis)
= n +n ≥ n +1.
Note that Example 2.8.5 implies that limn→∞ 2n =∞, and therefore limn→∞(1/2n) = 0. In other words, the sequence  converges to 0. This fact will be useful to us later.
We give one more example of a proof by mathematical induction, this time involving the factorial sequence. For any positive integer n, we define n!, which is called n factorial, to be the product of all integers from n down to 1:
n! = n · (n −1) · (n −2) · · · 1.
For example, 4! = 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 24. A useful fact about n! is that for every positive integer n,
(n +1)! = (n +1) · n · (n −1) · · · 1 = (n +1) · n!.
By convention, 0! is defined to be 1. Notice that with this convention, the equation (n +1)! = (n +1) · n! holds when n = 0 as well. Thus, we could have defined the sequence (n!)∞n=0 by using the recursive definition
0! = 1, and for every integer n ≥ 0, (n +1)! = (n +1) · n!.
In many cases, if a sequence has been defined recursively, then facts about that sequence are most easily proven by mathematical induction. We illustrate this in our next example by proving a property of n!. We will use a slight variation on mathematical induction, but if you understand why induction works, then you should have no trouble seeing why this variation works as well. (For a generalization of this example, see Exercise 21.)
Example 2.8.6. Prove that for all integers n ≥ 9, n! > 4n.
Solution. We use mathematical induction, but we use n = 9 as the base case of the induction.
Base case. If n = 9, then n! = 9! = 362880 and 4n = 49 = 262144, so n! > 4n.
Induction step. Suppose that n is an integer, n ≥ 9, and n! > 4n. Then

Now that we know a little bit about sequences and their limits, we are ready to present the proof of the intermediate value theorem. To motivate the proof, we begin by discussing a method you might use to compute  if your calculator doesn't have a  key. As we have already observed, 12 = 1 < 2 and 22 = 4 > 2, so  must be between 1 and 2. Thus, in all of our calculations we can restrict attention to the interval [u1, v1] = [1, 2].
A natural next step is to look at the midpoint of the interval [1, 2], which is 1.5, and compute 1.52 = 2.25 > 2. We conclude that  so we now focus our attention on the interval [u2, v2] = [1, 1.5]. Testing the midpoint of this interval, we find that 1.252 = 1.5625 < 2, so  must belong to the interval [u3, v3] = [1.25, 1.5]. The midpoint of this interval is 1.375 and 1.3752 = 1.890625 < 2, so we can narrow down further to the interval [u4, v4] = [1.375, 1.5]. Continuing in this way, we generate an infinite sequence of closed intervals, each one containing the next. In other words, for every n, [un+1, vn+1] ⊆ [un, vn]. We call this a nested sequence of intervals. As the intervals shrink, we are able to pin down  with greater and greater accuracy.
The endpoints of our intervals are two sequences of numbers, and since the intervals are nested we have u1 ≤ u2 ≤ u3 ≤· · · and v1 ≥ v2 ≥ v3 ≥· · . The lengths of the intervals are v1 −u1 = 2−1 = 1, v2 −u2 = 1.5−1 = 1/2, v3 − u3 = 1.5−1.25 = 1/4, v4 −u4 = 1.5−1.375 = 1/8, and so on. In general, the length of the nth interval is vn −un = 1/2n−1, and therefore, by Example 2.8.5, limn→∞(vn − un) = limn→∞(1/2n−1) = 0. It turns out that these facts are sufficient to guarantee that the intervals shrink down to a single point on the number line. We state this precisely in the following theorem.
Theorem 2.8.7 (Nested Interval Theorem). Suppose that  and  are two sequences of numbers such that u1 ≤ u2 ≤ u3 ≤· · · and v1 ≥ v2 ≥ v3 ≥ · · · . Suppose also that for every n, un ≤ vn, and limn→∞(vn −un) = 0. Then there is a unique number c such that for every n, un ≤ c ≤ vn. Furthermore, limn→∞ un = limn→∞ vn = c; in fact, since for every n we have un ≤ c ≤ vn, we can say that as n →∞, un →c≤ and vn →c≥.
The nested interval theorem is illustrated in Figure 2.41. The theorem expresses a fundamental property of the real numbers, and we will use it repeatedly in the rest of this book. We will not give a proof of the nested interval theorem. The proof of the existence of a number c belonging to all of the intervals [un, vn] is surprisingly difficult, because it depends on subtle facts about the real numbers that are beyond the scope of this book. However, it should be intuitively clear from the figure that such a number c must exist, and we ask you to accept it on these intuitive grounds.
Once the existence of the number c is established, it is not hard to see why the limit statements in the last sentence of the theorem must be true. For every n we have un ≤ c ≤ vn, and therefore 0 ≤ vn −c ≤ vn −un. But limn→∞(vn −un) = 0, so by the squeeze theorem limn→∞(vn −c) = 0, and therefore

Similarly, limn→∞ un = c. In other words, the sequences  and  both converge to c. This is also intuitively clear in Figure 2.41.


Figure 2.41: The nested interval theorem.

The nested interval theorem is the key tool we will use to prove the intermediate value theorem. We will also need the following fact:
Theorem 2.8.8. Suppose that limx→a f (x) = L and r is any real number.
1.If L > r, then there is some number δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ then f (x) > r.
2.If L < r, then there is some number δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ then f (x) < r.
The theorem should make intuitive sense. For example, part 1 says that if, as x →a, f (x) approaches a limit L that is larger than r, then when x gets close enough to a, f (x) will be larger than r. A careful proof uses the ε-δ definition of limits:
Proof. To prove part 1, assume that L > r. According to the definition of limits, for every number ε > 0 there is some δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ then | f (x)− L| < ε. Since this is true for every ε > 0, we can assign any positive value we please to ε. We will use the value ε = L −r > 0. Applying the definition of limits, we conclude that there is some number δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ then | f (x)− L| < ε, and therefore
L −ε < f (x) < L +ε.
(See Figure 2.42.) The first half of this inequality tells us that f (x) > L −ε = L −(L −r) = r, as required in part 1 of the theorem.
The proof of part 2 is similar.


Figure 2.42: The proof of Theorem 2.8.8.

As an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.8.8, we get the following fact. A fact that follows from a theorem is often called a corollary of the theorem.
Corollary 2.8.9. Suppose that limx→a f (x) = L, r is any real number, and d > 0.
1.Suppose that for all x, if 0 < |x −a| < d then f (x) ≤ r. Then L ≤ r.
2.Suppose that for all x, if 0 < |x −a| < d then f (x) ≥ r. Then L ≥ r.
To put it more informally, Corollary 2.8.9 says that if f (x) ≤ r for x close to a but not equal to a, then limx→a f (x) ≤ r, and similarly if f (x) ≥ r for x close to a but not equal to a, then limx→a f (x) ≥ r. We say that the weak inequalities f (x) ≤ r and f (x) ≥ r are preserved by limits. Notice that the strict inequalities f (x) < r and f (x) > r are not preserved by limits. For example, if f (x) > r for x close to a but not equal to a, it does not follow that limx→a f (x) > r (see Exercise 23).
Proof of Corollary 2.8.9. Once again, the proofs of the two parts are very similar, so we will only prove part 1. We will use the method of proof by contradiction, so we begin by assuming that the conclusion L ≤ r is false; in other words, we assume that L > r. Then by part 1 of Theorem 2.8.8, there is some number δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δthen f (x) > r. But we have also assumed in part 1 that if 0 < |x −a| < d then f (x) ≤ r. Thus, if we let x be a number close enough to a that 0 < |x −a| < d and 0 < |x −a| < δ, then f (x) ≤ r and f (x) > r, which is impossible. Therefore it cannot be the case that L > r, so L ≤ r.
We have stated Theorem 2.8.8 and Corollary 2.8.9 for limits as x → a, but similar facts hold for all of our other versions of limits: one-sided limits, limits as x →±∞, and limits of sequences. For example, the sequence version of part 1 of Corollary 2.8.9 says that if a sequence (an)∞n=1 converges to L and there is some number N such that for all n > N, an ≤ r, then L ≤ r. In other words, weak inequalities are preserved by sequence limits. This is the fact that we will use in our proof of the intermediate value theorem.
Theorem 2.7.6 (Intermediate Value Theorem, restated). Suppose that f is continuous on the interval [a, b], and either f (a) < r < f (b) or f (a) > r > f (b). Then there is some number c such that a < c < b and f (c) = r.
Proof. We will assume that f (a) < r < f (b); the case in which f (a) > r > f (b) is similar. Our plan is to define a nested sequence of intervals [u1, v1], [u2, v2], [u3, v3],... that will shrink down to the desired number c.
We start by letting [u1, v1] = [a, b]. To get from one interval to the next, we use the following fact, which tells us how to shrink an interval [u, v] to an interval [u′, v′] that is half as big:
Lemma 2.8.10. Suppose a ≤ u < v ≤ b and f (u) ≤ r ≤ f (v). Then there are numbers u′ and v′ such that u ≤ u′ < v ≤ v, v′ −u′ = (v −u)/2, and f (u′) ≤ r ≤ f (v′).
Proof of Lemma. Let w = (u + v)/2; in other words, w is the midpoint of the interval [u, v]. If f (w) ≤ r, then we have f (w) ≤ r ≤ f (v) and v −w = (v −u)/2, so we can let u′ = w and v′ = v. Similarly, if f (w) > r then we let u′ = u and v′ = w. This proves the lemma.
By assumption, we have f (u1) = f (a) < r < f (b) = f (v1). Applying the lemma, we conclude that there are numbers u2 and v2 such that u1 ≤ u2 < v2 ≤ v1, v2 −u2 = (v1 −u1)/2 = (b−a)/2, and f (u2) ≤ r ≤ f (v2). Applying the lemma again, we see that there are numbers u3 and v3 such that u2 ≤ u3 < v3 ≤ v2, v3 −u3 = (v2 −u2)/2 = (b−a)/4, and f (u3) ≤ r ≤ f (v3). Continuing in this way, we construct a nested sequence of intervals [un, vn ] such that for every n, vn −un = (b−a)/2n−1 and f (un) ≤ r ≤ f (vn). Since limn→∞(vn −un) = limn→∞(b−a)/2n−1 = 0, we can apply the nested interval theorem to conclude that there is a unique number c such that for every n, un ≤ c ≤ vn. In particular, a = u1 ≤ c ≤ v1 = b. We must prove now that f (c) = r.
Suppose that f (c) > r. Since f (a) < r, this implies that c = a. Therefore a < c ≤ b, and since f is continuous on [a, b], it follows that f is continuous from the left at c. According to the nested interval theorem, as n →∞, un → c≤, and thus, by Theorem 2.7.12, f (un) → f (c). In other words, limn→∞ f (un) = f (c). But recall that we chose the numbers un so that for every n, f (un) ≤ r. Applying the fact that weak inequalities are preserved by sequence limits (the sequence version of Corollary 2.8.9), we can conclude that f (c) = limn→∞ f (un) ≤ r. Thus, our assumption that f (c) > r could not have been correct.
Similar reasoning shows that it cannot be the case that f (c) < r, so f (c) = r. Since f (a) < r < f (b), this implies that c = a and c = b. Thus, a < c < b, so c has all the properties required in the theorem and the proof is complete.

2.9Monotone Sequences and the Completeness of the Real Numbers
When studying a sequence, it is sometimes useful to know how the terms compare to each other. We therefore make the following definition:
Definition 2.9.1. Let  be a sequence.
1.We say that  is strictly increasing if a1 < a2 < a3 < · · · .
2.We say that  is weakly increasing if a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ · · · .
3.We say that  is strictly decreasing if a1 > a2 > a3 > · · · .
4.We say that  is weakly decreasing if a1 ≥ a2 ≥ a3 ≥ · · · .
Notice that if a sequence is strictly increasing then it is also weakly increasing, and if it is strictly decreasing then it is also weakly decreasing. If a sequence has any of these four properties, then we say that it is monotone.
Some books use the term "increasing" without the modifier "strictly" or "weakly," but there is some inconsistency in the literature about whether the word "increasing," when used alone, means strictly increasing or weakly increasing. To avoid confusion, we will always use one of the modifiers "strictly" or "weakly."
Example 2.9.2. Show that the following sequences are monotone:

Solution. The nth term of sequence (a) is an = 12n/(n +1). Setting n equal to 1, 2, 3, and 4 in this formula, we see that the sequence starts
6, 8, 9, 9.6, . . . .
Thus, a1 < a2 < a3 < a4, but will this pattern continue? We need to know whether, in general, an < an+1.
One convenient way to compare an to an+1 is to compute an+1 −an and see whether it is positive, negative, or 0. In this case we have

Thus, for every positive integer n we have an+1 −an > 0, and therefore an+1 > an. We conclude that sequence (a) is strictly increasing.
If the terms of a sequence  are positive, then another way to compare an+1 to an is to compute the ratio an+1/an and compare it to 1. This method often works well if the formula for an involves exponentiation or factorials. For sequence (b) we have an = n!/2n > 0, so we compute

Since n stands for a positive integer, we have n ≥ 1, and therefore (n +1)/2 ≥ 2/2 = 1. Thus, an+1/an ≥ 1, and multiplying this inequality by an (which is positive), we conclude that an+1 ≥ an. Therefore sequence (b) is weakly increasing. (It is not strictly increasing, since a1 = a2. However, a2 < a3 < a4 < · · ·, so we could say that the sequence  is strictly increasing.)
Let's compute the limits of the two sequences in the last example. For sequence (a), we have

To find the limit of sequence (b), we apply Example 2.8.6, which tells us that for n ≥ 9,

Since limn→∞ 2n =∞, we conclude that limn→∞ n!/2n =∞.
Thus, one of the sequences in Example 2.9.2 converges, and the terms of the other approach ∞. It turns out that these are the only possibilities for a weakly increasing sequence. To see why, we will need the following concept:
Definition 2.9.3. Suppose A is a set of numbers. We say that a number b is an upper bound for A if for every x ∈ A, x ≤ b. Similarly, b is a lower bound for A if for every x ∈ A, x ≥ b.
For example, let A be the set whose elements are the terms of sequence (a) in Example 2.9.2. In other words,
A = {x : for some positive integer n, x = 12n/(n +1)} = {6, 8, 9, 9.6, . . .}.
Another notation for A is A = {12n/(n +1) : n is a positive integer}. For every positive integer n we have 12n/(n +1) ≤ 12n/n = 12, so 12 is an upper bound for A. Of course, it is also true that for every integer n, 12n/(n +1) ≤ 13, so 13 is also an upper bound. In fact, every number greater than 12 is an upper bound for A. But now consider a number b < 12. Since sequence (a) converges to 12, the sequence version of Theorem 2.8.8 implies that for sufficiently large n, 12n/(n +1) > b, and therefore b is not an upper bound for A. Thus, 12 is the smallest number that is an upper bound for A; we say that 12 is the least upper bound of A. To summarize, we have shown that sequence (a) converges to the least upper bound of its set of terms.
On the other hand, suppose that B = {n!/2n : n is a positive integer}, the set of terms of sequence (b). Since limn→∞ n!/2n =∞, for any number b we might choose, there will be positive integers n for which n!/2n > b. Thus, no number b will be an upper bound for B; the set of terms of sequence (b) has no upper bound.
We plan to show that every weakly increasing sequence follows the pattern of either sequence (a) or sequence (b). In other words, we will show that if the set of terms of a weakly increasing sequence has an upper bound, then the sequence converges to the least upper bound, and if there is no upper bound, then the terms approach∞. And a similar fact is true of weakly decreasing sequences: if the set of terms of a weakly decreasing sequence has a lower bound, then the sequence converges to the greatest lower bound, and if not then the terms approach−∞.
There is one difficulty we must deal with before we can carry out this plan: what if the set of terms of a weakly increasing sequence has an upper bound, but among the upper bounds there isn't a smallest one? After all, not every collection of numbers has a smallest element. For example, there is no smallest positive number: for any positive number x, x/2 is a smaller positive number. Could it happen that a set of numbers has an upper bound, but no least upper bound? Fortunately, we won't have to worry about this problem:
Theorem 2.9.4 (Completeness of the Real Numbers). Suppose that A is a nonempty set of real numbers. That is, A is a set of numbers that has at least one element.
1.If A has an upper bound, then it has a least upper bound.
2.If A has a lower bound, then it has a greatest lower bound.
Completeness is an important property of the real numbers that is closely related to the nested interval theorem. In fact, we will use the nested interval theorem to prove Theorem 2.9.4 at the end of this section. But first, let's see how it helps us understand weakly increasing and decreasing sequences.
Theorem 2.9.5. Suppose  is a sequence, and let A be the set whose elements are the terms of the sequence.
1.If  is weakly increasing and A has an upper bound, then  converges to the least upper bound of A.
2.If  is weakly increasing and A does not have an upper bound, then limn→∞ an =∞.
3.If  is weakly decreasing and A has a lower bound, then  converges to the greatest lower bound of A.
4.If  is weakly decreasing and A does not have a lower bound, then limn→∞ an = −∞.
Proof. For part 1, suppose that  is weakly increasing and A has an upper bound. Then by the completeness of the real numbers, A has a least upper bound. Let b be this least upper bound. We now use the definition of limits to show that limn→∞ an = b.
Suppose ε > 0. Since b is the least upper bound of A, b−ε is not an upper bound, so there must be some positive integer N such that aN > b−ε. Now consider any integer n > N. Since the sequence is weakly increasing, an ≥ aN > b−ε. And since b is an upper bound for A, an ≤ b. Combining these facts, we conclude that b−ε < an ≤ b < b+ε. Thus, for every n > N we have |an −b| < ε, as required.
We use the definition of limits in the proof of part 2 as well. Suppose now that A does not have an upper bound, and consider any number M. Since M is not an upper bound for A, there must be some positive integer N such that aN > M. And since the sequence is weakly increasing, for any integer n > N, an ≥ aN > M. This shows that limn→∞ an =∞.
The proofs of parts 3 and 4 are similar to the proofs of parts 1 and 2 (see Exercise 20).
Example 2.9.6. A sequence  is defined recursively as follows:
a1 = 1, and for every positive integer n, 
Find limn→∞ an.
Solution. The first few terms of the sequence are

So far, the terms are strictly increasing, but will they continue to increase, and do they have an upper bound? Since the sequence is defined recursively, it may be easiest to use mathematical induction to answer these questions. We will use induction to prove that for every positive integer n, 0 < an < an+1 < 3.
Base case. Since a1 = 1 and a2 = 2, we have 0 < a1 < a2 < 3.
Induction step. Suppose that n is a positive integer and 0 < an < an+1 < 3. Then 1/an > 1/an+1 > 0, so

According to the definition of the sequence, this means that an+1 < an+2 < 3, and we already know that an+1 > an > 0. Therefore 0 < an+1 < an+2 < 3. This completes the mathematical induction proof.
We now know that the sequence  is strictly increasing, and that 3 is an upper bound for the terms of the sequence. By Theorem 2.9.5, the sequence converges; in other words, there is some number L such that as n →∞, an → L. The number L is the least upper bound for the set of terms of the sequence. Since a4 = 2.6 and 3 is an upper bound, we must have 2.6 ≤ L ≤ 3, but we don't yet know the exact value of L.
We are going to use a somewhat unusual procedure to find L: we are going to compute limn→∞ an+1 in two different ways, and then set the two answers equal to each other. For the first computation, let m = n +1. Then as n →∞, m = n +1→∞, and as m →∞, am → L. Combining these, we conclude that as n→∞, an+1 = am → L, so limn→∞ an+1 = L. For the second computation, we use the recursive definition of the sequence to see that

Both computations are correct, so the two answers must be equal to each other. Therefore L = 3 −1/L. Multiplying by L, we get L2 = 3L −1, or L2 −3L +1 = 0, and the quadratic formula gives

Thus, we have narrowed down the possibilities for L to  and  But we already know 2.6 ≤ L ≤ 3, so we can rule out the first possibility. Therefore 
Our solution to the last example had a somewhat unusual form. First we showed that the limit exists, and that entitled us to introduce the name L for the value of the limit. Then we did some further analysis to find the value of L. The lesson here is that sometimes showing that a limit exists is the first step in finding its value. Once you know that a limit is defined, you can give a name to its value. And giving a name to a number is surprisingly useful, because it makes it much easier to reason about the number. We will see more examples of this kind of reasoning later in this book.
Example 2.9.7. Find

Solution. If we let an = (2n)!/(n!)2, then we have
a1 = 2, a2 = 6, a3 = 20, a4 = 70.
Will the numbers continue to increase? Since the formula for an involves factorials, a good way to answer this question is to compute

We have already observed that (n +1)! = (n +1) · n!, and it follows that (2n +2)! = (2n +2) · (2n +1)! = (2n +2) · (2n +1) · (2n)!. Therefore

Since an+1/an > 1, we conclude that an+1 > an, so the sequence  is strictly increasing. Thus, according to Theorem 2.9.5, either the sequence converges or limn→∞ an =∞.
Suppose that the sequence converges—say, limn→∞ an = L. Then L is the least upper bound for the set of terms of the sequence, and since we have already computed a4 = 70, we must have L ≥ 70. Imitating our last example, we now compute limn→∞ an+1 in two ways. On the one hand, as n →∞ we have n +1→∞, and therefore limn→∞ an+1 = L. But on the other hand, according to equation (2.20), an+1 = (4n + 2)/(n +1) · an, and therefore

The two answers must be equal, so L = 4L. Dividing by L (note that L ≥ 70, so L = 0), we get 1 = 4, which is obviously false. We conclude that our assumption that the sequence converges must have been wrong.
Thus, the sequence does not converge. By Theorem 2.9.5, the only remaining possibility is that limn→∞ an =∞. For an alternative proof of this fact, see Exercise 18.
We end this section with the promised proof of Theorem 2.9.4. Recall that this theorem says that if a nonempty set of real numbers A has an upper bound, then it has a least upper bound, and if it has a lower bound, then it has a greatest lower bound.
Proof of Theorem 2.9.4. We will prove only the statement about upper bounds; the proof for lower bounds is similar (see Exercise 21). Suppose that A has an upper bound; let v1 be an upper bound for A. The assumption that A is nonempty means that there is at least one number in A, so we can let a be some element of A. Then if we let u1 be any number smaller than a, then u1 is not an upper bound for A. Note that u1 < a ≤ v1. We will look for the least upper bound of A between u1 and v1. The key fact we will use to narrow down our search for the least upper bound is the following fact:
Lemma 2.9.8. Suppose u < v, u is not an upper bound for A, and v is an upper bound for A. Then there are numbers u′ and v′ such that u ≤ u' < v' ≤ v, v′ −u′ = (v −u)/2, u′ is not an upper bound for A, and v′ is an upper bound for A.
Proof. Let m = (u + v)/2, the midpoint of the interval [u, v]. If m is an upper bound for A, then we can let u′ = u and v′ = m. If not, then we can let u′ = m and v' = v.
By the lemma, there must be numbers u2 and v2 such that u1 ≤ u2 < v2 ≤ v1, v2 −u2 = (v1 −u1)/2, u2 is not an upper bound for A, and v2 is an upper bound. Applying the lemma again, we see that there are numbers u3 and v3 such that u2 ≤ u3 < v3 ≤ v2, v3 −u3 = (v2 −u2)/2 = (v1 −u1)/4, u3 is not an upper bound for A, and v3 is an upper bound. Continuing in this way, we get sequences  and  such that u1 ≤ u2 ≤ u3 ≤· · ·, v1 ≥ v2 ≥ v3 ≥ · · ·, and for every n, un ≤ vn, vn −un = (v1 −u1)/2n−1, un is not an upper bound for A, and vn is an upper bound for A. Since limn→∞(vn −un) = limn→∞(v1 −u1)/2n−1 = 0, the nested interval theorem implies that there is a number b such that for every n, un ≤ b ≤ vn, and limn→∞ un = limn→∞ vn = b. We will show that b is the least upper bound of A.
To see that b is an upper bound for A, let x be any element of A. For every n, vn is an upper bound for A, so vn ≥ x. Since weak inequalities are preserved by limits, it follows that b = limn→∞ vn ≥ x, so b is an upper bound. Finally, to see that b is the least upper bound, consider any number c < b. Then since limn→∞ un = b, by the sequence version of Theorem 2.8.8, for sufficiently large n, un > c. Since u n is not an upper bound for A, there is some x ∈ A such that x > un. Combining this with un > c, we have x > c, so c is not an upper bound for A. Thus, we see that no number smaller than b can be an upper bound for A, so b is the least upper bound of A.

3.1Rates of Change and Slopes
In many applications of mathematics, an equation of the form y = f (x) is used to express a relationship between real-world quantities x and y. This equation says that the value of y depends on the value of x, and therefore if the value of x changes, then the value of y will also change. Sometimes we are interested in knowing how fast y will change when x changes.
For example, consider an electric heater in which electrical current flows through a coil of wire, causing the wire to heat up. Suppose the resistance of the wire coil is 25 ohms. Then according to Joule's law, if a current of I amps flows through the coil, then the power of the heater will be P watts, where
P = 25I2.
If we let f (I) = 25I2, then we could say that P = f (I). The graph of the equation P = f (I) is shown in Figure 3.1.
With a current of I = 4 amps, the power of the heater will be P = f (4) = 400 watts. If we increase the current to I = 6, the power increases to P = f (6) = 900 watts. The change in the current in this case is 6−4 = 2 amps, and the change in power is f (6)− f (4) = 900−400 = 500 watts. We say that the average rate of change of P with respect to I over the interval [4, 6] is



Figure 3.1: The graph of P = f (I). The slopes of the two blue secant lines are the average rates of change of P with respect to I over the intervals [4, 6] and [7, 10].

This tells us how fast the power of the heater changes as we increase the current from 4 to 6 amps. On average, over this interval the power increases by 250 watts for each additional amp of current. Notice that the points (4, 400) and (6, 900) are on the graph of f. The line through these two points is a secant line for the graph of f, and the average rate of change of P with respect to I over the interval [4, 6] can be interpreted as the slope of this secant line.
The average rate of change of P with respect to I over the interval [7, 10] would be

Thus, over this interval the power increases more quickly as the current increases. You can see this in Figure 3.1. The average rate of change of P with respect to I over the interval [7, 10] is the slope of the secant line through the points (7, 1225) and (10, 2500), and you can see in the figure that this line slopes up more steeply than the secant line through (4, 400) and (6, 900).
Here's another example: Consider a cylinder that is filled with a gas. Suppose that a piston can be pushed into the cylinder to decrease the volume of the gas, or pulled out to increase the volume. When the piston is pushed all the way in, the volume is 10 cubic inches (abbreviated in3) and the pressure of the gas is 300 kilopascals (abbreviated kPa). According to Boyle's law, if the piston is pulled out, increasing the volume V, then the pressure P will decrease according to the formula

Once again, we have a functional relationship; we can write P = g(V), where g(V) = 3000/V.
Suppose that the piston is pulled out enough to increase the volume from 10 in3 to 15 in3. Then the pressure will decrease from its initial value of g(10) = 300 kPa to g(15) = 200 kPa. The change in volume is 15−10 = 5 in3, and the change in pressure is g(15)− g(10) = 200−300= −100 kPa; the fact that the change in pressure is negative indicates that the pressure has decreased. The average rate of change of P with respect to V over the interval [10, 15] is therefore

The rate of change is negative, indicating that as the volume increases, the pressure decreases. Over this interval, the pressure decreases an average of 20 kilopascals for each cubic inch the volume increases. The average rates of change over other intervals may be different. For example, the average rate of change over the interval [20, 25] is

Once again, these rates of change can be interpreted as slopes of secant lines for the graph of g, as shown in Figure 3.2.


Figure 3.2: The graph of P = g(V). The slopes of the two blue secant lines are the average rates of change of P with respect to V over the intervals [10, 15] and [20, 25].

Rates of change are especially useful for talking about quantities that change over time. For example, recall that in Section 2.1 we discussed a ball that was thrown up in the air. The ball moved along a vertical number line with units marked off in feet, and the position of the ball on this number line after t seconds was given by the formula y = h(t) = 160t −16t2. We saw that the average velocity of the ball during the time interval [3, 5] was

In the terminology we are using now, this is just the average rate of change of y with respect to t over the interval [3, 5]. In other words, the average velocity of an object moving along a line is the average rate of change of its position with respect to time. This means that the average velocity tells you how fast, on average, the position of the object changes as time passes.
Generalizing from these examples, we make the following definition.
Definition 3.1.1. Suppose two quantities x and y are related by the equation y = f (x). We say that the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval [a, b] is

If the quantity x is measured in, say, smoots, and the quantity y is measured in millihelens, then the units for the average rate of change will be millihelens per smoot; the average rate of change tells us the number of millihelens by which y changes, on average, for each smoot by which x is increased, as x increases from a to b.1 A positive rate of change indicates that y increases, while a negative rate of change indicates that it decreases.
In our discussion in Section 2.1 of the ball thrown up in the air, we also studied the instantaneous velocity of the ball at time t = 3. This is more difficult to compute than an average velocity, because it cannot be computed by dividing distance traveled by elapsed time; in a single instant, the ball doesn't move at all, and no time passes, so we would be computing 0/0, which is undefined. Recall that our strategy in Section 2.1 was to compute the average velocity of the ball during very short time intervals either beginning or ending with t = 3. Our reasoning was that during a very short time interval the velocity wouldn't have time to change much, and therefore the average velocity over such a time interval would be a good approximation of the velocity at time t = 3. Furthermore, the approximation could be made more and more accurate by making the time interval shorter and shorter. We then found the precise velocity at time t = 3 by taking the limit of these approximations as they were made more and more accurate. In other words, to find the instantaneous velocity at t = 3, we found the average velocity over a time interval beginning or ending at t = 3, and then took the limit of this average velocity as the length of the time interval approached 0.
Let's see if we can generalize this idea to other situations. Consider quantities x and y related by an equation y = f (x). We would like to determine how fast y changes, per unit of increase of x, when x is equal to some number a; we will call this the instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x at x = a. Imitating our earlier reasoning, we approximate this with the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval between a and a + h, for h close to 0 but not equal to 0. If h is positive, then this would be the interval [a, a + h], and the average rate of change would be

If h is negative, then a + h < a. The interval would then be [a + h, a], over which the average rate of change is

Thus, we have the same formula for the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval between a and a + h, whether h is positive or negative. For h close to 0, this will be a good approximation of the instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x at x = a, and the approximation will improve as h gets closer to 0.We can't actually let h = 0, since then our formula for the average rate of change would be 0/0. But we can still get a precise answer for the instantaneous rate of change by taking the limit as h approaches 0.
Definition 3.1.2. Suppose two quantities x and y are related by the equation y = f (x). If the limit

is defined, then we say that it is the instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x at x = a. Sometimes we will leave out the word instantaneous and simply call this the rate of change of y with respect to x at x = a. In other words, if a rate of change is not explicitly specified to be an average rate of change, then it is understood to be an instantaneous rate of change. Since y = f (x), we may substitute f (x) for y and use the phrase rate of change of f (x) with respect to x at x = a.
As we will see, the limit in Definition 3.1.2 is sometimes undefined, but for the moment we will focus on cases when it is defined. In the graph of f, the fraction (f (a + h)− f (a))/h represents the slope of a secant line through the point P = (a, f (a)) and a nearby point Qh = (a + h, f (a + h)). As h approaches 0, the point Qh approaches P, and the secant line approaches the line tangent to the graph of f at P, as shown in Figure 3.3. Thus, the instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x at x = a could also be thought of as the slope of the line tangent to the graph of f at the point P. Intuitively, the tangent line at P is the line passing through P that goes in the same direction as the curve at P, so the instantaneous rate of change tells us how steeply the curve y = f (x) is inclined at P.
For example, consider again the electric heater whose power P is related to the current I by the equation P = f (I) = 25I2. Let's find the instantaneous rate of change


Figure 3.3: As h approaches 0, the point a + h moves along the x-axis toward a, the point Qh moves along the graph of f toward P, and the secant line through P and Qh (blue) approaches the tangent line at P (red).

of P with respect to I at I = 4. According to Definition 3.1.2, this is

This tells us that if the current is increasing, then just at the instant when the current is I = 4 amps, the power is increasing at a rate of 200 watts/amp. It also tells us that the slope of the line tangent to the graph of f at the point (4, 400) is 200. Looking at Figure 3.1, this makes sense; it appears that the slope of the tangent line at (4, 400) is slightly less than the slope of the secant line through (4, 400) and (6, 900), which, as we computed earlier, is 250.
In the case of the gas in the cylinder, the instantaneous rate of change of pressure with respect to volume when V = 20 would be

Thus, if the volume is increasing, then when it is 20 in3, the pressure is decreasing at a rate of 7.5 kPa/in3. We could also say that the line tangent to the graph of g at the point (20, 150) has slope −7.5. This line slopes down a little more steeply than the secant line through (20, 150) and (25, 120), whose slope we computed earlier to be −6.
Finally, for the ball thrown straight up, let's compute the instantaneous rate of change of position with respect to time when t = 3. Since the name of the function in this case is h, to avoid confusion we have switched to a different letter for the variable in the limit below.

Of course, this agrees with the instantaneous velocity we computed in Section 2.1.
Example 3.1.3. Suppose that the temperature in a room is 50 degrees Fahrenheit. A heater is turned on, and the temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit, t hours later is given by the formula

How fast is the temperature increasing one hour after the heater was turned on?
Solution. We compute the rate of change of T with respect to t at t = 1:

Thus, the temperature is increasing at a rate of 5 ◦F/hr after 1 hour.
In our examples so far we have considered equations relating quantities that have physical meanings. But rates of change are useful any time one quantity depends on another, whether the quantities have a physical meaning or not.

The graph of the equation y = f (x) passes through the point (6, f (6)) = (6, 5), and the calculation above shows that the slope of the line tangent to the graph at this point is 3/10. Thus, using the point-slope equation, the equation of this tangent line is y −5 = (3/10)(x −6), or equivalently

The graph of f and the tangent line at (6, 5) are shown in Figure 3.4.

3.2 Derivatives
It is time for our next paradox of calculus. Usually, if you generalize a math problem then it gets harder. For example, finding the sum of the first 5 positive integers is not hard: 1+2+3+4+5 = 15. But finding a general formula for the sum of the first n positive integers, for any positive integer n, is more difficult (see equation (5.4) in Section 5.1 for the answer). However, in calculus sometimes generalizing makes a problem easier, not harder. We call this the paradox of generalization.
To see how this applies to rates of change, consider the equation y = f (x). In the last section we saw how to find the rate of change of y with respect to x at a particular value of x. But it turns out that it will make things easier if we generalize this problem and instead find the general formula for the rate of change of y with respect to x at any value of x. Indeed, by the end of this chapter we will see that the easiest way to find the rate of change of y with respect to x at a particular value of x is to first find the general formula for the rate of change at any value of x, and then plug in the particular value of x that we are interested in.
For example, consider the equation y = f (x) = x3. Let's find the general formula for the rate of change of y with respect to x, for any value of x. To do this, we calculate the rate of change exactly as we did in the last section, but without plugging in a value for x. In our calculation we treat x as standing for a particular number, but leave the number unspecified:

It follows that, for example, the rate of change of y with respect to x when x = 2 is 3(22) = 12, and the rate of change when x = 5 is 3(52) = 75.
Notice that in this example we started with a formula involving x, namely x3, and when we computed the rate of change we got another formula involving x, namely 3x2. This suggests that we could think of this calculation as an operation that can be performed on a function to produce another function.
Definition 3.2.1. For any function f, the derivative of f is the function f ′ defined by the formula

The domain of f ′ is the set of all values of x for which this limit is defined. If a is in the domain of f ′, then we say that f is differentiable at a. In that case, f ′(a) is the rate of change of f (x) with respect to x at x = a, which is also the slope of the line tangent to the graph of f at the point (a, f (a)). The process of finding the derivative of a function is called differentiation.
If I is an open interval, we say that f is differentiable on I if it is differentiable at a for every number a ∈ I. Recall that when we discussed continuity on closed or half-open intervals, the endpoints required special treatment. Similarly, there are complications associated with discussing differentiability at endpoints of intervals. For the moment we will avoid these complications by sticking to open intervals when discussing differentiability on intervals. Later (see Section 4.9) we will discuss differentiability on closed or half-open intervals.
For example, our earlier calculation shows that if f (x) = x3 then f ′(x) = 3x2. Since f ′(x) is defined for all real numbers, f is differentiable on the interval (−∞,∞). Let's compute a few more examples of derivates.
Example 3.2.2. Find the derivatives of the following functions:

What are the domains of the derivatives?
Solution. The derivative of f is the function f ′ defined by the formula

Since f (0) is undefined, this formula will be undefined when x = 0. For x = 0, we have

Thus, the domain of f ′ is (−∞, 0) ∪(0,∞), and for all x in this domain, f ′(x) = −1/x2. We could also say that f is differentiable on each of the intervals (−∞, 0) and (0,∞).
Similarly, since g(x) is undefined for x < 0, g′(x)will also be undefined for x < 0. However, in the case of the function g it turns out that, although g(0) is defined, g ′(0) is undefined. To see why, consider the limit that defines g′(0):

This limit is undefined, because  is undefined for h < 0. The definition of derivative calls for a two-sided limit in which h approaches 0 from both sides, and in this case the two-sided limit makes no sense. Thus, g is not differentiable at 0. (You may be thinking that we could compute a "one-sided version" of the derivative by taking the one-sided limit as h → 0+. But in this case even this one-sided limit is undefined, since the denominator approaches 0.)
For x > 0 we rationalize the numerator to evaluate g′(x):

Although the domain of g is [0,∞), the domain of g′ is (0,∞), and for all x in this domain, 
To make sure that the meaning of the calculations in Example 3.2.2 is clear, we illustrate them with a couple of examples. In the case of the function f (x) = 1/x, we have f (3) = 1/3, so the graph of the function passes through the point (3, 1/3). Using the formula for f ′(x) that we derived in the example, we see that the tangent line to the graph at that point has slope f ′(3)= −1/32 = −1/9. Thus, the equation of the tangent line is y −1/3 = (−1/9)(x −3), or equivalently

The graphs of the curve y = 1/x and the line y = (−1/9)x + 2/3 are shown in Figure3.5, where you can see that the line is tangent to the curve at the point (3, 1/3). Similarly, the graph of  passes through the point (4, 2), the slope of the tangent line there is  and therefore the equation of the tangent line is y = (1/4)x +1.


Figure 3.5: The graphs of the curve y = 1/x (black) and the line y = (−1/9)x +2/3 (red).

One of the lessons of Example 3.2.2 is that, since the formula that defines f ′(x) contains both f (x) and f (x + h), in order for f ′(x) to be defined, not only must f (x) be defined, but also f (x + h) must be defined for h close to 0. In other words, there must be some number d > 0 such that the interval (x −d, x + d) is contained in the domain of f. For example, if the domain of f is an interval, then f cannot be differentiable at an endpoint of that interval. This is why the function g in Example 3.2.2 failed to be differentiable at 0: the domain of g was the interval [0,∞), so g couldn't be differentiable at the endpoint 0. (Later we will consider a one-sided version of derivatives that can be used at endpoints of intervals. But for the moment we will stick to the version of derivatives given in Definition 3.2.1, which is undefined at endpoints.)
But even if there is a number d > 0 such that (x −d, x + d) is contained in the domain of f, the limit that defines f ′(x) may be undefined. For example, consider the function f (x) = |x|. If x > 0, then x + h > 0 for h close to 0, so |x| = x and |x + h| = x + h. Therefore

Similarly, if x < 0 then

However, the computation of f ′(0) is more delicate. We have

In this limit, h can be either positive or negative, so |h| can be either h or −h. The best way to deal with this is to compute the two one-sided limits:

Since the two one-sided limits are different, the two-sided limit is undefined, which means that f ′ (0) is undefined. Thus, although f (x) is defined for all x, f is not differentiable at 0. Putting all of our calculations together, we have

If we look at the graph of f (see Figure 3.6), then we can see that this answer makes sense. If a > 0, then the graph of y = |x| passes through the point (a, |a|) = (a, a), and the line that is tangent to the graph at that point—that is, the line through (a, a) that goes in the same direction as the graph of f at that point—is the line y = x, which has slope 1. Similarly, for a < 0, the line tangent to the graph of y = |x| at (a, |a|) = (a,−a) is y = −x, which has slope −1. But at the point (0, 0), the graph of f has an angle where the direction of the curve changes abruptly. Thus, the graph is not going in a particular direction at the point (0, 0), and therefore there is no tangent line at that point. This, then, is another reason why a function may fail to be differentiable at a particular value of x: if there is no tangent line at that value of x, then the derivative, which gives the slope of the tangent line, will be undefined.


Figure 3.6: The graph of y = f (x) = |x|. There is no tangent line at x = 0, so f is not differentiable at 0.

Another instructive example is the function  The derivative is

A natural idea for evaluating this limit is to rationalize the numerator, but how do we do that? When we computed the derivative of the function  in Example 3.2.2, we rationalized the numerator, and what made our algebraic steps work was the formula for factoring a difference of two squares,
(a −b)(a + b) = a2 −b2.
In the case of the function  it seems that we need a similar formula for factoring a difference of two cubes. In other words, we need a formula of the form

A little experimentation leads to a formula that works in the blank:
(a −b)(a2 + ab + b2) = a3 −b3.
Substituting  for a and  we get the following formula:

This motivates our evaluation of f ′ (x):

Taking the limit of the denominator in the last fraction, we get

Thus, as long as x ≠ 0 we have

However, if x = 0 then the limit of the denominator is 0 and the limit of the fraction is undefined. Thus, f is not differentiable at 0.
It is worthwhile to examine more closely why f ′(0) is undefined. Substituting 0 for x in the definition of the derivative we see that

Now, as h →0≠, , and therefore

Of course, this doesn't change our conclusion that f ′(0) is undefined; if a limit is equal to ∞ then the limit is undefined, so f is not differentiable at 0. However, we see more clearly now why f is not differentiable at 0. As h approaches 0, the fraction (f (0 + h)− f (0))/h fails to approach any number because it gets very large. Recall that this fraction represents the slope of the secant line through the points P = (0, f (0)) = (0, 0) and Qh = (0 + h, f (0 + h))  Thus, this secant line slopes up very steeply, and in fact it slopes up more and more steeply as h approaches 0 and Qh approaches P, as you can see in Figure 3.7. Our conclusion is that the secant lines approach the vertical line through P as h approaches 0. There is a line tangent to the graph of f at the point P, but it is the vertical line x = 0, whose slope is undefined. This is therefore another way in which a function f can fail to be differentiable: if the tangent line to the graph at the point (a, f (a)) is vertical, then the slope of the tangent is undefined, and the function is not differentiable at a.
There are a number of variations on the notation that mathematicians use to talk about derivatives. To explain the first of these variations, we begin with the fact that if a


Figure 3.7: The graph of the equation  The secant lines through P and Qh (blue) approach the vertical line x = 0 (red) as h approaches 0.

function f is differentiable at a number a, then we have

Now, suppose we let x = a + h. Then h = x −a, so as x →a≠, h → 0≠. And by the definition of derivative, as h →0≠,

Putting these together, we see that as x →a≠, (f (x)− f (a))/(x −a)→ f ′ (a). In other words, we have proven the following theorem:
Theorem 3.2.3. Suppose f is differentiable at a. Then

This gives us an alternative limit we can use to evaluate f ′ (a). As an application of this alternative limit, we use it to prove our next theorem.
Theorem 3.2.4. If f is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a.
Proof. Suppose f is differentiable at a. In order to prove that f is continuous at a, we must show that limx→a f (x) = f (a). To evaluate this limit, we reexpress it in a way that relates it to our new formula for f ′(a):

This theorem gives us one more way in which a function can fail to be differentiable: if the function is not continuous at some number, then it cannot be differentiable at that number. For example, the function f (x) = ⎿x⏌ is not continuous at any integer, so it is also not differentiable at any integer.
Another notational variation involves replacing the h in the definition of derivative with a different symbol. Consider two quantities x and y that are related by an equation of the form y = f (x). In our definition of f ′(x), the fraction (f (x + h)− f (x))/h represents the slope of the secant line through the points P = (x, f (x)) and Qh = (x + h, f (x + h)). The number h is the amount by which the x-coordinate changes when we go from P to Qh, and it is sometimes denoted △x (the symbol "△" is the Greek uppercase letter delta). This is not a product of two numbers, △ and x; rather, it should be thought of as a single symbol standing for the change in x. Similarly, the numerator f (x + h)− f (x) is the amount by which y changes when we go from P to Qh, so it can be denoted △y. We can therefore write

This way of writing the derivative motivates another notation that is sometimes used for  Thus, we could write

For example, if y = x3, then according to a derivative calculation we did earlier in this section, 
It is important to remember that although dy/dx looks like a fraction, it is not a fraction. If x and y are related by the equation y = f (x), then the notation dy/dx is just another name for f ′(x); it does not denote a fraction in which a number dy is divided by a number dx. However,  is closely related to a fraction: according to the definition of the derivative, it is the limit of the fraction △y/△x as △x approaches 0. The notation dy/dx serves to remind us of the fact that, if △x is small, then the derivative dy/dx, which is the instantaneous rate of change of y with respect to x, is close to the fraction △y/△x, which is the average rate of change of y with respect to x over a small interval.
Another way to write  In this version of the notation, we could think of  " as meaning "the rate of change of . . . with respect to x." Thus,
the rate of change of y with respect to x.
We also call dy/dx the derivative of y with respect to x. When using this notation we will sometimes replace y with the formula expressing y in terms of x. For example, if y = x3 then we could write

More generally, we can say that

Sometimes we use other letters for the independent and dependent variables, in which case we make appropriate adjustments in our derivative notation. For example, if quantities w and t were related by the equation w = g(t), then we would write dw/dt = g′(t).
Example 3.2.5. Find

Solution.

Each of the notations for the derivative that we have introduced has its advantages and disadvantages. The f ′ notation emphasizes the fact that differentiation is an operation on functions: we begin with a function f, and its derivative is another function, f′. The use of functional notation also gives us a convenient way to talk about evaluating the derivative at a particular number: the rate of change of f (x) with respect to x at a particular number x = a can be written f ′(a).
The dy/dx notation does not share these advantages. But if we read "d/dx" as "rate of change with respect to x," then the dy/dx notation expresses the interpretation of the derivative as a rate of change more directly, and it reminds us that the derivative is close to the fraction △y/△x. It also gives us a convenient way of talking about a derivative without having to give a name to the function that we are differentiating. For example, in Example 3.2.5, we found the derivative of the function f (t) = 1/(t2 +1), but we didn't need to introduce a name for this function.
The dy/dx notation is in a sense less explicit than the f ′ notation. It is only appropriate to write dy/dx in a context in which y is related to x by some equation of the form y = f (x). But the notation dy/dx does not explicitly mention the function f, so it is up to the reader to identify from the context the function that relates y to x. The dy/dx notation also does not give us an easy way of talking about evaluating the derivative at a particular value of x. However, we can remedy this last deficiency by introducing a new notational convention: we write dy/dx|x=a to denote the derivative of y with respect to x, with the number a substituted for x. For example, we have already observed that if y = x3 then dy/dx = 3x2. Therefore

One of the reasons there are several different notations for derivatives is that when calculus was being developed, different mathematicians wrote derivatives in different ways. Isaac Newton (1643-1727) and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) are generally given credit for developing calculus independently at around the same time, although they were both building on work of earlier mathematicians. The notation dy/dx was introduced by Leibniz, so it is sometimes called "Leibniz notation" for the derivative.
For Leibniz, dy/dx was actually a fraction; he thought of dx as an "infinitesimal" change in x, with dy being the corresponding infinitesimal change in y. Other mathematicians at the time also talked about infinitesimal numbers, although they did not have a good explanation of what these infinitesimal numbers were. Eventually mathematicians recognized that among the real numbers there are no infinitesimal numbers, and therefore if they wanted to put calculus on a firm logical foundation they would need to change their methods. Through the work of Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) and Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass (1815-1897), the idea of an infinitesimal change in x was replaced with the modern idea of taking the limit as △x approaches 0.2
Newton had a different notation for derivatives that involved putting dots over variables. Although his notation is still sometimes used today, it is not used as widely as Leibniz notation, and we will not use it in this book. The f ′ notation was introduced later, by Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813).

3.3 Derivative Rules
We have not yet fully explained why it is easier to compute the general formula for the rate of change of f (x) with respect to x—that is, to compute the derivative f ′(x)—than it is to compute the rate of change at a particular value of x. The reason is that there are patterns in the relationship between f and f ′ that make it very easy to find the derivatives of many functions without having to work out any limits at all! We investigate these patterns in this section.
To discover these patterns, we will use the same method we used when we studied limits: we will begin by finding the derivatives of the simplest functions, namely constant functions and the identity function, and then we will see what happens to the derivatives of functions when the functions are combined. We will state most of our results using both Leibniz's d/dx notation and Lagrange's f ′ notation.
Theorem 3.3.1. Constant functions and the identity function are differentiable at all numbers, and their derivatives are given by the following formulas:
1.Suppose f is a constant function; that is, there is some number c such that f (x) = c. Then f ′(x) = 0. In other words, 
2.Suppose f is the identity function; that is, f (x) = x. Then f ′(x) = 1. In other words, 
Proof. For part 1, suppose f (x) = c. Then

For part 2, we have

For combinations of functions, we begin with the simplest cases: adding functions, subtracting functions, and multiplying a function by a constant. For a function f and a number c, let cf be the function defined by the equation (c f)(x) = c(f (x)). In other words, cf is just the product of f with the constant function whose constant value is c.
Theorem 3.3.2. Suppose that f and g are functions and c is a number.
1.If f and g are differentiable at a number x, then so is f + g, and
(f + g)′(x) = f ′(x)+ g′(x).
In other words,

2.If f is differentiable at x, then so is cf, and
(c f)′(x) = c(f ′(x)).
In other words,

3.If f and g are differentiable at x, then so is f − g, and
(f − g)′(x) = f ′(x)− g′(x).
In other words,

Proof. To prove part 1, suppose f and g are differentiable at x. According to the definition of derivative,

We need to be careful to interpret the first term in the numerator correctly: to evaluate (f + g)(x + h), we must apply the function f + g to the number x + h. The definition of f + g tells us that (f + g)(x + h) = f (x + h)+ g(x + h). Thus,

Now, we have assumed that f and g are both differentiable at x, which means that the limits of (f (x + h)− f (x))/h and (g(x + h)− g(x))/h are both defined, and their values are:

Therefore by part 1 of Theorem 2.4.2,

Similarly, to prove part 2 we apply the definitions of derivative and cf. Suppose f is differentiable at x. Then

Finally, to prove part 3 we combine parts 1 and 2. We find it more convenient to write the proof of this part in Leibniz notation:

To state Theorem 3.3.2 more informally, it says that to differentiate a sum or difference of two functions, just differentiate the two functions separately. To differentiate a function that has been multiplied by a constant, just leave the constant factor alone and differentiate the function. For example, combining Theorems 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 we can now see that

Notice that we were able to compute this derivative without having to work out a limit. But this is still a fairly simple function. To differentiate more complex functions we need more rules.
Based on Theorem 3.3.2, you might expect the rule for products to be (f g)′(x) = f ′(x)g′(x), but it turns out that this is not correct. To discover the correct rule, we begin with the definition of derivative:

To relate this to f ′(x) and g′(x),we will need to find an algebraic relationship between the numerator of the last fraction and the differences f (x + h) − f (x) and g(x + h )− g(x). There is an algebraic trick that allows us to do that: we subtract and add the same thing in the numerator.

If we assume that f and g are both differentiable at x, then we have

Also, if f is differentiable at x then it is continuous at x, so since limh→0(x + h) = x, we have limh→0 f (x + h) = f (x). Putting it all together, we conclude that

Thus, we have proven the following theorem.
Theorem 3.3.3 (Product Rule). If f and g are differentiable at x, then so is f g, and
(f g)′(x) = f (x)g′(x) + g(x) f ′(x).
In other words,

For the purpose of applying the product rule in examples, it may be useful to restate the rule in words. We can state it as follows:
The derivative of a product of two terms is equal to the first term times the derivative of the second plus the second term times the derivative of the first.
For example, we have seen previously that  and 
The first of these derivatives is defined for all values of x, but the second is defined only for x > 0. Therefore  is differentiable on (0,∞), and

We will use the product rule to derive our next derivative rule. We saw in Theorem 3.3.1 that  It follows by the product rule that

Applying the product rule again we find that

Of course, this agrees with the answer we got for this derivative in the last section. Another application of the product rule gives us

Looking at these examples, you should see a pattern emerging. For n up to 4, we have shown that  Will this pattern continue for larger values of n? Let's see if we can prove it. In the calculations we have done so far, each case was derived from the previous one. This suggests the method of proof that we should try to use to show that the pattern will continue: mathematical induction.
Theorem 3.3.4 (Power Rule). Suppose n is a positive integer, and f (x) = x n. Then f is differentiable at all numbers, and f ′ (x) = nxn−1. In other words, 
Proof. We use mathematical induction.
Base case.3

Induction step. Suppose that n is a positive integer and  Then by the product rule,

Using the theorems we have proven, we can now easily find the derivative of any polynomial. For example,

In the future, we won't write out so many steps when computing the derivative of a polynomial. Imitating this example, you should be able to see that polynomials are differentiable at all numbers, and that you can find the derivative of any polynomial by simply replacing each power of x by its derivative, which is given by the power rule, and replacing the constant term with 0. For example,

To find derivatives of rational functions, we need a rule for quotients:
Theorem 3.3.5 (Quotient Rule). If f and g are differentiable at x and g(x) ≠ 0, then f / g is differentiable at x, and

In other words,

Proof. Suppose that f and g are differentiable at x, and g(x) ≠ 0. First we use the definition to find the derivative of 1 / g(x):

Now we can use this result, together with the product rule, to find the derivative of f (x)/g(x):

Once again, it is probably best to learn this in words:
The derivative of a quotient is equal to the denominator times the derivative of the numerator minus the numerator times the derivative of the denominator, all divided by the denominator squared.
According to the quotient rule, rational functions are differentiable at all numbers except where the denominator is 0. For example,

This derivative is defined for all values of x except 
This may be a good time to make a comment about simplifying answers. We multiplied out the products in the numerator of our last answer because when we did so we were able to combine some terms and simplify the numerator. In fact, the x3 terms canceled out completely when we did this! We didn't bother to multiply out the square in the denominator because it would not have led to any similar simplification. It is a good idea to get in the habit of simplifying your answer as much as you can. We will eventually be using derivatives to solve problems, and it will be much easier to use a derivative if it has been simplified. But notice that simplifying does not merely mean multiplying everything out; it means looking for algebraic steps that will make the answer simpler and easier to use in further calculations.
An interesting consequence of the quotient rule is that the power rule works for negative integer exponents as well:
Theorem 3.3.6. Suppose n is a negative integer, and for all x ≠ 0, f (x) = xn. Then f is differentiable at all x ≠ 0, and f ′(x) = nxn−1. In other words, 
Proof. Since n is a negative integer, n = −m for some positive integer m. Recall that by the definition of negative exponents,

This is undefined when x = 0, but defined for all other values of x. We can now use the power rule for positive exponents and the quotient rule to compute the derivative, which is also defined for all x ≠ 0:

In the last section we showed that

Recall that for a rational number m/n written in lowest terms,  Rewriting the derivatives above using fractional exponents, we have

So the power rule works for the exponents 1/2 and 1/3 too! In fact, it works for 1/n, for every integer n ≥ 2. One way to see this is to imitate the method we used in the last section for the exponents 1/2 and 1/3 (see Exercise 24). But the algebra needed for that approach gets a little messy. A clever change of variables makes it possible to compute these derivatives with very little algebraic work.
Theorem 3.3.7. Suppose n is an integer, n ≥ 2, and f (x) = x1/n. Then f′  (x) = (1/n)x1/n−1. In other words, If n is even then the domain of f ′  is (0,∞), and if n is odd then it is (−∞, 0) ∪ (0,∞).
Proof. We have  so,

If n is even, then this limit makes sense only for x > 0, and we will find its value for all of these values of x. For n odd, we will see that the limit is undefined when x = 0, but we will find its value for all other values of x.
To compute the limit, we make a change of variables. Let  and k =  Then  Raising both sides of this equation to the power n, we get x + h = (y + k)n, and therefore
h = (y + k)n − x = (y + k)n − yn.
For h ≠ 0 we also have k ≠ 0, so we can write

The denominator of the last fraction is beginning to look like the derivative of yn with respect to y. Indeed, as k → 0≠,

And since  as h →0≠, k →0≠. Putting these two limit facts together, we see that if x = 0, then as h →0≠,

Thus,

However, if n is odd and x = 0, then the denominator of the second fraction in (3.1) approaches 0 as h →0≠, and therefore f ′(0) is undefined.
Example 3.3.8. Find

Solution.

We end this section by finding the derivatives of the trigonometric functions. To do this we will need to use the following trigonometric identities:
sin(α + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin β,
cos(α + β) = cos α cos β − sin α sin β.
We assume you have seen these identities before, but if not you can find them in any trigonometry book (or see Exercise 2.3 in Section 1.4). We will also need the following two limits:

Limit (a) is one of the examples we gave in Section 2.1, and we confirmed its value at the end of Section 2.7. To compute limit (b), we use an algebraic trick we have seen before and then apply limit (a):

We are now ready to differentiate the trigonometric functions. We begin with the sine function. Near the end of the calculation, we apply limits (a) and (b).

The derivative of the cosine function is similar:



Table 3.1: The derivatives of the trigonometric functions.

The remaining trigonometric functions are defined in terms of sine and cosine, and their derivatives can now be computed by the quotient rule. For example,

We leave the other three calculations to you (see Exercise 25), and just summarize the results in Table 3.1. And we remind you that the value for limit (a) is only correct when angles are measured in radians, so the derivatives in Table 3.1 are also only correct when angles are measured in radians.

3.4The Chain Rule
We turn now to the differentiation of compositions of functions. The theorem that tells us how to do this is called the chain rule.
Theorem 3.4.1 (Chain Rule). If g is differentiable at x and f is differentiable at g(x), then f ◦ g is differentiable at x, and
(f ◦ g)′(x) = f ′(g(x)) · g′(x).
In other words,

Before proving the theorem, we try it out in a few examples.
Example 3.4.2. Find the derivatives of the following functions.

Solution. We have h = f ◦ g, where f (x) = x7 and g(x) = x2 −5x +2. By results from the last section, f ′(x) = 7x6 and g′(x) = 2x −5. Therefore
h′(x) = f ′(g(x)) · g′ (x) = f ′ (x2 −5x +2) · (2x −5) = 7(x2 −5x +2)6(2x −5).
For the function j, we write j = f ◦ g, where  and g(x) = sec x. Again, the last sections tells us how to differentiate f and g:

Thus,

We can streamline our use of the chain rule by noticing the relationship between the following two equations:

The first equation says that the derivative of f (x) is f ′(x). Replacing x with the expression g(x) on both sides, you might expect that the derivative of f (g(x)) would be f ′(g(x)). The chain rule says that this is part of the answer, but it's not the whole thing. To get the correct answer you need to multiply by the derivative of g(x).
This suggests a quick way to find the derivative of an expression of the form f (g(x)). First, identify the "outer" function f, and find its derivative:

If you now replace x with g(x) on both sides, and multiply by the derivative of g(x) on the right, then the chain rule says that you will have the correct answer for the derivative of f (g(x)):

For example, consider again the function h(x) = (x2 −5x +2)7 from Example 3.4.2. The "outer" function in this case is the "raise to the 7th power" function, whose derivative is given by the equation

Now we replace x with x2 −5x +2 on both sides, and multiply by the derivative of x2 −5x +2 on the right:

Notice that this agrees with the answer we got in Example 3.4.2.
With practice, you will be able to do much of this reasoning in your head. For example, suppose you want to differentiate the function h(x) = sin(1/x). You can just think

and then write

Example 3.4.3. Find the derivatives of the following functions:

Solution. How do you decide which derivative rule to use first when you are differentiating a complicated function? One approach is to imagine that you are computing the value of the function at a particular value of x, and think about what the last step in that computation would be. In the case of the function f, to evaluate f (x) you would first compute (x2 +1) and tan x, then multiply them together, and finally take the square root of the product. Since the last step is taking the square root, the first step in differentiating f is to apply the chain rule, with the square root function as the outer function. We have

so by the chain rule,

To evaluate the remaining derivative, notice that the last step in computing (x2 +1) tan x is to multiply x2 +1 by tan x. This tells us that we should use the product rule:

In the case of the function g, to compute g(x) we would first compute  and tan x and then multiply them together. Since the last step is multiplication, we start with the product rule:

To evaluate the last derivative, we apply the chain rule, with "raising to the power 1/2" as the outer function:

Finally, the last step in evaluating h(x) is taking the square root, so we use this as the outer function in the chain rule:

For the last derivative, we use the chain rule again, with the tangent function as the outer function. Since 

There is another way of writing the chain rule that provides some enlightenment about why the rule is true, and points the way toward a proof. Suppose y = f (g(x)).
If we let u = g(x), then we can write
y = (f ◦ g)(x), y = f (u), u = g(x).
Therefore

Now, the chain rule says that
(f ◦ g)′ (x) = f ′ (g(x)) · g′ (x) = f ′ (u) · g′ (x).
Rewriting all of these derivatives in the Leibniz notation of equation (3.2), we see that the chain rule can be written

For example, consider again the function h(x) = (x2 −5x +2)7 from Example 3.4.2, and let y = h(x). Then we can say that y = u7, where u = x2 −5x +2. Thus,

and therefore by the chain rule,

Thus, we have yet another way of finding the derivative of h.
When written in the form of equation (3.3), the chain rule might seem obvious. But remember that the derivatives in equation (3.3) are not fractions, so we can't prove the chain rule by simply canceling du in the product dy/du · du/dx. The chain rule could be thought of as saying that, although these derivatives are not fractions, they cancel as if they were.
It is not surprising that derivatives act in some ways like fractions, because they are close to fractions. If we let △x stand for a small change in x, then this change will cause a change △u in u because of the equation u = g(x), and then since y = f (u), this change in u will cause a change △y in y. This "chain reaction" of changes explains why the term "chain rule" is an appropriate name for Theorem 3.4.1. The derivatives in equation (3.3) are close to the fractions △y/△x, △y/△u, and △u/△x, and since these really are fractions, we are justified in saying that

A natural approach to proving the chain rule would be to take the limit of both sides of equation (3.4) as △x approaches 0 in the hope that this would lead to equation (3.3).
Unfortunately, there is a small flaw in this approach: even if △x ≠ 0, it is possible that △u = 0. In that case, the fraction △y/△u in equation (3.4) would be undefined. Thus, to turn our idea into a correct proof we must modify equation(3.4) to avoid dividing by △u. In the proof we will give below, we will define a function r, and we will replace the fraction △y/△u in equation (3.4) with r(△u). We will define r so that if △u ≠ 0 then r(△u) = △y/△u. But unlike the expression △y/△u, r(△u) will be defined even if △u = 0.
Proof of Theorem 3.4.1. Suppose that g is differentiable at some number x, and f is differentiable at g(x). Let u = g(x). Then f is differentiable at u, so f ′(u) defined. We now define a function r as follows:

By the definition of derivative, we have

In other words, r is continuous at 0.
If h ≠ 0 then r (h) = (f (u + h)− f (u))/h, and therefore
f (u + h)− f (u) = r (h) · h.       (3.5)
But notice that even if h = 0, equation (3.5) is true, since in that case both sides of the equation are 0. Therefore equation (3.5) holds for all values of h.
Now let △x ≠ 0 represent a small change in x. As described before, this leads to corresponding changes in u and y:
△u = g(x + △x)− g(x),
△y = f (u + △u)− f (u) = f (g(x + △x))− f (g(x)).
We now rewrite △y by plugging in △u for h in equation (3.5):
△y = f (u + △u)− f (u) = r(△u) ·△u.
Dividing by △x, we get

Notice that this is exactly the same as equation (3.4), except that △y/△u has been replaced with r(△u), as suggested earlier.
We want to see what happens now as △x approaches 0. Since g is differentiable at x, it is continuous at x, and therefore

But then since r is continuous at 0, it follows that

Thus,

In other words,
(f ◦ g)′(x) = f ′(g(x)) · g′(x).
One important lesson of the chain rule, when it is written in the form of equation (3.3), is that dy/dx is not the same as dy/du. The derivative dy/dx gives the rate of change of y with respect to x, which tells us how much y changes per unit of change of x. On the other hand, dy/du is equal to the rate of change of y with respect to u, which tells us how much y changes per unit of change of u. These are not the same thing; according to the chain rule, they are related by the equation dy/dx = dy/du · du/dx. Thus, it would be ambiguous to talk about "the derivative of y"; we always need to specify: derivative with respect to which other variable?
In the last section, we saw that the power rule works if the exponent is a positive integer, a negative integer, or a fraction of the form 1/n for an integer n ≥ 2. Using the chain rule, we can see that it works for any nonzero rational exponent.
Theorem 3.4.4. Suppose f (x) = xr, where r is a nonzero rational number. Then f ′(x) = rxr−1.
Since r is rational and r ≠ 0, we can write r = m/n, where n is a positive integer, m is a nonzero integer, and the fraction m/n is reduced to lowest terms. If n is even, then the domain of f ′ is (0,∞). If n is odd and r < 1, then the domain of f ′ is (−∞, 0) ∪(0,∞). And if n is odd and r ≥ 1 then the domain of f ′ is (−∞,∞).
Proof. Since we have already proven the power rule for positive and negative integer exponents, we may as well assume n ≥ 2. By definition,

We have already shown that if n is even then  is differentiable when x > 0, and if n is odd then  is differentiable for all x ≠ 0. For these values of x, we can therefore use the chain rule to find f ′(x):

We leave it to you to check (see Exercise 24) that if n is odd and r > 1 then f ′(0) is also defined, and
f ′(0) = 0 = r · 0r−1.
You might wonder at this point whether the power rule works for irrational exponents as well. For example, if f (x) = xπ, is it the case that f ′(x) = πxπ−1?We answer this question with another question: What does xπ mean? We know that for a rational number m/n, xm/n means  But π is an irrational number, so this definition doesn't apply to xπ. In fact, one has to use methods of calculus to even say what xπ means. Later in this book (see Section 7.4) we will define xr for irrational numbers r, and then we will be able to find the derivatives of these functions. (And if you can't wait to find out the answer: yes, it will turn out that even if r is irrational, .)
Example 3.4.5. Find the derivatives of the following functions:

Solution. You might be tempted to use the quotient rule to compute these derivatives. While that wouldn't be wrong, there is an easier approach. For the function f, it is easier to rewrite "division by 7" as "multiplication by 1/7":

We can also eliminate division from the formula for g(x), by using a negative exponent:

Notice that if f is a function, then its derivative f ′ is also a function. It therefore makes sense to differentiate f ′. As usual, we put a prime after f ′ to denote its derivative. In other words, the derivative of f ′ is written f ′′; it is called the second derivative of f. Similarly, the derivative of f ′′ is called the third derivative of f, and it is denoted f ′′′. It is convenient to have a notation that doesn't require counting a long string of primes, so another notation for the third derivative is f (3). Similarly, if we differentiate f n times, then we get the nth derivative of f, which is denoted f (n). These are called higher-order derivatives of f. For example, if f (x) = x3 then
f ′ (x) = 3x2, f ′ ′′(x) = 6x, f ′′′(x) = f (3)(x) = 6, f (4)(x) = 0, f (5)(x) = 0, . . . .
There is also a version of Leibniz notation for higher-order derivatives. If y = f (x), then dy/dx = f ′ (x). Therefore

Reading across the "numerator" and "denominator" in the last expression, we see two d's and a y in the numerator, and dx twice in the denominator. This suggests the following notation for the second derivative:

Similarly, we write d3y/dx3 for the third derivative of y with respect to x, and, in general, dny/dxn for the nth derivative. As usual, we can also replace y with f (x) in Leibniz notation and write

Rewriting our last example in Leibniz notation, we have

Since derivatives give instantaneous rates of change, d2y/dx2 can be interpreted as the rate of change of dy/dx with respect to x. For example, consider again our discussion in Section 2.1 of a ball thrown up in the air. Recall that the height of the ball, in feet, after t seconds was given by the formula
y = h(t) = 160t −16t2.
The derivative of y with respect to t gives the velocity of the ball, in ft/sec:

For example, we computed before that after 3 seconds, the velocity is

The second derivative of y with respect to t is

This is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time, which is called the acceleration of the ball. It tells us how fast the velocity of the ball is changing. Since v is measured in ft/sec, dv/dt is measured in (ft/sec)/sec, which can also be written ft/sec2. The acceleration of the ball is a constant −32 ft/sec2, which means that the velocity of the ball is decreasing by 32 ft/sec every second. Of course, this is the result of gravity pulling the ball down. We will see other uses of higher-order derivatives later in this book.
We now know how to differentiate any function built up from constants, rational powers of x, and trigonometric functions by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and composition. This is a very wide range of functions, including many functions that come up in applications. We work one more example to illustrate how the rules we have learned allow us to compute complicated derivatives.

3.5Implicit Differentiation
Suppose you remember that  is differentiable for all x ≠ 0, but you don't remember what the derivative is. Here's a clever way you could work out the derivative. We start with the fact that, by definition,  is a number whose cube is x:

Now take the derivative with respect to x of both sides of this equation, using the chain rule on the left:

(Notice that we need to know that  is differentiable to justify the use of the chain rule here. The equation is therefore  correct for all x ≠ 0, but not for x = 0.) We can now solve this equation for 

Of course, this agrees with our previous answer for this derivative.
Let's see what this calculation looks like if we let  On the left below we have reproduced the steps in the calculation above, and on the right we have rewritten each step, substituting y for 

One step on the right may look strange to you: Why did  get rewritten as 3y2.  rather than just 3y2? The reason is that y stands for the expression and, as the corresponding step on the left shows, to find the derivative of you need to use the chain rule.
The lesson here is that in general there is a difference between  and  Of course,

But  only makes sense in a context in which y stands for some expression g(x), and in that case you must use the chain rule to compute the derivative:

Here's another example of this method of finding derivatives. The unit circle x2 + y2 = 1 passes through the point P = (3/5,−4/5). What is the equation of the line tangent to the circle at the point P? The unit circle and the tangent line at P are shown in Figure 3.11.


Figure 3.11: The unit circle (black) and the line tangent to the circle at P = (3/5,−4/5) (red).

One way to answer this question is to solve for y in the equation of the circle:

Thus, the unit circle can be thought of as comprising the graphs of two functions,

The graph of ft is the top half of the circle, and the graph of fb is the bottom half. Both functions have domain [−1, 1], and they are differentiable on the interval (−1, 1).
The point P is on the bottom half of the circle, so we can find the slope of the tangent line by computing f b′ (3/5), using the formula for fb(x) in (3.6). You are asked to do this calculation in Exercise 1.
But there is an easier way. If we let y = fb(x), then there is a way to find dy/dx = f ′ b(x) without having to use the formula for f b(x). For every x ∈ (−1, 1), the point (x, y) is on the bottom half of the unit circle, and therefore it satisfies the equation x2 + y2 = 1. We can now find dy/dx by differentiating both sides of this equation:

In other words, f b′ (x)= −x/fb(x). Thus, the slope of the line tangent to the circle at P is

The equation of the tangent line is therefore y + 4/5 = (3/4)(x −3/5), or equivalently

The functions ft and fb are defined explicitly in (3.6). We say that these functions are defined implicitly by the equation x2 + y2 = 1. The method we used to find dy/dx = f ′ b(x), in which we differentiated both sides of this equation rather than using the explicit formula for fb(x), is therefore called implicit differentiation.
Let's give one more example of implicit differentiation. Consider the graph of the equation
y3 − 4xy = x3 −1, (3.8)
which is the curve shown in Figure 3.12 (part of it is black and part is blue). It is easy to verify that this curve passes through the point (1, 2). We will find the equation of the line tangent to the curve at this point (shown in red in Figure 3.12).
Unfortunately, our curve is not the graph of a function, because it fails the vertical line test. For example, the vertical line x = 1 crosses the curve three times, at the points (1, 2), (1, 0), and (1,−2). However, as with the unit circle, it is possible to break the curve into pieces, each of which is the graph of a function. For example, the part of the curve that is colored blue in Figure 3.12 passes the vertical line test, so it is the graph of some function f. And since the point (1, 2) lies on this part of the curve, f (1) = 2. It can be shown, by methods that go beyond the scope of this book, that f is differentiable at 1. We won't worry about this detail here; we'll simply assume that f is differentiable at 1 and find the value of f ′(1). This will tell us the slope of the tangent line at (1, 2).


Figure 3.12: The graph of y3 −4xy = x3 −1 (black and blue) and the line tangent to this curve at (1, 2) (red).

One way to proceed would be to solve for y in equation (3.8) in order to find a formula for f (x). But this equation is very hard to solve, and the formula for f (x) would be very complicated. A better idea is to use the fact that if y = f (x), then x and y satisfy equation (3.8). We can therefore use implicit differentiation to find 4

The slope of the tangent line is therefore

and the equation of the tangent line is y −2 = (11/8)(x −1), or

The key step in all of our examples of implicit differentiation was to take the derivative of both sides of an equation. It is worthwhile to pause, therefore, to discuss when it is correct to do this.
In Figure 3.13a, the blue and red curves are the graphs of two functions, f and g. The curves cross at x = a, so f (a) = g(a). But the tangent lines to the curves at the crossing point have different slopes, so f ′(a) ≠ g′(a). This illustrates that it is possible to have f (a) = g(a), but f ′(a) ≠ g′(a). Does that mean that if you take the derivative of both sides of a true equation, you can end up with a false equation?


Figure 3.13: In both figures, the blue and red curves are the graphs of y = f (x) and y = g(x), and tangent lines are drawn in black. In (a), the tangent lines to the two curves at x = a have different slopes, so f ′(a) ≠ g′(a). In (b), the curves have the same tangent line at x = a, so f ′(a) = g′(a).

Let's look more closely at how it can happen that f (a) = g(a) but f ′(a) ≠ g′(a). According to the definition of derivative,

Thus, the value of f ′(a) depends not only on f (a), but also on f (a + h) for h close to 0. In Figure 3.13a, we have f (a) = g(a), but it is not the case that f (a + h) = g(a + h) for h close to 0. This explains why f ′(a) ≠ g′(a).
Now consider the functions f and g whose graphs are shown in Figure 3.13b. In this case, not only do f (x) and g(x) agree at x = a, they agree at all values of x in the interval (a −d, a + d), for some number d > 0. It follows that f (a + h) = g(a + h) for h close to 0 (more precisely, for |h| < d), and therefore f ′(a) = g′(a). You can see this in the figure, because the tangent lines to the two curves at x = a are the same. This motivates our next theorem.
Theorem 3.5.1. Suppose that I is an open interval, and for every number x in the interval I, f (x) = g(x). Then for every number x in I, f ′(x) = g′(x), where we interpret this equation to mean that either both derivatives are defined and they are equal, or both are undefined.
Proof. Consider any number x in the interval I. Since I is an open interval, it does not include its endpoints, so x is not an endpoint of the interval. Therefore for h close to 0, x + h is also in I. It follows that we have not only f (x) = g(x), but also f (x + h) = g(x + h) for all h sufficiently close to 0. Therefore

Thus, if you have an equation between two expressions involving an independent variable x, then it may be correct to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x, but you have to be careful about it. If the equation holds at just a single value of x, then you can't take the derivative of both sides of the equation and expect the resulting equation to be true. But if the equation holds for all values of x in some open interval, then you can differentiate both sides and the resulting equation will be true on the same interval.
To put it more informally, if an equation says that two expressions involving an independent variable x define the same function on some open interval, then you can take the derivative of both sides. But if it merely says that the two expressions have the same numerical value at a particular value of x, then you can't. This is a reflection of the fact that differentiation is an operation on functions, not numbers.
We'd better look back at the examples in which we differentiated both sides of an equation and make sure we did it right! Consider, for example, the unit circle x2+ y2 = 1, and the function fb whose graph is the bottom half of this circle. With y = fb(x), the equation x2 + y2 = 1 is true for all x in the open interval (−1, 1). It is therefore correct to differentiate both sides of the equation, and the resulting equation will also be true for all x in the interval (−1, 1). We leave it to you to check that in our other examples, when we differentiated both sides of an equation, the equation was true throughout some open interval.
It is also possible to find higher-order derivatives of functions that have been defined implicitly. We give one example illustrating this.
Example 3.5.2. It can be shown that the curve 3 y −cos y = 2 sin x, which is shown in Figure 3.14, is the graph of a differentiable function f. Show that f (7π/6) = 0, and find f ′′(7π/6).
Solution. If x = 7π/6 and y = 0 then
3y −cos y = −1 = 2 sin x,
so the curve passes through the point (7π/6, 0). Since the curve is the graph of f, this means that f (7π/6) = 0.
If we let y = f (x), then for every number x, 3y − cos y = 2 sin x. We can therefore use implicit differentiation to find f ′(x) = dy/dx:



Figure 3.14: The graph of the equation 3y −cos y = 2 sin x.


To find f ′′(x) = d2 y/dx2, we just differentiate dy/dx. In the course of this calculation, the term dy/dx shows up. When it does, we simply fill in the formula for it that we have already computed:

Finally, we evaluate at the requested point:

1The smoot and the millihelen are real, if somewhat fanciful, units. The smoot is a measure of length; it is 5 feet, 7 inches, which was the height of Oliver R. Smoot in 1958, when he was used by his MIT Lamba Chi Alpha brothers to measure the length of the Harvard Bridge. The millihelen, named for Helen of Troy, is a measure of beauty; it is the amount of beauty needed to launch one ship.
2Muchmore recently, Abraham Robinson (1918-1974) showed that the set of real numbers could be enlarged to form a number system called the hyperreal numbers that includes infinitesimals. Robinson showed that the hyperreal numbers could be used to justify methods similar to those used at the time of Newton and Leibniz. His approach to calculus is known as nonstandard analysis.
3There is a small technical point that should be mentioned here. Some books do not assign any meaning to the expression 00. In calculus, it is best to follow the convention that 00 = 1, so that the equation x0 = 1 is true for all values of x.
4In the last step of our computation of dy/dx, we divide by 3y2 −4x. This step would not be correct at a point on the curve where 3y2 −4x = 0, and our formula for dy/dx would be undefined at such a point. However, as long as we use our formula only at points where 3y2 −4x = 0, the formula will give the correct value for dy/dx. Similar restrictions apply to our other derivative calculations in this section.

Applications of Differentiation
4.1 Related Rates
Imagine that a leaking oil well is creating a circular oil slick on the surface of the ocean. As the oil continues to leak, the area of the oil slick is increasing at a steady rate of 1000 square meters per hour. How fast is the radius of the slick increasing when the radius is 500 meters?
We will be solving word problems in this section, so it might be helpful to begin with some general advice about how to approach word problems. The most important thing to understand about word problems is that there are two phases to the solution of any word problem. In the first phase, you must translate the English of the problem into mathematical language. This turns the word problem into a mathematical problem. In the second phase, you solve this mathematical problem. The most common mistake students make when solving word problems is to try to begin phase two of the problem before they have completed phase one. When you are starting to work on a word problem, you shouldn't even be thinking about solving the problem. Your first task is simply to understand what the problem is asking, and to do this you must translate the English into mathematical language. It is only when you have translated the entire problem into mathematical language that you should begin to think about solving the problem.
Turning now to the problem in the first paragraph of this section, let's translate the problem into mathematical language. We begin by identifying the quantities relevant to the problem and introducing notation for those quantities. Clearly the problem concerns the area and radius of the oil slick, so we will need letters to stand for these quantities. A natural choice is to let A stand for the area, and r the radius. But our notation must be precise, so we need to specify the units in which these quantities are measured. Looking back at the problem, we see that it will be most convenient to measure the radius in meters and the area in square meters, so we define:
r = radius of oil slick, in m,
A = area of oil slick, in m2.
But there is a third quantity relevant to this problem. The problem says that r and A are changing over time, and it talks about the rates at which they are changing as time passes. So time is another relevant variable:
t = time since beginning of oil spill, in hr.
Since r and A are changing over time, we can think of each of them as being given by some function of t:
r = f (t), A= g(t).
This means that r and A are dependent variables in this problem, and t is the independent variable. In a real-world problem like this it is reasonable to assume that f and g are differentiable at all values of t. Their derivatives give the rates at which r and A are changing.
Now that we have our notation fixed, we are ready to begin translating the problem from English into math. We will go through the problem sentence by sentence (or even word by word, if necessary) and translate it into mathematical language.
The first sentence says, "Imagine that a leaking oil well is creating a circular oil slick on the surface of the ocean." The crucial word in this sentence is "circular." Since the problem concerns the area and radius of the oil spill, surely the formula for the area of a circle will be relevant. Let's write it down:
A = πr 2.
We can now move on to the next sentence: "As the oil continues to leak, the area of the oil slick is increasing at a steady rate of 1000 square meters per hour." This sentence tells us how fast the area A is changing; in other words, it is telling us dA/dt, which is measured in m2/hr:

But there is one word in this sentence that we haven't included in our translation:"steady." What does it mean for A to increase "at a steady rate"? It means that the rate of increase is the same at all times. So a more careful statement of the information in this sentence is:

Well, maybe not all t—we hope the oil leak will be stopped eventually! But the problem is concerned with a certain period of time—a certain open interval of values of t—during which the oil is leaking. When we say "for all t," we mean for all values of t in the interval of time under discussion in the problem.1
Now we can move on to the last sentence of the problem: "How fast is the radius of the slick increasing"—translation: What is dr/dt?—"when the radius is 500 meters"—translation: when r = 500.
Let's summarize our translation of the problem into mathematical language. Note that some sentences in the problem, such as the description of the steady rate of increase of the area of the oil slick, are about what is true at all times, whereas the last sentence is about a particular time, namely the moment in time when r = 500. This distinction will be important in our solution of the problem, so we include it in our summary.

For all values of t:
For a particular value of t:

A = πr 2
r = 500





We have put the equation A = πr 2 in the first column because as the oil slick grows, it remains circular, so this formula for the area of the slick holds at all times.
Now that we have translated the problem into mathematical language, we are ready to begin thinking about how to solve it. We know dA/dt, and we need to find dr/dt. Can we find a relationship between these rates of change? Well, we have a relationship between A and r, namely A = πr2. Taking the derivative of both sides of this equation with respect to t will give us a relationship between dA/dt and dr/dt:

Recall that, as we saw in Section 3.5, if an equation is true for all values of t in some open interval, then you can take the derivative with respect to t of both sides of the equation and the resulting equation will be true for the same range of values of t. Since equation (4.1) is true for all values of t (in the time period under consideration in the problem), equation (4.2) is also true for all values of t.
We can now fill in the given values of dA/dt and r, and solve for dr/dt. Once we fill in r = 500, we will no longer have an equation true at all times; the equation will be true only at the moment when r = 500:
For all t, 

Thus, when r = 500, the radius is increasing at a rate of 1/π ≈ 0.32 m/hr.
The key idea in solving this problem was to find a relationship between the rates of change of A and r. This is therefore called a related rates problem. We found this relationship between rates of change by taking the derivative of both sides of the equation A = πr 2, which gives a relationship between A and r. And to justify this step it was important that the equation A = πr 2 was true for all values of t. This means that it was important not to use the value r = 500 until after the differentiation step. You might have been tempted to plug in r = 500 in the equation A = πr 2 right away, to get A = π(5002) = 250000π. This isn't wrong, but it is only correct at a single moment, not for all t. It would therefore not be correct to differentiate both sides of this equation.
In the rest of this section, we'll give several more examples of related rates problems. In each case, we will take the derivative of both sides of an equation to get a relationship between rates of change. And in each case, it will be crucial to make sure this equation is true for all values of t in some open interval. We will therefore need to make sure we don't use any information that is true at only one time before we do the differentiation step.
Example 4.1.1. A lighthouse is 2 miles west of a shoreline that runs north to south. The beam of the lighthouse rotates counterclockwise at a steady speed of 4 revolutions per minute. How fast is the point where the beam hits the shore moving when it is 3 miles north of the light?
Solution. It is often helpful in word problems to draw a diagram. The situation in this example is illustrated in Figure 4.1. The lighthouse is at the point L, 2 miles due west of the point Q on the shoreline. The beam of the lighthouse hits the shore at the point P. Ultimately, we will be interested in the moment when the distance PQ is 3 miles, but this distance is changing over time, and we will need to work out equations that are true at all times, not just at this particular moment. So in the figure we label this distance x, not 3. The problem says that the beam rotates counterclockwise at 4 revolutions per minute. This sounds like a rate of change, but the rate of change of what quantity?


Figure 4.1: Lighthouse and shoreline in Example 4.1.1.

The most natural choice is the angle θ, measured in radians. Since the beam is rotating counterclockwise, θ is increasing, and since one revolution is 2π radians, it is increasing at a steady rate of 8π radians per minute. Thus, if t represents time, measured in minutes, then

The problem asks how fast the point P is moving when x = 3. If we think of the shoreline as a vertical number line marked off in miles, with the origin at Q, then x represents the position of P on this number line, and the velocity of P, in miles per minute, is dx/dt. Thus, the question we must answer is:

We have now translated the whole problem into mathematical language, so we are ready to start solving it. We know dθ/dt, and we're looking for dx/dt. Imitating the approach we used in the oil slick problem, if we can find an equation relating θ and x and then differentiate both sides of this equation, then we will get a relationship between dθ/dt and dx/dt. Looking at Figure 4.1, the labeling on the right triangle LPQ suggests the relationship

Is this relationship true at all times? Well, there are times when the beam of the lighthouse is pointing out to sea and doesn't hit the shore at all, and at such times x isn't even defined. But the relationship does hold not only at the crucial moment when x = 3, but also for an interval of time that extends both before and after this crucial moment. Thus, there is an open interval of values of t when this equation is true, and this interval includes the moment we are interested in. We can therefore restrict attention to this interval of values of t and take the derivative of both sides of the equation:

When x = 3, the important points L, P, and Q are related as shown in Figure 4.2, where the length of LP comes from the Pythagorean theorem. We can see in this diagram that  and therefore  Filling in all the values we know in equation (4.3), we have:

Thus, the point P is moving north at 52π ≈ 163 miles/min.


Figure 4.2: Triangle LPQ when x = 3.

Example 4.1.2. Water pours out of a conical funnel at a constant rate of 5 cubic inches per minute. The funnel is 12 inches high and the radius at the top is 4 inches. How fast is the depth of the water decreasing when it is 3 inches deep?
Solution. Figure 4.3a shows the funnel with water pouring out of the bottom. The first sentence of the problem says that the volume of water in the funnel is decreasing at a constant rate of 5 in3/min. Thus, if we let V stand for the volume of water in the funnel, in cubic inches, and t for time, in minutes, then

Notice that dV/dt is negative, because the volume is decreasing. The last sentence of the problem asks us to find dh/dt when h = 3, where h is the depth of the water, in inches, as shown in the figure. Thus, we need to find an equation relating V to h.


Figure 4.3: The funnel of Example 4.1.2 is shown in (a). Figure (b) shows the right half of a vertical cross section.

The water is in the shape of a cone, so we should probably use the formula for the volume of a cone. If we let r be the radius of the circular top of the water, in inches, then

This equation relates V to h, but unfortunately it brings in a third variable, r, whose value is also changing over time. If we take the derivative of both sides of equation (4.4), we'll get an equation involving dV/dt, dh/dt, and dr/dt. Since we know neither dh/dt nor dr/dt, we'll have two unknown quantities in this equation, so it seems unlikely that we'll be able to solve for dh/dt. It appears that the inclusion of the extra variable r is a problem.
Fortunately, there is a way to eliminate r from the problem. Figure 4.3b shows the right half of a vertical cross section through the funnel. In this figure, triangles ABO and CDO are similar, and therefore

Thus r = h/3, and substituting this into equation (4.4), we get

Now we are ready to differentiate and then plug in all of the given values:

Thus, when h = 3, the depth of the water is decreasing at a rate of 5/π ≈ 1.6 in/min.
Example 4.1.3. A garage door is made out of a rigid piece of wood 10 feet high. The top of the door moves along horizontal tracks attached to the ceiling of the garage, which is 10 feet above the floor, and the bottom moves along vertical tracks attached to the sides of the door opening. When the door is being closed, a motor pushes the top of the door along its tracks at a constant speed of 2 ft/sec. How fast is the bottom of the door moving when it is 2 feet above the floor? What is the acceleration of the bottom of the door at that moment?
Solution. Figure 4.4 shows a side view of the garage door while it is being closed. We are told that

where x is measured in feet and t is time, measured in seconds. Notice that x is decreasing, so dx/dt is negative. To determine how fast the bottom of the door is moving when it is 2 feet above the floor we must find dy/dt when y = 8.


Figure 4.4: Side view of garage door in Example 4.1.3.

We see in Figure 4.4 that x and y are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse 10, so
for all t, x2 + y2 = 10,
and therefore

When y = 8, we have x2 +82 = 102, and therefore x = 6. Plugging in all the values we know, we find that

Thus, when y = 8, y is increasing at a rate of 3/2 ft/sec. In other words, when the bottom of the door is 2 feet above the floor, it is moving down at a rate of 3/2 = 1.5 ft/sec.
To find the acceleration of the bottom of the door, we must find d2 y/dt2. The equation dy/dt = 3/2 is true at only one instant, so we can't differentiate that equation to find d2 y/dt2. But equation (4.5) is true at all times. Furthermore, we know that for all t, dx/dt = −2, so we can plug in that value before differentiating:

Finally, plugging in known values again when y = 8, we have

Thus, dy/dt is decreasing, so the bottom of the door is slowing down. Its speed is decreasing at a rate of 25/32 ≈ 0.78 ft/sec2.
Example 4.1.4. A heavy weight is to be lifted using a block and tackle. A pulley is attached to the ceiling, 15 feet above the floor, and another pulley is attached to the weight. A 50-foot rope is attached to the weight, and it then runs up to and around the pulley attached to the ceiling, down to and around the pulley attached to the weight, back up to and around the ceiling pulley, and then down to a man. The man holds the end of the rope 3 feet above the floor and walks away from the weight at a constant speed. When he is 9 feet away from the point directly below the pulley and weight, the weight is rising at a rate of 1/2 ft/sec. How fast is it rising when he is 16 feet away? (You may assume that the weight and the pulleys are small enough that their size can be neglected.)
Solution. The situation in this problem is illustrated in Figure 4.5a. We measure all distances in feet, and time in seconds. Since the rope traverses the vertical distance 15− x three times, the fact that the length of the rope is 50 feet means that
d +3(15− x) = 50,
and therefore
d = 5 +3x.
We are told that dy/dt is a constant, but we are not told what this constant is. We also know that when y = 9, dx/dt = 1/2, and we are asked to find dx/dt when y = 16.


Figure 4.5: The block and tackle setup in Example 4.1.4.

We can get a relationship between x and y by noting that the diagonal length of rope is the hypotenuse of the right triangle shown in Figure 4.5b. This gives us the equation y2 +122 = (5+3x)2. Notice that this problem is concerned with two different times, so we can summarize the problem as follows:

As usual, we begin by differentiating the equation relating x and y:

Next, we look at the time when y = 9. We know that at this time, dx/dt = 1/2, and solving for x in the equation y2 +144 = (5+3x)2, we find that x = 10/3. Thus, by equation (4.6) we have:

But dy/dt is a constant, so this is the value of dy/dt when y = 16 as well. The equation y2 +144 = (5+3x)2 tells us that at that time, x = 5, so plugging into equation (4.6) again we get:

Thus, when y = 16, the weight is rising at a rate of 2/3 ≈ 0.67 ft/sec.
Exercises 4.1
1.In Section 3.1, we discussed an electric heater whose power P (measured in watts) is related to the current I flowing through the heater (measured in amps) by the equation P = 25 I 2.

Is it increasing or decreasing?

17.A light bulb is suspended 20 inches above a tabletop, and a horizontal board is positioned between the light bulb and the tabletop. The board has a circular hole, with radius 3 inches, centered below the light bulb, and light passing through this hole creates a circular lighted region on the tabletop (see Figure 4.7). If the board is raised at a rate of 5 in/sec, how fast is the area of the lighted region changing when the board is 10 inches below the light bulb? Is the area increasing or decreasing?

4.2The Mean Value Theorem
The theoretical basis for all of the other applications of derivatives in this chapter will be an important theorem called the mean value theorem. Here's what it says:
Theorem 4.2.1 (Mean Value Theorem). Suppose f is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b). Then there is a number c such that a < c < b and

The mean value theorem is illustrated in Figure 4.10. The black curve is the graph of f, and the blue line is the secant line for this graph that passes through the points


Figure 4.10: The mean value theorem. The red tangent line is parallel to the blue secant line, and therefore (f (b)− f (a))/(b−a) = f ′(c).

(a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)). The slope of this secant line is (f (b)− f (a))/(b−a). The mean value theorem says that for some number c between a and b, the slope of this secant line is the same as the slope of the tangent line to the graph at (c, f (c)). In other words, the tangent line is parallel to the secant line. Such a number c is shown in the figure, where the tangent line is drawn in red. Another way to express the conclusion of the mean value theorem is to say that the average rate of change of f (x) over the interval [a, b] is equal to the instantaneous rate of change at some number c between a and b.
For example, consider the case of the function f (x) = 1/x, on the interval [2, 8]. We already know that f is continuous and differentiable at all numbers except 0, so it is certainly continuous on the interval [2, 8] and differentiable on (2, 8). The derivative is given by the formula f ′(x)= −1/x2. Thus, according to the mean value theorem, there should be a number c between 2 and 8 such that

Let's see if we can find such a number c. Filling in the formula for f (x) on the left side of equation (4.7), we find that

Thus, equation (4.7) says that

Of course, there is a number c between 2 and 8 that satisfies this equation, namely c = 4.
It may not be immediately clear why the mean value theorem is important. But again and again in this chapter we will find that the mean value theorem is just what we need to solve some problem. In particular, if you are studying a function f and you want to know something about the relationship between f (a) and f (b), for two numbers a and b with a < b, it is worthwhile to see what the mean value theorem says about the function f on the interval [a, b]. It is surprising how often this leads to useful information.
For example, what is the value of  Well, 20 > 16, so  is bigger than  But how much bigger? We are asking about the relationship between f (20) and f (16), where  So let's see what the mean value theorem has to say about this function f on the interval [16, 20].
Since f is continuous and differentiable at all positive numbers, it is continuous on [16, 20] and differentiable on (16, 20). The mean value theorem therefore tells us that there is some number c such that 16 < c < 20 and

Since  this means that

or in other words

Thus, the mean value theorem has given us a formula for  Of course, we don't know the value of the number c in this formula. We could solve for c, as we did in our previous example. But this time we're going to show that, even without knowing the value of c, we can learn a lot about  from equation (4.8).
Although we don't know the exact value of c, we do know that 16 < c < 20. Since c > 16, we have  and therefore  Thus, equation (4.8) tells us that

Combining this with the fact that c < 20, we conclude that  and therefore

Thus, we have  Of course, this isn't a terribly important discovery—your calculator will tell you almost instantly that  But who would have guessed that the mean value theorem could tell us the approximate value of When we plug other functions and intervals into the mean value theorem, what other interesting facts will pop out?
To prove the mean value theorem, we will use the nested interval theorem, Theorem 2.8.7.2 Thus, our plan will be to find a nested sequence of closed intervals [u1, v1] = [a, b], [u2, v2], [u3, v3], ... such that limn→∞(vn −un) = 0. Recall that to say that the intervals are nested means that u1 ≤ u2 ≤ u3 ≤· · · and v1 ≥ v2 ≥ v3 ≥· · · . The nested interval theorem will then tell us that there is a unique number c that is in all of the intervals in the nested sequence. If we choose the intervals [un, vn] carefully, then the number c will be the number we need for the mean value theorem.
One of the key steps in our proof will be the following fact:
Lemma 4.2.2. Suppose that f is continuous on [u, v]. Then there are numbers u′ and v′ such that u < u′ < v′ < v, v′ −u′ = (v −u)/3, and

Proof. The lemma is illustrated in Figure 4.11. We begin by dividing the interval [u, v] in thirds. Let d = (v −u)/3, one third of the length of the interval, and let
p = u +d, q= u +2d.
Thus, u < p < q < v, and p −u = q − p = v −q = d = (v −u)/3, as shown in Figure 4.12.


Figure 4.11: Lemma 4.2.2. The two blue secant lines are parallel, and v′ −u′ = (v −u)/3.



Figure 4.12: The points p and q divide the interval [u, v] into three equal pieces.

Let

In other words, m is the slope of the secant line for the interval [u, v], and m1, m2, and m3 are the slopes of the secant lines for the three pieces we have cut this interval into. Notice that

Thus, the slope of the secant line for the interval [u, v] is the average of the slopes of the secant lines for the intervals [u, p], [p, q], and [q, v].
If we are lucky, m2 = m. In that case, we can just let u′ = p and v′ = q, and we will have v′ −u′ = (v −u)/3 and

as required. If we are not so lucky, then either m2 < m or m2 > m.We will only consider the case in which m2 < m; the proof if m2 > m is similar.
So suppose now that m2 < m. If m1 ≤ m and m3 ≤ m, then we have

which is impossible. So either m1 > m or m3 > m. Once again, the proofs for the two cases are similar, so we will only do one of them. Let's assume that m3 > m.
We now have m2 < m < m3. Recall that we are looking for an interval [u′, v′] of length d for which the slope of the secant line is m. We can't let [u′, v′] = [ p, q], because the slope of the secant line for the interval [p, q] is too small, and similarly the slope for the interval [q, v] is too big. The idea for the rest of the proof is to imagine sliding the interval [ p, q] to the right until it coincides with [q, v]. At the beginning of this process the slope of the secant line is too small, and at the end it is too big. So somewhere along the way, it should be just right.
To make this idea precise, we use the intermediate value theorem (Theorem 2.7.6). Define a function g as follows:

Then

and

Also, since f is continuous on [u, v], g is continuous on the interval [p, q] (see Exercise 15). Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, there is some number c such that p < c < q and g(c) = m. According to the definition of g, this means that

Thus, we can complete the proof of the lemma by letting u′ = c and v′ = c +d.
In our proof of the mean value theorem we will compute f ′(c) using a limit that is slightly different from the ones we have used in the past. It will be helpful to work out this derivative calculation in advance:
Lemma 4.2.3. Suppose that f is differentiable at c, and are sequences such that as n→∞, un →c− and vn →c+. Then

Proof. For every n, we have

To simplify our notation, we let

Thus, sn and tn are the slopes of the secant lines for the intervals [un, c] and [c, vn].
Also, notice that since un < c < vn, we have 0 < pn < 1, and

Substituting into equation (4.9), we get

We could say that the slope of the secant line for the interval [un, vn] is a weighted average of the slopes for the intervals [un, c] and [c, vn]. To compute the limit in the lemma, it will be helpful to rearrange equation (4.10) like this:

Recall that in Theorem 3.2.3 we showed that

Since we know that as n →∞, un →c− and vn →c+, it follows that

Thus, the first term on the right-hand side of equation(4.11) approaches f ′(c) as n →∞. Our plan now is to use the squeeze theorem to show that the rest of the right-hand side of that equation approaches 0.
Since 0 < pn < 1, we have
0 ≤ |pn · (tn −sn)| = pn · |tn −sn|≤ |tn −sn|.
Using equations (4.12), we see that

and therefore, by the squeeze theorem,

It follows (by the sequence version of Theorem 2.4.11) that

We can now complete the proof of the lemma by combining equations (4.11), (4.12), and (4.13):

We are now ready to prove the mean value theorem:
Proof of Theorem 4.2.1. We use Lemma 4.2.2 to define a nested sequence of intervals. Let u1 = a and v 1 = b. Since f is continuous on [a, b] = [u1, v1], by the lemma there are numbers u2 and v2 such that u1 < u2 < v2 < v1, v2 −u2 = (v1 −u1)/3 = (b−a)/3, and

Now apply the lemma again to find u3 and v3 so that u2 < u3 < v3 < v2, v3 −u3 = (v2 −u2)/3 = (b−a)/9, and

Continuing in this way, we define a sequence of intervals [un, vn ] such that for every n, vn −un = (b−a)/3n−1,

and un < un+1 < vn+1 < vn.
Since

the nested interval theorem tells us that there is a unique number c such that for all n, un ≤ c ≤ vn. In fact, since un < un+1 ≤ c ≤ vn+1 < vn, we have un < c < vn.
In particular a = u1 < c < v1 = b, and since f is differentiable on (a, b), it follows that f is differentiable at c. The nested interval theorem also asserts that limn→∞ un = limn→∞ vn = c, so we can say that as n →∞, un →c− and vn →c+.
We can now complete the proof by applying Lemma 4.2.3:

We close this section by considering one more example. Let f (x) = |x| and [a, b] = [−2, 2]. Then

But in Section 3.2 we showed that

so there is no number c between 2 and −2 such that f ′(c) = 0. Does this contradict the mean value theorem? No, the statement of the mean value theorem says that it can only be applied if the function f is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b). But in this case f is not differentiable on (−2, 2), because it is not differentiable at 0. This example illustrates that it is important to check that f is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) before applying the mean value theorem; applying the theorem without checking these conditions can lead to incorrect conclusions.

4.3Increasing and Decreasing Functions
We now want to see what the derivative of a function can tell us about the shape of the graph of the function. In this section, we will see how to determine whether the graph goes up or down as we move from left to right. We begin by fixing our terminology. Imitating the terminology we introduced for monotone sequences in Section 2.9, we make the following definition.
Definition 4.3.1. Let f be a function and I an interval contained in the domain of f.
1.We say that f is strictly increasing on I if for all numbers x1, x2 ∈ I, if x1 < x2 then f (x1) < f (x2).
2.We say that f is weakly increasing on I if for all numbers x1, x2 ∈ I, if x1 < x2 then f (x1) ≤ f (x2).
3.We say that f is strictly decreasing on I if for all numbers x1, x2 ∈ I, if x1 < x2 then f (x1) > f (x2).
4.We say that f is weakly decreasing on I if for all numbers x1, x2 ∈ I, if x1 < x2 then f (x1) ≥ f (x2).
5.We say that f is constant on I if for all numbers x1, x2 ∈ I, f (x1) = f (x2).
For example, consider the function f whose graph is shown in Figure 4.13. The domain of f is [p, t). For any two numbers x1 and x2 in the interval [p, q], if x1 < x2 then f (x1) < f (x2); an example of such a pair of numbers is shown in the figure. Therefore f is strictly increasing on the interval [ p, q]. For any numbers x1 and x2 with x1 < x2, notice that f (x1) < f (x2) if and only if the slope of the secant line through (x1, f (x1)) and (x2, f (x2)) is positive. Thus, another way to see that f is strictly increasing on [ p, q] is to note that if you pick two points on the graph whose x-coordinates are in the interval [ p, q], then the secant line through those two points will have positive slope. The blue line in the figure is an example of such a secant line. To put it more informally, to say that f is strictly increasing on [ p, q] means that if a point moves along the graph from x = p to x = q, then as the point moves from left to right, it also moves up.


Figure 4.13: The graph of a function f that is strictly increasing on [p, q], strictly decreasing on [q, r ], constant on [r, s], and strictly increasing on [s, t).

Similarly, f is strictly decreasing on the interval [q, r ], constant on [r, s], and strictly increasing again on [s, t). A point moving along the graph from left to right will go down for q ≤ x ≤ r, then stay at the same level for r ≤ x ≤ s, and then go up again for s ≤ x < t. All secant lines through two points whose x-coordinates are in the interval [q, r ] will have negative slope, secant lines on the interval [r, s] will have slope 0, and secant lines on the interval [s, t) will have positive slope. We could also say that f is weakly decreasing on the interval [q, s], and weakly increasing on [r, t).
This example illustrates that you can see, in the graph of a function, the intervals on which the function is strictly or weakly increasing, strictly or weakly decreasing, or constant. But what if you know a formula for f (x), but don't have the graph of f ? Is there a way to use the formula for f (x) to determine intervals on which f is increasing, decreasing, or constant? Yes, in many cases the derivative of f will tell you the answer:
Theorem 4.3.2. Suppose f is continuous on an interval I and differentiable on the interior of I.
1.If f ′(x) > 0 for all x in the interior of I, then f is strictly increasing on I.
2.If f ′(x) ≥ 0 for all x in the interior of I, then f is weakly increasing on I.
3.If f ′(x) < 0 for all x in the interior of I, then f is strictly decreasing on I.
4.If f ′(x) ≤ 0 for all x in the interior of I, then f is weakly decreasing on I.
5.If f ′(x) = 0 for all x in the interior of I, then f is constant on I.
Proof. The proofs are all very similar, so we will just prove part 1. (We ask you to prove two other parts in Exercises 23 and 24.) We could summarize the idea behind the proof of part 1 of the theorem like this: The assumption that f ′(x) is positive on the interior of I means that every tangent line in this interval has positive slope. According to the mean value theorem, every secant line on the interval I is parallel to one of these tangent lines. Therefore all of these secant lines have positive slope, so f is strictly increasing on I.
Now let's see if we can spell out the details more carefully. Suppose that f ′(x) > 0 for all x in the interior of I. To prove that f is strictly increasing on I, we assume that x1 and x2 are elements of I and x1 < x2. According to Definition 4.3.1, we must prove that f (x1) < f (x2).
We need to compare f (x1) to f (x2), so let's try applying the mean value theorem to f on the interval [x1, x2]. Notice that [x1, x2] ⊆ I, so since f is continuous on I and differentiable on the interior of I, it is continuous on [x1, x2] and differentiable on (x1, x2). Therefore, according to the mean value theorem, there is some number c such that x1 < c < x2 and

But we have assumed that f ′(x) > 0 for all x in the interior of I, so f ′(c) > 0. Since x1 < x2, it follows that
f (x2)− f (x1) = f ′(c)(x2 − x1)> 0,
and therefore f (x1) < f (x2).
For example, consider the function f (x) = x2 −6x +5. Since f is a polynomial, it is continuous at all numbers, so the graph of f is a curve with no breaks in it.
We have f ′(x) = 2x −6 = 2(x −3), so f ′(3) = 0, f ′(x) > 0 for x > 3, and f ′(x) < 0 for x < 3. It follows, by Theorem 4.3.2, that f is strictly decreasing on the interval (−∞, 3] and strictly increasing on [3,∞). Since f ′(3) = 0, the tangent line at the point (3, f (3)) = (3,−4) is horizontal. Thus, the curve "levels off" at x = 3, where the function switches from decreasing to increasing. The graph of f is shown in Figure 4.14.


Figure 4.14: The graph of the function f (x) = x2 −6x +5. The horizontal tangent line at the point (3,−4) is shown in red.

Notice that for every number x, f (3) ≤ f (x). We can verify this by reasoning by cases:
Case 1. x < 3. Since f is strictly decreasing on (−∞, 3], we have f (x) > f (3).
Case 2. x = 3. Of course, in this case f (x) = f (3).
Case 3. x > 3. Since f is strictly increasing on [3,∞), f (3) < f (x).
Thus, in every case, f (3) ≤ f (x), and therefore the point (3,−4) is the lowest point on the graph. We say that −4 is the minimum value of the function f, and f attains its minimum value at 3.
Definition 4.3.3. Suppose that f is a function and a is a number in the domain of f.
1.Suppose that for every x in the domain of f, f (a) ≤ f (x). Then we say that f (a) is the minimum value of f. We also say that f attains its minimum value at a.
2.Suppose that for every x in the domain of f, f (a) ≥ f (x). Then we say that f (a) is the maximum value of f, and f attains its maximum value at a.
Not every function has maximum and minimum values. For example, the function f (x) = x2 −6x +5, whose graph is shown in Figure 4.14, has a minimum value but no maximum value.
Now consider the function g(x) = x |x −4|. In order to apply Theorem 4.3.2 we would like to compute g′(x), but to do this we will need to consider x < 4, x > 4, and x = 4 separately. For x < 4 we have |x −4| = 4− x, so g(x) = x(4− x) = 4x − x2. According to Theorem 3.5.1, if two functions agree on an open interval then their derivatives also agree on that interval, so we can conclude that for all x in the open interval (−∞, 4),

Similarly, for x >4 we have g(x) = x(x −4) = x2 −4x and therefore g′(x) = 2x −4 = 2(x −2). Note that Theorem 3.5.1 applies only to open intervals, so we cannot include x = 4 in either of these calculations. To compute g′(4), we apply the definition of derivative:

Computing the two one-sided limits, we find that

Since the one-sided limits are different, g′(4) is undefined. Putting all of our calculations together, we have

Now that we have found g′(x), we are ready to determine where g′(x) is positive and negative. For x > 4, we see that g′(x) = 2(x −2) > 0. For x < 4 we have g′(x) = 2(2− x), so g′(2) = 0, g′(x) > 0 for x < 2, and g′(x) < 0 for 2 < x < 4. We can summarize our conclusions with the following number line:

We have marked the important x values 2 and 4 below the number line and information about g′(x) above the number line, using the letter "u" to indicate that g′(x) is undefined when x = 4.
Although g is not differentiable at 4, it is continuous everywhere. We can therefore use Theorem 4.3.2 to conclude that g is strictly increasing on (−∞, 2], strictly decreasing on [2, 4], and strictly increasing on [4,∞). The graph of g is shown in Figure 4.15. You can see in the graph that there is no tangent line at the point (4, g(4)) = (4, 0), which explains why g′(4) is undefined. Since g′(2) = 0, the tangent line at the point (2, g(2)) = (2, 4) (shown in red in the figure) is horizontal.


Figure 4.15: The graph of the function g(x) = x|x −4|.

Notice that g does not attain its maximum value at 2. You can show this by checking that, for example, g(5) = 5 > 4 = g(2). But it is more informative to note that

This limit tells us that the right side of the graph of g continues to rise higher and higher, eventually crossing any horizontal line y = M that we might draw. In particular, it must cross the line y = 4, so (2, 4) is not the highest point on the graph. Similarly,

so on the left side of the graph, g(x) goes lower than g(4) = 0. Therefore g does not attain its minimum value at 4. However, the point (2, 4) is higher than all other nearby points on the graph, and (4, 0) is lower than all nearby points. We say that g has a local maximum at 2, and a local minimum at 4. Let us give careful definitions of these terms. First we define a restricted version of maximum and minimum values.
Definition 4.3.4. Suppose f is a function, S is a subset of the domain of f, and a ∈ S.
1.Suppose that for every x ∈ S, f (a) ≤ f (x). Then we say that f (a) is the minimum value of f on S. We also say that f attains its minimum value on the set S at a.
2.Suppose that for every x ∈ S, f (a) ≥ f (x). Then we say that f (a) is the maximum value of f on S, and that f attains its maximum value on the set S at a.
Notice that if S is the entire domain of f, then the minimum and maximum values of f on S are just the minimum and maximum values of f, as defined earlier.
Definition 4.3.5. Suppose f is a function and a is a number in the domain of f.
1.We say that f has a local minimum at a if there is some number d > 0 such that the interval (a −d, a + d) is contained in the domain of f, and f attains its minimum value on (a −d, a +d) at a.
2.We say that f has a local maximum at a if there is some d > 0 such that the interval (a −d, a + d) is contained in the domain of f, and f attains its maximum value on (a −d, a +d) at a.
Looking back at the graph of g in Figure 4.15, we see that g is strictly increasing on (0, 2] and strictly decreasing on [2, 4). Therefore g attains its maximum value on the interval (0, 4) at 2, so g has a local maximum at 2. Similarly, g attains its minimum value on the interval (2, 6) at 4, and therefore g has a local minimum at 4.
The local maximum of g occurs at a point where the derivative is 0, and the local minimum occurs at a point where the derivative is undefined. It turns out that these are instances of a general pattern:
Theorem 4.3.6. Suppose f has a local maximum or minimum at a. Then either f is not differentiable at a or f ′(a) = 0.
Proof. We assume f has a local maximum at a; the proof for local minima is similar. We will assume that f is differentiable at a, and prove that f ′(a) = 0; this will establish that either f is not differentiable at a or f ′(a) = 0. Since f is differentiable at a, we know that

and therefore

We consider these two one-sided limits separately.
By the definition of local maximum, there is some number d > 0 such that the interval (a −d, a + d) is contained in the domain of f, and for all x, if a −d < x < a + d then f (x) ≤ f (a). Thus, for a −d < x < a we have f (x)− f (a) ≤ 0 and x −a < 0, and therefore (f (x)− f (a))/(x −a) ≥ 0. Since weak inequalities are preserved by limits (Corollary 2.8.9), it follows that

Similarly, for a < x < a +d we have (f (x)− f (a))/(x −a) ≤ 0, and therefore

Combining these two inequalities, we conclude that f ′(a) = 0.
The numbers identified in Theorem 4.3.6 are important enough to have a name:
Definition 4.3.7. A number a in the domain of f such that either f ′(a) is undefined or f ′(a) = 0 is called a critical number of f.
Thus, our last theorem says that a local maximum or minimum of a function can occur only at a critical number of the function. How can you tell if a critical number is the location of either a local maximum or a local minimum? The following theorem gives a convenient test.
Theorem 4.3.8 (First Derivative Test). Suppose that f is continuous at a, and for some number d > 0, f is differentiable on the intervals (a −d, a) and (a, a + d).
1.Suppose that for every number x, if a −d < x < a then f ′(x) < 0, and if a < x < a +d then f ′(x) > 0. Then f has a local minimum at a.
2.Suppose that for every number x, if a −d < x < a then f ′(x) > 0, and if a < x < a +d then f ′(x) < 0. Then f has a local maximum at a.
Proof. The proofs of the two parts are similar, so we prove only part 1. Since f is differentiable on the intervals (a −d, a) and (a, a + d), it is also continuous on these intervals. It is also continuous at a, so it is continuous on the interval (a −d, a +d). Since f ′(x) is negative on the interval (a −d, a) and positive on (a, a + d), f is strictly decreasing on (a −d, a] and strictly increasing on [a, a + d). It follows that f attains its minimum value on the interval (a −d, a + d) at a, and therefore f has a local minimum at a.
Example 4.3.9. Let f (x) = 3x4 + 4x3 −6x2 −12x +7. Find all critical numbers of f, and determine whether f has a local maximum or minimum at each of these numbers. Determine intervals on which f is increasing or decreasing. Determine the maximum and minimum values of f, if they exist. Sketch the graph of f.
Solution. To find the critical numbers, we first compute
f ′(x) = 12x3 +12x2 −12x −12 = 12(x3 + x2 − x −1)
= 12(x2(x + 1)−(x +1)) = 12(x + 1)(x2 −1) = 12(x +1)2(x −1).
There are no points where f is not differentiable, but there are two points where the derivative is 0:
f ′(x) = 12(x +1)2(x −1) = 0,
x = −1, 1.
Thus, the only critical numbers are ±1.
Notice that f ′ is continuous at all numbers. It follows, by the intermediate value theorem, that if f ′(x) is negative at one value of x and positive at another, then it must be 0 somewhere in between. In other words, f ′(x) can change sign only at points where it is equal to 0—that is, only at the critical numbers ±1. Thus, f ′(x) must have one sign throughout each of the intervals (−∞,−1), (−1, 1), and (1,∞). We can determine the sign of f ′(x) on each of these intervals by simply checking one number in each interval:
f ′(−2) = −36 < 0, f ′(0) = −12 < 0, f ′(2) = 108 > 0.
Thus, f ′(x) is negative on the intervals (−∞,−1) and (−1, 1), and positive on (1,∞). We summarize our findings as follows:

To sketch the graph of f, we first plot the points at x = ±1:
f (−1) = 12, f (1)= −4.
The graph has horizontal tangent lines at the points (−1, 12) and (1,−4). Also, f is strictly decreasing on the intervals (−∞,−1] and [−1, 1], and strictly increasing on [1,∞). Thus, the shape of the graph of f must be as shown in Figure 4.16.


Figure 4.16: The graph of f (x) = 3x4 + 4x3 −6x2 −12x +7.

By the first derivative test, f has a local minimum at 1. But f is strictly decreasing on both of the intervals (−∞,−1] and [−1, 1], so f has neither a local minimum nor a local maximum at −1. In fact, although the tangent line at x = −1 has slope 0, all secant lines in the interval (−∞, 1] have negative slope, and therefore f is strictly decreasing on (−∞, 1]. From the graph, it is clear that the local minimum at x = 1 is actually the lowest point on the entire graph, so the minimum value of f is −4, and it is attained at 1. The function f has no maximum value.
Example 4.3.9 illustrates that a function need not have a local maximum or minimum at a critical number. In the example, the critical number x = −1 turned out to be neither a local maximum nor a local minimum, but merely the location of a "wiggle" in the graph of f. The only reason we detected the wiggle in this case is that the wiggle was large enough that the curve leveled off at this point, creating a critical number. A smaller wiggle might have gone undetected by the methods we have used in this section. And this raises the question of whether there might be other wiggles that we missed. In the next section, we will develop methods for detecting such wiggles.
But before discussing the detection of wiggles, we give one more example to illustrate that the methods of this section can also be useful in the study of sequences.
Example 4.3.10. Determine whether the sequence  given by the formula

is monotone.
Solution. The methods we have discussed in this section do not apply directly to the sequence  The reason is that it would make no sense to compute the derivative of an with respect to n; since n stands for an integer, it cannot change by an amount △n that approaches 0.
However, we can use derivatives to study the function

on the interval [1,∞). The function f is continuous on this interval, and its derivative is

Therefore f is strictly increasing on the interval [1,∞). This means that for any real numbers x1 and x2 with 1 ≤ x1 < x2, f (x1) < f (x2). In particular, for every positive integer n, f (n) < f (n +1). But f (n) = an, so this means that for every positive integer n, an < an+1. In other words, (an)∞n=1 is strictly increasing.

4.4 Concavity
Consider the function f whose graph is shown in Figure 4.18. If this graph were a road and you were driving on this road from left to right, then you would have the steering wheel turned to the left from x = a to x = b, and to the right from x = b to x = c. We say that f is concave up on the interval [a, b], and concave down on [b, c].


Figure 4.18: The graph of a function f that is concave up on [a, b] and concave down on [b, c].

While this description gives a good intuitive idea of the difference between concave up and concave down, it is not precise enough to be useful in mathematical reasoning. To formulate a precise definition, we consider triples of points in each interval. As you can see in Figure 4.19, if we choose a triple of points on the graph of f with x-coordinates in the interval [a, b], then the intermediate point is below the secant line through the other two points, whereas in the interval [b, c], the intermediate point is above the secant line through the other two points. We base our precise definition of concavity on this distinction.


Figure 4.19: Triples of points on the graph of f.

Definition 4.4.1. Let f be a function and I an interval contained in the domain of f.
1.We say that f is concave up on I if for all numbers x1, x2, x3 ∈ I, if x1 < x2 < x3 then the point (x2, f (x2)) is below the secant line through the points (x1, f (x1)) and (x3, f (x3)).
2.We say that f is concave down on I if for all numbers x1, x2, x3 ∈ I, if x1 < x2 < x3 then the point (x2, f (x2)) is above the secant line through the points (x1, f (x1)) and (x3, f (x3)).
Let's work this out algebraically. Suppose x1 < x2 < x3, and let be the secant line through the points (x1, f (x1)) and (x3, f (x3)). The slope of is

Since passes through the point (x1, f (x1)), we can write the equation of in the point-slope form y − f (x1) = m(x − x1), or equivalently

Therefore passes through the point (x2, f (x1)+m(x2 − x1)).
Now suppose that the point (x2, f (x2)) is below . This means that f (x2) < f (x1)+m(x2 − x1), and rearranging we get

We could have used the point (x3, f (x3)), instead of (x1, f (x1)), when writing the equation of in point-slope form. This would lead to the inequality f (x2) < f (x3)+ m(x2 − x3), which is equivalent to

Combining inequalities (4.14) and (4.15), we conclude that

If we define

then m L is the slope of the secant line through the leftmost pair of points, (x1, f (x1)) and (x2, f (x2)), and m R is the slope of the secant line through the rightmost points, (x2, f (x2)) and (x3, f (x3)). What we have shown is that if (x2, f (x2)) is below, then mL < mR. This should be evident in Figure 4.19a.
Similar reasoning shows that if (x2, f (x2)) is above then mL > mR, and if (x2, f (x2)) lies on then m L = m R. Thus, we have found an algebraic test to determine the position of (x2, f (x2)) relative to . This gives us an alternative way to state the meaning of concavity.
Theorem 4.4.2. Suppose that f is a function and I is an interval contained in the domain of f.
1.The function f is concave up on I if and only if for all numbers x1, x2, x3 ∈ I, if x1 < x2 < x3 then

2.The function f is concave down on I if and only if for all numbers x1, x2, x3 ∈ I, if x1 < x2 < x3 then

Theorem 4.4.2 gives us a way to relate concavity to slopes of secant lines. Combining this with the mean value theorem, which relates slopes of secant lines to slopes of tangent lines, we should be able to relate concavity to derivatives. In fact, it turns out that the second derivative of f can be used to determine the concavity of f.
Theorem 4.4.3. Suppose f is continuous on an interval I and twice differentiable on the interior of I; in other words, for all x in the interior of I, f ′′(x) is defined.
1.If f ′′(x) > 0 for all x in the interior of I, then f is concave up on I.
2.If f ′′(x) < 0 for all x in the interior of I, then f is concave down on I.
Proof. For part 1, suppose that f ′′(x) > 0 for all x in the interior of I. Then by the results of the last section, f ′ is strictly increasing on the interior of I. Now consider three numbers x1, x2, x3 ∈ I with x1 < x2 < x3. Since [x1, x2] ⊆ I, we know that f is continuous on [x1, x2] and differentiable on (x1, x2), so by the mean value theorem, there is a number c1 such that x1 < c1 < x2 and

Similarly, by the mean value theorem there is a number c2 such that x2 < c2 < x3 and

But now since f ′ is strictly increasing on the interior of I and x1 < c1 < x2 < c2 < x3, we have f ′(c1) < f ′(c2), and therefore

It follows, by Theorem 4.4.2, that f is concave up on I. The proof of part 2 is similar.
For example, consider again the function f (x) = 3x4 +4x3 −6x2 −12x +7 from Example 4.3.9. We can gain a better understanding of the graph of f by determining intervals on which it is concave up and concave down. We begin by computing f ′′(x) and determining when it is 0. Since we showed in Example 4.3.9 that f ′(x) = 12(x3 + x2 − x −1), we have
f ′′(x) = 12(3x2 +2x −1) = 12(x +1)(3x −1),
and therefore f ′′(x) = 0 when x = −1 or x = 1/3. Since f ′′ is continuous everywhere, these are the only points where f ′′(x) can change sign. Thus, as before, we can determine the sign of f ′′(x) on each of the intervals (−∞,−1), (−1, 1/3), and (1/3,∞) by testing one sample point in each interval:
f ′′(−2) = 84 > 0, f ′′(0) = −12 < 0, f ′′(1) = 48 > 0.
The sign of f ′′(x) can therefore be summarized as follows:

Thus, f is concave up on the interval (−∞,−1], concave down on [−1, 1/3], and concave up on [1/3,∞).
At the end of the last section, we noted that the graph of f had a "wiggle" in it at the point (−1, 12). We can now say more about the nature of this wiggle: this is a point where the concavity of f changes. Such a point is called an inflection point.
Definition 4.4.4. A point (a, f (a)) on the graph of a function f is called an inflection point if there is a number d > 0 such that either f is concave up on (a −d, a] and concave down on [a, a +d), or f is concave down on (a −d, a] and concave up on [a, a + d).
In fact, we have discovered that there is a second inflection point on the graph of f, at x = 1/3. Since
f (1/3) = 68/27 ≈ 2.52,
the coordinates of the second inflection point are (1/3, 68/27). The graph of f, with the inflection points and minimum point marked, is shown in Figure 4.20.


Figure 4.20: The graph of y = 3x4 + 4x3 −6x2 −12x +7.

Example 4.4.5. Sketch the graph of the function f (x) = −x3/3− x2 + 3x +2.
Solution. We begin by computing the first two derivatives of f :
f ′(x)= −x2 −2x +3 = −(x +3)(x −1),
f ′′(x)= −2x −2 = −2(x +1).
Notice that f, f ′, and f ′′ are all continuous everywhere. Clearly f ′(x) = 0 when x = −3, 1, and f ′′(x) = 0 when x = −1. Next, we test sample points:

We can summarize what we have learned on a number line:

Clearly the most important points to plot are the points with x = −3,−1, 1, so we compute:

We can now draw the following conclusions: From the sign of f ′(x), we see that f is strictly decreasing on the interval (−∞,−3], strictly increasing on the interval [−3, 1], and strictly decreasing on [1,∞),and f has a local minimum at −3 and a local maximum at 1. The tangent lines at the points (−3,−7) and (1, 11/3) are horizontal. From the sign of f ′′(x), we see that f is concave up on (−∞,−1] and concave down on [−1,∞), so the point (−1,−5/3) is an inflection point. For the purpose of getting the shape of each segment of the graph right when we draw the graph, it might be best to summarize our conclusions like this:
(−∞,−3]: strictly decreasing, concave up.
[−3,−1]: strictly increasing, concave up.
[−1, 1]: strictly increasing, concave down.
[1,∞): strictly decreasing, concave down.
The graph of f is shown in Figure 4.21.
In addition to helping us determine concavity, the second derivative of a function can also help us classify critical numbers as local maxima or minima:
Theorem 4.4.6 (Second Derivative Test). Suppose that f ′(a) = 0.
1.If f ′′(a) > 0, then f has a local minimum at a.
2.If f ′′(a) < 0, then f has a local maximum at a.
Proof. We will only prove part 1, since, as usual, the two parts are very similar. Suppose f ′′(a) > 0. Applying Theorem 3.2.3 and using the fact that f ′(a) = 0, we have

Since f ′′(a) > 0, by Theorem 2.8.8 there must be some number δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ then f ′(x)/(x −a) > 0.


Figure 4.21: The graph of y = −x3/3− x2 + 3x +2.

Now, suppose x is any number such that a −δ < x < a. Then x −a < 0, and multiplying the inequality f ′(x)/(x −a) > 0 by the negative number x −a we conclude that f ′(x) < 0. Similarly, for a < x < a + δ we conclude that f ′(x) > 0. But this means we can now apply the first derivative test (Theorem 4.3.8) to conclude that f has a local minimum at a.
The proof of Theorem 4.4.6 actually shows a little bit more than what the theorem says. If f ′(a) = 0 and f ′′(a) > 0, then the proof shows that there is a positive number δ such that for every number x, if a −δ < x < a then f ′(x) < 0, and if a < x < a +δ then f ′(x) > 0. Therefore f is decreasing on (a −δ, a] and increasing on [a, a + δ). Similarly, if f ′(a) = 0 and f ′′(a) < 0 then there is a positive number δ such that f is increasing on (a −δ, a] and decreasing on [a, a + δ).
Example 4.4.7. Sketch the graph of the function

Solution. We use the quotient rule to compute f ′(x) and f ′′(x). It is worthwhile to simplify both as much as possible:


Since x2 +1 is never 0, all three of f, f ′, and f ′′ are defined and continuous everywhere. We have f ′(x) = 0 at x = ±1, and f ′′(x) = 0 at x = 0, Testing sample points, we find that the signs of f ′(x) and f ′′(x) can be summarized as follows:

We have five important points to plot: inflection points at  a local minimum at x = −1, and a local maximum at x = 1. We plug into the formula for f (x) to find the y-coordinates of these points:

Plotting these points, and filling in the shape of the graph using the signs of f ′(x) and f ′′(x), we get the graph shown in Figure 4.22.
We know that f has a local minimum at −1, but is f (−1) = 0 the minimum value of f on its entire domain? We can't tell yet. We know that on the interval f is strictly decreasing and concave up. If we extend the curve in Figure 4.22 further to the right, how low will it go? If it eventually goes below 0, then 0 will not be the minimum value of f. But if it never goes below 0, then 0 is the minimum value of f, attained at x = −1. Similarly, we can't tell whether f (1) = 2 is the maximum value of f on its entire domain until we investigate how high the curve goes if we extend it further to the left. The question marks in Figure 4.22 indicate that we still have more issues to resolve at the left and right ends of the graph.


Figure 4.22: The middle part of the graph of y = (x +1)2/(x2 +1).


Figure 4.23: The graph of y = (x +1)2/(x2 +1). The dashed line is the asymptote y = 1.
To resolve these issues, we need to know what happens to f (x) when x gets very large or very small, so we compute the limits of f (x) as x →±∞. In fact, both computations are the same:

Thus, the line y = 1 is a horizontal asymptote, and the graph approaches this asymptote at both ends. In Figure 4.23 we have added this additional information to the graph. Since f (x) is strictly decreasing on [1,∞) and approaches 1 as x approaches∞, f (x) must be larger than 1 for all positive x. Similarly, f (x) < 1 for x < 0. Therefore 0 is, indeed, the minimum value of f, and 2 is the maximum value.

In this section we use the methods we have developed to graph some more complicated functions. In the previous section, the domain of every function we graphed was R, the set of all real numbers. However, in this section some functions will be undefined at some numbers.
When sketching the graph of a function f, we will generally use the following procedure:
1.Determine the domain of f.
2.Find f ′(x), and use it to determine intervals on which f is increasing or decreasing, and local maximum and minimum points.
3.Find f ′′(x), and use it to determine intervals on which f is concave up or down, and inflection points.
4.Use limits to find all vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
5.Plot all important points, and then sketch the curve.
Since the examples in this section will be more difficult, we add a couple of additional suggestions:
6.Use common sense. If there's something about the shape of the graph you're not sure about, do whatever additional calculations are necessary to resolve your doubts.
7.Check your work: after sketching the graph of a function, make sure your sketch is compatible with all of your calculations. If not, find your mistake and fix it.
As an example of item 6, if you find a number a such that f (a) is defined but f ′(a) is not, you might investigate why the derivative is undefined. Is there a vertical tangent line at x = a? Does the graph have a sudden change of direction at x = a?
As an example of item 7, suppose you determine that f is strictly decreasing on a certain interval, and then you plot two points in that interval and find that the one on the right is higher. Something is wrong! If the function is strictly decreasing on the interval, then the point on the right should be lower. You must have made a mistake somewhere—go back and find it.
Example 4.5.1. Sketch the graph of the function

Solution. Notice that f (x) is undefined when x = ±1. The domain of f is (−∞,−1) ∪ (−1, 1) ∪(1,∞), and f is continuous at all numbers in this domain. The first two derivatives are:

Looking at the numerator and denominator of f ′(x), it is easy to see that for all x = ±1, x2 +1 > 0 and (x2 −1)2 > 0, and therefore f ′(x) < 0. Clearly f ′′(x) = 0 when x = 0, but also f ′′(x) is undefined when x = ±1. On each of the intervals (−∞,−1), (−1, 0), (0, 1), and (1,∞), f ′′ is continuous and nonzero, so it cannot change sign on any of these intervals. We can therefore determine its sign by checking a sample point in each interval. The results are as follows, where we have marked points where a function is undefined with the letter "u":

There are no local maximum or minimum points, but the concavity changes at x = 0,±1. The numbers −1 and 1 are not in the domain of f, so we don't have inflection points at these x-coordinates. But f (0) = 0, so the point (0, 0) is an inflection point.
Since f (x) is undefined at x = ±1, we investigate what happens when x approaches ±1 from either side. As x →1+, x2 −1→0+, and therefore

Similarly, we have

Thus, the vertical lines x = −1 and x = 1 are asymptotes.
To check for horizontal asymptotes, we compute

Thus, the graph will approach the horizontal asymptote y = 0 on both sides.
The graph of f comes in three pieces, one for each of the intervals (−∞,−1), (−1, 1), and (1,∞) that make up the domain of f. We now have enough information about the shape of the graph on each of these intervals to draw a rough sketch. But if we want to make the sketch more accurate, there are a few additional calculations we could do.
On the interval (−∞,−1), we know that f is strictly decreasing and concave down, and the graph approaches the asymptotes y = 0 and x = −1. This tells us the shape of this part of the graph, but since we have not yet evaluated f at any number in this interval, we don't know exactly where to put it on the page. To give us a little more guidance, we could plot a point on this part of the graph:

Similarly, to help with the part of the graph for x > 1 we compute

On the interval (−1, 1), we know there is an inflection point at (0, 0). To make our graph more accurate, we will draw the tangent line at this point. To do this, we compute

Thus, the tangent line is the line y = −x.
To sketch the graph of f, we plot the points we have computed, draw the tangent line at (0, 0) and the asymptotes, and then use these as guides as we fill in the shape of the graph according to the signs of f ′(x) and f ′′(x). The resulting graph is shown in Figure 4.25.
As a check on our work, let's run through everything we have computed and make sure it is reflected in our sketch. The signs of f ′(x) and f ′′(x) tell us that on the interval (−∞,−1), f is strictly decreasing and concave down, on (−1, 0] it is strictly decreasing and concave up, on [0, 1) it is strictly decreasing and concave down, and on (1,∞) it is strictly decreasing and concave up. All of this matches the curve we have drawn. Just to the right of x = 1 the curve goes up very high, which is in agreement with our calculation that limx→1+ f (x)=∞. Similarly, just to the left of 1 the curve goes down very low, to the right of −1 it goes up, and to the left of −1 it goes down, just as all of our limits require. The curve also approaches the line y = 0 at both sides. The curve passes through all the points we computed, and it is tangent to the line y = −x at the origin.


Figure 4.25: The graph of y = x/(x2 −1). The red line is the line y = −x.

Example 4.5.2. Sketch the graph of the function

Solution. Since f (x) is undefined when x = 0, the domain of f is (−∞, 0) ∪(0,∞).
To compute derivatives, it is easiest to rewrite f (x) in the form

We then have

Clearly f ′(2/3) = 0, f ′′(1) = 0, and both f ′(0) and f ′′(0) are undefined. On the intervals between these values the derivatives are continuous and nonzero, and by checking sample points we find that they have the following signs:

We have a local minimum at x = 2/3 and an inflection point at x = 1, so we compute:
f (2/3)= −1/4, f (1) = 0.
Since f (0) is undefined, we examine the behavior of f (x) for x close to 0. Checking the numerator and denominator of f (x) separately, we see that as x →0=, 2x2 −3x +1→1 and x2 →0+. Therefore

so f has a vertical asymptote at x = 0. Also,

so the graph approaches the horizontal asymptote y = 2 on both sides.


Figure 4.26: The graph of y = (2x2 −3x + 1)/x2.

The graph of f comes in two pieces, one for x < 0 and one for x > 0, with a break at x = 0 where f (x) is undefined. We have two points to plot on the right half, a local minimum at (2/3,−1/4) and an inflection point at (1, 0). We choose a point to plot on the left half as well:

Plotting all the points and asymptotes we have computed and then filling in the shape of the graph according to the signs of f ′(x) and f ′′(x), we get the graph in Figure 4.26.
Example 4.5.3. Sketch the graph of the function 
Solution. The domain of g is R, and g is continuous everywhere. To compute the derivatives, it is easiest to write g(x) = x(x +4)1/3. To find g′(x) we apply the product rule and simplify:

We have g′(x) = 0 when x = −3 and g′′(x) = 0 when x = −6. Note also that g′(x) and g′′(x) are undefined when x = −4. Checking sample points in the intervals between these points we get the following results:

We have an inflection point at x = −6 and a local minimum at x = −3, so we will want to plot these points:

Notice that although g′(−4) and g′′(−4) are undefined, g(−4) = 0, and in fact g is continuous at −4. Thus, g is concave down on [−6,−4] and concave up on [−4,∞), and therefore (−4, 0) is another inflection point.
Why is g′(−4) undefined? Let's investigate:

Thus, secant lines through (−4, 0) and nearby points slope down very steeply, and the tangent line at (−4, 0) is vertical. It is easy to check that limx→±∞ g(x)=∞, so there are no horizontal asymptotes. The graph of g is shown in Figure 4.27.


Figure 4.27: The graph of 

Example 4.5.4. Sketch the graph of the function

Solution. In order for h(x) to be defined, we must have x2 + x > 0. To solve this inequality, we first determine when x2 + x = 0:

Next, we check sample points in the intervals (−∞,−1), (−1, 0), and (0,∞):
When x = −2, x2 + x = 2,
When x = −1/2, x2 + x = −1/4,
When x = 1, x2 + x = 2.
The sign of x2 + x can therefore be summarized as follows:

Thus, the domain of h is (−∞,−1) ∪(0,∞).
Next, we compute derivatives:

These functions are continuous and nonzero on the intervals (−∞,−1) and (0,∞), and undefined on [−1, 0]. Their signs are very simple:

Thus, h is strictly decreasing and concave down on (−∞,−1), and strictly increasing and concave down on (0,∞). There are no local maxima, local minima, or inflection points.
To check for asymptotes, we need to compute several limits. For the limit as x →∞, we factor out the highest power of x inside the square root and then write  as x:

For the limit as x approaches−∞, we need to be a little careful. For  so

Thus, we have asymptotes y = 1 on the right and y = −1 on the left.
We should also see what happens as x →−1− and as x →0+. For the first, as x →−1− we have x →−1 and  and therefore

Thus, the line x = −1 is also an asymptote. The limit as x → 0+ is more complicated, because the numerator and denominator of h(x) both approach 0. We need to see if we can cancel something:

So the graph approaches the point (0, 0) from the right. However, this point is not on the graph, since h(0) is undefined.
The graph of h comes in two pieces, one for x < −1 and one for x > 0. It's probably a good idea to plot at least one point in each piece, so we compute:

We plot these points, an open circle at (0, 0), and the asymptotes, and then use these as guides as we draw a curve that is strictly decreasing and concave down on (−∞,−1), and strictly increasing and concave down on (0,∞). The resulting sketch is shown in Figure 4.28.


Figure 4.28: The graph of  The dashed lines are the asymptotes y = ±1 and x = −1.

It appears in the graph that the curve is very steep just to the right of x = 0.
Let's check:

This shows that as we approach 0 from the right along the curve, the curve slopes up more and more steeply, approaching vertical.
We end this section by making an observation about the functions g and h that we graphed in the last two examples. Notice that g and h are both strictly increasing on the rightmost parts of their domains—on the interval [−3,∞) in the case of g, and on the interval (0,∞) in the case of h. Also, notice that limx→∞ g(x)=∞ and limx→∞ h(x) = 1. This may remind you of our study of monotone sequences in Section 2.9. Recall that in that section we showed that if a sequence is weakly increasing, then either it converges or its terms approach∞, and we established an analogous result for weakly decreasing sequences. The behavior of the functions g and h might lead you to ask if something similar is true for functions. The following theorem shows that the answer is yes.
Theorem 4.5.5. Suppose f is a function whose domain contains an interval (a,∞), and let A be the set of all values of f at numbers in this interval; that is, A = { f (x) : x > a} = {y : for some x > a, y = f (x)}.
1.If f is weakly increasing on (a,∞) and A has an upper bound, then limx→∞ f (x) is defined and is equal to the least upper bound of A.
2.If f is weakly increasing on (a,∞) and A does not have an upper bound, then limx→∞ f (x)=∞.
3.If f is weakly decreasing on (a,∞) and A has a lower bound, then limx→∞ f (x) is defined and is equal to the greatest lower bound of A.
4.If f is weakly decreasing on (a,∞) and A does not have a lower bound, then limx→∞ f (x)= −∞.
Proof. The proof is very similar to the proof of Theorem 2.9.5. For part 1, suppose that f is weakly increasing and A has an upper bound. By the completeness of the real numbers (Theorem 2.9.4), we can let L be the least upper bound of A. We now verify that limx→∞ f (x) = L by using the definition of limits.
Suppose ∈ > 0. Since L is the least upper bound of A, L −∈ is not an upper bound, and therefore there must be some number N > a such that f (N) > L −∈. Now consider any x > N. Since f is weakly increasing on (a,∞), f (x) ≥ f (N) > L −∈, and since L is an upper bound for A, f (x) ≤ L. Thus, L −∈ < f (x) ≤ L < L +∈, so | f (x)− L| < ∈.
To prove part 2, suppose that f is weakly increasing on (a,∞) and A does not have an upper bound. Once again, we use the definition of limits to prove that limx→∞ f (x)=∞. Let M be any number. Since A does not have an upper bound, M is not an upper bound for A, so there must be some N > a such that f (N) > M. But then since f is weakly increasing on (a,∞), for every x > N we have f (x) ≥ f (N) > M. This proves that limx→∞ f (x)=∞.
The proofs of parts 3 and 4 are similar.
For a function that is weakly increasing or decreasing on an interval (a, b), there is a similar theorem about limx→b− f (x). And analogous theorems can be proven for limits as x →−∞or x →a+.We ask you to formulate and prove one such theorem in Exercise 16.

4.6Optimization Problems
We now know how to use derivatives to determine the shape of the graph of a function. But why is this important? The answer is that often knowing the shape of the graph of a function can help us solve problems involving that function. For example, in some situations it is important to know how large or small some quantity can be. If this problem can be phrased as asking for the maximum or minimum value of some function, then we can use the methods we have developed to find the answer.
Example 4.6.1. A square sheet of metal is 12 inches on each side. A box with an open top is to be made by cutting equal-sized squares from the corners of the sheet and then folding up the sides, as shown in Figure 4.29. What is the largest possible volume of the box?
Solution. We begin by recalling our advice in Section 4.1 about word problems: before we even think about solving the problem, we need to translate the problem into mathematical language. We begin by introducing notation for the important quantities in the problem. We let x stand for the length of the sides of each of the squares that are to be cut out, in inches, and we let V be the volume of the final box, in cubic inches. As indicated in


Figure 4.29: Making the box in Example 4.6.1. The shaded squares are removed, and then the sides are folded up along the dashed lines.

the figure, the dimensions of the box are (12−2x)×(12−2x)×x, so the volume of the box is given by the formula V = x(12−2x)2 = 4x(x −6)2. We could write this as V = f (x), where f (x) is given by the formula
f (x) = 4x(x −6)2.
What is the domain of f ? Since x is the length of the sides of the cut-out squares, it must be positive. And in order to have some metal left to form the box we must have x < 6. So the domain of f is the open interval (0, 6). We can now rephrase the problem as follows: Find the maximum value of f on the interval (0, 6). Now that we have translated the problem from English into mathematics, we are ready to solve it.
We can solve this problem using the methods we have developed in the previous sections. We begin by finding the derivative and determining where it is positive, negative, and zero. We have

Clearly f ′(x) = 0 when x = 2 (we don't include x = 6 as another critical number, since 6 is not in the domain of f), and checking the sign of f ′(x) on either side of 2 we get the following results:

Thus, f is strictly increasing on the interval (0, 2] and strictly decreasing on [2, 6). It follows that f attains its maximum value at x = 2, and the maximum value is f (2) = 128. Thus, the largest possible volume of the box is 128 in3. The graph of the function f is shown in Figure 4.30.


Figure 4.30: The graph of V = f (x) = 4x(x −6)2, 0 < x < 6.

Problems that ask that some quantity be made as large or as small as possible are called optimization problems. Our strategy for solving optimization problems is to identify the quantity that is to be maximized or minimized, and then find a formula for this quantity in terms of some other quantity that can vary over some interval. In the case of the last example, we had to maximize V, the volume of the box, and we expressed it in terms of x, the length of the sides of the cut-out squares, which could vary over the interval (0, 6). This allows us to rephrase the problem as asking for the maximum or minimum value of some function on some interval, and we can then use our curve-sketching methods to solve this problem.
Example 4.6.2. A farmer wants to fence in a rectangular field with area 200 square meters. One side of the fence is to be made of bricks and will cost $30 per meter. The other three will be made of wood and will cost $10 per meter. What should the dimensions of the field be to minimize the cost?
Solution. The phrase "minimize the cost" identifies this problem as an optimization problem, and tells us that the quantity to be minimized is C, the cost of the fence (in dollars). We want to find the dimensions of the field that will minimize the cost, so we begin by finding a formula for C in terms of the dimensions of the field. Let x and y be the length and width of the field, in meters, and suppose that one of the sides of length x is the one along which the fence will be made of bricks, as shown in Figure 4.31. The cost of this side of the fence will be $30x, and the cost of the other three sides will be $10(x + 2y), so the formula for C is
C = 30x + 10(x + 2y) = 40x +20y.
There is a complication in this example that was not present in our previous example: C has been expressed in terms of two variables, x and y. But there is also one sentence of the problem that we have not yet translated into mathematics.


Figure 4.31: The rectangular field of Example 4.6.2.

The first sentence says that the field must have area 200 square meters, which means that xy = 200. Thus, we can eliminate one of these variables. We have

and therefore

What is the range of possible values of x? Since x is the length of one side of the field, it must be positive. But there is no upper limit on the possible values of x; if x is very large then y = 200/x will be very small, but nothing in the problem rules out a very long, narrow field. Thus, x can take any value in the interval (0,∞). So we can solve our problem by determining where the function

attains its minimum value on the interval (0,∞). We have

Clearly f ′(10) = 0, f ′(x) < 0 when 0 < x < 10, and f ′(x) > 0 for x > 10. Thus, f is strictly decreasing on (0, 10] and strictly increasing on [10,∞), so the minimum value of C = f (x) is attained at x = 10.
It is always a good idea to look over your solution to a word problem to make sure you have answered the question that was asked. In this case, the problem asks for "the dimensions of the field," so we should find y as well. We have

so the field should be 10 meters by 20 meters, with one of the 10 meter sides of the fence being made of brick.
Example 4.6.3. Find the dimensions of the cylinder of greatest volume that can be inscribed in a sphere of radius R.
Solution. We must maximize the volume of the cylinder, which we denote by V. If the radius and height of the cylinder are r and h, as in Figure 4.32a, then the formula for the volume is
V = πr 2h.
Once again we have an extra variable: V has been expressed in terms of two variables, r and h. So we look for a relationship between r and h that we can use to eliminate one of them. The two variables are related because the cylinder must be inscribed in a sphere of radius R. Figure 4.32b shows a vertical cross section through the center of the sphere, and the thick lines in the figure form a right triangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, r 2 + (h/2)2 = R2, and therefore r 2 = R2 −h2/4. Substituting into the formula for V, we get

We have now expressed V in terms of one variable, h. (Note that R is a constant; its value has not been specified, but it is fixed throughout the problem.) Thus, we can write V = f (h), where

What is the domain of f ? It is clear in Figure 4.32a that 0 < h < 2R, and h can take on any value in this range, so the domain of f is the open interval (0, 2R). Thus, to solve the problem we must determine where f attains its maximum value on the interval (0, 2R).


Figure 4.32

We begin by determining where the derivative is 0:

Checking the sign of f ′(h) on either side of this critical number we get the following results:

Thus, f is strictly increasing on the interval (0,  and strictly decreasing on  and therefore V has its largest value when  Since the problem asks for "the dimensions of the cylinder," we also compute the radius. From the equation r 2 = R2 −h2/4 that we derived earlier, we get

Thus, the cylinder of largest volume that can be inscribed in a sphere of radius R has height  and radius 
Example 4.6.4. Two pulleys are attached to the ceiling, 2 feet apart. A rope is 10 feet long, and it has a ring attached to one end and a handle at the other end. The rope is passed over the two pulleys so that the handle hangs down on one side and the ring on the other. Then the handle is passed through the ring and pulled down. As the handle is pulled down, the ring slides up the rope, staying centered between the two pulleys, as shown in Figure 4.33a. How far down below the ceiling can the handle be pulled? You may assume that the pulleys, ring, and handle are small enough that their sizes can be ignored.


Figure 4.33: The rope and pulleys of Example 4.6.4.

Solution. Ignoring the sizes of the pulleys, ring, and handle, we idealize the situation as in Figure 4.33b, where all distances are measured in feet. We are asked to maximize d, the distance from the ceiling to the handle.
Clearly d = x + y, where x is the distance from the ceiling to the ring and y is the length of the part of the rope below the ring. As usual, we look for a relationship between x and y. In this case, the relationship comes from the fact that the total length of the rope is 10 feet, a fact that we have not yet used. The rope comes in four segments: two slanted segments of length  each, the horizontal segment at the top of length 2, and the vertical segment at the bottom of length y. Thus,  and therefore

So the quantity to be maximized is

The smallest possible value of x is x = 0, which would occur if the ring were pushed all the way up to the ceiling. The largest value occurs when the handle is first put through √the ring, at which point y = 0. Setting y = 0 in equation (4.16) we get  and therefore  Thus, we must find the maximum value of the function

on the interval 
We begin by differentiating:

The derivative turns out to be easiest to understand if we rationalize the numerator:

Clearly the denominator is positive for all x in the interval  Looking at the numerator, we see that f ′(x) = 0 when f ′(x) > 0 for 0 < x <  and f ′(x) < 0 for  Thus, f is strictly increasing on  and strictly decreasing on  and the maximum value of f is

In other words, the handle can be pulled down to a point approximately 6.27 feet below the ceiling.

4.7Maxima and Minima on Finite Closed Intervals
Often in optimization problems, the domain of the function whose maximum or minimum value must be found is a finite closed interval. For example, in Example 4.6.4 the domain of f was the interval  Sometimes the domain is a finite interval that is not closed, but we can make it closed by adding in the endpoints. For example, in Example 4.6.1 we had to find the maximum possible volume of a box with dimensions (12−2x)×(12−2x)×x, for 0 < x < 6. We did this by finding the maximum value of the function f (x) = x(12−2x)2 = 4x(x −6)2 on the interval (0, 6). But the formula for f (x) makes sense at x = 0 and x = 6, and these values of x could be thought of as corresponding to "degenerate boxes" in which at least one dimension is 0, and therefore the volume is also 0. If we had included these endpoints, then the domain of f would have been the finite closed interval [0, 6]. In the graph of f in Figure 4.30, the points (0, 0) and (6, 0) would have been black dots instead of open circles, but the rest of the solution would have been the same. Similarly, in Example 4.6.3 we had to maximize the volume of a cylinder, where the volume was given by the function f (h) = π(R2h −h3/4). We took the domain of f to be the interval (0, 2R), but we could have used the interval [0, 2R] instead, with the endpoints representing "degenerate cylinders" with height 0 or radius 0.
Why would we want to include the endpoints in the domains of these functions? The reason is given by the following theorem. We will give a proof of the theorem at the end of this section.
Theorem 4.7.1 (Extreme Value Theorem). Suppose f is continuous on the finite closed interval [a, b]. Then f has a maximum value and a minimum value on [a, b].
We have seen that some functions don't have maximum or minimum values. The extreme value theorem says that this never happens in the case of a continuous function f on a finite closed interval [a, b]. Such a function always has both a maximum value and a minimum value. Where will these values be attained? If the maximum value is not attained at one of the endpoints, then it must occur at a number c in the interior of the interval, and f will then have a local maximum at c. It follows, by Theorem 4.3.6, that c must be a critical number of f; in other words, either f ′(c) is undefined or f ′(c) = 0. Similarly, the minimum value of f must be attained at either an endpoint of the interval or a critical number.
This gives us another method that can be used to find the maximum and minimum values of a continuous function on a finite closed interval. Simply compute the value of the function at the endpoints and at all critical numbers in the interior of the interval. Whichever of these values is largest must be the maximum value of the function on the interval, and whichever value is smallest is the minimum value.
For example, consider again Example 4.6.4, in which we had to find the maximum value of the function

on the interval  showed in the last section that the only critical number for this function in the interval  is  Instead of checking the sign of f ′(x) to the left and right of this number, we could just check the value of the function at this critical number and the endpoints of the interval:

We can now say that the maximum value of f (x) on  is  attained at  and the minimum value is  attained 
We can also use this method to solve the problem in Example 4.6.1. As we observed at the beginning of this section, we could solve that problem by finding the maximum value of the function
f (x) = 4x(x −6)2
on the interval [0, 6]. We showed in the last section that the only critical number for f in the interior of this interval is at x = 2, where the value of the function is f (2) = 128. Since the value at the endpoints is f (0) = f (6) = 0, the maximum value is 128. Similarly, this method could be used to solve the problem in Example 4.6.3; we leave the details to you. Let's try using it in one more example:
Example 4.7.2. A dog is standing at a point D on the shore of a lake. His owner is standing at a point A on the shore 20 meters away, and he throws the dog's favorite ball into the water. The ball lands at a point B, 14 meters from the shore (see Figure 4.39). If the dog can run 6.40 meters per second and swim 0.91 meters per second, what route should the dog take to get to the ball as fast as possible?
Solution. The dog could simply jump into the water and swim in a straight line to the ball. This is the shortest route to the ball, but perhaps not the fastest route, since the dog would be swimming the whole way, and he swims much more slowly than he runs. Another possibility would be to run along the shore to the point A and then swim from there to the ball. This route is longer, but since the dog would be running most of the way, it might be faster. And then there are intermediate possibilities: the dog could run to a point C between D and A and then swim from there. Our task is to determine which of these routes is fastest. (It is clear in Figure 4.39 that it would not be fastest for the dog to jump into the water either to the left of D or to the right of A.)
Suppose the dog runs to a point C that is x meters from A and then swims. If x = 20 then C = D, and we have the first route, in which the dog swims directly from D to B. If x = 0 then C = A and we have the second route, which involves the least swimming.


Figure 4.39: The dog in Example 4.7.2 is at point D, and he wants to get to the ball, which is at point B.

Since any intermediate value of x is also possible, we must consider all values of x in the interval [0, 20].
How long will it take the dog to reach the ball? He will run 20− x meters at a speed of 6.40 m/sec, which will take him (20− x)/6.40 seconds. By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance he has to swim is and at 0.91 m/sec this will take  seconds. Thus, the total time will be

seconds. We must find the minimum value of this function on the interval [0, 20].
We begin by solving for critical numbers:

Since f is continuous on the finite closed interval [0, 20], it must have a minimum value, and this minimum value must occur at either 0, 20, or 2.01.We check the values of the function at these points:
f (0) ≈ 18.51,
f (2.01) ≈ 18.35,
f (20) ≈ 26.83.
Since f (2.01) is the smallest, this is the minimum value of the function. Thus, the dog should run to a point just a bit more than 2 meters short of A, and then jump into the water and swim from there.
By the way, Example 4.7.2 is based on a true story. The dog, whose name is Elvis, actually ran to a point 2.6 meters from A before jumping into the water. Not bad for a dog who didn't have access to a calculator! For more details, see the article "Do Dogs Know Calculus?" by Elvis's owner Timothy Pennings (College Mathematics Journal 34 (2003), pp. 178-182).
We now turn to the proof of the extreme value theorem. Suppose f is a function that is continuous on the interval [a, b]. We must prove that f has both a maximum value and a minimum value. Since the proofs for the maximum and minimum values are similar, we will just prove that f has a maximum value.
If a ≤ u < v ≤ b, then we will say that the interval [u, v] is nonmaximizing if there is some number d ∈ [a, b] such that for every x ∈ [u, v], f (x) < f (d). In other words, the interval [u, v] is nonmaximizing if there is a point (d, f (d)) on the graph of f that is higher than any point on the part of the graph of f with u ≤ x ≤ v, as shown in Figure 4.40. If [u, v] is not nonmaximizing, then we say that it is maximizing.


Figure 4.40: The interval [u, v] is nonmaximizing, because the point (d, f (d)) (red) is higher than any point on the part of the graph of f with u ≤ x ≤ v (blue).

Notice that the number d in the definition of nonmaximizing cannot be in the interval [u, v], so a nonmaximizing interval cannot be all of [a, b]. In other words, the interval [a, b] is maximizing. If we are looking for a number where f attains its maximum value on the interval [a, b], there is no point in looking in a nonmaximizing interval: clearly the maximum value cannot be attained at any number in a nonmaximizing interval.
The following fact about maximizing intervals is the key to our proof:
Lemma 4.7.3. Suppose that [u, v] is a maximizing interval. Then there are numbers u′ and v′ such that u ≤ u′ < v′ ≤ v, v′ −u′ = (v −u)/2, and [u′, v′] is maximizing.
Proof. Let w = (u + v)/2, the midpoint of the interval [u, v]. Our plan is to show that either [u,w] or [w, v] is maximizing. If we can prove this, then we can let [u′, v′] be whichever of these two intervals is maximizing.
Suppose that [u,w] and [w, v] are both nonmaximizing. Since [u,w] is nonmaximizing, there is some number d1 such that for every x ∈ [u,w], f (x) < f (d1). Similarly, since [w, v] is nonmaximizing, there is some d2 such that for every x ∈ [w, v], f (x) < f (d1).
Either f (d1) < f (d2) or f (d1) ≥ f (d2). Suppose first that f (d1) < f (d2). Then for every x ∈ [u,w], f (x) < f (d1) < f (d2). Combining this with the fact that for all x ∈ [w, v], f (x) < f (d2), we conclude that for all x ∈ [u, v], f (x) < f (d2). But this means that [u, v] is nonmaximizing, which is impossible, since we are told in the lemma that it is maximizing. Similarly, if f (d1) ≥ f (d2) then we can show that for all x ∈ [u, v], f (x) < f (d1), again contradicting the fact that [u, v] is maximizing. Thus, it is impossible for both [u,w] and [w, v] to be nonmaximizing, so at least one of them is maximizing. This proves the lemma.
We hope that by now you have guessed how we are going to prove the extreme value theorem. By applying the lemma repeatedly, we will create a nested sequence of maximizing intervals, and then we will use the nested interval theorem.
Proof of Theorem 4.7.1. Let u1 = a and v1 = b. As we have already mentioned, [u1, v1] = [a, b] is maximizing, so by the lemma we can find u2 and v2 such that u1 ≤ u2 < v2 ≤ v1, v2 −u2 = (v1 −u1)/2 = (b−a)/2, and [u2, v2] is maximizing. Applying the lemma again, we see that there are u3 and v3 such that u2 ≤ u3 < v3 ≤ v2, v3 −u3 = (v2 −u2)/2 = (b−a)/4, and [u3, v3] is maximizing. Continuing in this way we get a nested sequence of maximizing intervals [un, vn] such that vn −un = (b−a)/2n−1.
Since limn→∞(vn −un) = limn→∞(b−a)/2n−1 = 0, the nested interval theorem tells us that there is number c such that for every n, un ≤ c ≤ vn, and limn→∞ un = limn→∞ vn = c. Of course, our plan is to show that f attains its maximum value on the interval [a, b] at c.
If f does not attain its maximum value at c, then there is some number d ∈ [a, b] such that f (c) < f (d). We now apply the fact that f is continuous at c. (To simplify the proof, we will assume that c is in the interior of the interval [a, b]. If c is one of the endpoints, then minor adjustments must be made in the following argument to use one-sided continuity.) Since f is continuous at c, limx→c f (x) = f (c) < f (d). Therefore, by Theorem 2.8.8, there must be a number δ > 0 such that if c −δ < x < c+ δ then f (x) < f (d). Next we use the fact that limn→∞ un = limn→∞ vn = c to conclude that if we choose n large enough, then c −δ < un < vn < c+ δ. It follows that for all x, if x ∈ [un, vn] then c−δ < x < c+δ, and therefore f (x) < f (d). But this means that [un, vn ] is nonmaximizing, contradicting the fact that we chose our sequence of nested intervals to be maximizing. Thus, f must attain its maximum value at c.

4.8 L'Hôpital's Rule
In this section, we discuss a method for using derivatives to help us evaluate limits. The method is named for Guillaume de l'Hôpital (1661-1704), who published it in 1696 in his book Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes, the first textbook on differential calculus. However, it is believed that the method was actually discovered by Johann Bernoulli (1667-1748); l'Hôpital and Bernoulli had entered into a contract that gave l'Hôpital the right to publish Bernoulli's discoveries. The method is based on the following theorem:
Theorem 4.8.1 (L'Hôpital's Rule). Suppose that limx→a f (x) = limx→a g(x) = 0. If

then

L'Hôpital's rule is useful if you are trying to compute a limit of the form limx→a(f (x)/g(x)), and the limits of the numerator and denominator are both 0. A limit of this form is sometimes called an indeterminate form of type 0/0 because one cannot determine the value of the limit by simply computing the limits of numerator and denominator and then dividing. The rule says that in this situation you can try computing limx→a(f ′(x)/g′(x)) instead. If you get some number L as the answer for this limit, then the answer for the original limit is also L.
We will discuss the proof of l'Hôpital's rule later in this section. As we will see, the proof is based on our old friend the mean value theorem. But before turning to the proof let's try the rule out in a few examples.
Consider the limit

Since limx→2(x2 − x −2) = limx→2(x2 −3x +2) = 0, this limit fits the pattern of l'Hôpital's rule, with f (x) = x2 − x −2 and g(x) = x2 −3x +2. We have

so by l'Hôpital's rule, the value of the original limit is also 3.
Of course, we could also have evaluated this limit by the calculation

which confirms that l'Hôpital's rule has given us the right answer in this case. Thus, we didn't need l'Hôpital's rule to evaluate this limit. But there are other examples in which there is no easy alternative to the use of l'Hôpital's rule.
Example 4.8.2. Evaluate the limit

Solution. Since limx→π sin(3x) = sin(3π) = 0 and limx→π (x −π) = 0, we have an indeterminate form of type 0/0. There is no obvious cancelation to be done, so we try l'Hôpital's rule. The rule tells us to evaluate

We conclude that the value of the original limit is also −3.
Example 4.8.3. Evaluate the limit

Solution. Once again we have an indeterminate form of type 0/0. L'Hôpital's rule tells us to try to evaluate

The limit in (4.17) is also an indeterminate form of type 0/0, so we use l'Hôpital's rule again:

L'Hôpital's rule now tells us that the value of the limit in (4.17) is 25/2, and it follows by another application of l'Hôpital's rule that this is also the value of the original limit.
L'Hôpital's rule can also be used for one-sided limits and limits as x approaches ∞or−∞. And it can also be used if we find that the limit of f ′(x)/g′(x) is ∞or−∞; in this case, once again, the same conclusion applies to the limit of f (x)/g(x).
Example 4.8.4. Evaluate the limit

Solution. Of course, the fact that the variable in the limit is t rather than x makes no difference in the use of l'Hôpital's rule. We have a one-sided limit that is an indeterminate form of type 0/0, so we compute the derivatives of the numerator and denominator:

Next we compute

By l'Hôpital's rule, we conclude that

Sometimes a difficult limit is not in the 0/0 form, but it can be rearranged to put it in that form:
Example 4.8.5. Evaluate the limit

Solution. We are asked to compute the limit of a product, not a quotient, so l'Hôpital's rule doesn't apply directly. We have

and as we pointed out in our discussion after Theorem 2.5.14, if one factor in a product approaches ∞and the other approaches 0, then the two factors are pulling the product in opposite directions, and there is no easy way to determine the limit of the product.
We might say that the limit in this example is an indeterminate form of type ∞·0.
But we can rearrange this limit to turn it into an indeterminate form of type 0/0:

Now we can apply l'Hôpital's rule. We begin by computing the derivatives of the numerator and denominator:

Next, we compute

Finally, by l'Hôpital's rule we conclude that the value of the original limit is 1/2.
Although l'Hôpital's rule does not apply directly to limits of sequences, it can still play a role in the evaluation of sequence limits. For example, consider the sequence (an)∞n=1, where an is given by the formula

The limit of this sequence is

which is an indeterminate form of type 0/0. L'Hôpital's rule does not apply to this limit, since the variable n here stands for an integer. (As we observed in Example 4.3.10, the idea of differentiating with respect to an integer n makes no sense.)
However, we can apply l'Hôpital's rule to the limit

Taking the derivatives of the numerator and denominator, we compute

We conclude, by l'Hôpital's rule, that the value of limit (4.18) is also −π, and therefore, by Theorem 2.8.2, limn→∞ an = −π.
L'Hôpital's rule can also be applied to limits of fractions f (x)/g(x) in which numerator and denominator both approach±∞. In other words, we have the following theorem:
Theorem 4.8.6 (L'Hôpital's Rule, Part 2). Suppose that either limx→a f (x)=∞ or limx→a f (x) = −∞, and also either limx→a g(x)=∞or limx→a g(x)= −∞. If

then

As before, the same rule applies to one-sided limits and limits as x approaches ∞ or −∞, and it also applies if L is replaced by either∞ or −∞.
Limits of the kind considered in Theorem 4.8.6 are called indeterminate forms of type∞/∞.
Example 4.8.7. Evaluate the limit

Solution. We already know an algebraic trick that can be used to evaluate this limit:

But let's check that l'Hôpital's rule would give the same result.
Since limx→∞(1−3x2) = −∞ and limx→∞(x2 +5x −3)=∞, we have an indeterminate form of type∞/∞. L'Hôpital's rule suggests that we compute

This is still an indeterminate form of type∞/∞, so we use l'Hôpital's rule again:

By l'Hôpital's rule, this is the answer to the limit in (4.19), and also the answer to the original limit.
As we mentioned earlier, the proof of l'Hôpital's rule is based on the mean value theorem. Actually, we will need the following more general form of the theorem.
Theorem 4.8.8 (Cauchy'sMean Value Theorem). Suppose that f and g are continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), and for all x ∈ (a, b), g′(x) = 0. Then there is a number c such that a < c < b and

Notice that if g(x) = x then g′(x) = 1, and equation (4.20) becomes

which is the equation in the conclusion of the original mean value theorem. Thus, Cauchy's mean value theorem is a generalization of the original mean value theorem: when we apply Cauchy's mean value theorem with g(x) = x, we get the same conclusion that we would get from the original mean value theorem, but Cauchy's mean value theorem can be applied with other choices for g.
Proof of Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem. First we would like to verify that we are not dividing by 0 in equation (4.20). We are told in the statement of the theorem that g′(x) = 0 for all x in the interval (a, b), so we know that no matter what number c we choose in this interval we will have g′(c) = 0, and therefore the denominator on the right-hand side of (4.20) will not be 0. But what about the denominator on the left?
Applying the original mean value theorem to g, we know that there is some number d such that a < d < b and

Since g′(d) = 0, we conclude that g(b)− g(a) = 0, and therefore the denominator on the left-hand side of (4.20) is not 0.
Let

Our goal is to find a number c between a and b such that f ′(c)/g′(c) = r. To motivate the proof, we rewrite this last equation as f ′(c) = rg′(c), or equivalently f ′(c)−rg′(c) = 0. This suggests that we study the function
h(x) = f (x)−rg(x).
Since f and g are both continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), the same is true of h, and
h′(x) = f ′(x)−rg′(x).
Thus, we can apply the original mean value theorem to h to conclude that there is some number c such that a < c < b and

To complete the proof we must evaluate the left-hand side of equation (4.21). By the definition of h, we have

Therefore equation (4.21) tells us that

Thus, f ′(c) = rg′(c), and since we know g′(c) = 0 we can divide by g′(c) to conclude that

This is the same as equation (4.20), so the proof is complete.
Proof of L'Hôpital's Rule. Since l'Hôpital's rule applies in many different situations, there are many cases to consider. We will give the proof for just one case involving a one-sided limit that is an indeterminate form of type 0/0. At the end of the proof we will make some brief comments about other cases.
Suppose that limx→a+ f (x) = limx→a+ g(x) = 0 and

Notice that in order for this last limit statement to be true, the fraction f ′(x)/g′(x) must be defined for all x close to a but larger than a. More precisely, there must be some number b > a such that f and g are differentiable on the interval (a, b), and for all x in that interval, g′(x) = 0. We must prove that limx→a+(f (x)/g(x)) = L.
We begin by defining functions F and G on the domain [a, b) as follows:

In other words, F (x) and G(x) are the same as f (x) and g(x) for x in the interval (a, b), but we have defined F (a) and G (a) to be 0. It follows that F and G are differentiable, and therefore also continuous, on the interval (a, b), and for all x in that interval, F′(x) = f ′(x) and G′(x) = g′(x) = 0. Also notice that since limx→a+ F(x) = limx→a+ f (x) = 0 = F (a), F is continuous from the right at a, and similarly G is continuous from the right at a.
For any number x such that a < x < b, we have

We now apply Cauchy's mean value theorem to F and G on the interval [a, x] to conclude that there is some number cx such that a < cx < x and

We have used the notation cx, rather than simply c, to stress that cx depends on x; for different values of x, the value of cx will be different.
Since a < cx < x, the squeeze theorem tells us that as x →a+, cx → a+. And since limx→a+(f ′(x)/g′(x)) = L, we can say that as cx → a+, f ′(cx)/g′(cx) → L. Combining these facts, we conclude that as x →a+,

and therefore

Similar reasoning can be used to prove l'Hôpital's rule for limits in which x → a−, and the two one-sided versions of l'Hôpital's rule can be combined to prove the rule for two-sided limits. One can also replace L in the reasoning above with ∞or −∞to prove that l'Hôpital's rule applies when f ′(x)/g′(x)→±∞. For a proof of l'Hôpital's rule for limits in which x →∞, see Exercise 17. L'Hôpital's rule for indeterminate forms of type ∞/∞can also be proven using Cauchy's mean value theorem, although the details are a bit trickier (see Exercise 18).
We end this section with some examples illustrating the limitations of l'Hôpital's rule. Students sometimes become enamored of l'Hôpital's rule and want to apply it to every limit they come across. Of course, it is never wrong to try using l'Hôpital's rule on any indeterminate form of type 0/0 or∞/∞, but the rule isn't always helpful.
For example, consider the limit

This is an indeterminate form of type∞/∞, so we compute

L'Hôpital's rule now suggests that we compute the limit

This is another indeterminate form of type∞/∞, and another application of l'Hôpital's rule leads to the limit

But this is the same as our original limit! L'Hôpital's rule is just leading us in circles; it is not going to solve this problem. For a solution, see Exercise 19.
Another interesting example is the limit

Clearly the denominator approaches 0, but the numerator is more complicated. We have
−1 ≤ cos(1/x) ≤ 1,
and therefore
−x2 ≤ x2 cos(1/x) ≤ x2.
Since limx→0 x2 = limx→0(−x2) = 0, the squeeze theorem tells us that limx→0(x2 cos(1/x)) = 0. Thus, we have an indeterminate form of type 0/0, so we can try l'Hôpital's rule.
We begin by computing

Thus, l'Hôpital's rule suggests that we evaluate

As x →0, the denominator approaches 1, and we leave it to you to verify, using the squeeze theorem, that 2x cos(1/x)→0. But the term sin(1/x), like the function h1(x)from Section 2.2, oscillates back and forth between −1 and 1 infinitely many times as x → 0. It appears, then, that the fraction in limit (4.23) is sometimes close to −1 and sometimes close to 1 when x is near 0, and therefore the limit is undefined. (You are asked to verify this conclusion more carefully in Exercise 20.) Does it follow that limit (4.22) is undefined? No, this would be a misuse of l'Hôpital's rule. The rule says that if limit (4.23) is equal to some number, or equal to ±∞, then the same is true for limit (4.22), but that is not the situation we are in.
In fact, limit (4.22) is defined, as the following calculation shows:

Thus, this example illustrates that when using l'Hôpital's rule you must be careful to apply it only in cases that fit the rule exactly as it is written.
Finally, we consider the limit

This is an indeterminate form of type ∞/∞ (see Exercise 21), so let's try l'Hôpital's rule. We compute:

and

Thus, l'Hôpital's rule leads us to compute the limit

After canceling a factor of sin x from numerator and denominator in this limit we get

since the denominator in (4.26) approaches ∞and the numerator is always between −2 and 2. You might think that we could use l'Hôpital's rule to conclude that the value of limit (4.24) is also 0, but this is incorrect. The mistake this time is very subtle. Although we have computed limit (4.26) correctly, limit (4.25) is actually undefined, because numerator and denominator are both 0 whenever x is an integer multiple of π. Thus, l'Hôpital's rule doesn't apply.
To get the correct answer for limit (4.24), we divide numerator and denominator by x:

As x →∞, the fractions (sin x cos x)/x and (sin x −2 sin x cos x)/x both approach 0, and therefore for large x, the numerator on the right side of (4.27) is close to 1 and the denominator is close to 2 −cos x. Since 2 −cos x oscillates between 1 and 3, for some large values of x the function in limit (4.27) is close to 1, and for some it is close to 1/3. Thus, the limit is undefined.

4.9Antiderivatives
In all of our work with derivatives so far, we have started with a function and then computed its derivative. But in some applications of calculus it is useful to work backwards: given the derivative of a function, find the function. We investigate this process of "antidifferentiation" in this section.
For example, consider the function f (x) = 6x2. Can you find a function F (x) such that F′(x) = f (x)? In this case it is not hard to guess an answer. If we let F(x) = 2x3, then F′(x) = 6x2 = f (x). But this isn't the only possible answer. For example, if F(x) = 2x3 +1 then it is also true that F′(x) = f (x). In fact, it is clear that for any number C, if F(x) = 2x3 + C then F′(x) = f (x).
Are there any other possibilities we haven't thought of? No, these are the only ones. To see why, suppose that F is a function such that for all x, F′(x) = 6x2. Then

Now recall from part 5 of Theorem 4.3.2 that if a function is continuous on an interval and its derivative is 0 on the interior of the interval, then the function is constant on the interval. It follows that F (x)−2x3 must be constant on the interval (−∞,∞). In other words, there is some number C such that for all x, F (x)−2x3 = C, and therefore F (x) = 2x3 + C. The graphs of some functions of this form are shown in Figure 4.44.
In this example we were able to find a family of functions F such that the equation F′(x) = f (x) holds for all values of x; in other words, F′ agrees with f throughout the interval (−∞,∞). We say that F is an antiderivative of f on the interval (−∞,∞). We will sometimes want to work with antiderivatives on smaller intervals as well. For open intervals, the definition is easy:
Definition 4.9.1. Suppose f is a function and I is an open interval contained in the domain of f. We say that a function F is an antiderivative of f on I if F is differentiable on I, and for all x ∈ I, F′(x) = f (x).


Figure 4.44: Graphs of the curves y = 2x3 −1, y = 2x3, y = 2x3 +1, y = 2x3 +2, and y = 2x3 +3.

For example, the function  is an antiderivative of  on the interval (0,∞), because for all x > 0,

We will also want to work with antiderivatives on closed intervals, but this concept is slightly more complicated. Just as continuity on closed intervals required us to use a one-sided version of continuity at the endpoints, differentiability on closed intervals will require a one-sided version of derivatives at the endpoints.
Definition 4.9.2. The right-hand derivative of a function f at a number a is the number  defined by the formula

Similarly, the left-hand derivative of f at a is

Notice that our definitions of  and  are based on one-sided versions of the limit that defines f ′(a). Thus, the ordinary two-sided derivative f ′(a) is defined if and only if the two one-sided derivatives are defined and equal, and in that case  But sometimes the one-sided derivatives are defined when the two-sided derivative is not. For example, we have already seen that if f (x) = |x| then
f ′(0) is undefined. But the one-sided derivatives are

All of our familiar rules for computing derivatives have versions that apply to one-sided derivatives as well. For example, if  and  are defined, then  and  are also defined, and we have

As in our proof of Theorem 3.2.3, by letting x = a + h in the definitions of the one-sided derivatives we can derive the alternative formulas

and

Thus,  is determined by the values of f (a) and f (x) for x > a, whereas  depends on f (a) and f (x) for x < a. Also, by imitating the proof of Theorem 3.2.4, we can show that if  is defined then f is continuous from the right at a, and if  is defined then f is continuous from the left at a.
Consider the function  The domain of this function is [0,∞), and  We have already observed that g′(0) is undefined, because g(x) is not defined for x close to 0 on both sides of 0. But g(x) is defined for all x > 0, so it makes sense to compute the right-hand derivative of g at 0:

This motivates our next definition.
Definition 4.9.3. We say that a function f is differentiable on a closed interval [a, b] if f is differentiable on (a, b), and the one-sided derivatives  and  are defined.
Similarly, we say that f is differentiable on [a, b) if it is differentiable on (a, b) and  is defined, and it is differentiable on (a, b] if it is differentiable on (a, b) and  is defined. In general, f is differentiable on an interval I if it is differentiable on the interior of I, and the appropriate one-sided derivatives are defined at any endpoints that are included in I. For example, we can now say that the function g(x) = x3/2 is differentiable on the interval [0,∞). The function f (x) = |x| is differentiable on both of the intervals (−∞, 0] and [0,∞), although it is not differentiable on (−∞,∞).
We are now ready to define antiderivatives on intervals that are not open.
Definition 4.9.4. Suppose f is a function and the closed interval [a, b] is contained in the domain of f. We say that a function F is an antiderivative of f on [a, b] if F is differentiable on  and for all x ∈ (a, b), F′ (x) = f (x). More generally, if I is any interval contained in the domain of f, then to say that F is an antiderivative of f on I means that F is differentiable on I, if I includes its left endpoint a then  if I includes its right endpoint b then  and for every x in the interior of I, F′ (x) = f (x).
When talking about derivatives of a function we may sometimes leave the subscript + or − out of our derivative notation if it is clear from context what kind of derivative we are talking about. For example, if F is an antiderivative of f on an interval I, then we may simply say that for all x ∈ I, F′ (x) = f (x), leaving it for you to fill in that in this equation F′ (x) denotes  if x is the left endpoint of I,  if x is the right endpoint of I, and F′ (x) if x is in the interior of I. Another example of this convention is the following version of the chain rule, which can be proven by making minor adjustments in our previous proof:
Theorem 4.9.5 (Chain Rule on Intervals). Suppose that f is differentiable on an interval I, g is differentiable on an interval J, and for every x ∈ J, g(x) ∈ I. Then f ◦ g is differentiable on J, and for every x ∈ J,
(f ◦ g)′(x) = f ′(g(x)) · g′(x),
where each of the derivatives in this equation is interpreted as a one-sided derivative whenever it is evaluated at an endpoint.
As in our first example in this section, antiderivatives always come in families of functions that differ from each other by a constant. In other words, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 4.9.6. Suppose that F is an antiderivative of f on an interval I. Then for every number C, the function G(x) = F (x)+C is also an antiderivative of f on I. Furthermore, these are the only antiderivatives. In other words, if G is any antiderivative of f on I, then there is some number C such that for all x ∈ I, G(x) = F(x)+C.
Proof. Since F is an antiderivative of f on I, for every x ∈ I, F ′ (x) = f (x) (with appropriate one-sided derivatives being used at endpoints). Since the derivative of a constant function is 0, it follows that if G(x) = F(x)+C then G′ (x) = F′ (x)+0 = f (x), so G is also an antiderivative of f on I.
To see that these are the only antiderivates of f on I, suppose that G is any antiderivative of f on I. Since F and G are differentiable on I, they are also continuous on I. We also know that for all x ∈ I, G′ (x) = f (x), but we will actually use this equation only for x in the interior of I. Let H = G − F. Then H is continuous on I, and for all x in the interior of I,
H′ (x) = G′(x)− F′(x) = f (x)− f (x) = 0.
By part 5 of Theorem 4.3.2, it follows that H is constant on the interval I. In other words, there is some number C such that for all x ∈ I, H(x) = C. Therefore G(x)− F(x) = C, so G(x) = F(x)+C.
It is perhaps worth mentioning that the second paragraph of this proof actually proves a little more than what is stated in the theorem. The proof shows that if F is an antiderivative of f on I, G is continuous on I, and G is an antiderivative of f on the interior of I, then there is some number C such that for all x ∈ I, G(x) = F (x)+C, and therefore G is actually an antiderivative of f on all of I. For more on this, see Exercise 19.
According to Theorem 4.9.6, to find all antiderivatives of a function f on an interval I, we simply have to find one antiderivative F and then add "+C" to the formula for F (x). Finding one antiderivative can sometimes be done by reversing our rules for computing derivatives. For example, reversing the power rule for rational exponents (Theorem 3.4.4) gives us the following theorem.
Theorem 4.9.7. Suppose r is a rational number and r = −1, and let f (x) = xr. Then the function

is an antiderivative of f on every interval contained in the domain of f.
To list these intervals explicitly, we first write the rational number r in lowest terms as r = m/n. If n is odd and r ≥ 0, then f (x) = xr is defined for all x, and F is an antiderivative of f on the interval (−∞,∞). If n is odd and r < 0, then f (x) is defined for all values of x except x = 0, and F is an antiderivative of f on each of the intervals (−∞, 0) and (0,∞). If n is even, then the domain of f is [0,∞) if r > 0, and (0,∞) if r < 0. In both of these cases, F is an antiderivative of f on the entire domain of f.
Proof. Notice that since r = −1, the denominator in the formula for F (x) is not 0. According to the power rule for derivatives,

The correctness of this equation on the intervals listed in the theorem follows, in almost all cases, from Theorem 3.4.4. The one exception is that if n is even and r > 0 then, since the domain of f includes the left endpoint 0, we must verify that 

Another derivative theorem that can easily be reversed is Theorem 3.3.2:
Theorem 4.9.8. Suppose that F and G are antiderivatives of f and g, respectively, on an interval I. Then:
1. F + G is an antiderivative of f + g on I.
2. For any number c, cF is an antiderivative of cf on I.
3. F − G is an antiderivative of f − g on I.
Proof. Since F and G are antiderivatives of f and g on I, we know that for all x ∈ I, F′ (x) = f (x) and G′ (x) = g(x). All three parts of the theorem now follow easily from the corresponding rules for derivatives. For example, F + G is an antiderivative of f + g because
(F + G)′ (x) = F′ (x)+ G′ (x) = f (x)+ g(x) = (f + g)(x).
Combining our theorems, we can now easily find antiderivatives of all polynomials. For example, if f (x) = 2x3 + x2 −4x +5, then the antiderivatives of f on (−∞,∞) are precisely the functions of the form

Notice in particular that, although the derivative of a constant function is 0, this is not true of the antiderivatives of a constant function. Rather, the antiderivatives of a constant function f (x) = a are functions of the form F (x) = ax +C.
Reversing our trigonometric derivative rules gives us the trigonometric antiderivatives in Table 4.1. This table illustrates that antidifferentiation is often more difficult than differentiation. For example, the table gives an antiderivative for sec2 x, but not sec x. In fact, sec x does have an antideriviative, but it involves a function that we haven't studied yet. We'll learn about it later in this book (see Example 8.3.3). In contrast, finding the derivative of any power of sec x is easy. For another example of the difficulty of antidifferentiation, notice that although we know the derivative of the function f (x) = 1/x, we don't yet know an antiderivative of f, since Theorem 4.9.7 doesn't apply when r = −1. Again, this is an antiderivative that we will have to return to later (see Section 7.3).


Table 4.1: Some trigonometric antiderivatives. In each case, the antiderivative works on any interval contained in the domain of the function.

Example 4.9.9. Find a function F such that for all x,  and F (0) = 3.
Solution. By Theorem 4.9.7, one antiderivative  is  and by Table 4.1, one antiderivative of sin x is −cos x. Thus, we must have

for some constant C. We can use the fact that F (0) = 3 to solve for C:

and therefore C = 4. So the unique function F that meets the stated requirements is

This example illustrates a common pattern: When we compute an antiderivative, there will always be an undetermined constant C in our answer. But we may be able to determine the value of C if we have some additional information. In particular, if we know the value of the antiderivative at a single number, then we can use this to solve for C.
Example 4.9.10. A ball is thrown straight up from ground level with an initial velocity of 160 feet per second. Find the height of the ball t seconds later. (You may ignore the effects of air resistance.)
Solution. If we let h denote the height of the ball, in feet, then h = f (t), for some unknown function f. We wish to find a formula for f (t). As we have discussed before, the velocity of the ball at any time will be v = dh/dt = f ′ (t), and the acceleration will be a = dv/dt = f ′′(t). In solving this problem we will make use of the fact, determined by experiment, that the earth's gravity will cause the ball (or, in fact, any object in free fall near the surface of the earth) to experience a constant downward acceleration of approximately 32 ft/sec2.
The velocity v = dh/dt will be positive if the height of the ball is increasing, and therefore the ball is moving up, and it will be negative if the ball is moving down. Since the acceleration caused by gravity is downward, the velocity of the ball will be decreasing at a constant rate of 32 ft/sec2, and therefore for all t we have
a = f ′′ (t) = −32.
We can now use antidifferentiation to find first f ′ (t) and then f (t).
Since f ′ (t) must be an antiderivative of f ′′ (t), we have
v = f ′ (t) = −32t + C,
for some number C. We are also told that the initial velocity of the ball is 160 ft/sec, so
f ′ (0) = −32(0)+C = 160.
Therefore C = 160, and v = f ′ (t) = −32t +160. Antidifferentiating again, we get
h = f (t) = −16t2 +160t + D,
for some D. Once again, we have a given value that we can use to solve for D. We are told that the ball is thrown "from ground level," so
f (0) = −16(02)+160(0)+ D = 0.
Therefore D = 0, so h = f (t) = −16t2 + 160t. Notice that this is the formula we used for the height of the ball in Section 2.1. We have finally learned enough calculus to be able to see where that formula came from.
We have not specified the intervals on which our antiderivatives were computed. As we observed in Section 2.1, after 10 seconds the ball hits the ground. It is then no longer in free fall, and the formula a = −32 no longer applies. Thus, our formulas are correct only for the time interval [0, 10].
Example 4.9.11. A rock is dropped from the top of a tall building. It hits the ground 4 seconds later. How tall is the building?
Solution. Once again we let h be the height of the ball above the ground, in feet, and we have h = f (t), where t is the number of seconds since the rock was dropped. As before, while the rock is falling—that is, for t in the interval [0, 4]—the acceleration is a = f ′′ (t) = −32, and therefore
v = f ′(t) = −32t + C.
This time we are told that the rock is dropped, not thrown, so the initial velocity is
f ′(0) = −32(0)+C = 0.
This tells us that C = 0, and therefore v = f ′(t) = −32t. Antidifferentiating again on the interval [0, 4], we get
f (t) = −16t2 + D.
We are told that the rock hits the ground after 4 seconds, so
f (4)= −16(42)+ D = 0,
and therefore D = 256. So the height of the rock after t seconds is h = f (t) = −16t2 + 256. In particular, the rock starts at a height of h = f (0) = 256 feet. Thus, the building is 256 feet tall.
Example 4.9.12. You drop a rock into a well, and 4 seconds later you hear the splash when it hits the water. How deep is the well?
Solution. This problem is slightly different from the last one, because it takes some time for the sound to travel from the bottom of the well to the top. Thus, the rock hits the water in a little less than 4 seconds.
Just for variety, in this case we will measure the rock's position downward from ground level. So we'll let d be the depth of the rock in the well, measured in feet, and we have d = f (t), where t is the time, in seconds, since the rock was dropped. Once again the velocity is v = dd/dt = f ′ (t), but now a positive velocity means that the depth d is increasing, which means that the rock is moving down. Now the downward acceleration of gravity will cause the velocity to increase at a steady rate of 32 ft/sec2, so we have a = dv/dt = f ′′ (t) = 32.
As before, we antidifferentiate twice and use the fact that the initial depth and velocity are both 0 to deduce that
v = f ′(t) = 32t,
d = f (t) = 16t2.
The rock hits the water at some time t = t0 < 4, at which time the rock has fallen to a depth of d = 16t20 feet. The sound must now travel the 16t20 feet back to the surface in 4 −t0 seconds. Since the speed of sound is approximately 1126 ft/sec, this means that
16t20 = 1126(4−t0).
This is a quadratic equation, and we can use the quadratic formula to solve for t0:

Of course, the negative solution doesn't make sense in this problem—the rock can't hit the water 74 seconds before it was dropped! So the rock hits the water about 3.8 seconds after it was dropped, and the depth of the well is approximately f (3.8) = 16(3.82) ≈ 231 ft. As a check, we can compute that the time it will take the sound to travel the 231 feet back to the surface is 231/1126 ≈ 0.2 sec, so the sound will arrive after 3.8+0.2 = 4 seconds, as required.

1Why an open interval? If the oil leak lasts for 100 hours, then in the equations r = f (t), A = g(t) we might want to think of the domains of the functions f and g as the closed interval [0, 100]. But in that case the functions would only be differentiable on the open interval (0, 100), and therefore the discussion of the rates of change of A and r would only make sense on this open interval.
2Our proof of the mean value theorem is based on F. Acker, The missing link, Mathematical Intelligencer 18, no. 3 (1996), pp. 4-9.

Chapter 5
Integrals
5.1Summations
In this chapter we will often work with sums of lists of numbers. It will therefore be convenient to introduce notation for such sums. We will write  to denote the sum of the numbers a1, a2, ..., an. In other words,

As in our notation for sequences, the subscript "i = 1" and superscript "n" indicate that in the expression ai, we should plug in values for i starting with 1 and running up to n.
The symbol  (the Greek uppercase letter sigma) indicates that the resulting numbers are to be added. For example,

It will be helpful to develop rules that will sometimes allow us to evaluate  when ai is given by a formula. As with limits and derivatives, we proceed in a systematic way, working out the simplest summations, and then establishing rules that will allow us to combine simple summations to find more complicated ones.
Recall that the simplest functions are the constant functions and the identity function. Similarly, the simplest summations of the form (5.1) are those in which either ai is equal to a constant or ai = i. Consider first the case in which there is some constant c such that for every i, ai = c. Then

Filling in ai = c in the summation on the left-hand side of this equation, we have

For example, 
If ai is given by the formula ai = i, then the summation in (5.1) becomes

Of course, it is straightforward to compute this sum for a particular value of n. But there is a clever trick that allows us to find a formula that gives the value of this sum for any value of n. First we write the summation twice, with the terms written in reverse order the second time, and then we add the two equations, term-by-term:

On the right-hand side of equation (5.3), the term (n +1) appears n times, so we have

and therefore

For example,

as you can confirm by adding up the numbers from 1 to 10.
We can combine these simple summations to evaluate some more complicated ones by using the following theorem.
Theorem 5.1.1. For any numbers c, a1, a2, ..., an, b1, b2, ..., bn, the following equations are true:

Proof. We can prove this theorem by simply writing out the meaning of the summation notation and then applying basic rules of algebra. (For an alternative approach to the proof of this theorem, see Exercise 8.) For part 1, we have

Similarly, to prove part 2 we compute

Part 3 follows from parts 1 and 2:

Example 5.1.2. Evaluate 
Solution. We begin by applying parts 1 and 3 of Theorem 5.1.1:

We can now get the solution by filling in the formulas from equations (5.2) and (5.4):

Theorem 5.1.1 tells us what happens to a summation when all of its terms are multiplied by a constant, and it tells us what happens when two summations are combined by adding or subtracting their terms. Based on our experience with limits and derivatives, you might think that our next step should be to investigate what happens when two summations are combined by multiplying or dividing their terms. Are there simple formulas that express  and  in terms of  and  Unfortunately, there are no such simple formulas.
With no formula for how are we to evaluate a sum like  Unfortunately, the method we used to compute  doesn't work for  But surprisingly, evaluating the summation  in two different ways will lead us to the answer. Writing out the meaning of this summation, we see that most of the terms cancel out:

Notice that the 23 in the first term cancels with the −23 in the second term, the 33 in the second term cancels with the −33 in the third term, and so on. After all of these cancelations, all that is left on the right-hand side of equation (5.5) is the −13 from the first term and the (n +1)3 from the last term. Thus, we have

Sums like (5.5), in which all but a few terms cancel out, are called telescoping sums. But there is a second way to evaluate this summation. Since
(i +1)3 −i 3 = (i 3 +3i 2 +3i +1)−i 3 = 3i 2 +3i +1,
we have

Equations (5.6) and (5.7) give two different formulas for the same sum. Equating these formulas, we get

Rearranging, we find that

and therefore

Similar methods can be used to find a formula for  for any positive integer p. For example, in Exercise 9 you are asked to derive the equation

Using such formulas, together with Theorem 5.1.1, we can evaluate  for any polynomial f.
Example 5.1.3. Find

Solution.

So far we have written all of our summations with the variable i running through the values from 1 to n. But we can use other variables when writing summations, and we can let the variable run through a different range of values. Our next example illustrates this.
Example 5.1.4. Find

Solution. We give two solutions, to illustrate different methods that are sometimes useful for evaluating sums.
Solution 1. We begin by expanding (k +3)2 and applying Theorem 5.1.1:

Next we apply equations (5.2), (5.4), and (5.8), with m substituted for n, to evaluate the three summations on the right. Notice that the use of the letter k instead of i in our summations does not affect the values of the sums. For example, we have

The variables k and i in the summations in equation (5.10) serve as placeholders, to be replaced by the numbers from 1 tom when the sum is evaluated. Once these replacements are made, the letters k and i disappear from the expression, and we see that the value of the sum does not depend on k or i (although it does depend on m). We say that k and i are dummy variables (or bound variables). In general, a dummy variable in an expression can be changed to a different variable without affecting the value of the expression.
Evaluating the other two sums in a similar way, we arrive at the answer:

Solution 2. Writing out the meaning of the original summation we see that it can be written more simply in a different way:

Notice that in the final sum, the variable i starts at the value 4, not 1. Substituting m +3 for n in equation (5.8), we see that

But we need to evaluate the sum with i running through the values from 4 to m +3, not 1 to m +3. Writing out the meaning of the summation notation makes it clear what adjustment needs to be made. We have

and therefore

Of course, this is the same as the answer we got in Solution 1.

5.2Accumulation and Area
A scientist is studying a stream that flows into a lake. She wants to know how much water flows from the stream into the lake, so she asks her research assistant to set up equipment to measure the flow rate of the stream. Since the flow rate might vary, she asks her assistant to report back to her about the flow rate on five consecutive days. The assistant reports measurements of the rate at which water is flowing from the stream into the lake, in cubic meters per hour (abbreviated m3/hr), at 9 a.m. on each of five consecutive days, as shown in Table 5.1.


Table 5.1: Flow rate of stream on five consecutive days, in m3/hr.

The scientist suspects that the flow rate won't vary much over the course of a single day, so she thinks it will be approximately correct to assume that the stream flowed at a constant rate of 603 m3/hr all day on Monday, 527 m3/hr on Tuesday, and so on. Thus, she computes that during the 24 hours of Monday, a total of about 603 · 24 = 14472 cubic meters of water flowed from the stream into the lake. Similarly, the total volume of water flowing into the lake on Tuesday was about 527 · 24 = 12648 m3, and so on. Adding up the contributions for all five days, she computes that the total volume of water that flowed from the stream into the lake over the five-day period was approximately

This is only an approximation, because the flow rate was probably not constant on each day, but if the flow rate didn't vary much over the course of a single day, it should be fairly accurate.
The next day, the scientist shows her calculations to her research assistant. The assistant says that the equipment he used actually recorded the flow rate four times every day, at 3 a.m., 9 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m., and he noticed that there was a fair amount of variability in the flow rate over the course of each day. Thus, the scientist's calculations might not be very accurate. The scientist asks for this more detailed data, and the research assistant supplies the figures shown in Table 5.2.
Using this data, the scientist is able to do a more accurate calculation. She takes each measurement as applying to a 6-hour period. Thus, she assumes that from midnight to 6 a.m. on Monday, the flow rate was 531 m3/hr, from 6 a.m. to noon it was 603 m3/hr, and so on. Now she computes that from midnight to 6 a.m. a total of about 531 · 6 = 3186 m3 of water flowed into the lake, from 6 a.m. to noon the total was about 603 · 6 = 3618 m3, and similarly for all of the other 6-hour periods. Adding up the contributions of all of the 6-hour periods over all five days, she estimates that the total volume of water that flowed into the lake was


Table 5.2: Flow rate of stream at four times on each of five days, in m3/hr.


This is still an approximation, but it is probably more accurate than the first calculation, since it takes into account some of the variability in the flow rate over the course of each day.
Recall that when we studied rates of change, we found it helpful to interpret them geometrically as slopes of secant and tangent lines. There is also a helpful geometric interpretation of the calculations our scientist has done. To explain this geometric interpretation, we first introduce some notation. Let t denote time since midnight Sunday night, measured in hours. Since 24 · 5 = 120, the five-day period under consideration in this example corresponds to values of t in the interval [0, 120]. For each t in this interval, let f (t) be the rate at which water was flowing from the stream into the lake, in m3/hr, at time t. The graph of the equation y = f (t) is shown in Figure 5.1. The five measurements in Table 5.1 correspond to the five black dots on the curve. For example, since the flow rate was 603 m3/hr at 9 a.m. on Monday, we have f (9) = 603, and therefore the point (9, 603) is on the graph. The measurement of 527 m3/hr at 9 a.m. on Tuesday tells us that the curve passes through the point (33, 527), since 9 a.m. on Tuesday was 33 hours after midnight on Sunday night. Similarly, the other three measurements in Table 5.1 correspond to the other three labeled points in Figure 5.1.
We have also drawn five blue rectangles in Figure 5.1, one for each of the five days of the experiment. The top of each rectangle passes through one of the labeled points on the graph. Thus, the first rectangle contains all points (t, y) with 0 ≤ t ≤ 24 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 603. This rectangle has height 603 and width 24, and therefore its area is 603 · 24 = 14472—exactly the same as the scientist's initial estimate of the volume of water that flowed into the lake on Monday. Similarly, the scientist's initial estimates of the volume of water flowing into the lake on the other four days are equal to the areas of the other four rectangles. Therefore, the sum in equation (5.11) is equal to the total area of the five rectangles in Figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1: The graph of y = f (t). The areas of the five blue rectangles are equal to the five terms in the sum in equation (5.11).
The scientist's improved estimate in equation (5.12) can also be interpreted as the total area of a collection of rectangles. This time there are 20 terms in the sum, each giving an approximation of the volume of water flowing into the lake in a 6-hour time period, so we draw 20 rectangles, each of width 6 on the t-axis; see Figure 5.2. The tops of the rectangles pass through the points on the graph corresponding to the 20 measurements in Table 5.2. With more sample points on the graph, the tops of the rectangles follow the shape of the curve fairly closely in Figure 5.2. As a result, the total area of the rectangles, which is given by the sum in equation (5.12), is approximately equal to the area of the region under the curve y = f (t) between t = 0 and t = 120—that is, the area of the region containing all points (t, y) with 0 ≤ t ≤ 120 and 0 ≤ y ≤ f (t).
You should recognize that we now have the ingredients for applying the methods of calculus to the problem of computing the volume of water flowing into the lake over the five days: we have a way of computing an approximate answer to the problem, and a way of making the approximation more accurate. The scientist could have made her approximation even more accurate by dividing the time period 0 ≤ t ≤ 120 into an even larger number of narrower intervals, taking a measurement of the flow rate in each interval, and adding up estimates of the volume of water that flowed into the lake in each of these intervals. The terms of this sum would again be equal to the areas of a sequence of rectangles. For example, if she had measured the flow rate once every hour, then she would have ended up adding up the areas of 120 rectangles, as shown in Figure 5.3. The region inside these rectangles is almost indistinguishable from the region under the curve y = f (t) between t = 0 and t = 120. It appears that if we take the limit of these approximations as the number of rectangles approaches ∞, we will get the exact area under the curve, and this will be equal to the exact number of cubic meters of water that flowed into the lake.

Figure 5.2: The areas of the blue rectangles are equal to the terms in the sum in equation (5.12).

Figure 5.3: The region inside 120 rectangles, each of width 1, is almost indistinguishable from the region under the curve.
Let's see if we can spell this idea out more precisely. Suppose we divide the interval [0, 120] into n smaller intervals, each of width △t = 120/n. These smaller intervals will be [0,△t], [△t, 2△t], [2△t, 3△t], and so on. It will be convenient to have notation for the endpoints of these intervals, so we let t0 = 0, t1 = △t, t2 = 2△t, and, in general, ti = i△t for 0 ≤ i ≤ n. Notice that tn = n△t = n(120/n) = 120. The first interval is [t0, t1], the second is [t1, t2], and for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, the i th interval is [ti−1, ti ]. To estimate the volume of water flowing into the lake in each of these time intervals, we will need a measurement of the flow rate at some point in each interval. Thus, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n we choose a number  and measure the flow rate at time  of course, this flow rate is  To estimate the volume of water flowing into the lake during the time interval [ti−1, ti ], we assume that the flow rate was a constant  m3/hr throughout this interval. Since the interval is △t hours long, we compute that the total volume of water that flowed into the lake over this interval is approximately  Adding up the contributions of all the time intervals, we conclude that the total volume of water that flowed into the lake from t = 0 to t = 120, in cubic meters, is about


Figure 5.4: The areas of these rectangles are equal to the terms in the sum in equation (5.13).
The sum in equation (5.13) is called a Riemann sum for the function f on the interval [0, 120], after the mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866). Each term of the sum in equation (5.13) can be thought of as representing the area of a rectangle, as illustrated in Figure 5.4. If we want to specify that there are n terms in the sum, we may refer to it as a Riemann n-sum. Thus, the sum in equation (5.11) is an example of a Riemann 5-sum for the function f on the interval [0, 120], and the sum in equation (5.12) is an example of a Riemann 20-sum. Notice that in forming a Riemann n-sum, we can choose the sample points  however we please. Thus, for a single value of n there will be many possible Riemann n-sums. For example, we could get another Riemann 5-sum by using, say, the 3 p.m. measurements on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and the 9 p.m. measurements on Tuesday and Thursday.
Suppose that, for each n, Rn is a Riemann n-sum for f on the interval [0, 120]. The examples we have considered suggest that as n increases, Rn should get closer and closer to both the area under the graph of f for 0 ≤ t ≤ 120 and also the total volume of water that flowed into the lake over the five days, in cubic meters. To get the exact value, we therefore take the limit as n →∞. In other words,
 = area under graph of f for 0 ≤ t ≤ 120
= volume of water that flowed into lake over five days, in m3.
Later in this chapter we will study methods for evaluating such limits. For the moment, we will simply be satisfied with having found a mathematical formula for the exact answer to our problem.
Limits of Riemann sums can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. Here's another example. Consider a piece of wire that is 10 centimeters long. The density of the wire measures the mass of the wire per unit of length. If mass is measured in grams (abbreviated g) and length in centimeters (abbreviated cm), then density is measured in grams per centimeter (g/cm). For example, if the density of the wire is 3 g/cm, then since the length of the wire is 10 cm, the total mass of the wire is 3 · 10 = 30 g.
But now suppose the density of the wire varies from one point to another. How can we compute the total mass of the wire? We will imagine that the wire is marked off in centimeters as a number line, with one end labeled 0 and the other labeled 10. Each point on the wire corresponds to some number in the interval [0, 10]. For each x in this interval, let h(x) be the density of the wire, in g/cm, at the point corresponding to x.
For each positive integer n, we can now compute an approximation to the mass of the wire as follows. We divide the wire into n pieces, each of width △x = 10/n. For 0 ≤ i ≤ n, let xi = i△x. Then for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, the i th piece of the wire corresponds to the interval [xi−1, xi ]. Next, we choose a sample point  The density at this sample point is  but if n is large, and therefore △x is small, then the density probably doesn't vary a great deal over the interval [xi−1, xi ], so we will not be making a large error if we assume that the density is  over this entire interval. Under this assumption, since the length of the i th piece of the wire is △x cm, the mass of this piece is  Adding up the contributions of all the pieces, we conclude that the mass of the wire, in grams, is approximately

Of course, this is a Riemann n-sum for h on the interval [0, 10].
We now have a sequence  of approximations to the mass of the wire. Each of these approximations could also be thought of as an approximation to the area under the graph of the curve y = h(x), for 0 ≤ x ≤ 10. As n increases, we expect these approximations to improve. Thus, to get the exact answer we use a limit:
 = area under graph of h for 0 ≤ x ≤ 10
= total mass of the wire, in grams.
We will consider one more example of the use of Riemann sums. Your house is probably connected to an electrical grid from which it draws electrical power. For example, if you turn on ten 100-watt light bulbs, then these bulbs will draw 10 · 100 = 1000 watts of electrical power, or 1 kilowatt (kW), from the electrical grid. If you leave the bulbs on for an hour, then they will use 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) of electrical energy. More generally, if the electrical devices in your house draw a constant P kilowatts of electrical power for d hours, then over this time they will use a total of Pd kWh of electrical energy. The electric meter on your house measures the total number of kilowatt hours of electrical energy you have taken from the grid, and the electric company charges you for each kilowatt hour.
Computing your electricity usage is easy if the devices in your house draw a constant level of power. But this is unlikely to happen. As you turn various electrical devices in your house on and off, the total electrical power drawn by these devices will vary over time. How, then, can we compute the total number of kilowatt hours of electrical energy used during some period of time?
To make our question precise, we introduce some notation. Let t denote time, measured in hours, and let g(t) be the number of kilowatts of power being drawn from the electrical grid by devices in your house at time t. For any numbers a < b, we would like to know how to compute the number of kilowatt hours of electrical energy you took from the grid during the time interval from t = a to t = b.
Before answering this question, we add one additional complication. If you install solar panels on the roof of your house, you can decrease the amount of electrical energy you need to buy from the electric company. In fact, if at some time your solar panels generate more electricity than you are using, then your electric company may allow you to supply electrical energy back to the electrical grid, and any electrical energy you supply will be subtracted from your total usage (and the cost of that electricity will be subtracted from your bill!). This means that for some values of t, g(t) may be negative. If g(t) = −P kW for a period of d hours, then during that time your electric meter will run backwards, and Pd kWh will be subtracted from your total electrical energy usage.
Now we are ready to compute the total number of kilowatt hours of electrical energy you took from the grid for a ≤ t ≤ b. By now, the procedure should look familiar. For each positive integer n, we divide the interval [a, b] into n smaller intervals, each of width △t = (b−a)/n. The intervals will be [a, a + △t], [a + △t, a + 2△t], and so on. Thus, if we let ti = a + i△t, then the i th interval is [ti−1, ti ]. Next, we choose sample points  and we assume that during each time period [ti−1, ti ], you drew a constant  kW of power from the grid. The electrical energy you took from the grid during this time period was therefore approximately  kWh (with a negative value indicating electrical energy that you supplied to the grid). Adding up the contributions of all of the time periods, we conclude that the total number of kilowatt hours of electrical energy that you took from the grid is about

Finally, to get an exact answer we let n →∞:
 = total electrical energy taken from grid, in kWh.
Can we also give a geometric interpretation of this limit in terms of area? Yes, but we will have to make some adjustments to take into account the fact that g(t) may be negative for some values of t. For example, consider the Riemann sum illustrated in Figure 5.5. The value of  in this case is negative. If we write  where P is positive, then the first red rectangle in the figure extends down P units below the t axis. Since the rectangle has width △t, its area is P△t. But the third term in the Riemann sum in equation (5.14) is  Thus, in the Riemann sum, this area is subtracted off, rather than being added in. Similarly, the areas of the other red rectangles are also subtracted. Thus, the Riemann sum gives the sum of the areas of the blue rectangles minus the areas of the red rectangles. As the number of rectangles increases, the Riemann sums will approach the area of the blue region in Figure 5.6 minus the area of the red region.


Figure 5.5: A Riemann 10-sum for the function g on the interval [a, b].



Figure 5.6: The limit of the Riemann sums is equal to the blue area minus the red area.

All of our examples in this section have something in common. In every case, we were measuring something that could be thought as accumulating. In the case of the stream, the water from the stream accumulated in the lake over a period of five days. If you imagine an ant walking along the wire from one end to the other, we could say that the mass of the wire accumulates behind the ant as it walks. And as you use electricity, your electrical usage accumulates in the read-out of your electric meter. In each case, we had information about the rate at which the quantity was accumulating: the flow rate of the stream describes the rate at which water accumulates in the lake, the density of the wire gives the rate at which mass accumulates behind the ant as it walks, and the electrical power you draw from the grid measures the rate at which you are using electrical energy. There are many other situations in which we have information about the rate at which something is accumulating, and in these situations we can always use a limit of Riemann sums to compute the total accumulation.

5.3 Definite Integrals
We now set aside the particular applications considered in the last section—water flowing into a lake, the mass of a wire, and electricity usage—and focus on the mathematical calculation that arose in all of these applications: limits of Riemann sums. We begin with a careful definition of the concept we will be studying.
Definition 5.3.1. Suppose that a < b, f is a function that is defined on the closed interval [a, b], and n is a positive integer. Let △x = (b−a)/n, and for 0 ≤ i ≤ n let xi = a + i△x. These numbers divide the interval [a, b] into n smaller intervals [x0, x1], [x1, x2], ..., [xn−1, xn], each of width △x. Also, suppose that for 1 ≤ i ≤ n,  ∈ [xi−1, xi ]. Then the sum

is called a Riemann sum for f on the interval [a, b]. We may also call it a Riemann n-sum if we want to specify the number of terms in the sum.
Suppose that, for each positive integer n, Rn is a Riemann n-sum for f on [a, b]. Then we will say that  is a Riemann sum sequence for f on [a, b].
Recall that different choices of the sample points  may lead to different Riemann sums, and therefore there may be many different Riemann sum sequences for a given function f and interval [a, b]. If  is a Riemann sum sequence for a function f on an interval [a, b], then we will usually be interested in evaluating limn→∞ Rn. There are a couple of worries we might have about this limit. Might the limit be undefined in some cases? Even if it is defined, might different Riemann sum sequences for the same function have different limits? It turns out that if we stick to continuous functions then these awkward situations will not arise:
Theorem 5.3.2. Suppose that a < b and f is a function that is continuous on the closed interval [a, b]. Then every Riemann sum sequence for f on [a, b] converges, and all such sequences converge to the same number. In other words, there is some number L such that if  is any Riemann sum sequence for f on [a, b], then limn→∞ Rn = L.
The proof of Theorem 5.3.2 is difficult; we will present it at the end of this chapter. For the moment we will simply accept the theorem and see where it leads us. Clearly the number L in the theorem is important and deserves a name.
Definition 5.3.3. Suppose that a < b and f is continuous on [a, b]. Then the number L that is the limit of all Riemann sum sequences for f on [a, b] is called the definite integral of f from a to b, and it is denoted  In other words, for any Riemann sum sequence ,

The number a is called the lower limit1 of integration, b is called the upper limit of integration, and f(x) is called the integrand.
More informally, in the notation of Definition 5.3.1 we can say that for large n,

The expression f(x) dx on the left is supposed to remind you of the formula  that appears in the Riemann sum on the right. The symbol ∫ is called an integral sign. It is an elongated S, which is intended to remind you that the expression on the right is a sum. The dx at the end of the integral notation, like the dx in the notation dy/dx, serves to identify the independent variable. It is an important part of the notation for integrals, and must not be left out. In particular, we will see in Section 5.5 that it plays an important role in the method of integration by substitution.
More advanced books use a somewhat more complicated definition of definite integrals. However, Definition 5.3.3 will be adequate for our purposes in this book.
In thinking about definite integrals, it may help to keep in mind the geometric interpretation discussed in the last section. If f(x) is positive for all values of x, then  is equal to the area of the region under the graph of f for a ≤ x ≤ b. If f(x) is not always positive, then we divide the region between the graph of f and the x-axis for a ≤ x ≤ b into two parts, the part above the x-axis and the part below. The value of  is equal to the area of the part above the x-axis minus the area of the part below.

Solution. Suppose n is a positive integer. We begin by computing all of the quantities mentioned in Definition 5.3.1. We have f(x) = 2− x/2, a = 0, and b = 6, so △x = (b−a)/n = (6−0)/n = 6/n. Next, the points that divide the interval [0, 6] into n smaller intervals are given by the formula

Finally, we must choose the sample points  According to Theorem 5.3.2, it doesn't matter what choice we make; all choices will lead to the same value when we take the limit of the Riemann n-sum as n →∞. We can therefore make the choice that seems simplest. We will let  (To find out what happens with an alternative choice, see Exercise 7.)
We can now work out a formula for the Riemann sum:

Notice that in this summation, n is a constant; as i runs through all the values from 1 to n, n doesn't change. We can therefore use Theorem 5.1.1 and equations (5.2) and (5.4) to evaluate the sum:

Finally, to evaluate the definite integral we take the limit as n →∞:

The graph of the equation y = 2− x/2 is shown in Figure 5.7, and according to the geometric interpretation we have given for definite integrals, the value of  should be equal to the area of the blue triangle in this figure minus the area of the red triangle. The blue triangle has base 4 and height 2, so its area is  Similarly, the area of the red triangle is  so
(area of blue triangle) −(area of red triangle) =  exactly as expected.
Example 5.3.5. Evaluate



Figure 5.7: The graph of y = 2− x/2 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 6. The value of  is equal to the area of the blue triangle minus the area of the red triangle.

Solution. In this example we have f(x) = x2 −2x, a = −1, and b = 2. As before, for any positive integer n we let △x = (b−a)/n = 3/n, and for 0 ≤ i ≤ n we let

We once again choose  This choice leads to the Riemann sum

Finally, we take the limit as n →∞to get the value of the integral:

All that work for nothing! What does it mean that the value of the integral is 0? Since the integral is the blue area minus the red area in Figure 5.8, the blue and red areas must be exactly equal.
The examples we have done illustrate that computing a definite integral of even a fairly simple function by using the definition can be quite difficult. As with limits and derivatives, we need to look for theorems that will make the computation of definite integrals easier. Since definite integrals are so closely related to summations, we begin with an analogue of our main theorem about summations, Theorem 5.1.1:
Theorem 5.3.6. Suppose that a < b, f and g are continuous on [a, b], and c is any real number. Then:



Figure 5.8: The graph of y = x2 −2x for −1 ≤ x ≤ 2. Since  the blue area and the red area are exactly equal.

Proof. Each of the three parts can be proven by applying the corresponding part of Theorem 5.1.1 to the Riemann sums involved. We illustrate this by proving part 2.
For any positive integer n, as usual we let △x = (b−a)/n and xi = a + i△x, and we choose sample points  Using these sample points, we get the following Riemann sums for f and g on [a, b]:

We can also use these sample points to compute a Riemann sum for f + g:

where we have used part 2 of Theorem 5.1.1 in the second step. Finally, by the definition of definite integrals, we have

Unfortunately, as with summations, we don't have similar theorems for dealing with products and quotients. In other words, there are no simple formulas relating


Figure 5.9: The graph of the function f in Theorem 5.3.7. The area of the region that is shaded blue is 

 and  to  and  However, there are a few other basic properties of definite integrals that we will find useful. For the first of these, recall that, according to the extreme value theorem, if f is continuous on the interval [a, b] then it has a maximum value and a minimum value on that interval. Our next theorem, which is illustrated in Figure 5.9, says that these values can be used to get some idea of the size of the definite integral.
Theorem 5.3.7. Suppose that a < b and f is continuous on [a, b].Letm be the minimum value of f on [a, b], and let M be the maximum value. Then

Proof. For any positive integer n, let

be a Riemann n-sum for f, where all notation is as in Definition 5.3.1. Since M is the maximum value of f on [a, b], for every i we have  and therefore

Taking the limit as n→∞(and applying the preservation of weak inequalities by limits), we conclude that

Similar reasoning establishes the other inequality in the theorem.
A useful consequence of this theorem is the following corollary.
Corollary 5.3.8. Suppose that a < b, f and g are continuous on [a, b], and for all x ∈ [a, b], f(x) ≤ g(x). Then 
Proof. We will apply Theorem 5.3.7 to the function g − f. For all x ∈ [a, b] we have f(x) ≤ g(x), and therefore g(x)− f(x) ≥ 0. It follows that if we let m be the minimum value of g − f on [a, b], then m ≥ 0. Applying Theorem 5.3.7, we conclude that

and therefore 
There is one more theorem about definite integrals that we will find useful in the next section. Consider the function whose graph is shown in Figure 5.10. The region under the graph between x = a and x = c, which is shaded blue, comes in two parts: the part to the left of x = b, which has stripes with positive slope, and the part to the right, which has stripes with negative slope. If we add the areas of the two striped parts, we should get the area of the entire blue region. This suggests that the following theorem should be true:
Theorem 5.3.9. Suppose that a < b < c, and f is continuous on [a, c]. Then

Although the interpretation of definite integrals in terms of areas is a useful guide to intuition, it is important to remember that it is not how we defined definite integrals. By definition, a definite integral is a limit of Riemann sums. Thus, although Figure 5.10 makes Theorem 5.3.9 very plausible, a rigorous proof of the theorem must show that the appropriate limits of Riemann sums satisfy the equation in the theorem. The details of this proof are a little tricky, so we will put it off until the end of this chapter.


Figure 5.10: The graph of the function f in Theorem 5.3.9. The area of the blue region is  The part of this region where the stripes have positive slope is  and the part where the stripes have negative slope is 

So far we have defined  only when a < b, but it will turn out to be useful to extend the definition to the case a ≥ b as well. Suppose we try to carry out the calculations in Definition 5.3.1 even when a ≥ b. For any positive integer n, we can still let △x = (b−a)/n and xi = a + i△x. We can still choose sample points  between xi−1 and xi and form the sum

What will the result be?
If a = b, then for every n we will have △x = (b−a)/n = 0, and therefore the sum (5.15) will be 0. It therefore seems reasonable that in this case  should be defined to be 0. We could think of it as representing the area of a region of width 0.
If a > b, then △x = (b−a)/n will be negative. The numbers xi for 0 ≤ i ≤ n will still be evenly spaced between a and b, but they will run from right to left on the x-axis rather than left to right. As a result, we will have rather than  The sum (5.15) will be just like a Riemann sum for the definite integral  except that △x will be negative. Thus, instead of adding up the areas of rectangles above the x-axis and subtracting the areas of rectangles below, we will be adding up the areas of rectangles below the x-axis and subtracting the areas of rectangles above. As n →∞, it appears that the sum (5.15) will approach −
The claims we have just made can be justified more carefully, but we won't bother, because we have presented this discussion for motivational purposes only. The simplest way to proceed is simply to take the values suggested by this discussion to be the definition of  when a ≥ b.
Definition 5.3.10. For a ≥ b, we define  as follows:
1. If a = b then 
2. If a > b then 
Notice that according to this definition, whether a < b, a > b, or a = b, the equation  holds. As evidence of the merit of the definition, we note that Theorem 5.3.9 can now be extended.
Theorem 5.3.9, Extended. Suppose f is continuous on an interval I, and a, b, and c are numbers in I. Then

Proof. Of course, we already know that this theorem holds if a < b < c. We can prove the theorem by considering all other possible orderings of the numbers a, b, and c. Checking all of the possibilities is a bit tedious, so we will just check a couple of cases.
Suppose first that b < a < c. Then by the original version of Theorem 5.3.9 we know that

Combining this with Definition 5.3.10, we have

as required.
Next, suppose that a = b > c. Then

once again confirming the theorem.
We leave it to you to check that the requirement a < b can also be eliminated from Theorem 5.3.6 (see Exercise 10):
Theorem 5.3.6, Extended. Suppose that f and g are continuous on an interval I, a and b are numbers in I, and c is any number. Then:

5.4 The Fundamental Theorems of Calculus
In this section we will discover a remarkable shortcut for evaluating definite integrals. We begin by returning to the integral we evaluated in Example 5.3.5,  We plan to use the variable x for another purpose in this section, so it will be convenient to eliminate x from this integral. Fortunately, the value of the integral will be unchanged if we replace the variable x with a different variable, say t. In other words,

To see why this equation makes sense, recall the interpretation of  in terms of the graph of y = x2 −2x for −1 ≤ x ≤ 2. This graph is shown in Figure 5.8, and the value of the integral is the blue area in this figure minus the red area. The graph of y = t2 −2t for −1 ≤ t ≤ 2 is exactly the same, except that the horizontal axis is labeled t rather than x. Of course, changing the label on the horizontal axis in Figure 5.8 has no effect on the areas of the blue and red regions, and therefore changing the variable in the integral from x to t has no effect on the value of the integral.
A more careful way to verify equation (5.16) is to work out the Riemann sums involved. Let f(x) = x2 − 2x. Recall that in Example 5.3.5, we evaluated  by letting △x = (2−(−1))/n = 3/n and  −1+i△x = −1+3i/n, and then computing the Riemann n-sum

To evaluate  we would similarly let △t = 3/n and ti = −1+i△t = −1+3i/n, and then we would compute the Riemann n-sum

Notice that the letters x and t have disappeared from these Riemann sums—these letters do not appear on the right-hand sides of equations (5.17) and (5.18)—and the two sums are identical. Therefore the two integrals in equation (5.16) are equal. The variables x and t in these integrals, like the variable i in the Riemann sums, are dummy variables.
Now, how can we find a shortcut for evaluating  Recall the paradox of generalization: when we were studying derivatives, we found that it was easier to find the general formula for the rate of change of f(x) at any value of x than to find the rate of change at a particular value of x. In other words, it was easier to find f ′(x) than to find, say, f ′(2). Let's see if the same thing is true for definite integrals: instead of computing  let's try computing  for any x > −1. It seems that this should make the problem harder—indeed, initially the computation will get harder. But don't let this brief setback discourage you; eventually we will discover that, paradoxically, generalizing makes the problem easier.
To compute for any x > −1, we let △t = (x −(−1))/n = (x + 1)/n and  Next, we compute the Riemann n-sum Rn. To keep the calculations from getting too complicated, we won't fill in the formula for △t right away.

To simplify further, we now need to fill in the formula for △t:

At this point, we can compute the limit as n →∞ before simplifying further:

Our final conclusion is that

Although we assumed x > −1 in our calculations, it can be shown that this formula is actually correct for all values of x.
There's something surprising about this answer: x3/3− x2 +4/3 happens to be an antiderivative of our original integrand f(x) = x2 −2x. Why would an antiderivative show up as the answer? The calculation we did seems to have absolutely nothing to do with derivatives. Is it just a coincidence that we ended up with an antiderivative? No, it is an example of a general pattern:
Theorem 5.4.1 (First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus). Suppose f is continuous on an interval I and a ∈ I. For all x ∈ I let

Then F is an antiderivative of f on I.
Proof. To prove the theorem we have to verify that for all x ∈ I, F′(x) = f(x), where we use appropriate one-sided derivatives at any endpoints that are included in I. We compute F′(x) by computing the two one-sided derivatives separately, using the definition of derivative. We begin by showing that if x is not the right endpoint of I, then

Since we are assuming that x is not the right endpoint of I, if h > 0 and h is close to 0 then x +h ∈ I. We can therefore use Theorem 5.3.9 to compute F(x + h)− F(x):

Next, we use Theorem 5.3.7 to estimate the last integral above. Since f is continuous on I and [x, x +h] is contained in I, f is continuous on [x, x +h], and therefore it has a minimum value and a maximum value on that interval. Let mh be the minimum value of f on [x, x +h], attained at some number ch ∈ [x, x +h], and let Mh be the maximum value, attained at some Ch ∈ [x, x +h]. We have put a subscript h on all of these variables to remind you that they depend on h; as h varies, the numbers ch, mh = f (ch), Ch, and Mh = f (Ch) will vary as well. By Theorem 5.3.7,

In other words,
f (ch)h ≤ F(x +h)− F(x) ≤ f (Ch)h.
This inequality is illustrated in Figure 5.11. Dividing through by the positive number h, we have

Inequality (5.19) suggests that we might be able to use the squeeze theorem to complete the proof. To do this we must compute the limits of f (ch) and f (Ch) as h →0+. Since ch ∈ [x, x +h], we have
x ≤ ch ≤ x +h.
As h →0+, x +h → x>, and therefore by the squeeze theorem ch → x≥. But f is continuous from the right at x, so by Theorem 2.7.12 it follows that f (ch) → f(x). In other words,



Figure 5.11: The graph of the function f in Theorem 5.4.1. The area of the region that is shaded gray is F(x), and the area of the region that is shaded blue is F(x + h)− F(x).

Similarly, as h → 0+, Ch → x≥, and therefore

Applying the squeeze theorem to inequality (5.19), we conclude that

Similar reasoning can be used to show that if x is not the left endpoint of I then

(see Exercise 15). Combining our results for the two one-sided derivatives, we conclude that F is an antiderivative of f on I.
The first fundamental theorem of calculus gives us a way of producing an antiderivative for any continuous function on any interval. An important consequence of the theorem is that continuous functions always have antiderivatives. Continuous functions are not always differentiable, but they are always "antidifferentiable":
Corollary 5.4.2. Suppose f is continuous on an interval I. Then f has an antiderivative on I.
Proof. Let a be any number in I, and for x ∈ I let  Then by the first fundamental theorem of calculus, F is an antiderivative of f on I.
For example, consider the function  We will let you verify that the domain of f is the interval I = [−1,∞), and that f is continuous on this domain. Now for x ≥ −1 let

Then F √is an antiderivative of f on [−1,∞). In other words, for all x > −1, F′(x) =  and  It would be very difficult to evaluate the integral in equation (5.20) by taking a limit of Riemann sums, and therefore we have no simpler formula for F (x) than (5.20). But even without a simpler formula for F (x), we know what F′(x) is.
Now consider the function

Since x2 is always nonnegative, G(x) is defined for all values of x, and we have

Again, we have no simple formula for G(x), but we can find its derivative. By the chain rule,

Let's try one more example. For all x, let

Then by the first fundamental theorem of calculus,
H′(x) = x3 −4x.
In this case, we can actually determine a formula for H (x) by antidifferentiating. We know that one antiderivative of x3 −4x on the interval (−∞,∞) is x4/4−2x2, and all other antiderivatives can be found by adding a constant to this formula. Thus, there must be some constant C such that for all x,

Is there any way to find the value of C? In the past, we have always done this by filling in a known value of the function. Is there any value of H that we know? Yes, one value is easy to compute:

Filling in this value in equation (5.21), we have

and therefore C = 7/4. In other words, we have shown that

For example, taking x = 2 we have

Something truly amazing just happened, and it happened so quickly and effortlessly that you might not have noticed. We just found the value of a definite integral without having to compute any Riemann sums! You could compute the value of the integral in equation (5.22) by taking a limit of Riemann sums—you are asked to do this calculation in Exercise 13. But we have found the answer by a much easier method.
Let's see if we can turn the calculation we did in this example into a general method for evaluating definite integrals. Suppose f is continuous on an interval I that contains two numbers a and b, and we wish to compute  Since the variable x in this integral is a dummy variable, we can switch to a different variable without changing the value of the integral:

Now we generalize the problem we are trying to solve. For all x ∈ I we define

We want to find H (b), but it turns out it is easier to find the general formula for H (x) than it is to find the particular value H (b). (The paradox of generalization strikes again!) What makes it easier to find H (x) than H (b) is the first fundamental theorem of calculus: we know that H is an antiderivative of f on the interval I.
Suppose we happen to know an antiderivative F of f on I. Then by Theorem 4.9.6, there is some constant C such that for all x ∈ I,

To find C, we evaluate H at the easiest number:

Substituting into equation (5.23) we get
0 = H(a) = F(a)+C,
and therefore C = −F(a). Filling in this value for C in equation (5.23), we find that
H(x) = F(x)− F(a),
or in other words

Now that we have solved the general problem, we can finally fill in the particular value we wanted:

We have just proven the following theorem:
Theorem 5.4.3 (Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus). Suppose f is a function that is continuous on an interval I and F is an antiderivative of f on I. Then for any numbers a and b in I,

Example 5.4.4. Evaluate

Solution. We computed this integral in Example 5.3.5 by means of a somewhat messy Riemann sum calculation, and found that the answer was 0. Now we know a much easier method.
If we let f(x) = x2 −2x, then one antiderivative of f on (−∞,∞) is F(x) = x3/3− x2. Therefore, by the second fundamental theorem of calculus,

Since the difference F (b)− F (a) will come up whenever we apply the second fundamental theorem of calculus, it will be convenient to have notation for it. This difference is often denoted either  In other words,

Using this notation, we could rewrite our solution to Example 5.4.4 like this:

Example 5.4.5. Evaluate the following definite integrals:

Solution. For integral (a), we need an antiderivative of 1/x2 = x−2. By Theorem 4.9.7, one antiderivative is given by the formula x−1/(−1) = −1/x. This is an antiderivative on each of the intervals (−∞, 0) and (0,∞); for the evaluation of integral (a), we use (0,∞) as the interval I in the second fundamental theorem of calculus:

Notice that it was crucial in this calculation that 1 and 3 both belong to an interval I, namely I = (0,∞), for which the hypotheses of the second fundamental theorem hold: the integrand 1/x2 is continuous on this interval, and −1/x is an antiderivative of 1/x2 on the interval. Thus, we could not have used the second fundamental theorem to evaluate, say,  Indeed, since 1/x2 is not continuous on the interval [−1, 3], our Definition 5.3.3 does not even apply to this last integral. Later in this book we will extend our definition of the definite integral to include some discontinuous integrands, but for the moment we regard this integral as simply meaningless.
For integral (b), we apply the second fundamental theorem of calculus with the variable θ replacing x. Since  the value of the integral is

What makes integral (c) difficult is the use of the absolute value function. As usual, we deal with this by considering the values of x in the interval [0, 2] for which x2 −1 is positive and negative separately. We have

Therefore, by Theorem 5.3.9,

Example 5.4.6. An object moves along a number line (which is marked off in feet) in such a way that its velocity at time t (measured in seconds) is given by the formula

What is the displacement of the object from t = 0 to t = 8? (Recall that the displacement of the object is the change in its position.)
Solution. We will give two solutions to this problem.
Solution 1. Let s(t) be the position of the object on the number line at time t. Then

and by antidifferentiating we conclude that

for some constant C. Therefore the displacement of the object is

Solution 2. If an object moves at a constant velocity of v ft/sec for d seconds, its displacement will be vd feet. The velocity of the object in this problem varies over time, so we use Riemann sums to approximate its displacement. For each positive integer n, we divide the time interval [0, 8] into n smaller intervals, each of width △t = 8/n. As usual, we let ti = i△t, and we choose sample points  If n is large, so that △t is small, then the velocity of the object won't vary much over the time interval from t = ti−1 to t = ti, so we can approximate the displacement of the object over this time interval by assuming that the velocity is a constant  ft/sec throughout the interval. The displacement over the interval [ti−1, ti ] is therefore about  ft. The displacement from t = 0 to t = 8 is the sum of the displacements over all of these smaller intervals, so it is approximately

Of course, this is a Riemann sum for v on the interval [0, 8]. The approximation gets better and better as n increases, so the exact displacement is

We now evaluate this integral by the second fundamental theorem of calculus:

When we proved the fundamental theorems of calculus, we suggested that these theorems were very surprising. But Example 5.4.6 suggests that perhaps they aren't so surprising after all. There are two ways of approaching the problem of finding the displacement of the moving object in the example. According to the first approach, the displacement is s(8)−s(0), where s is an antiderivative of the velocity v. According to the second approach, the displacement is  Of course, these two approaches should give the same answer, and this is exactly what the second fundamental theorem says.

5.5 Integration by Substitution
According to the second fundamental theorem of calculus, if F is an antiderivative of a continuous function f on an interval I, then F can be thought of as giving a general formula for computing definite integrals of f; for any numbers a and b in I, we can compute  by applying F to b and a and subtracting. For this reason, antiderivatives are also often written using an integral sign. If F is an antiderivative of f on an interval I, then we write

The integral in equation (5.24) is called an indefinite integral—indefinite because no limits of integration a and b have been specified. It is customary to include the " +C" in the formula on the right side of equation (5.24) so that it gives the general formula for all antiderivatives of f on I.
In practice, mathematicians rarely specify the interval on which an indefinite integral applies. The notation ∫ f(x) dx = F (x)+C is usually used in situations in which the domain of f is a union of intervals, and F is an antiderivative of f on every interval contained in the domain of f. These intervals can be determined from the formula for f(x), so there is no need to specify them. For example, we would write

to indicate that −1/x + C is the general formula for all antiderivatives of the function f(x) = 1/x2 on each of the two intervals (−∞, 0) and (0,∞) that make up the domain of f.
In this book, we will generally use the notation ∫ f(x) dx only when f is continuous on every interval contained in its domain. Corollary 5.4.2 guarantees that any such function will have an indefinite integral on each of these intervals. Our only problem, then, is finding it.
Unfortunately, finding indefinite integrals is significantly harder than finding derivatives. However, checking the correctness of an indefinite integral is usually easy: to check the correctness of the equation ∫ f(x) dx = F (x)+C, we just have to verify that  For example, to check the correctness of equation (5.25),

Table 5.5: Some indefinite integrals.
we compute

It might be helpful to summarize what we know about antiderivatives at this point, writing everything in our new indefinite integral notation. First of all, we know the indefinite integrals listed in Table 5.5. We can also summarize Theorem 4.9.8 as saying that if f and g have indefinite integrals on some interval I—for example, if they are continuous on I—and c is any number, then on I,

For example, equation (5.26b) tells us that on any interval, if  and

To find indefinite integrals, we will need to reverse our rules for computing derivatives. For example, equations (5.26a)-(5.26c) can be thought of as the reversal of Theorem 3.3.2. One of the most important techniques for computing indefinite integrals is the result of reversing the chain rule. Suppose F is differentiable on an interval I, g is differentiable on an interval J, and for every x ∈ J, g(x) ∈ I. Then according to the chain rule on intervals (Theorem 4.9.5), F ◦ g is differentiable on J, and for all x ∈ J,  In other words, the following statement is true:

Reversing the two derivatives in this statement, we get the following statement about indefinite integrals:

For example, suppose we want to evaluate the indefinite integral

If we let f (u) = u7 and g(x) = x2 +1, then g′(x) = 2x, and therefore the integral can be written

Motivated by (5.27), we compute

Thus, if we let F(u) = u8/8, then we have ∫ f (u) du = F(u)+C, and statement (5.27) (with I = J = (−∞,∞)) tells us that the answer to our original integral is

We can confirm this answer by differentiating:

Of course, the factor of 2x in this derivative came from the chain rule. Since we used the chain rule backwards to find the answer to this indefinite integral, it is not surprising that we used the chain rule forwards when checking it.
It will be convenient to develop a symbolic procedure for applying statement(5.27).
If we are faced with an integral of the form

then the first step of our procedure will be to replace g(x) with u and g′(x) dx with du, which will convert our integral into

Suppose we are able to evaluate this new integral, getting the solution

Then we just have to replace u in this solution with g(x) to get F (g(x))+C, and, according to (5.27), we will have the right answer for the original integral.
As a guide to the substitutions involved in this procedure, we will write the equations u = g(x) and du = g′(x) dx. The first of these equations can be thought of as introducing the new variable u into the problem and specifying what it stands for. We will not try to give an interpretation for the second equation, since we have not assigned any meaning to the symbols du and dx by themselves. We think of it as just a symbolic guide, telling us that in our integral notation, du should be substituted for g′(x) dx.
For example, using this symbolic procedure, here is how we could rewrite our solution to the integral  We begin by writing the equations u = g(x) = x2 +1 and du = g(x) dx = 2x dx. Making the substitutions suggested by these equations in our integral, we can write our solution like this:

This method of evaluating integrals is called integration by substitution.
Let's try another example of integration by substitution. Suppose we want to find

We let u = x3 +2, so that du = 3x2 dx. Then we have

Recall that, although the Leibniz derivative notation du/dx is not really a fraction, the chain rule says that in some ways it acts like one. Integration by substitution can be thought of as another instance of this phenomenon. If u = g(x), then

Now, if we pretend that du/dx is a fraction, then we can "multiply both sides by dx" to get
du = g′(x) dx.
Again, this is not correct, or even meaningful. But the method of integration by substitution says that if we pretend it is, then we can get correct answers for indefinite integrals.
The hardest part of the method of integration by substitution is deciding what formula to use for u. A good guideline is that u should be substituted for some expression g(x) appearing in the integral whose derivative g′(x) also appears in the integral. Sometimes if g′(x) doesn't appear exactly, it is possible to make small adjustments to make the method work. For example, let's evaluate

The quantity x2 −4 appears in the integral, and its derivative is 2x, which almost appears as well—only the factor of 2 is missing. So we try the substitution u = x2 −4, du = 2x dx, and make adjustments for the missing factor of 2:

Notice that in this substitution, x dx got replaced by (1/2) · 2x dx, which was then replaced by (1/2) du. Another way to get the same result would have been to rewrite the original substitution equation du = 2x dx as (1/2) du = x dx.
In integral notation, mathematicians often treat the symbol "dx" as if it were a quantity that the integrand is being multiplied by. For example, when the integrand is a fraction, mathematicians sometimes include the "dx" in the numerator of the fraction, rather than putting it after the fraction. We use this convention in part (c) of the next example.
Example 5.5.1. Find the following indefinite integrals:

Solution. For integral (a), we use the substitution

This leads to the solution

The substitution for (b) is perhaps harder to see, but it turns out that the choice u = cos x works. This gives us du = −sin x dx, or equivalently (−1) du = sin x dx, so

Finally, for part (c), since 2x +1 appears inside the square root, we try

So in integral (c) we can replace  by  and dx by (1/2) du. But what about the x in the numerator? Can we also express it in terms of u? Yes: since u = 2x +1, we have x = (u −1)/2. Therefore

Notice that in integration by substitution, the integral  which involves only the variable x, is converted into the integral  which involves only the variable u. We never have an integral that contains both of the variables x and u. That's why it was important, in part (c) of Example 5.5.1, that we were able to rewrite the x in the numerator in terms of u. If you are trying to evaluate an integral by the method of substitution and you find that you are unable to convert the entire integral from one variable to another, then you need to try a different method of evaluating the integral.
For example, consider the integral

Motivated by the similarity between this integral and the one in part (b) of Example 5.5.1, we might try the substitution u = cos x, du = −sin x dx, (−1) du = sin x dx. If we rewrite the integral as

then we can replace (cos x)−2 with u−2 and sin x dx with (−1) du. But there's another factor of sin x, and there is no easy way to express this in terms of u. Thus, this substitution won't allow us to find the integral. However, it turns out that a completely different approach works for this integral; see Exercise 15.
In some cases you may find it necessary to do two substitutions in succession. For example, consider the integral

A good first step is the substitution 

But now how can we evaluate the last integral? Another substitution will do it: v = sin u, dv = cos u du:

Returning to our original integral, we conclude that

Integration by substitution can also help us to evaluate definite integrals:
Example 5.5.2. Evaluate

Solution. We begin by finding the indefinite integral, using the substitution u = x2 −1, du = 2x dx, (1/2) du = x dx:

Now we use this indefinite integral to evaluate the original definite integral:

While this solution is correct, there is an easier way. The easier way is based on the following theorem:
Theorem 5.5.3. Suppose f is continuous on an interval I, g is differentiable on an interval J, g′ is continuous on J, and for every x ∈ J, g(x) ∈ I. Then for any a and b in J,

Proof. Notice that since a and b are in J and g maps elements of J to elements of I, g(a) and g(b) are in I. Also, the hypotheses of the theorem guarantee that f (g(x)) · g′(x) is continuous on J and f (u) is continuous on I. Therefore we can use the second fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate both definite integrals in the theorem. We will show that this evaluation leads to the same answer for both integrals.
We begin with the second integral. Since f is continuous on I, it has an antiderivative F on I. Therefore by the second fundamental theorem,

For the first integral, we use the chain rule on intervals. Since F is differentiable on I and g is differentiable on J, the chain rule on intervals tells us that F ◦ g is differentiable on J, and (F ◦ g)′(x) = F′(g(x)) · g′(x) = f (g(x)) · g′(x). In other words, F (g(x)) is an antiderivative of f (g(x)) · g′(x) on J, and therefore

Thus, the values of the two integrals are the same.
Let's evaluate  the definite integral from Example 5.5.2, using Theorem 5.5.3. In the example, we used the substitution u = g(x) = x2 −1, (1/2) du = x dx. The limits of integration were a = 0 and b = 3, and Theorem 5.5.3 says that when we do the substitution, we should change these to
g(a) = g(0)= −1, g(b) = g(3) = 8.
Thus,

Notice that after we found the antiderivative of (1/2)u1/3, there was no need to put this antiderivative back in terms of x; we merely had to substitute the new limits of integration for u and subtract. Indeed, it would have been incorrect to rewrite the antiderivative in terms of x. The new limits of integration, −1 and 8, are the u-values corresponding to the original limits of integration 0 and 3, so they must be substituted for u, not x. Thus, the advantage of using Theorem 5.5.3 to evaluate a definite integral is that once the substitution has been made, you can forget about not only the original integral but also the original variable of integration, and simply evaluate the new integral in terms of its new variable.
The lesson of this example is that there are two ways to evaluate a definite integral by substitution: you can evaluate the corresponding indefinite integral by substitution and then use this answer to evaluate the definite integral, or you can do the substitution in the definite integral by applying Theorem 5.5.3. The one thing you must not do is to perform the substitution in the definite integral without converting the limits of integration as required by Theorem 5.5.3; that would result in an integral in which the integrand was written in terms of the new variable but the limits of integration were values of the original variable, a situation that is bound to cause confusion.
Example 5.5.4. Evaluate

Solution. We give two solutions.
Solution 1. We first find the corresponding indefinite integral, using the substitution u = x2 −15, du = 2x dx. Notice that we have x2 = u +15 and x dx = (1/2) du.

Now we use this indefinite integral to evaluate the definite integral:

Solution 2. We use the substitution u = x2 −15 again, but this time we substitute in the definite integral, changing the limits of integration from the x-values 4 and 8 to the corresponding u-values 42 −15 = 1 and 82 −15 = 49:

(Hint: First rewrite sin2 x as 1−cos2 x.)
5.6Proofs of Theorems
At this point, we owe you the proofs of two theorems: Theorems 5.3.2 and 5.3.9. We have put off these proofs for two reasons: they require a subtle technical strengthening of the concept of continuity, and they also require a generalization of the idea of Riemann sums. Neither of these ideas will be needed anywhere else in this book. Readers who are willing to accept these two theorems without proof don't need to know about these ideas and can skip this section. But for those who want to see the proofs, we provide full details here.
We begin by reexamining the concept of continuity. To say that a function f is continuous at a number t means that as s → t, f (s) → f (t), which means that for every ϵ > 0 there is some δ > 0 such that if |s − t| < δ then | f (s)− f (t)| < ϵ. Recall that we think of ϵ as a challenge, and δ as a response to this challenge. Thus, for f to be continuous at t means that we can meet every challenge ϵ with an appropriate response δ. To say that f is continuous on an interval I means that for every t ∈ I, f is continuous at t (where we use one-sided continuity at endpoints of I). Thus, for f to be continuous on I means that for every t ∈ I, we can meet every challenge ϵ for continuity at t with an appropriate response δ. But for different values of t, the responses may be different. For example, for one value of t we might respond to any ϵ > 0 with δ = ϵ/3, and for another we might respond with δ = min(1, ϵ/7). A slight strengthening of the definition is to require that the δ responses be the same for all t. This leads to the following concept.
Definition 5.6.1. A function f is said to be uniformly continuous on an interval I if for every ϵ > 0 there is some δ > 0 such that for all s and t in I, if |s −t| < δ then | f (s)− f (t)| < ϵ.
It is not hard to show that if f is uniformly continuous on an interval I, then it is continuous on I (see Exercise 1). The converse does not hold: it is possible for a function to be continuous on an interval, but not uniformly continuous (see Exercise 5). However, this never happens on finite closed intervals:
Theorem 5.6.2. If f is continuous on a finite closed interval [a, b], then it is uniformly continuous on [a, b].
Proof. Suppose that f is continuous on [a, b], and suppose that ϵ > 0. We think of ϵ as a challenge, to be met with a response δ as specified in Definition 5.6.1. For any interval I contained in [a, b], we will say that the challenge ϵ can be met on I if there is some δ > 0 such that for all s and t in I, if |s − t| < δ then | f (s)− f (t)| < ϵ. To complete the proof, we must show that the challenge ϵ can be met on [a, b].
We will assume that the challenge ϵ cannot be met on [a, b] and derive a contradiction. The key to our proof is the following fact.
Lemma 5.6.3. Suppose that a ≤ u < v ≤ b, and the challenge ϵ cannot be met on [u, v]. Then there are numbers u′ and v′ such that u ≤ u′ < v' ≤ v, v′ −u′ = (v −u)/2, and the challenge ϵ cannot be met on [u′, v′].
Proof. Let w = (u + v)/2. We will show that the challenge ϵ cannot be met on one of the two intervals [u,w] and [w, v]. We can then let [u′, v′] be either [u,w] or [w, v]—whichever one is an interval on which the challenge cannot be met.
Suppose the challenge ϵ can be met on both of the intervals [u,w] and [w, v]. Then there are numbers δ1 > 0 and δ2 > 0 such that
(a) for all s and t in [u,w], if |s −t| < δ1 then | f (s)− f (t)| < ϵ;
(b) for all s and t in [w, v], if |s −t| < δ2 then | f (s)− f (t)| < ϵ.
Since f is continuous at w, we can also choose a number δ3 > 0 such that
(c) for all s, if |s − w| < δ3 then | f (s)− f (w)| < ϵ/2.
Now let δ = min(δ1, δ2, δ3). We will show that δ meets the challenge ϵ on [u, v]. To see why, suppose s and t belong to the interval [u, v] and |s −t| < δ. We consider four possibilities:
Case 1. s ≤ w, t ≤ w. Then s and t belong to [u,w] and |s − t| < δ ≤ δ1, so by statement (a), | f (s)− f (t)| < ϵ.
Case 2. s ≥ w, t ≥ w. Then s and t belong to [w, v] and |s − t| < δ ≤ δ2, so by statement (b), | f (s)− f (t)| < ϵ.
Case 3. s < w < t. Then |s −w| = w−s < t −s = |s − t| < δ ≤ δ3, so by statement (c), | f (s)− f (w)| < ϵ/2. Similarly, |t −w| < δ3, and therefore | f (w)− f (t)| < ϵ/2. Therefore by the triangle inequality,

Case 4. t < w < s. As in case 3, we can show that | f (s)− f (t)| < ϵ.
Thus we see that in every case | f (s)− f (t)| < ϵ, so δ meets the challenge ϵ on [u, v]. But we assumed that the challenge could not be met on [u, v], so this is impossible. Thus, the challenge ϵ cannot be met on either [u,w] or [w, v], which proves the lemma.
Continuing with the proof of Theorem 5.6.2, we assume that the challenge ϵ cannot be met on [a, b], and then we use the lemma to construct a nested sequence of intervals. Let u1 = a and v1 = b. Then the challenge ϵ cannot be met on [u1, v1], so by the lemma we can choose u2 and v2 so that u1 ≤ u2 < v2 ≤ v1, v2 −u2 = (v1 − u1)/2 = (b−a)/2, and the challenge ϵ cannot be met on [u2, v2]. Applying the lemma again, we see that there must be u3 and v3 such that u2 ≤ u3 < v3 ≤ v2, v3 −u3 = (v2 −u2)/2 = (b−a)/4, and the challenge ϵ cannot be met on [u3, v3]. Continuing in this way, we construct a nested sequence of intervals [un, vn] such that for every n, vn −un = (b−a)/2n−1 and the challenge ϵ cannot be met on [un, vn].
By the nested interval theorem, there is a number c such that for every n, un ≤ c ≤ vn, and limn→∞ un = limn→∞ vn = c. In particular, c ∈ [u1, v1] = [a, b], so f is continuous at c. (If either c = a or c = b, then f is continuous at c from only one side. We leave it to you to make appropriate adjustments in the proof to deal with these cases.) Since f is continuous at c, as s → c, f (s) → f (c), and therefore there must be some δ1 > 0 such that if |s −c| < δ1 then | f (s)− f (c)| < ϵ/2. And since limn→∞ un = limn→∞ vn = c, there must be some n large enough that
c−δ1 < un ≤ c ≤ vn < c+δ1.
But now for any s and t in [un, vn] we have |s −c| < δ1 and |t −c| < δ1, and therefore | f (s)− f (c)| < ϵ/2 and | f (t)− f (c)| < ϵ/2. As in case 3 of the proof of the lemma, we can use the triangle inequality to conclude that | f (s)− f (t)| < ϵ. It follows that the challenge ϵ can be met on the interval [un, vn] (indeed, any choice for δ would meet the challenge), contradicting the way that interval was chosen.
We conclude that our assumption that the challenge ϵ could not be met on [a, b] was incorrect, and therefore f is uniformly continuous on [a, b].
Next we turn to a generalization of the idea of Riemann sums. Suppose that f is a function that is continuous on an interval [a, b]—and therefore, by Theorem 5.6.2, uniformly continuous on [a, b]. In Section 5.3, to form a Riemann n-sum for f on [a, b] we defined numbers x0, x1, ..., xn that were evenly spaced between a and b. We now extend this idea by allowing the numbers to be spaced unevenly.
If x0, x1, ..., xn are any numbers such that
a = x0 < x1 < · · · < xn = b,
then we will say that the set P = {x0, x1, . . . , xn} is a partition of the interval [a, b]. As before, we think of the elements of P as dividing the interval [a, b] into n smaller intervals [x0, x1], [x1, x2], ..., [xn−1, xn]. However, since the numbers need not be evenly spaced, the widths of these smaller intervals may vary. We let △x1 = x1 − x0, △x2 = x2 − x1, and, in general, △xi = xi − xi−1 = the width of the i th interval.
The mesh of the partition is the largest of the numbers △x1, △x2, ..., △xn; that is,
mesh(P) = max(△x1,△x2, . . . ,△xn).
As usual, we choose sample points  and then we form the sum

In this section, and this section only, we extend the definition of Riemann sums to allow sums of this form. We will say that R is a Riemann sum for f based on the partition P, or, more briefly, a Riemann P-sum for f. As before, R can be interpreted in terms of adding and subtracting areas of rectangles, but now the widths of the rectangles may vary. The Riemann sums we studied previously had this form, but they were based on partitions with △x1 = △x2 = · · · = △xn = (b−a)/n. We will say that such partitions are uniform.
There are two ways of choosing the sample points for a Riemann sum that we will be particularly interested in. Since f is continuous on each interval [xi−1, xi ], it has a minimum value and a maximum value on each of these intervals. Suppose the minimum is attained at ci ∈ [xi−1, xi ], and the maximum is attained at Ci ∈ [xi−1, xi ]. Using these numbers as sample points, we can define two special Riemann sums based on P:

For any choice of sample points  we will have  and therefore

In other words, if R is any Riemann P-sum, then m P ≤ R ≤ MP. Thus, we can refer to m P and M P as the minimum and maximum Riemann P-sums for f. If m P = MP, then all Riemann P-sums are equal. If not, then m P and M P determine a closed interval [mP, M P ], and all Riemann P-sums belong to this interval.
If Q is another partition of [a, b] and P ⊆ Q, then we say that Q is a refinement of P. The partition Q includes all of the numbers in P, plus perhaps some more. Thus, each of the n pieces into which P divides the interval [a, b] may be divided into still smaller pieces in the partition Q. We would like to investigate the relationship between Riemann sums based on P and those based on Q.
We begin with the simplest case, in which Q is the result of adding just one more number to P. The new number will belong to one of the intervals in the partition P. Say the new number is t, and it belongs to the i th interval of P. In other words, xi−1 < t < xi, and Q = P ∪{t} = {x0, x1, . . . , xi−1, t, xi, . . . , xn}. Riemann sums based on Q will be exactly the same as Riemann sums based on P, except that the term in the P-sum for the interval [xi−1, xi ] will be replaced in the Q-sum by two terms, one for the interval [xi−1, t] and one for [t, xi ].
In particular, consider the minimum and maximum Riemann P-sums and Q-sums. As before, we assume that the minimum and maximum values of f on the interval [xi−1, xi ] are attained at ci and Ci, respectively. Suppose that the minimum and maximum on the interval [xi−1, t] are attained at  and  and the minimum and maximum on [t, xi ] are attained at  and  Then clearly

Also, let  and  and note that

Therefore

Since all remaining terms in the minimum and maximum Riemann sums are the same for the partition Q as for P, we conclude that
mP ≤ mQ ≤ MQ ≤ MP.
To summarize: when a number is added to a partition, the minimum Riemann sum can only increase, and the maximum Riemann sum can only decrease. If Q is a refinement of P, then we can add the extra elements of Q to P one at a time, and at each step the range of Riemann sums can only shrink. As a result, we have the following fact.
Lemma 5.6.4. If Q is a refinement of P, then
mP ≤ mQ ≤ MQ ≤ MP.
According to Lemma 5.6.4, when we refine a partition, the range of Riemann sums based on the partition might shrink. But will it actually shrink, and how small will it get? Our next lemma will help us to answer this question.
Lemma 5.6.5. Suppose that for every positive integer n, Pn is a partition of [a, b], and limn→∞ mesh(Pn) = 0. Then 
Proof. Suppose ϵ > 0. To prove that  we must find a number N such that if n is a positive integer and n > N then 
Since f is uniformly continuous on [a, b], there is some δ > 0 such that
(a) if s, t ∈ [a, b] and |s − t| < δ then 
And since limn→∞ mesh(Pn) = 0, there is some N such that
(b) if n is a positive integer and n > N then mesh(Pn) < δ.
Now suppose that n is a positive integer and n > N. By statement (b), this means that mesh(Pn) < δ. Suppose that Pn = {x0, x1, . . . , xk }, where a = x0 < x1 < · · · < xk = b. To find the minimum and maximum Riemann sums based on Pn, for 1 ≤ i ≤ k we let ci and Ci be the numbers where f attains its minimum and maximum values on [xi−1, xi ]. Notice that since ci and Ci both belong to [xi−1, xi] we have
|Ci −ci| ≤ xi − xi−1 = △xi ≤ mesh(Pn) < δ,
and therefore, by statement (a), f (Ci)− f (ci) = | f (Ci)− f (ci)| < ϵ/(b−a). Thus,

This is the result we needed to verify that limn→∞(MPn −mPn) = 0, so the proof is complete.
We now have all the background we need to prove Theorem 5.3.2.
Theorem 5.3.2 (restated). Suppose that a < b and f is a function that is continuous on the closed interval [a, b]. Then every Riemann sum sequence for f on [a, b] converges, and all such sequences converge to the same number. In other words, there is some number L such that if  is any Riemann sum sequence for f on [a, b], then limn→∞ Rn = L.
Proof. We begin by defining a sequence of partitions of [a, b]. Let Q1 be the uniform partition of [a, b] into 2 pieces, and let Q2 be the uniform partition into 4 pieces. Then Q2 is a refinement of Q1, since it can be obtained by taking each of the 2 pieces of the partition Q1 and cutting it in half. Similarly, if we cut each piece of Q2 in half then we get the uniform partition into 8 pieces, which we will call Q3. In general, we let Qn be the uniform partition of [a, b] into 2n pieces. Then for every n, Qn+1 is a refinement of Qn, obtained by cutting each piece of the partition Qn in half. Thus, by Lemma 5.6.4,

Also, notice that the mesh of Qn is (b−a)/2n. Therefore limn→∞ mesh(Qn) = 0, and by Lemma 5.6.5 it follows that

By the nested interval theorem, there is some number L such that for every n, We must prove now that if  is any Riemann sum sequence forf then limn→∞ Rn = L. Recall that according to the definition of Riemann sum sequences in Section 5.3, this means that Rn is a Riemann sum for the uniform partition of [a, b] into n pieces. We will actually prove a little more than what is stated in the theorem. We will show that even if the partitions are not uniform, as long as the meshes of the partitions approach 0, the Riemann sums will converge to L. In other words, we now prove the following lemma:
Lemma 5.6.6. Suppose that for every positive integer n, Pn is a partition of [a, b] and Rn is a Riemann sum for f based on the partition Pn. Suppose also that limn→∞ mesh(Pn) = 0. Then limn→∞ Rn = L.
Proof. Suppose ϵ > 0; we must find a number N such that if n is a positive integer and n > N then |Rn − L| < ϵ.
Since limn→∞ mesh(Pn) = 0, Lemma 5.6.5 tells us that  0, and therefore there is some N1 such that
(a) if n is a positive integer and n > N1 then 
Similarly, since there is some N2 such that
(b) if n is a positive integer and n > N2 then 
Let N = max(N1, N2), and suppose that n is a positive integer and n > N. Then n > N1 and n > N2, so by statements (a) and (b),we have

We also know that

What we need now is some relationship between the minimum and maximum Riemann sums for Pn and those for Qn. Unfortunately, it is possible that neither Pn nor Qn is a refinement of the other, so Lemma 5.6.4 is not directly applicable. What can we do?
Our solution will be to introduce a third partition that is a refinement of both Pn and Qn. It is easy to find such a partition: if we let S = Pn ∪ Qn, then S is a partition of [a, b] that is a refinement of both Pn and Qn. It follows, by Lemma 5.6.4, that


Thus, by the triangle inequality,

This completes the proof of the lemma.
To see that the lemma suffices to complete the proof of Theorem 5.3.2, suppose (Rn)∞n=1 is a Riemann sum sequence for f. Let Pn be the uniform partition of [a, b] into n pieces. Then Rn is a Riemann sum for f based on Pn and limn→∞ mesh(Pn) = limn→∞(b−a)/n = 0. Therefore, by Lemma 5.6.6, limn→∞ Rn = L, as required.
Of course, the number L in Theorem 5.3.2 is what we defined to be  Thus, our proof of Lemma 5.6.6 establishes the following fact:
Theorem 5.6.7. Suppose f is continuous on [a, b], and for every positive integer n, Pn is a partition of [a, b] and Rn is a Riemann sum for f based on Pn. If limn→∞ mesh(Pn) = 0, then

This turns out to be just what we need to prove Theorem 5.3.9.
Theorem 5.3.9 (restated). Suppose that a < b < c, and f is continuous on [a, c]. Then

Proof. For each positive integer n, let Pn be the uniform partition of [a, b] into n pieces, and let  be the uniform partition of [b, c] into n pieces. Let Rn be a Riemann sum for f based on Pn, and let  be a Riemann sum based on  Then Qn is a partition of [a, c], and  is a Riemann sum for f based on Qn. Note that Qn may not be uniform, but its mesh is

Therefore  so by Theorem 5.6.7,

To do this, show that for every δ > 0 there are numbers s and t in (0,∞) such that |s −t| < δ but | f (s)− f (t)| ≥ 1.)

1The use of the word "limit" here is somewhat unfortunate, since it has nothing to do with the mathematical concept of limits. However, it is standard terminology.







Chapter 6
Applications of Integration
6.1 Area Between Curves
In Section 5.2, we saw several examples of quantities that could be computed as limits of Riemann sums. In each case, the quantity could be approximated by breaking it into n pieces for some positive integer n, approximating the contribution of each piece, and then adding up these approximate contributions to get a Riemann n-sum. And the approximation could be improved by breaking the quantity into a larger number of pieces—that is, by increasing n. We were then able to get the exact answer by finding the limit of the Riemann n-sums as n →∞. Such a limit is, by definition, a definite integral, and therefore it can be computed by the methods we developed in the last chapter.
In this chapter we will study a number of quantities that can be computed as definite integrals. It is probably easiest to understand this idea for geometric quantities, where we can think of physically cutting a geometric object into pieces. We therefore begin with several examples of geometric quantities that can be computed by integration.
We have already seen one such geometric example: the area under a curve y = f (x) for a ≤ x ≤ b. We assume here that f is continuous on [a, b] and f (x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [a, b]. Let R denote the region under the curve, which consists of all points (x, y) such that a ≤ x ≤ b and 0 ≤ y ≤ f (x), and let A denote its area.1 Recall that to approximate A, we first choose a positive integer n and cut the interval [a, b] into n pieces, each of width △x = (b − a)/n. The dividing points between these pieces are the numbers xi = a + i△x for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, and for 1 ≤ i ≤ n the ith piece is the interval [xi − 1, xi ]. The lines x = xi cut the region R into n vertical strips. If we let Ai denote the area of the ith strip, which is the region defined by the inequalities xi −1 ≤ x ≤ xi and 0 ≤ y ≤ f (x), then  This is illustrated in Figure 6.1a.
Next we choose a sample point  in each interval [xi−1, xi ]. If the value of the function f doesn't vary much over the interval [xi−1, xi ], then the curve y = f (x) will stay close to the horizontal line  on that interval, and therefore Ai will be approximately equal to the area of the rectangle  This rectangle has height  and width △x, and therefore area  Adding these approximations for all of the pieces, we see that A is approximately equal to the Riemann n-sum

This Riemann sum represents the sum of the areas of the blue rectangles in Figure 6.1b, which is approximately equal to the area of the gray region in Figure 6.1a.
As n increases, the rectangles in Figure 6.1b get narrower, their tops follow the shape of the curve y = f (x) more closely, and the area inside the rectangles approaches the area of R. We conclude that

For a more careful justification of this equation, see Exercise 14.
Now we would like to generalize this problem. Suppose that f and g are both continuous on the interval [a, b],and for all x ∈ [a, b], g(x) ≤ f (x). We want to compute the area A of the region R between the graphs of f and g for x ∈ [a, b], that is, the area of the region defined by the inequalities a ≤ x ≤ b and g(x) ≤ y ≤ f (x). If g were the constant function g(x) = 0, then the bottom of R would be the x-axis and this would be the same as the problem we just solved. Imitating our previous solution, we divide the interval [a, b] into n pieces of width △x = (b − a)/n, with division points xi = a + i△x for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n. Once again, the lines x = xi will divide R into n vertical strips. An example of such a region is shown in Figure 6.2a.
In the previous problem, the top of each strip was a piece of the curve y = f (x), and we approximated the area of the strip by flattening the top to get a rectangle. But in our new problem, both the top and the bottom of each strip are curved, so we will have to flatten both of them to get a rectangular approximation. As before, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n we choose a sample point  We now approximate the area of the ith strip with the area of the rectangle  as shown in Figure 6.2b. This rectangle has height  and width △x, so its area is  (Notice that to find a vertical distance—in this case, the height of the rectangle—we compute a difference of two y-coordinates: the top y-coordinateminus the bottom.) Adding up all of these approximations, we see that A is approximately equal to the sum

Figure 6.2: Approximating the area between y = f (x) and y = g (x) for a ≤ x ≤ b with a Riemann sum.


Finally, as usual we get the exact answer by taking the limit as n →∞: A = limn→∞ Rn.
This calculation looks similar to the one we did in the previous problem, but is Rn a Riemann sum? If we let h = f − g, then we can write

and we see that Rn is a Riemann n-sum for the function h on the interval [a, b]. Thus,

The lesson here is that if we have a sum of the form

then the sum is a Riemann sum for some function. In future examples, we won't bother to introduce a name for the function; we'll simply move from a limit of a sum to a definite integral in one step. For example, we could write the calculation we just completed like this:

Comparing the notation on the two sides of this equation, we see that when taking a limit of a Riemann sum, we can just change the summation sign to an integral sign, fill in the endpoints of the interval that was divided into pieces as the limits of integration, drop the subscript i and superscript ∗, and change the △ to a d.
Another way to derive the formula for the area of the region R in Figure 6.2 a would be to note that it is the area under the graph of f minus the area under the graph of g, so it can be computed by the formula

However, this derivation assumes that g(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [a, b].Our original derivation, in contrast, works whether g(x) is positive or negative, as long as g(x) ≤ f (x) for x ∈ [a, b].
Example 6.1.1. Find the areas of the following regions:
(a)The region between the curves y = 2x − 1 and y = x2 + 1 for 1 ≤ x ≤ 2.
(b)The region bounded by the curves y = x2 − x and y = 3x − x2.
(c)The region bounded by the curves y = sin x and y = sin 2x, 0 ≤ x ≤ π.
(d)The region bounded by the curves x = y2 and y = x − 2.
Solution. The region in part (a) is shown in Figure 6.3. Since (x2 + 1) − (2x − 1) = x2 − 2x + 2 = (x − 1)2 + 1 ≥ 1, the curve y = x2 + 1 is always above the curve y = 2x − 1, so the requested area is



Figure 6.3: The region in part (a) of Example 6.1.1.

For part (b), setting x2 − x = 3x − x2 and solving, we find that the curves cross at x = 0 and x = 2. The phrase "bounded by" means "completely enclosed by," so the region is the one that is shaded in Figure 6.4. The fact that the region extends below the x-axis is irrelevant; since we have x2 − x ≤ 3x − x2 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, we can use equation (6.1) to compute the area of the region. The area is therefore

The region in part (c) is shown in Figure 6.5. To find where the curves cross, we set sin 2x = sin x and use the identity sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x:
sin 2x = sin x,
2 sin x cos x − sin x = 0,
sin x(2 cos x − 1) = 0,
sin x = 0 or cos x = 1/2,
x = 0, π/3, π.
Since sin x ≤ sin 2x for 0 ≤ x ≤ π/3 and sin 2x ≤ sin x for π/3 ≤ x ≤ π, we have to use two integrals to compute the area:



Figure 6.4: The region in part (b) of Example 6.1.1.



Figure 6.5: The region in part (c) of Example 6.1.1.



Figure 6.6: The region in part (d) of Example 6.1.1.

Finally, the region in part (d) is shown in Figure 6.6a. We leave it to you to verify that the curves intersect at the points (1,−1) and (4, 2), as shown in the figure. It is possible to compute the area of this region using equation (6.1), but it requires two integrations. If we rewrite the curve x = y2 as  and then divide the region into two pieces with the line x = 1, as indicated in the figure, then we can compute the areas of these two pieces separately and add them together to get the answer. You are asked to work out the details of this calculation in Exercise 13.
However, it is possible to find the requested area with only one integral if we proceed somewhat differently. Instead of dividing the region into thin vertical strips, as we did before, we will divide it into horizontal strips. To do this, we reverse the roles of x and y in our earlier derivation. Rewriting the line y = x − 2 in the form x = y + 2, we see that the region whose area is to be computed can be defined by the inequalities −1 ≤ y ≤ 2, y2 ≤ x ≤ y + 2. We now divide the interval [−1, 2] on the y-axis into n pieces, each of size △y = 3/n. The division points are yi = −1+i△y for 0 ≤ i ≤ n. The lines y = yi divide the region into n horizontal strips, and we can approximate the area of each strip with the area of a rectangle. Rather than drawing all of these rectangles, we have drawn just one representative rectangle in Figure 6.6b; this is all we will need to work out the required formula. Since the left side of the rectangle passes through the indicated point on the curve x = y2, the x-coordinate of the left side of the rectangle is  Similarly, the x-coordinate of the right side of the rectangle is  Thus, the rectangle has width  and height △y, so its area is  (The width of the rectangle is a horizontal distance, which we compute as a difference of two x-coordinates: right minus left.) Adding up the areas of all the rectangles and then taking the limit as n →∞, we see that the requested area is

6.2 Volume by Disks, Washers, and Slices
Consider again the region R under the graph of a continuous, nonnegative function f on an interval [a, b]. In this section we will be interested in computing, not the area of R, but rather the volume of the solid generated when the region R is rotated about the x-axis.
To visualize this solid, imagine that the x-axis is a wire and the region R is a piece of paper attached to the wire. Now imagine twirling the x-axis wire between your fingers. The piece of paper will spin around the x-axis, sweeping out a three-dimensional solid S, as illustrated in Figure 6.7. Let V denote the volume of S. We want to compute V.


Figure 6.7: When the region R is rotated about the x-axis, it generates the solid S.

As before, we divide the interval [a, b] into n pieces, each of width △x = (b − a)/n, with division points xi = a + i△x. The lines x = xi once again divide R into thin vertical strips, but now we want to know how each strip contributes to the solid S. Figure 6.8 shows the ith strip, and the slice of the solid S that it generates when it is rotated about the x-axis. If we let Vi be the volume of this slice of S, then 

Figure 6.8: The ith vertical strip in R generates a slice of S.
To approximate Vi, we choose a sample point  and as before we flatten the top of the ith vertical strip of R to get the rectangle xi−1 ≤ x ≤ xi, 0 ≤ y ≤  When this rectangle is rotated about the x-axis, it generates a disk, as illustrated in Figure 6.9. We will use the volume of this disk as our approximation of Vi . The radius of the disk is the same as the height of the rectangle, which is  and its width is the same as the width of the rectangle, △x. Thus, the volume of the disk is  Using this as our approximation of Vi, and adding up the contributions of all of the slices, we get



Figure 6.9: We approximate the ith vertical strip with a rectangle, which generates a disk.

Finally, to get the exact answer we let n →∞. The last sum above is a Riemann sum, so its limit is a definite integral:

Example 6.2.1. Find the volumes of the solids generated when the regions below the following curves are rotated about the x-axis:
(a) y = 1/x, 1 ≤ x ≤ 2, (b) y = x2, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.
Solution. The region in part (a) is shown on the left in Figure 6.10, and the solid generated when this region is rotated about the x-axis is shown in the center. As usual, we slice the region into vertical strips and approximate each strip with a rectangle. The ith rectangle is shown in blue on the left in the figure, and it generates the disk on the right. The volume of this disk is  Adding up the volumes of these disks and letting n →∞, we find that the volume of the solid is



Figure 6.10: Computing the volume of the solid in part (a) of Example 6.2.1.

Figure 6.11 shows similar information for part (b). This time we are going to skip the Riemann sum and go straight to the definite integral. Since we know that the subscript i and superscript ∗ will be dropped when we set up the integral, we have not bothered to include them in Figure 6.11. Thus, the sample point for the rectangle on the left in the figure is simply called x, and the volume of the disk on the right is π(x2)2△x = πx4△x.


Figure 6.11: Computing the volume of the solid in part (b) of Example 6.2.1.

Therefore the volume of the solid is

In our solution to Example 6.2.1, rather than simply applying equation (6.2), we have chosen in each case to draw a picture from which the required definite integral could be worked out. One reason for doing this is that it makes it easier to remember the formula for the integral. But a more important reason is that this method makes it possible to compute a wide range of volumes that are similar to those we have computed, but that don't exactly fit the pattern of the derivation of equation (6.2). That equation doesn't apply directly to the volumes in our next example, but they can be computed by imitating the method we used in Example 6.2.1.
Example 6.2.2. Find the volumes of the solids generated when the following regions are rotated about the specified lines:
(a)The region bounded by y = x2 and y = 1, rotated about the line y = 1.
(b)The region bounded by y = x2 and y = 1, rotated about the x-axis.
(c)The region bounded by y = x3, y = 1, and the y-axis, rotated about the y-axis.
Solution. Setting x2 = 1 and solving, we find that the curves y = x2 and y = 1 cross at x = ±1. Thus, the region in part (a) is the one shown in Figure 6.12. We are asked to rotate this region about the line y = 1, not the x-axis, so formula (6.2) doesn't apply, but we will be able to work out the required integral from the picture. As usual, we approximate a vertical strip of this region with a rectangle, and as in part (b) of Example 6.2.1, the label we have assigned to the sample point for this rectangle is simply x, rather than  When this rectangle is rotated about the line y = 1, it generates the disk shown on the right in Figure 6.12. The radius of the disk is the height of the rectangle, which is 1 − x2, and the width is △x, so its volume is π(1 − x2)2△x. Adding up the volumes of these disks and then taking the limit as the number of disks approaches∞, we conclude that the volume of the solid is


Figure 6.12: Computing the volume of the solid in part (a) of Example 6.2.2.


Part (b) involves the same region, but this time it is rotated about the x-axis. You should be able to visualize that when a rectangular approximation of a vertical strip of this region is rotated about the x-axis, it generates a disk with a hole in it, as illustrated in Figure 6.13. This shape is usually called a washer, because it resembles the kind of washer that is used with a bolt and a nut. The volume of the washer can be computed by determining what the volume would be if it were a disk with no hole in it, and then subtracting the volume of the hole:


Figure 6.13: Computing the volume of the solid in part (b) of Example 6.2.2.

volume of washer = π(1)2△x − π(x2)2△x = π(1 − x4)△x.
As usual, we can now compute the volume of the entire solid by using a definite integral to add up the contributions of all of the slices:

Finally, the region in part (c) must be rotated about the y-axis. To get disk-shaped slices, we must cut this region into horizontal strips, so we will need to treat y as the independent variable in this problem. Rewriting the curve y = x3 in the form  we see that the region can be defined by the inequalities 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 and  A typical horizontal rectangle,  and the disk it generates, are shown in Figure 6.14. The volume of the disk is  so the volume of the entire solid is



Figure 6.14: Computing the volume of the solid in part (c) of Example 6.2.2.

It may seem that the problems we have been solving in this section are rather contrived; when would one ever want to rotate a region around an axis and compute the resulting volume? But a number of important volumes can be computed by this method.
For example, you probably know that the volume of a sphere of radius r is 4πr3/3, but do you know where this formula comes from? √We can generate a sphere of radius r by rotating the region below the semicircle  about the x-axis, as shown in Figure 6.15. The volume of the disk on the right in the figure is


Figure 6.15: Computing the volume of a sphere of radius r.


and therefore the volume of the sphere is

Notice that in this integral, x is the independent variable and r is a constant.
Similarly, we can generate a cone of radius r and height h by drawing a line segment connecting the points (0, h) and (r, 0) in the plane and then rotating the region under this line segment about the y-axis. This is illustrated in Figure 6.16. The equation of the line through the points (0, h) and (r, 0) is y = h − (h/r)x, or equivalently x = (r/h)(h − y), and therefore the volume of the disk shown on the right in the figure is



Figure 6.16: Computing the volume of a cone of radius r and height h.

We conclude that the volume of the cone is

In all of our examples in this section, we have found the volume of a solid by cutting it into slices, approximating the volumes of the slices, and then adding up these approximations. For the solids we have worked with so far, the slices were round, and therefore we were able to approximate the volume of each slice with the volume of a disk or a washer. But the method of slicing and adding can be applied even if the slices are not round. To demonstrate this, we close this section with one more example. We will find the volume V of a pyramid whose base is a square with sides of length s and whose height is h.
Figure 6.17 shows the pyramid whose volume is to be computed. To cut the pyramid into slices, we set up a vertical number line next to the pyramid. Wewill find it convenient to have the origin of the number line level with the top of the pyramid, with the numbers increasing as we move down the line, so that the point h on the number line is level with the bottom of the pyramid. Now we cut the interval [0, h] on the number line into n pieces, each of size △x = h/n, with division points xi = i△x for 0 ≤ i ≤ n. Horizontal planes passing through these division points will cut the pyramid into n slices. Figure 6.17 shows the ith slice. If we let Vi denote the volume of this slice, then 
The sides of slice i are slanted. To approximate Vi, we will flatten the sides of the slice to make them vertical. More precisely, we choose a sample point  in the interval [xi−1, xi ], and consider the horizontal plane passing though the point  on the number line. This plane intersects the pyramid in a square. Let wi be the length of the sides of this square, as shown in Figure 6.18. We approximate Vi with the volume of the box on the right in the figure. This box has height △x and a square base with sides of length wi, so Vi ≈ (wi)2△x, and therefore



Figure 6.17: To find the volume of a pyramid, we cut it into horizontal slices.



Figure 6.18: We approximate the ith slice with a box with vertical sides.



Figure 6.19: A vertical cross section through the center of the pyramid.

To turn this last sum into a Riemann sum, we will need a formula for wi in terms of    Consider the vertical cross section through the center of the pyramid shown in Figure 6.19. Triangles ABC and APQ are similar. Since ABC has base s and height h, and APQ has base wi and height we have and therefore 
Substituting into our approximation for V, we find that

Since the last sum has the form of a Riemann sum, when we take the limit as n →∞ to find the exact volume we get a definite integral:

17. You may have noticed some similarity between the formulas we derived in this section for the volumes of a cone and a pyramid: in both cases, the volume is equal to the area of the base of the solid times the height divided by 3. This is not a coincidence. Let R be a region in the plane with area A, and let P be a point h units above the plane. Let S be the solid consisting of all points that lie on a line segment connecting P to some point in R. Show that the volume of S is Ah/3.
6.3 Volume by Cylindrical Shells
In this section we will study one more method for computing volumes. Once again we consider the region R under the curve y = f (x) for a ≤ x ≤ b; we assume that f (x) ≥ 0 and a ≥ 0, so that R is contained in the first quadrant. As usual, we divide the interval [a, b] into n pieces of width △x = (b − a)/n, using division points xi = a + i△x, and we cut R into vertical strips with the lines x = xi .We then choose sample points  and approximate the ith vertical strip with the rectangle xi−1 ≤ 
As in the last section, to find the volume of the solid generated when the region R is rotated about an axis, we add up approximations of the contributions that all of the vertical strips make to this volume. We approximate the contribution of the ith strip by computing the volume of the solid generated when we rotate the ith rectangle about the axis. If the region R is rotated about the x-axis, then the ith rectangle generates a disk, and we can use the methods of the last section to compute the volume. But what if R is rotated about the y-axis? In that case, the ith rectangle generates a thin cylindrical shell, as illustrated in Figure 6.20.


Figure 6.20: When a vertical rectangle is rotated about the y-axis, it generates a cylindrical shell.

When computing the volume of the cylindrical shell in Figure 6.20, we find it convenient to take the sample point  to be the midpoint of the interval [xi−1, xi]; in other words, we let  The shell can be thought of as a cylinder with a slightly smaller cylindrical hole in it, so we compute its volume as the volume of the cylinder minus the volume of the hole:

As usual, we now add up these approximations of the contributions of all of the strips and then take the limit as n →∞. Thus, the volume of the solid generated when the region R in Figure 6.20 is rotated about the y-axis is

When applying this formula in examples, it may be best to remember the formula for the volume of a cylindrical shell in words. As indicated on the left in Figure 6.21,  is the average radius of the shell—that is, the radius of a circle halfway between the inside edge and the outside edge of the shell,  is the height of the shell, and △x is the thickness. Thus, we can say that
volume of cylindrical shell = 2π(average radius)(height)(thickness).
A good way to remember this formula is to imagine cutting the cylindrical shell open and flattening it out, as shown in Figure 6.21. The result would be a thin rectangular plate with height  width and thickness △x. The volume of this plate is therefore  exactly the same as the volume of the cylindrical shell. Of course, flattening the shell would require some distortion, since the inner edge of the shell would be stretched when the shell was flattened, and the outer edge would be compressed.


Figure 6.21: Cutting open and flattening a cylindrical shell.

Thus, this reasoning does not give a rigorous derivation of the formula for the volume of the shell. But it does provide an intuitive picture that may help you remember the formula.
Example 6.3.1. Find the volumes of the solids generated when the following regions are rotated about the specified lines:
(a)The region under the curve y = 4 − x2, 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, rotated about the y-axis.
(b)The region bounded by y = 4 − x2 and y = 4 − 2x, rotated about the line x = 2.
(c)The region bounded by x = (y − 1)2 and x = 1, rotated about the x-axis.
Solution. The region in part (a) is shown on the left in Figure 6.22. When a typical vertical rectangle is rotated about the y-axis, it generates a cylindrical shell, as shown on the right in the figure. The volume of this cylindrical shell is
2π(average radius)(height)(thickness) = 2πx(4 − x2)△x,
and therefore the volume of the solid is

For part (b), we begin by setting 4 − x2 = 4 − 2x. Solving, we find that the curves cross at x = 0 and x = 2, as shown in Figure 6.23. For this volume, we are working with a region between two curves, not a region under a curve, and the region is being rotated about the line x = 2, not the y-axis, so equation (6.3) doesn't apply directly. Nevertheless, the shell method can be used to compute the required volume.
The rectangle in Figure 6.23 generates a cylindrical shell with average radius 2 − x, height (4 − x2) − (4− 2x) = 2x − x2, and thickness △x. Therefore the volume of the cylindrical shell is 2π(2 − x)(2x − x2)△x, and the volume of the entire solid is



Figure 6.22: Computing the volume of the solid in part (a) of Example 6.3.1.



Figure 6.23: Computing the volume of the solid in part (b) of Example 6.3.1.

Finally, as shown in Figure 6.24, the region in part (c) can be defined by the inequalities 0 ≤ y ≤ 2, (y − 1)2 ≤ x ≤ 1.We therefore divide the interval [0, 2] on the y-axis into pieces and cut the region into horizontal strips, approximating each with a rectangle. When the rectangle in Figure 6.24 is rotated about the x-axis, it generates a cylindrical shell with average radius y,height 1 − (y − 1)2 = 2y − y2, and thickness △y.


Figure 6.24: Computing the volume of the solid in part (c) of Example 6.3.1.

Therefore the volume of the solid is

Sometimes a volume can be computed by more than one method. For example, in part (c) of Example 6.2.2 we found the volume of the solid generated when the region bounded by y = x3, y = 1, and the y-axis is rotated about the y-axis. In that example we cut the region into horizontal strips, but we can also find the volume by cutting the region into vertical strips. Figure 6.25 shows a rectangle approximating a vertical strip, and the cylindrical shell that it generates. The volume of this cylindrical shell is 2πx(1 − x3)△x, and therefore the volume of the solid is

Of course, this agrees with the answer we got in our original solution. For more examples of volumes that can be computed by two different methods, see Exercises 9-11.
If you are computing the volume of a solid generated when a region is rotated about an axis, how do you decide which method to use? It is generally best to decide first whether to use horizontal rectangles or vertical rectangles. If the region is bounded by curves of the form y = f (x), then it is usually easiest to treat x as the independent variable. This means that you will divide an interval on the x-axis into pieces, cut the region into vertical strips, and approximate these strips with vertical rectangles. On the other hand, if the region is bounded by curves of the form x = f (y), then you will probably want to cut an interval on the y-axis into pieces and then use horizontal rectangles to approximate horizontal strips of the region. Once you have decided whether to use horizontal or vertical rectangles, you can draw a picture to determine what shape these rectangles generate when they are rotated around the specified axis, and you can use this picture to help you set up the integral. Sometimes the curves bounding the region can be written in either the form y = f (x) or x = f (y). In that case, you can use either method. You might even find it helpful to set up the integral both ways and then choose which integral seems easier to evaluate.

Example 6.3.2. Find the volumes of the solids generated when the following regions are rotated about the specified lines:
(a)The region under the curve y = sec x, 0 ≤ x ≤ π/4, rotated about the x-axis.
(b)The region bounded by the y-axis and the curve  rotated about the x-axis.
Solution. Since the upper boundary of the region in part (a) is the curve y = sec x, it would be easiest to treat x as the independent variable and cut the region into vertical strips. When the vertical rectangle in Figure 6.26 is rotated about the x-axis, it generates a disk whose volume is π sec2 x△x. Thus, the volume of the solid is

For part (b), part of the boundary of the region is the curve x = sin(y2), so it is easiest to treat y as the independent variable and cut the region into horizontal strips. As you can see in Figure 6.27, a typical horizontal rectangle generates a cylindrical shell whose volume is 2πy sin(y2)△y, so the volume of the solid is

6.4 Work
Suppose that an object is at a point a on a number line. A constant force F is applied to the object, directed in the positive direction on the number line, and, under the influence of this force, the object moves to a point b > a, traveling through a distance d = b − a. In this situation, we say that the work done by the force is W = Fd. If d is measured in feet and F is measured in pounds, then W is measured in foot-pounds. If d is measured in meters and F in newtons, then the unit for W is called a joule (abbreviated J). In other words, 1 joule is the amount of work done by a constant force of 1 newton moving an object through a distance of 1 meter.
More complicated situations can be handled by applying the fact that work is additive: if a process can be decomposed as a sequence of subprocesses, then the work done in the course of the process is the sum of the work done in each of the subprocesses. For example, consider again the process of moving an object through a distance d while applying a constant force F. We can think of this process as a sequence of two subprocesses: moving the object through a distance d1 < d, and then moving it through a further distance d2, where d1 + d2 = d. The work done by the force in the first subprocess is Fd1, while in the second it is Fd2, and the sum of these is
Fd1 + Fd2 = F(d1 + d2) = Fd,
which is the work done by the force in the entire process.
What if the force is not a constant? Suppose once again that the object moves from a to b on the number line, but as the object moves the force varies. For a ≤ x ≤ b, let F (x) be the force applied to the object when it is at the point x; we will assume that F is a continuous function. How much work does this varying force do?
We can use a Riemann sum to get an approximate answer. For some positive integer n, divide the interval [a, b] into n pieces, each of width △x = (b − a)/n. As usual, we let xi = a + i△x. If we let Wi be the work done in moving the object from xi−1 to xi, then since work is additive, the total work done in moving the object from a to b is 
If n is large, so that △x is small, then the force probably won't vary much as the object moves from xi−1 to xi . We can therefore get a good approximation of Wi by choosing a sample point  and assuming that the force is a constant  throughout the interval [xi−1, xi ]. Thus, 
Adding up all of these approximations, we see that

Of course, the last sum is a Riemann sum for F on the interval [a, b].
As n increases, the terms in the Riemann sum track the varying force more and more closely, and the approximation improves. To get the exact value of the work, we take the limit as n →∞:

For example, suppose that an object moves from 2 to 4 on a number line that is marked off in feet, and for 2 ≤ x ≤ 4, the force on the object when it is at the point x is F (x) = 3 + 2x pounds. Then the work done by this force is

Example 6.4.1. An electron is held fixed at the origin of a number line that is marked off in meters, and a second electron is placed at the point 1. Since the electrons repel each other, the second electron will move away from the origin. How much work does the repulsive force do in pushing the second electron from 1 to 2 on the number line?
Solution. According to Coulomb's law, when the second electron is at the point x, the force pushing it away from the first electron, in newtons, is given by the formula

where C is a constant whose value is approximately 2.3×10−28. Thus, the work done by this force is

Example 6.4.2. A tank has the shape of the bottom half of a sphere whose radius is 3 feet. If the tank is full of water, how much work must be done to pump the water out over the edge of the tank?
Solution. Our strategy for solving this problem will be to divide the water into thin horizontal slices and compute the work required to lift each slice to the top of the tank. Adding these numbers will give the total amount of work required to pump all of the water out of the tank.
We can think of the water in the tank as the solid generated when the region R defined by the inequalities  is rotated about the y-axis, as shown in Figure 6.28; we assume here that the x- and y-axes are marked off in feet. We now divide the interval [−3, 0] on the y-axis into n pieces, each of width △y = 3/n, with division points yi = −3 + i△y. The lines y = yi divide R into n horizontal strips, and when these strips are rotated about the y-axis they generate n horizontal slices of the water. For i = 1, 2, . . . , n, let Wi be the work required to lift the ith slice of water up to the top of the tank. Then the work required to pump all of the water out of the tank is 


Figure 6.28: The hemispherical tank in Example 6.4.2.

As usual, we now choose sample points  and approximate the ith horizontal strip of R with the rectangle  When this rectangle is rotated about the y-axis, it generates a disk whose volume is  One cubic foot of water weighs about 62.4 pounds, so the weight of the ith slice of water is about This is the force that must be exerted to counteract the force of gravity in order to lift this slice of water.
The ith slice of water must be lifted a distance of about  feet to reach the top of the tank. (Notice that  This is only an approximation; the water at the top of the slice must be lifted a slightly smaller distance than the water at the bottom. But if n is large, and therefore △y is small, then this discrepancy will be negligible. The work required to lift the ith slice can now be approximated by multiplying force times distance:

Adding the work for all the slices, we arrive at an approximation for the total amount of work required to pump out all of the water:

Finally, to get the exact answer, we take the limit as n →∞, which will turn the last summation into an integral:

There is an interesting connection between the work done by a force on an object and the kinetic energy of the object. Consider an object moving to the right along the x-axis from x = x0 to x = x1 under the influence of a varying force F (x) that is directed to the right. As we have already seen, the work done by this force is  But we can also think of the position x of the object as a function of time t—say, x = s(t). If the motion of the object takes place between t = t0 and t = t1, then we have x0 = s(t0) and x1 = s(t1), and therefore we can write the work in the form

To see why the last two integrals are equal, use the substitution x = s(t), dx = s′(t) dt to convert the second integral into the first.
If we assume that F (x) is the only force acting on the object, then we can apply Newton's second law of motion, which says that the force on the object is equal to the mass of the object times its acceleration. The acceleration is d2x/dt2 = s′′(t), so if the mass is m then we have F(x) = F(s(t)) = ms′′(t). Substituting into equation (6.4), we get 

Finally, to evaluate this integral we use the substitution v = s′(t), dv = s′′(t) dt; notice that v represents the velocity of the object. If we let v0 = s′(t0) and v1 = s′(t1) (the initial and final velocities of the object), then the substitution leads to the formula

If you have studied physics before, then you may recognize (1/2)mv2 as the formula for the kinetic energy of the object. Thus, we have just shown that the work done by the force on the object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy.

6.5 Center of Mass
Alice and Bob are sitting on a seesaw. Alice weighs 120 pounds and Bob weighs 150, so the seesaw doesn't balance when they sit equally far from the center. But they discover that they can get it to balance if they shift their positions. In particular, after some experimentation they find that if Alice is 5 feet from the center of the seesaw and Bob is 4 feet from the center, as in Figure 6.29, then the seesaw balances.


Figure 6.29: Alice and Bob create equal and opposite torques, so the seesaw balances.

To understand why the seesaw balances in this situation, we must consider the concept of torque. The seesaw is supported at a point in the center called the fulcrum. When Alice is sitting 5 feet to the right of the fulcrum, gravity causes her to push down on the seesaw at that point with a force of 120 lb, and if Bob were not present, this force would cause the seesaw to rotate clockwise about the fulcrum. The torque of this force about the fulcrum is a measure of the extent to which the force would cause the seesaw to rotate. It is computed as the magnitude of the force times the distance from the fulcrum. Thus, Alice's weight on the seesaw creates a torque of 120 · 5 = 600 ft-lb about the fulcrum. Similarly, Bob, sitting 4 feet to the left of the fulcrum and weighing 150 pounds, creates a torque of 150 · 4 = 600 ft-lb in the opposite direction, exactly balancing the torque created by Alice. We could indicate that Bob's torque is in the opposite direction from Alice's by saying that Bob creates a clockwise torque of −600 ft-lb. The net rotational effect of a collection of forces is found by adding their torques. In our situation, the total torque on the seesaw is 600 − 600 = 0 ft-lb, and therefore the seesaw does not rotate at all; it balances.
Now let's generalize. Consider a horizontal beam that is marked off as a number line. There are objects whose masses are m1, m2, ..., mn resting on the beam at the points x1, x2, ..., xn (see Figure 6.30). We will assume that the mass of the beam itself is negligible. The weight of an object is proportional to its mass, so the ith object pushes down on the beam at the point xi with a force mi g, where g is a constant. If the beam rests on a fulcrum at the point c, then this force produces a clockwise torque of (xi − c)mi g about the fulcrum. Notice that if xi < c then this torque is negative, indicating that the force would cause a counterclockwise rotation.
We would like to determine where we should position the fulcrum so that the beam will balance. In order for the beam to balance, the total torque must be 0:



Figure 6.30: A beam with several masses on it.

We can now solve this equation for c to find the point where the beam will balance. We begin by expanding the summation, using Theorem 5.1.1:

Solving for c, we find that the beam will balance if the fulcrum is at the point

This point is called the center of mass of the collection of objects. Notice that the denominator of the fraction on the right in equation (6.5) is simply the total mass of the objects. The numerator is called the first moment of mass (about the origin) for the collection of objects.
Equation (6.5) tells us how to find the center of mass of a finite collection of objects arranged on a number line, if the mass of each object is concentrated at a point. But mass is generally spread out, not concentrated at a point. Thus, it would be more realistic to imagine mass spread continuously over some part of a number line. For example, consider a wire of varying density extending over the interval [a, b] on a number line. We will assume that for a ≤ x ≤ b, the density of the wire at the point x is d (x), where d is a function that is continuous on the interval [a, b]. We would like to find the center of mass of this wire.
We begin by showing how Riemann sums can be used to get an approximate answer. For a large positive integer n, we can imagine cutting the wire into n small pieces. If we treat these pieces as n point masses, then we can use equation (6.5) to find an approximate value for the center of mass of the wire. To cut the wire into pieces, we divide the interval [a, b] into n smaller intervals, each of width △x = (b − a)/n, with division points xi = a + i△x. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, the ith piece of the wire is the part that lies in the interval [xi−1, xi ]. To approximate the mass of this piece of wire, we choose a sample point  and assume that the density is a constant  throughout the interval. Since density is mass per unit of length, the mass of the ith piece of wire is approximately  By treating the ith piece of wire as a point mass located at the point  and applying equation (6.5), we find that the center of mass of the wire is approximately

As n increases, the n pieces of wire become smaller, and this approximation, which is based on treating these pieces as points, becomes more accurate. The numerator and denominator of (6.6) are both Riemann sums, so as n →∞ they both approach integrals. Thus, the exact center of mass is

The denominator of the last fraction in equation (6.7) is the total mass of the wire, and the numerator is the first moment of mass about the origin.
For example, suppose that a piece of wire extends from 0 to 5 on a number line, and the density at the point x is d(x) = 3x. Then the mass of the wire is

and the first moment of mass is

Therefore the center of mass is at

In other words, the wire would balance on a fulcrum at the point 10/3.
It is interesting to work out what happens in the case of a wire of constant density. Suppose that the wire extends from a to b on the number line, and the density at every point in the interval [a, b] is D. Then according to equation (6.7), the center of mass will be

In other words, the wire balances at its midpoint. Of course, in hindsight this answer is obvious, but it is nice to see that equation (6.7) leads to this obvious answer.
So far we have discussed balancing one-dimensional objects. Let's try moving up to a two-dimensional object. Suppose that a thin plate of uniform density covers the triangle with vertices (0, 0), (2, 0), and (0, 4) in the plane. The hypotenuse of this triangle lies on the line y = 4 − 2x. For any number cx between 0 and 2, we can draw the vertical line x = cx on the plate. We then lay the plate on top of a knife edge, with the line x = cx resting on the knife edge, as shown in Figure 6.31. For what value of cx will the plate balance on the knife edge?
To find this balance point, we cut the triangular plate into n thin vertical strips and approximate these strips with rectangles as usual; the ith rectangle is shown in Figure 6.31. The rectangle has width △x and height  so its area is Since the density of the plate is uniform, the weight of the ith strip of the plate is about  for some constant K. This means that when the plate is resting on the knife edge, the force of gravity on this strip of the plate exerts a torque of about  about the knife edge. Adding up the torques for all of the strips and taking the limit as the number of strips approaches∞, we see that the total torque is



Figure 6.31: Balancing a triangular plate on a knife edge.

For the plate to balance on the knife edge, this total torque must be 0. Thus, to find the balance point, we set the torque equal to 0 and solve for cx:

Notice the similarity of this formula to the formula in equation (6.7): the denominator of the last fraction is the total area of the plate, and the numerator is the first moment of area about the line x = 0—that is, about the y-axis. Evaluating the integrals, we find that the balance point is

We can do a similar calculation to find a horizontal line on which the plate will balance. Rewriting the hypotenuse in the form x = 2 − y/2 and imitating the calculation above, we find that the first moment of area about the line y = 0 is

Since we have already computed that the area is 4, we conclude that the plate will balance on the line y = cy, where

Putting it all together, we have shown that the plate will balance on either a horizontal line or a vertical line through the point (2/3, 4/3). In fact, it can be shown that the plate will balance on the point of a needle at this point. The point (2/3, 4/3) is called the centroid of the triangle.
In general, if a region is defined by the inequalities a ≤ x ≤ b, g(x) ≤ y ≤ f (x), where f and g are continuous on [a, b] and for all x ∈ [a, b], g(x) ≤ f (x), then the x-coordinate of the centroid is given by the formula

where A is the area of the region. A similar formula applies for the y-coordinate of the centroid of a region.
We close this chapter by noting a connection between centroids and volumes:
Theorem 6.5.1 (Pappus's Second Centroid Theorem2). If a region in the plane is rotated about an axis that does not pass through the region, then the volume of the solid generated is equal to the area of the region times the distance traveled by the centroid of the region when it rotates about the axis.
Proof. We will prove the theorem in the case of a region of the form a ≤ x ≤ b, g(x) ≤ y ≤ f (x) that is rotated about the y-axis. We assume here that 0 < a < b, f and g are continuous on [a, b], and for all x ∈ [a, b], g(x) ≤ f (x).
If the area of the region is A, then the x-coordinate of the centroid is

When the centroid is rotated about the y-axis, it traces out a circle of radius cx, so the distance it travels is the circumference of this circle, 2πcx .
Thus, the product of the area of the region and the distance traveled by the centroid is

But this is precisely the volume of the solid generated when the region is rotated about the y-axis, computed by cylindrical shells.

Chapter 7
Inverse Functions, the Natural Logarithm, and the Exponential Function
7.1 Inverse Functions
Consider the functions f (x) = x3 and  Clearly these functions are closely related. But what, exactly, is the nature of the relationship?
We begin by examining the relationship between the graphs of these functions. The graph of g is the graph of the equation But by the definition of cube roots, to say that y is the cube root of x simply means that y is the number whose cube is x. In other words,

Thus, we could also describe the graph of g as the graph of the equation x = y3. Of course, the graph of f is the graph of the equation y = x3. These two graphs contain exactly the same points, but with the x- and y-coordinates reversed. You can see this reversal of x- and y-coordinates in Table 7.1, which lists some points on the graphs of f and g. Thus, we can construct the graph of g by determining the points on the graph of f and then reversing the coordinates of those points.
Geometrically, what is the effect of reversing the x- and y-coordinates of a point? The answer to this question is illustrated in Figure 7.1. Imagine that there is a wire embedded in the page along the line y = x, which is shown as a dashed line in the figure. If you were to spin the page 180 degrees, using this wire as an axis, then the point (a, b) in the figure would end up at the point (b, a). Thus, the geometric effect of reversing the coordinates of a point is to flip the point over across the line y = x. It follows that if we draw the graph of f and then flip this graph over across the line y = x, then we will get the graph of g. This is illustrated in Figure 7.2. The graph of f is shown in Figure 7.2a, and if you flip this graph over across the line y = x then you get the graph of g, which is shown in Figure 7.2b.


Table 7.1: Some points on the graphs of f and g.



Figure 7.1: Reversing the coordinates of a point has the effect of flipping it over across the line y = x.

The relationship between the graphs of f and g implies an algebraic relationship between these functions. For any real number x, the point (x, f (x)) is on the graph of f. It follows that (f (x), x) is on the graph of g, and therefore g(f (x)) = x. Similar reasoning shows that for all x, f (g(x)) = x. We can verify these equations algebraically by filling in the formulas defining f and g:



Figure 7.2: Flipping the graph of f over across the line y = x produces the graph of g.

Thus, each of these functions "undoes" the other: If you apply f to a number x, then you can undo this operation and get back the original number x by applying g. Similarly, if you apply g to x, then you can undo this operation and get back x by applying f.
We say that g is the inverse of f, and we write g = f −1. Thus, we can write  Notice that f −1(x) is not the same thing as (f (x))−1 = 1/f (x) = 1/x3.
Let's try another example. Let h be the function defined as follows:

We will leave it to you to verify, using the methods of Chapter 4, that the graph of h is as shown in Figure 7.3a. In particular, note that h is strictly increasing on (−∞,∞), and the lines y = 2 and y = −2 are asymptotes.


Figure 7.3: To get the graph of h−1, we flip over the graph of h.

Flipping this graph over across the line y = x gives us the graph of the equation x = h(y), which is shown in Figure 7.3b. This graph passes the vertical line test, and therefore it is the graph of a function. We call this function the inverse of h, and denote it by h−1.
Notice that the domain of h is the interval (−∞,∞), so every real number appears as the x-coordinate of a point on the graph of h. However, you can see in Figure 7.3a that the y-coordinates of the points on the graph are the numbers in the interval (−2, 2). In other words,
{h(x) : x ∈ R} = {y : for some real number x, y = h(x)} = (−2, 2).
Recall that this set is called the range of h. Because of the reversal of the roles of x and y in Figures 7.3a and 7.3b, this means that the set of x-coordinates of points on the graph of h−1 is (−2, 2), and the set of y-coordinates is (−∞,∞). In other words, the domain of h−1 is (−2, 2)—the same as the range of h—and the range of h−1 is (−∞,∞)—the same as the domain of h.
As before, the graphical relationship between h and h−1 implies an algebraic relationship. If x is any real number, then the point (x, h(x)) is on the graph of h. Therefore (h(x), x) is on the graph of h−1, so h−1(h(x)) = x. Similarly, if x ∈ (−2, 2), then (x, h−1(x)) is on the graph of h−1, so (h−1(x), x) is on the graph of h, which means that h(h−1(x)) = x. In other words, h and h−1 undo each other.
We can verify this algebraically by finding a formula for h−1(x). Suppose x ∈ (−2, 2), and let y = h−1(x). Then the point (x, y) is on the graph in Figure 7.3b, so it satisfies the equation

We can now find a formula for h−1(x) by solving for y in this equation. This is easiest to do if we treat the left and right halves of the graph separately. So suppose first that 0 ≤ x < 2. Then it is clear in Figure 7.3b that y ≥ 0, and therefore |y| = y. Thus, equation (7.2) becomes

Similarly, if −2 < x < 0 then y < 0, and therefore |y| = −y. Substituting this into equation (7.2) leads to the solution

Since y = h−1(x), we conclude that

In other words,

In Exercise 1, we ask you to use our formulas for h(x) and h−1(x) to verify that h and h−1 undo each other.
We have now developed a graphical method for finding what we are calling the inverse of a function: graph the function and then flip the graph over across the line y = x, and you will have the graph of the inverse of the function. But there is something that could go wrong with this method: what if the flipped-over graph fails the vertical line test? In fact, this can happen. Consider, for example, the function f (x) = x2. Figure 7.4a shows the graph of y = x2, and flipping this graph over gives us the graph of x = y2 in Figure 7.4b. This graph fails the vertical line test, as indicated by the red vertical line in Figure 7.4b. Tracing this problem back to its source, we see that the problem is caused by the fact that a horizontal line crosses the graph of f more than once. This horizontal line intersects the graph at two points that have different x-coordinates, labeled x1 and x2 in Figure 7.4a, but the same y-coordinate. In other words, x1 ≠ x2, but f (x1) = f (x2). This, then, is the situation we need to avoid if we want to construct the inverse of a function. There is a name for functions that avoid this situation:
Definition 7.1.1. A function f is called one-to-one if there do not exist numbers x1 and x2 in the domain of f such that x1 ≠ x2 but f (x1) = f (x2).


Figure 7.4

Example 7.1.2. Which of the following functions are one-to-one?
f (x) = x3 +2x, g(x) = x3 −2x, h(x) = 1/x.
Solution. We give a graphical solution. We leave it to you to verify that the graphs of the functions are as shown in Figure 7.5. The red lines in the figure illustrate that no horizontal line intersects the graph of f or h more than once, but there are horizontal lines intersecting the graph of g more than once. Therefore f and h are one-to-one, but g is not.


Figure 7.5: The graphs of the functions in Example 7.1.2.

With this new terminology, we can now say more carefully what we mean by the inverse of a function. Suppose f is a one-to-one function. Then no horizontal line intersects the graph of the equation y = f (x) more than once, and therefore no vertical line intersects the graph of x = f (y) more than once. Thus, the graph of x = f (y) passes the vertical line test, so it is the graph of a function. We define this function to be the inverse of f, and we denote it by f −1. For any numbers x and y, we have y = f −1(x) if and only if x = f (y), and as in the examples above we can use this to show that the functions f and f −1 undo each other. That is, for all x in the domain of f, f −1(f (x)) = x, and for all x in the domain of f −1 (which is the same as the range of f), f (f −1(x)) = x.
On the other hand, if f is not one-to-one then f does not have an inverse. For example, the reason we were unable to construct an inverse in the case of the function f (x) = x2 is that this function is not one-to-one.
Although we cannot construct an inverse for a function that is not one-to-one, we can come close. The idea is to restrict the domain of the function in order to make it one-to-one. For example, although the function f (x) = x2 is not one-to-one, we can turn it into a one-to-one function by restricting it to x ≥ 0. More precisely, we define a function g with domain [0,∞) by saying that for all x ∈ [0,∞), g(x) = x2. The function g is called the restriction of f to the interval [0,∞). The graph of g consists of all points (x, y) such that y = x2 and x ≥ 0. This is just the right half of the graph of f, as shown in Figure 7.6a, and it is clear from this graph that g is one-to-one, since no horizontal line intersects the curve more than once. Reversing the roles of x and y, we get the flipped graph in Figure 7.6b, which consists of all points (x, y) such that x = y2 and y ≥ 0. This curve passes the vertical line test, so it is the graph of the function g−1, the inverse of g.
It is clear from Figure 7.6b that the domain of g−1 is [0,∞). Suppose x ∈ [0,∞), and let y = g−1(x). Then the point (x, y) is on the curve in Figure 7.6b, so

As in the case of the function h−1, we can now find a formula for g−1(x) by solving for y. The equation x = y2 has two solutions for  But the additional restriction y ≥ 0 in (7.4) allows us to eliminate the negative solution and conclude that Thus, the inverse of g is the function  Of course, these functions undo

each other: both functions have domain [0,∞), and for all x ≥ 0,

But notice that the restriction x ≥ 0 is necessary here. For x < 0, we have  |x| = −x.
To state our conclusions more informally, we can say that although the cube root function is the inverse of the cubing function, the square root function is not the inverse of the squaring function. Rather, it is the inverse of the restriction of the squaring function to the interval [0,∞). In later sections of this chapter we will study the inverses of a number of functions, and in some cases we will have to use the trick of restricting the domain to make the function one-to-one before we can construct an inverse.

7.2 Calculus with Inverse Functions
We saw in the last section that if f is a one-to-one function, then it has an inverse function f −1, and the domain of f −1 is the same as the range of f. Thus, if we want to be able to find the domains of inverse functions, then it will be helpful to develop a better understanding of the ranges of functions.
For example, suppose that the domain of f is a finite closed interval [a, b], and f is continuous on this interval. Then as we saw in Section 4.7, f has a minimum value m, attained at some number c ∈ [a, b], and it has a maximum value M, attained at some C ∈ [a, b]. If we also assume that f is not a constant function, then m < M. Clearly m and M are in the range of f, but no number smaller than m or larger than M can be in the range of f. Now consider any number r with m < r < M. Since f is continuous, according to the intermediate value theorem there must be some number d between c and C such that f (d) = r, and therefore r is in the range of f. Thus, the range of f includes m, M, and all numbers in between, but no other numbers; in other words, the range is the closed interval [m, M].
It turns out something similar is true even if the domain of f is some other kind of interval:
Theorem 7.2.1. Suppose the domain of f is an interval, f is continuous on that interval, and f is not a constant function. Then the range of f is an interval.
Before we prove this theorem, let's consider a few examples. Let f, g, and h be the functions defined as follows:

The domains of f and g are (−∞,∞), and the domain of h is (−1, 1). If you sketch the graphs of these functions, using the methods of Chapter 4, you will find that the range of f is the interval [0,∞), the range of g is (0, 1], and the range of h is [1,∞).
In our proof of Theorem 7.2.1, we will use the completeness of the real numbers (Theorem 2.9.4). To see why completeness is relevant to this proof, consider the interval (0, 1]. Clearly 1 is an upper bound for this interval, but no number smaller than 1 is an upper bound. Thus, 1 is the least upper bound of (0, 1]. Similarly, 0 is the greatest lower bound of (0, 1]. And similar reasoning applies to other intervals. In general, if an interval does not extend infinitely far to the right on the number line, then its right endpoint is its least upper bound, and if it does not extend infinitely far to the left, then its left endpoint is its greatest lower bound. Thus, to recognize a set as an interval we can try to locate its endpoints by looking for its least upper bound and greatest lower bound. In certain situations, the completeness of the real numbers guarantees the existence of these numbers.
Proof of Theorem 7.2.1. Suppose that the domain of f is an interval, f is continuous on that interval, and f is not a constant function. Let R be the range of f. We must prove that R is an interval.
There are several cases, depending on whether or not R has an upper bound or a lower bound. We will consider only one case, leaving the others as exercises for you (see Exercise 11 for another case). The case we will consider is the case in which R has an upper bound but no lower bound.
Since R has an upper bound, by the completeness of the real numbers, it has a least upper bound. Let b be the least upper bound of R. Since b is an upper bound, no number larger than b is in R. Our plan now is to show that every number smaller than b is in R.
Consider any number r < b. Since b is the least upper bound of R, r is not an upper bound, so there is some y ∈ R such that y > r. And since we have assumed that R does not have a lower bound, r is not a lower bound for R, and therefore there is some z ∈ R such that z < r.
By the definition of range, for y to belong to R, which is the range of f, means that there is some c in the domain of f such that f (c) = y. Similarly, since z ∈ R, there is some d in the domain of f such that f (d) = z.We now have f (d) = z < r < y = f (c). Since f is continuous, we can apply the intermediate value theorem to conclude that there is some number a between c and d such that f (a) = r. Therefore r is in the range of f —that is, r ∈ R.
We have shown that no number larger than b is in R, and every number smaller than b is in R. Thus, if b ∈ R then R = (−∞, b], and if not then R = (−∞, b). In either case, we can conclude that R is an interval.
We now turn to the main topic of this section, calculus with inverse functions. Suppose that f is a function whose domain is an interval I, and f is continuous on I. We will be most interested in the case in which f is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on I. If f is such a function, then it is not a constant function, so by Theorem 7.2.1, the range of f is some interval J. It should also be clear that no horizontal line can intersect the graph of f more than once, and therefore f is one-to-one. Thus, f −1 is defined, and its domain is the interval J. Must f −1 be continuous on J? If f is differentiable, must f −1 also be differentiable? We begin with an informal discussion of these questions. Once we have found tentative answers, we will state these answers in a theorem and prove the theorem.
Since f is continuous, the graph of f is a curve with no breaks in it. When this graph is flipped over across the line y = x, the resulting curve will also have no breaks in it. Thus, it seems that f −1 should also be continuous.
Now suppose that a ∈ I and f is differentiable at a. Then the graph of f has a tangent line at the point where x = a. If we let b = f (a) and m = f ′(a), then the equation of this tangent line, written in point-slope form, is y −b = m(x −a). Now we flip over both the graph of f and also the tangent line across the line y = x, as shown in Figure 7.8. Reversing the roles of x and y, we see that the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f −1 at the point (b, a) is x −b = m(y −a). If m ≠ 0, then we can rewrite this equation in the form y −a = (1/m)(x −b), and we see that the slope of the line is 1/m = 1/f′(a). Thus, it appears that if f ′(a) ≠ 0, then f −1 is differentiable at b and (f −1)′(b) = 1/f ′(a).
It turns out that our conclusions about the continuity and differentiability of f −1 are correct, but the reasoning we have used was based on intuition and pictures, rather than on the mathematical definitions of continuity and differentiability. To confirm the correctness of our conclusions, we formulate them as a precise theorem and give a careful proof.


Figure 7.8: Flipping over the tangent line to the graph of f at (a, b) gives the tangent line to the graph of f −1 at (b, a).

Theorem 7.2.2. Suppose the domain of f is an interval I, f is continuous on I, and f is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on I. Then f −1 is defined, and its domain is an interval J. Furthermore:
1. The function f −1 is continuous on J.
2. Suppose a ∈ I and let b = f (a). If f is differentiable at a and f ′(a) ≠ 0, then f −1 is differentiable at b, and

Proof. We will assume in our proof that f is strictly increasing; the proof for strictly decreasing functions is similar. We have already shown that f −1 is defined and that its domain is an interval J.
To prove part 1, suppose that b is in J. We must verify that f −1 is continuous at b, where as usual we use one-sided continuity at endpoints. We can accomplish this by showing that if b is not the right endpoint of J, then f −1 is continuous from the right at b, and if b is not the left endpoint, then f −1 is continuous from the left at b. The proofs of these two statements are very similar, so we will do only the first.
Suppose that b is not the right endpoint of J, and let a = f −1(b). Then f (a) = b and, since f is strictly increasing, a is not the right endpoint of I. To show that f −1 is continuous from the right at b, we must prove that limx→b+ f −1(x) = f −1(b) = a. We use the ϵ-δ method.
Supposeϵ > 0. Since a is not the right endpoint of I, we can find a number a1 in I such that a < a1 ≤ a +ϵ. Let b1 = f (a1), and note that since f is strictly increasing, b < b1 (see Figure 7.9). Let δ = b1 −b > 0, so that b+δ = b1.
Now suppose that b < x < b+δ; we must prove that | f −1(x)−a| < ϵ. We have
f (a) = b < x < b+δ = b1 = f (a1),


Figure 7.9: The graphs of f and f −1.

so by the intermediate value theorem there must be some number c such that a < c < a1 and f (c) = x. Therefore f −1(x) = c, so
a < f −1(x) < a1 ≤ a +ϵ,
which implies that | f −1(x)−a| < ϵ, as required.
For part 2, suppose that f is differentiable at a and f ′(a) = 0. We will assume initially that a is in the interior of I, so that b is in the interior of J, and we therefore use ordinary two-sided derivatives. To find (f −1)′(b), we use the definition of derivatives:

To compute this limit, we let x = f −1(b+h). Then f (x) = b+h, so h = f (x)−b = f (x)− f (a). It follows that if h ≠ 0 then f (x) ≠ f (a), so x ≠ a. Thus, we can write

By part 1, f −1 is continuous at b, so as h →0=, x = f −1(b+h) → f −1(b) = a. But as we have just observed, if h = 0 then x = a, so we can say that as h →0≠, x →a≠. And since f is differentiable at a, as x →a≠,

Putting these facts together, we see that as h →0≠,

Thus, (f −1)′(b) = 1/f ′(a). We leave it to you to make appropriate adjustments in the proof to verify that if a and b are endpoints of their intervals, then this equation holds for one-sided derivatives.
To illustrate Theorem 7.2.2, we return to our first example in the last section, the function f (x) = x3, whose inverse is  Since f is continuous and strictly increasing on the interval (−∞,∞), we can apply the theorem. In particular, part 2  gives us a formula for the derivative of f −1. For any real number x ≠ 0, let  Then f (a) = a3 = x and f ′(a) = 3a2 = 0, so according to the theorem,

in agreement with the answer given by the power rule.
The equation in part 2 of Theorem 7.2.2 takes an interesting form when written in Leibniz notation. If y = f −1(x) then x = f (y), and according to part 2 of the theorem, if f ′(y) ≠ 0 then (f −1)′(x) = 1/f ′(y). But in Leibniz notation, (f −1)′(x) = dy/dx and f ′(y) = dx/dy, so this equation says

Thus, this is another instance in which, although dy/dx is not a fraction, it acts like one.

7.3 The Natural Logarithm
At this point, we know how to differentiate a wide range of functions, but our knowledge of antiderivatives is more limited. Perhaps the simplest function for which we don't yet know an antiderivative is the function f (x) = x−1 = 1/x. (Recall that the formula  doesn't apply when r = −1, since it would lead to division by 0.) In this section we will learn about an antiderivative of f.
As we saw in Corollary 5.4.2, one consequence of the first fundamental theorem of calculus is that if a function is continuous on an interval then it has an antiderivative on that interval. Thus, f must have an antiderivative on each of the intervals (−∞, 0) and (0,∞). Indeed, the first fundamental theorem tells us how to write down a particular antiderivative. Motivated by that theorem, we make the following definition:
Definition 7.3.1. For x > 0, we define

We sometimes leave out the parentheses and write ln x rather than ln(x). (We will discuss the name of this function and the reason for the notation "ln" later.)
According to the first fundamental theorem of calculus, for x > 0 we have

It follows that

We have now solved the problem of finding an antiderivative of 1/x, at least on the interval (0,∞). You may feel that, in some sense, it is cheating to call this a solution. Have we really found an antiderivative, or have we just made up a name for the antiderivative and then declared victory? To respond to this question, let us make several points about the significance of our solution.
First of all, we now know that 1/x has an antiderivative on the interval (0,∞). And in mathematics, once you know that something exists, it is often very useful to give it a name. Once you have a name for something, you can formulate questions about it and investigate its properties. We will eventually learn enough properties of the function ln x that you will begin to feel as comfortable with it as you do with other familiar functions, such as  or sin x.
But Definition 7.3.1 does more than simply give a name to an antiderivative of 1/x. The definition gives a formula for ln x that can be used to compute the numerical value of ln x for any positive number x. The easiest case is x = 1, since

But we can use Riemann sums to approximate other values of ln x to any desired degree of accuracy.
For example, consider the case x = 2:

To estimate the value of ln 2, let's compute a Riemann 4-sum for the function f (t) = 1/t on the interval [1, 2].We divide the interval [1, 2] into 4 smaller intervals, each of width △t = 1/4, using the division points

Taking the right endpoint of each interval [ti−1, ti ] as the sample point—that is, letting  —leads to the Riemann sum

In Figure 7.10a, the area of the blue shaded region is ln 2, and the Riemann sum R4 is equal to the sum of the areas of the four striped rectangles. Since the rectangles lie entirely inside the blue region, it is clear that

(For a more careful verification of this inequality, see Exercise 20.) A similar calculation, using the left endpoint of each interval as the sample point, leads to a Riemann sum that is an overestimate of ln 2 (see Figure 7.10b):

Riemann n-sums for larger values of n require more arithmetic, but should give more accurate estimates of ln 2. And, indeed, similar calculations using Riemann 1000-sums rather than Riemann 4-sums lead to the conclusion that
0.6928 ≤ ln 2 ≤ 0.6934.
Thus, we can say that ln 2 ≈ 0.693.
In Exercise 21, we invite you to use Riemann 4-sums to estimate the value of ln 3. Once again, using Riemann n-sums for larger values of n leads to more accurate estimates, allowing us to conclude that ln 3 ≈ 1.099.
We now know three points on the graph of y = ln x: (1, 0), (2, ln 2) ≈ (2, 0.693), and (3, ln 3) ≈ (3, 1.099). What does the rest of the graph look like? We can use the curve-sketching techniques we learned in Chapter 4 to answer this question. For x > 0


Figure 7.10: The graph of y = 1/t.

we have

It follows that the function ln x is continuous, strictly increasing, and concave down on its entire domain, the interval (0,∞). Thus, the graph of y = ln x must have the shape shown in Figure 7.11.We have put question marks at both ends of the graph to indicate that we don't know yet whether there are asymptotes. To determine this, we will need to evaluate limx→0+ ln x and limx→∞ ln x; we'll find the values of these limits later in this section.


Figure 7.11: The graph of y = ln x.

Example 7.3.2. Find the derivatives of the following functions:
f (x) = sin(ln x), g(x) = sin x ln(x2 +1), h(x) = ln(5x).
Solution. We combine the equation  with our previous formulas for derivatives:

The derivative of the function h in Example 7.3.2 is a bit surprising: the factor of 5 ended up making no difference at all! Indeed, for any positive constant a we have

This means that ln(ax) is another antiderivative of 1/x on the interval (0,∞). But we already know that every such antiderivative must have the form ln x + C. We conclude that there must be some number C such that for every x > 0,
ln(ax) = ln x + C.
Can we determine the value of C? We usually do this by plugging in a particular value for x, and in the case of the function ln x, the easiest value to plug in is 1.
Setting x = 1 we find that
ln a = ln 1+C = 0+C = C.
Thus, C = ln a, so we have shown that for all x > 0,

This equation leads to our next theorem.
Theorem 7.3.3. Let a and b be any positive numbers.
1. ln(ab) = ln a +ln b.

Proof. To prove part 1, we simply substitute b for x in equation (7.6). (Notice that this proof could be thought of as another example of the paradox of generalization: to understand ln(ab) for particular positive numbers a and b, we used a fact about the function ln(ax) for all x > 0.)
We use part 1 to prove part 2:

Rearranging, we get ln(1/a) = −ln a.
Finally, part 3 follows from parts 1 and 2:

We hope the equations in Theorem 7.3.3 look familiar to you: if you have studied logarithms before, then you will recognize that logarithms satisfy exactly the same equations. It appears, then, that the function ln x has something in common with logarithms. For this reason, ln x is called the natural logarithm of x. Although natural logarithms are not exactly the same as the logarithms that are usually studied in high school, the two are closely related; we will discuss the relationship later in this chapter.1
Our next theorem shows that natural logarithms satisfy another familiar property of logarithms:
Theorem 7.3.4. For any positive number a and any rational number r, ln(ar) = r ln a.
Proof. Motivated by the paradox of generalization, to learn about ln(ar) for a single positive number a we begin by studying the function ln(xr) for all x > 0. We have

Thus, ln(xr) is an antiderivative of r/x on the interval (0,∞). But we can find all such antiderivatives by computing the indefinite integral of r/x:

It follows that there must be some constant C such that for all x > 0,
ln(xr) = r ln x + C.
Once again, to evaluate C we set x = 1, which gives us the equation
ln 1 = r ln 1+C.
Since ln 1 = 0, we conclude that C = 0, and therefore
ln(xr) = r ln x.
Finally, substituting a for x proves the theorem.
As an example of Theorem 7.3.4, consider the case a = 3. Since ln 3 ≈ 1.099 > 1, for every positive integer n we have ln(3n) = n ln 3 > n. Using this fact, we can now settle the question of whether the curve y = ln x has asymptotes:
Theorem 7.3.5.

Proof. By definition, the limit statement in part 1 means that for every number M, there is some number N such that if x > N then ln x > M. To prove this, consider any number M. Let n be an integer larger than M, and let N = 3n. Then for any x > N we have
ln x > ln N = ln(3n) = n ln 3 > n > M,
as required.
For part 2, we use the fact that ln(1/x) = −ln x, and therefore ln x = −ln(1/x). As x → 0+, we have 1/x →∞, and therefore, by part 1,
ln x = −ln(1/x)→−∞.
Thus, limx→0+ ln x = −∞.
Theorem 7.3.5 tells us that the graph of y = ln x has a vertical asymptote at x = 0, but no horizontal asymptote. Although the curve rises very slowly if we continue to follow it to the right in Figure 7.11, for any horizontal line y = M that we might draw, the curve eventually crosses that line and continues to rise.
We have not yet found an antiderivative of 1/x on the interval (−∞, 0). For x < 0, ln x is undefined, but ln(−x) is defined, and we have

Thus, ln(−x) is an antiderivative of 1/x on (−∞, 0).We can combine our antiderivatives on the intervals (−∞, 0) and (0,∞) into one function by observing that

Thus, we can write

and this answer applies on both of the intervals (−∞, 0) and (0,∞) that make up the domain of the function 1/x. The graph of y = ln |x| is shown in Figure 7.12.

Example 7.3.6. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. To evaluate integral (a) we use the substitution u = x2 −3, du = 2x dx, (1/2) du = x dx:

For integral (b), we use the substitution u = ln x, du = (1/x) dx:

Finally, for integral (c) we use the substitution u = 1−2x, du = −2 dx, (−1/2) du = dx. Since this is a definite integral, we also change the limits of integration from the x-values 1 and 2 to the corresponding u-values −1 and −3:

27.A hollow cylinder is 20 inches long, and it has a radius of 2 inches. It is closed at one end and open at the other. A piston (a disk that just fits inside the cylinder) is inserted into the open end and pushed in, and as a result the air inside the cylinder is compressed and the pressure inside the cylinder increases. According to Boyle's law, the pressure P of the air in the cylinder (measured in pounds per square inch, abbreviated psi) and the volume V of the air in the cylinder (measured in in3) are related by the equation P = K/V, for some constant K.
(a)Assuming that the pressure inside the cylinder when the piston is first inserted is equal to atmospheric pressure (approximately 15 psi), find K.

7.4 The Exponential Function
In the last section, we learned that the natural logarithm function is strictly increasing. It follows that the natural log is one-to-one, and therefore it has an inverse. In this section we study the inverse of the natural log. For reasons that will soon become clear, it is called the exponential function.
Definition 7.4.1. The inverse of the natural logarithm function is called the exponential function, and is denoted exp.
The graph of y = ln x is shown in Figure 7.13a. Flipping this graph over across the line y = x produces the graph of y = exp(x), which is shown in Figure 7.13b.


Figure 7.13: The graphs of the natural logarithm and the exponential function.

And since flipping the graph over corresponds to reversing the roles of x and y, we have
y = exp(x) if and only if x = ln y.
Applying ideas from Sections 7.1 and 7.2, we can immediately make a few observations about the exponential function. The domain of the natural logarithm is (0,∞), and since limx→0+ ln x = −∞and limx→∞ ln x =∞, the range is (−∞,∞). It follows that the domain of the exponential function is (−∞,∞), and the range is (0,∞). Thus, for all x, exp(x) is defined and exp(x) > 0. We also know that the natural log and exponential function undo each other. In other words,
for all x, ln(exp(x)) = x,
for all x > 0, exp(ln x) = x.
By Theorem 7.2.2, the exponential function is continuous and differentiable at all real numbers. We will find its derivative later in this section.
Some further properties of the exponential function follow immediately from properties of the natural log:
Theorem 7.4.2. Let a and b be any real numbers.
1. exp(a) · exp(b) = exp(a + b).

3. If a > 0 and r is any rational number, then ar = exp(r ln a).
Proof. We begin by observing that, by part 1 of Theorem 7.3.3,
ln(exp(a) · exp(b)) = ln(exp(a))+ln(exp(b)) = a + b.
Therefore
exp(a) · exp(b) = exp(ln(exp(a) · exp(b))) = exp(a + b),
which establishes part 1. The proof of part 2 is similar; see Exercise 1.
Finally, for part 3 we begin with the fact that, by Theorem 7.3.4, ln(ar) = r ln a. Therefore
ar = exp(ln(ar)) = exp(r ln a).
As an example of part 3 of Theorem 7.4.2, consider the case a = 2. According to the theorem, for every rational number r,
2r = exp(r ln 2) ≈ exp(0.693r).
What if r is an irrational number? Then, as we have observed before, we have not yet assigned a meaning to the expression 2r . But notice that the domain of the exponential function includes all real numbers, and therefore exp(r ln 2) is defined.
Another way to understand this point is to compare the graphs of the equations y = 2x and y = exp(x ln 2). The graph of y = 2x includes only points whose x-coordinates are rational, so it looks something like the dotted curve in Figure 7.14a. It is a curve with holes in it at all irrational values of x. (Of course, it isn't possible to make the dots and holes in the figure small enough to accurately reflect the way the rational and irrational numbers are crowded together on the number line.) On the other hand, the graph of y = exp(x ln 2) is a continuous curve with no holes in it, as shown in Figure 7.14b. What part 3 of Theorem 7.4.2 tells us is that this curve passes through all of the dots that make up the graph of y = 2x . In other words, if you were to place Figure 7.14b on top of Figure 7.14a, the continuous curve y = exp(x ln 2) would lie exactly on top of the dotted curve y = 2x .


Figure 7.14: The graphs of y = 2x and y = exp(x ln 2).

Up until now we have not tried to define 2x for irrational values of x. But surely if we were to define it, we would want to do it in such a way that the graph of y = 2x would become a continuous curve. It wasn't clear before whether or not this was possible; that is, we didn't know whether there was a continuous curve passing through all points on the graph in Figure 7.14a. But now we have stumbled on such a curve: y = exp(x ln 2). And in fact, it can be shown that this is the only continuous curve that passes through all of these points (see Exercise 22). This suggests that for irrational x, we should define 2x to be exp (x ln 2). More generally, we make the following definition:
Definition 7.4.3. If a > 0 and x is irrational, then we define ax to be exp(x ln a).
Notice that this definition can only be used when a > 0, since ln a is undefined for a ≤ 0 (see Exercise 23). Combining this definition with part 3 of Theorem 7.4.2, we can now say that for all a > 0 and all real numbers x, whether rational or irrational,

and therefore

Using these facts, we can show that our new, extended definition of ax satisfies all of the familiar properties of exponentiation:
Theorem 7.4.4. Suppose a > 0, b > 0, and r and s are any real numbers.
1. ar · as = ar+s .

3. (ar)s = ars.
4. ar · br = (ab)r .

Proof. For part 1, we apply equation (7.7) and part 1 of Theorem 7.4.2:
ar · as = exp(r ln a) · exp(s ln a) = exp(r ln a + s ln a) = exp((r + s) ln a) = ar+s .
For part 3, we use equations (7.7) and (7.8) to compute
(ar)s = exp(s ln ar) = exp(s(r ln a)) = exp((rs) ln a) = ars.
The proofs for parts 2, 4, and 5 are similar. We leave the details to you; see Exercise 2.
We have now defined ax for all a > 0 and all real numbers x, but there is a particular value of a that is especially convenient. Equation (7.7) is simplest if ln a = 1, or equivalently a = exp(1). There is a standard notation in mathematics for this number.
Definition 7.4.5. The number exp(1) is denoted e.
We have e = exp(1), and since the exponential function is the inverse of the natural log, this means that ln e = 1. We already know that ln 2 ≈ 0.693 < 1, ln 3 ≈ 1.099 > 1, and the natural log function is strictly increasing, so e must be between 2 and 3. Riemann sum calculations similar to the ones we did earlier can be used to show that ln 2.7 ≈ 0.993 < 1 and ln 2.8 ≈ 1.030 > 1, so 2.7 < e < 2.8. And by taking these calculations even further it can be shown that e ≈ 2.71828. It turns out that e, like π, is an irrational number whose decimal expansion goes on forever, with no obvious pattern in the digits. It has important uses throughout mathematics, and we will make extensive use of it for the rest of this book.
Taking a = e in equation (7.7), we see that for all x,
ex = exp(x ln e) = exp(x · 1) = exp(x).
In other words, the exponential function exp(x) is the same as the function ex! Of course, this is the reason it is called the exponential function. From now on we will use the notations exp(x) and ex interchangeably. In particular, we can rewrite some of the most important facts we have learned about the exponential function as follows:
for all x, ln ex = x,

A good way to remember equation (7.9) is to write a = eln a and then apply part 3 of Theorem 7.4.4:
ax = (eln a)x = ex ln a.
One reason that the exponential function and the natural log are important is that they can be useful for solving equations. We illustrate with a couple of examples.
Example 7.4.6. Solve for x:
(a) 3x = 2x+1,(b) ln(2x + e) = 2 −ln x.
Solution. The main difficulty in solving equation (a) is that the x's are in the exponents. We can get them out of the exponents by applying the natural logarithm function to both sides of the equation. Notice that both sides are positive for all values of x, so they are in the domain of the natural log.
ln(3x) = ln(2x+1),
x ln 3 = (x +1) ln 2,
x(ln 3−ln 2) = ln 2,

We leave it to you to verify (see Exercise 24) that this value is a solution to the original equation.
For equation (b), the difficulty is that the x's appear inside the natural log function, so we apply the exponential function to both sides:

2x2 +ex −e2 = 0,
(2x −e)(x + e) = 0.
The final equation has two solutions, x = e/2 and x = −e. But x = −e doesn't make sense in the original equation, since the natural log of a negative number is undefined. We ask you to check in Exercise 24 that x = e/2 ≈ 1.359 is a solution to the original equation, so it is the only solution.
We pointed out earlier that, by Theorem 7.2.2, the exponential function is differentiable at all real numbers. What is its derivative? We could use the formula in part 2 of Theorem 7.2.2 to find this derivative, but it is perhaps just as easy to use implicit differentiation. If we let y = ex, then ln y = x, and therefore

Thus,

This is certainly a remarkable property of the exponential function; we have never before come across a function that is equal to its own derivative! There are many applications of the exponential function that are based on this property; see Exercises 27 and 28 for examples. In Exercise 25 you are asked to determine all functions that have this interesting property.
Notice that for all x, we have

It follows that the exponential function is strictly increasing and concave up on (−∞,∞). This confirms the shape of the graph in Figure 7.13b. Since the exponential function is strictly increasing and its range is (0,∞), it is also not hard to verify (see Exercise 15) that

These limits are also evident in Figure 7.13b. In particular, notice that the vertical line x = 0 is an asymptote of the graph of y = ln x, and when the graph is flipped over it becomes the horizontal asymptote y = 0 of the graph of y = ex .
Example 7.4.7. Find the derivatives of the following functions:

Solution. We combine our new derivative formula  with the chain rule:

When working with a function in which some number other than e is raised to a power, it is often easiest to use equation (7.9) to rewrite the function in terms of the exponential function. We illustrate this in our next example.
Example 7.4.8. Find the derivatives of the following functions:
f (x) = 2x, g(x) = xπ, h(x) = x x, x > 0.
Solution. To differentiate f, we use equation (7.9) to rewrite f (x) in the form
f (x) = 2x = ex ln 2.
Therefore

Similar reasoning can be used to show that for any number a > 0,

Notice that this equation is simplest when a = e, in which case ln a = ln e = 1 and the equation becomes 
Now consider the function g. Since π is irrational, the meaning of xπ is given by equation (7.9). According to that definition, the domain of g is (0,∞), and for all x > 0, g(x) = eπ ln x. Therefore

Thus, the power rule works for the exponent π as well! In fact, similar reasoning can be used to show that it works for all irrational exponents.
Finally, turning to the function h, by equation (7.9) we have h(x) = ex ln x, and therefore

As another example of the value of equation (7.9), we establish the following facts, which will be useful later.
Theorem 7.4.9. Let p be any real number.
1. If p > 0 then limx→∞ x p =∞.
2. If p < 0 then limx→∞ x p = 0.
3. If p > 1 then limx→∞ px =∞.
4. If 0 < p < 1 then limx→∞ px = 0.
For example, this theorem tells us that limx→∞ x0.01 =∞, limx→∞ x−0.01 = 0, limx→∞ 1.01x =∞, and limx→∞ 0.99x = 0.
Proof. By equation (7.9), x p = ep lnx. To find the limit of this function as x approaches infinity, first note that as x →∞, lnx →∞. Thus, if p > 0 then p ln x →∞, and therefore x p = ep ln x →∞. On the other hand, if p < 0 then p ln x →−∞, so x p = ep ln x → 0. This proves statements 1 and 2.
The proofs for statements 3 and 4 are similar. Once again, we begin by applying equation (7.9) to write px = ex ln p. If p > 1 then ln p > 0, so as x →∞, x ln p →∞, and therefore px = ex ln p →∞. On the other hand, if 0 < p < 1 then ln p < 0, so as x →∞, x ln p →−∞and px = ex ln p → 0.
For every new derivative formula there is a corresponding integration formula. Since we also have Using this formula, we can solve a variety of other integrals involving the exponential function.
Example 7.4.10. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. For integral (a), we make the substitution

which leads to the solution

For integral (b), we write ex+3 = ex · e3 and then substitute u = ex, du = ex dx: 

Finally, for integral (c) we rewrite e2x as ex · ex and then substitute u = ex +1, ex = u −1, du = ex dx:

There are two simplifications we can make in this answer: we can drop the first "+1," since adding a constant to an antiderivative gives another antiderivative, and we can drop the absolute value signs, since ex +1 is always positive. This gives us the answer

We end this section by briefly considering the logarithms that you may have studied previously. If a > 0 and a = 1, then it can be shown that the function f (x) = ax is one-to-one, its domain is (−∞,∞), and its range is (0,∞) (see Exercise 30). Therefore f has an inverse. This inverse is called the logarithm to the base a, and it is denoted loga. Thus, for all x and y,
y = loga x if and only if x = ay.
The domain of loga is (0,∞) and its range is (−∞,∞).
To put it more informally, for any x > 0, loga x is the number y such that ay = x. For example, log3 81 = 4 since 34 = 81, and log2(1/4)= −2 since 2−2 = 1/4. You may have previously studied logarithms to the base 10, for which we have log10 100 = 2, log10 1000 = 3, and so on.
Using methods we developed in Section 7.1, we can find a formula for loga x. Suppose x > 0, and let y = loga x. Then x = ay. We can now solve this equation for y by taking the natural log of both sides of the equation: ln x = ln(ay) = y ln a, and  therefore y = ln x/ln a. But y = loga x, so we have shown that
In the case a = e, we have

Thus, we have finally found the relationship between the natural logarithm and other logarithms: the natural logarithm is simply the logarithm to the base e.
We have traveled a somewhat circuitous route to reach our conclusions in this section, so it may be worthwhile to summarize some of the conclusions we have reached about the functions ax and loga x. When working with these functions, we have found that it is easiest to use the value a = e, for which these functions are ex = exp(x) and loge x = ln x. One of the reasons these particular functions are the easiest to use is that their derivatives take a very simple form:

For other values of a, the derivatives are slightly more complicated. But there is no need to spend much time studying ax and loga x for other values of a, because equations (7.9) and (7.10) tell us how to reexpress these functions in terms of ex and ln x:

Thus, if we know how to work with the functions ex and ln x, then we can use these equations to solve problems involving ax and loga x for other values of a.

In other words, there is some number k such that for all t, f ′(t) = k f (t). By Exercise 26, it follows that f (t) = Cekx, for some constant C.

29. A light is hanging from the ceiling by a wire. Each piece of the wire must support the weight of the part of the wire that is below it, as well as the weight of the light. Thus, higher parts of the wire must support more weight than lower parts, and it makes sense that the wire might need to be thicker at the top than at the bottom. In this problem we will assume that the weight that a piece of wire can support is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the wire, and we will find the shape of a wire that is just barely thick enough to hold the light without breaking.
Suppose that the light weighs w pounds, the wire is L inches long, the wire is made of material that weighs d pounds per cubic inch, and a piece of the wire can support s pounds per square inch of cross-sectional area. We will assume that the wire is formed by rotating the region bounded by the curve x = f (y), the y-axis, the x-axis, and the line y = L about the y-axis, for some positive continuous function f, where the axes are marked off in inches. We also assume that at each point along its length, the wire is just barely wide enough to support the weight of the light and the part of the wire below that point.

7.5 The Inverse Trigonometric Functions
Now that we know how useful it can be to study inverses of functions, it is natural to ask if there are more functions whose inverses we should investigate. In this section we study inverses of some trigonometric functions.
For example, consider the sine function. Looking at the graph of y = sin x in Figure 7.15, we see that there is a problem with defining an inverse: the sine function is very far from being one-to-one. Indeed, for every number c between −1 and 1, the horizontal line y = c intersects the curve y = sin x infinitely many times! But we already know how to deal with this problem: restrict the domain of the function to make it one-to-one.
Restricting the domain of the sine function to the interval [−π/2, π/2] will give us the part of the graph shown in black in Figure 7.15, and no horizontal line intersects this part of the graph more than once. There are other intervals we could use. For example, restricting the domain of the sine function to the interval [π/2, 3π/2] would also give us a one-to-one function. There is no particular reason to use one interval rather than another, but we must choose some interval, and the interval [−π/2, π/2] is the standard choice that mathematicians use.
To state our idea more precisely, we define a function f with domain [−π/2, π/2] by saying that for −π/2 ≤ x ≤ π/2, f (x) = sin x. Thus, f is the restriction of the sine function to the interval [−π/2, π/2], and it is a continuous, strictly increasing function with domain [−π/2, π/2] and range [−1, 1]. The graph of f consists of all points (x, y) such that y = sin x and−π/2 ≤ x ≤ π/2. Flipping this graph over across the line y = x gives us the points (x, y) such that x = sin y and −π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2. This is the graph of the inverse of f, which is called the inverse sine function.


Figure 7.15: The function sin x is not one-to-one, but we can make it one-to-one by restricting it to −π/2 ≤ x ≤ π/2.

Definition 7.5.1. Let f be the restriction of the sine function to the interval [−π/2, π/2]. Then the inverse of f is called the inverse sine function, and it is denoted sin−1. Thus, for all numbers x and y,
y = sin−1 x if and only if x = sin y and 
The graph of the inverse sine function is shown in Figure 7.16. Clearly the domain of the inverse sine is [−1, 1], and its range is [−π/2, π/2]. Note that some books call this function the arcsine function, and write arcsin x rather than sin−1 x. Also, remember that although sin2 x = (sin x)2, sin−1 x is not the same as (sin x)−1 = csc x.

Example 7.5.2. Compute:

Solution. For part (a), let  According to Definition 7.5.1, this means that  and −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. Thus, θ is an angle in the first or fourth quadrant whose sine is  We know an angle that fits this description: sin (π/3) =  and −π/2 ≤ π/3 ≤ π/2. Notice that there are other angles whose sine is For example, sin (2π/3) =  But 2π/3 is not between−π/2 and π/2. In the interval [−π/2, π/2], the only angle whose sine isis π/3. Thus, sin−1  = θ = π/3. When working with the inverse sine function, we will often use the strategy we just used in our solution to part (a): give a name to the particular value of the inverse sine function that is under discussion, and then apply Definition 7.5.1. Since values of the inverse sine function represent angles, we often use the letter θ for a value of the inverse sine function.
Applying this method in part (b), we let θ = sin−1(−1/2). This means sin θ = −1/2 and −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. Since sin(−π/6)= −1/2 and −π/2 ≤ −π/6 ≤ π/2, we conclude that sin−1(−1/2) = θ = −π/6.
Finally, for part (c), if we let θ = sin−1(1), then sin θ = 1 and −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2, and the only angle that fits this description is θ = π/2. Thus, sin−1(1) = π/2.
Since the inverse sine function is the inverse of a restricted version of the sine function, we know that these functions undo each other. In other words,
(a) for all x ∈ [−π/2, π/2], sin−1(sin x) = x;
(b) for all x ∈ [−1, 1], sin(sin−1 x) = x.
The restrictions on the values of x in these statements are necessary. For example, consider sin−1(sin(8π/7)). You might think that this must be equal to 8π/7, but statement (a) doesn't apply, since 8π/7 > π/2. Let's work it out carefully. We let θ = sin−1(sin(8π/7)), which means that sin θ = sin(8π/7) and −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. We now see that θ = 8π/7 can't be right, because 8π/7 is not in the interval [−π/2, π/2]. To find θ, we must find the unique angle between −π/2 and π/2 whose sine is the same as the sine of 8π/7. The easiest way to find the answer is to look at the unit circle. In Figure 7.17 you can see by symmetry that the points P and Q have the same y-coordinate, and therefore sin(−π/7) = sin(8π/7). Since −π/2 ≤ −π/7 ≤ π/2, we conclude that sin−1(sin(8π/7)) = θ = −π/7.


Figure 7.17

We can similarly define inverses for all of the trigonometric functions. In each case, we must restrict the domain of the trigonometric function in order to make it one-to-one. There is more than one restriction we could choose, but certain choices have become standard. For example, we define the inverse tangent function as follows:
Definition 7.5.3. Let f be the restriction of the tangent function to the interval (−π/2, π/2). Then the inverse of f is called the inverse tangent function, and it is denoted tan−1. Thus, for all x and y,
y = tan−1 x if and only if x = tan y and 


Figure 7.18: The graphs of the tangent and inverse tangent functions.

The graphs of the tangent and inverse tangent functions are shown in Figure 7.18. The restriction of the tangent function to the interval (−π/2, π/2) gives us the part of the graph that is shown in black in Figure 7.18a, and flipping this part of the graph over gives us the graph of the inverse tangent in Figure 7.18b. Notice that the graph of the tangent function has vertical asymptotes at x = ±π/2. When the graph is flipped over, these become horizontal asymptotes for the graph of the inverse tangent function at y = ±π/2. Thus, limx→∞ tan−1 x = π/2 and limx→−∞ tan−1 x = −π/2.
The only other trigonometric function whose inverse we will make use of in this book is the secant function.
Definition 7.5.4. Let f be the restriction of the secant function to the set [0, π/2) ∪ (π/2, π]. Then the inverse of f is called the inverse secant function, and it is denoted sec−1. Thus, for all x and y,
y = sec−1(x) if and only if x = sec y and either 


Figure 7.19: The graphs of the secant and inverse secant functions.

The graphs of secant and inverse secant are shown in Figure 7.19. The vertical asymptote of the graph of the secant function at x = π/2, when flipped over, turns into a horizontal asymptote for the graph of the inverse secant at y = π/2. Thus, limx→∞ sec−1 x = limx→−∞ sec−1 x = π/2.
It is clear in Figure 7.19b that the domain of the inverse secant function is (−∞,−1] ∪[1,∞). Thus, the inverse secant function comes in two pieces, and it is sometimes helpful to work with these pieces separately. You can see in the figure that the graph of y = sec−1 x for x ≥ 1 comes from flipping over the graph of y = sec x for 0 ≤ x < π/2, and y = sec−1 x for x ≤ −1 comes from y = sec x for π/2 < x ≤ π. Thus, for x ≥ 1,

while if x ≤ −1 then
y = sec−1 x if and only if x = sec y and 
We should warn you that, while many mathematicians use the definition we have given for the inverse secant function, some use a slightly different definition. Everyone seems to agree that, for x ≥ 1, sec−1 x should belong to the interval [0, π/2). For x ≤ −1, we have said that sec−1 x belongs to the interval (π/2, π], but some mathematicians choose the interval [π, 3π/2) instead. There are two lessons here. The first is that when reading another book, you should check to see which definition they use. And the second is that one can avoid potential confusions by using sec−1 x only for x ≥ 1, if possible. We will see that it is sometimes possible to avoid the "left half" of the inverse secant function altogether.
Example 7.5.5. Compute:
(a) tan−1(−1), (b) sec−1(2).
Solution. For part (a), let θ = tan−1(−1). This means that tan θ = −1 and −π/2 < θ < π/2. Since tan(−π/4) = −1 and −π/2 < −π/4 < π/2, we see that tan−1(−1) = θ = −π/4.
Similarly, for part (b) we let θ = sec−1(2), which means that sec θ = 2 and either 0 ≤ θ < π/2 or π/2 < θ ≤ π/2. In fact, since 2 ≥ 1, we can restrict our attention to the "right half" of the inverse secant function and conclude that 0 ≤ θ < π/2. Rewriting the equation sec θ = 2 as cos θ = 1/2 may help you see that sec−1(2) = θ = π/3.
Example 7.5.6. Compute:
(a) cos(sin−1(−4/5)), (b) tan(sec−1(−3)).
Solution. For part (a), we let θ = sin−1(−4/5). Then sinθ = −4/5 and −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2, and we are asked to find cos(sin−1(−4/5)) = cos θ. Since we know the value of sin θ and we have to find cos θ, a natural next step is to look for a relationship between sin θ and cos θ. Of course, we know that cos2 θ +sin2 θ = 1, so

But we're not done yet. There can be only one value for cos(sin−1(−4/5)), so we need to decide which value is the right one, 3/5 or −3/5. There is one piece of information about θ that we haven't used yet: −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. This tells us that θ is in either the first or the fourth quadrant, and in those quadrants the cosine function is never negative. Therefore cos(sin−1(−4/5)) = cos θ = 3/5.
We proceed in a similar way for part (b). Let θ = sec−1(−3), so that sec θ = −3 and either 0 ≤ θ < π/2 or π/2 < θ ≤ π. We must find tan(sec−1(−3)) = tan θ, so we use the identity tan2 θ +1 = sec2 θ. (If you don't remember this identity, notice that you can derive it from cos2 θ +sin2 θ = 1 by dividing both sides by cos2 θ.) This gives us

Once again we look to the restriction on θ to decide which answer is right. We know that either 0 ≤ θ < π/2 or π/2 < θ ≤ π, so θ is in either the first or second quadrant. Unfortunately, the tangent function is nonnegative in the first quadrant and nonpositive in the second, so this doesn't help us. This is a good example of why it is sometimes useful to treat the two halves of the inverse secant function separately. In this case we have θ = sec−1(−3), so we are using sec−1 x for x ≤ −1. For that part of the inverse secant function we have π/2 < θ ≤ π, θ is in the second quadrant and tan θ ≤ 0. Therefore tan 
We turn now to the derivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions. The function sin x is differentiable at all numbers, and its derivative, cos x, is nonzero whenever −π/2 < x < π/2. It follows, by Theorem 7.2.2, that the inverse sine function is differentiable on the interior of its domain, the interval (−1, 1). We find it simplest to compute the derivative by implicit differentiation. Let y = sin−1 x. Then sin y = x and −π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2, so

Imitating the reasoning we used in Example 7.5.6, we can simplify the denominator by using the identity cos2 y +sin2 y = 1:

Since −π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2, we have cos y ≥ 0, so we can eliminate the negative solution and conclude that Thus,

Similar methods can be used to find the derivatives of the inverse tangent and secant. By Theorem 7.2.2, the inverse tangent is differentiable on its entire domain, the interval (−∞,∞). And applying the theorem separately to the two pieces of the inverse secant function, we conclude that the inverse secant is differentiable on both of the intervals (−∞,−1) and (1,∞).
To find the derivative of the inverse tangent, we begin by letting y = tan−1 x. This means that tan y = x and −π/2 < y < π/, so

Finally, for the inverse secant we let y = sec−1 x. Then secy = x and either 0 ≤ y < π/2 or π/2 < y ≤ π, so

To simplify the denominator, we start with the fact that sec y = x, and therefore

Unfortunately, the restriction on y tells us that y is in either the first or the second quadrant, and the sign of tan y is different in these two quadrants. Once again, we must treat the two halves of the inverse secant function separately. For x ≥ 1 we have 0 ≤ y < π/2, so tan y ≥ 0 and therefore  Similar reasoning for x ≤ −1 leads to the conclusion that  Putting it all together, we conclude that

We can combine these into one formula by writing

The derivatives we have computed are summarized in Table 7.2. Notice that each derivative also gives us a new indefinite integral formula. These integration formulas illustrate one of the reasons why the inverse trigonometric functions are important in calculus: sometimes an integral that appears to have nothing to do with trigonometry can have an answer that contains an inverse trigonometric function.


Table 7.2: Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions, and the corresponding integration formulas.

In fact, the integrals in Table 7.2 are just the tip of the iceberg. We will eventually see that many integrals that don't appear to involve trigonometry will have inverse trigonometric functions in their answers. As a step in that direction, we evaluate some integrals related to those in Table 7.2.
Example 7.5.7. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. For integral (a), motivated by the fact that 9x2 = (3x)2, we make the substitution u = 3x, du = 3 dx, (1/3) du = dx:

To evaluate integral (b), it turns out it is helpful to complete the square in the denominator:

Now we can substitute u = (x +1)/2, du = (1/2) dx, 2 du = dx:

Notice that the domain of the integrand in part (c) is (−∞,−1] ∪[1,∞). For x ≥ 1, the integral is the same as the third integral in Table 7.2, so the answer is sec−1 x + C. For x ≤ −1, we'll use the substitution u = −x, du = (−1) dx; notice that u ≥ 1:

Combining our answers for the two halves of the domain, we can express our answer as
 follows:
There are other ways of writing the answer to this integral, but one nice feature of the solution we have chosen is that it uses the inverse secant function only on the interval [1,∞). Thus, we have avoided the controversial left half of the inverse secant.
We end this section with a few more examples of calculus problems we can solve with the formulas we have derived.
Example 7.5.8. Evaluate:

Solution. For parts (a) and (b), we use the chain rule:

For part (c), we begin by splitting the integral into two integrals:

We can now solve the two integrals separately. For the first, we use the substitution u = 3x2 +1, du = 6x dx, (1/6) du = x dx:

Notice that the absolute value signs can be dropped, since 3x2 +1 > 0. For the second integral, we use the substitution 

Combining these two integrals, we conclude that

Finally, the substitution u = x2, du = 2x dx can be used to solve the integral in (d):

Notice that we have used our answer to part (c) of the last example to get sec−1 |u|, but once we replaced u with x2 it became clear that the absolute value signs were unnecessary.

29. Verify that for all real numbers t,

This implies that the point (cosh t, sinh t) lies on the curve x2 − y2 = 1, which is a hyperbola. For this reason, the functions cosh and sinh are called the hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine. (Of course, this should remind you of the identity cos2 t +sin2 t = 1, which implies that the point (cos t, sin t) lies on the circle x2 + y2 = 1.)

7.6 L'Hôpital's Rule Again
With all of the new functions we have learned about in this chapter, we can now do a lot more with l'Hôpital's rule. We begin with a few examples.
Example 7.6.1. Evaluate the following limits:

Solution. Limit (a) is an indeterminate form of type 0/0, so it is natural to try l'Hôpital's rule. We have

so l'Hôpital's rule leads us to compute

Thus, the value of limit (a) is 
In limit (b), we have x →∞ and (tan−1 x −π/2)→ (π/2−π/2) = 0, so the limit has the indeterminate form ∞·0. To apply l'Hôpital's rule, we first rewrite the limit as an indeterminate form of type 0/0:

Now l'Hôpital's rule leads us to evaluate the limit

We conclude that the value of limit (b) is −1.
Limit (c) is also an indeterminate form of type 0/0. Differentiating numerator and denominator leads to the limit

This is another indeterminate form of type 0/0, so we use l'Hôpital's rule again:

Thus, by two applications of l'Hôpital's rule, the value of limit (c) is −1/2.
Finally, in limit (d), as x →−∞, ex →0, so the limit has the indeterminate form ∞·0. One way to rewrite it as a limit of a fraction would be

This is an indeterminate form of type 0/0, so we try differentiating numerator and denominator:

This is another indeterminate form of type 0/0, but it looks more complicated than the original limit. We could apply l'Hôpital's rule again, but it is not hard to see that this will just make matters even worse. We'd better go back and try a different approach.
There is another way to rewrite the original limit as a limit of a fraction:

Now as x →−∞, in the denominator we have −x →∞, and therefore e−x →∞. Thus, the limit is an indeterminate form of type∞/∞, and l'Hôpital's rule prompts us to compute the limit

We conclude that limit (d) is equal to 0.
Next we look at what l'Hôpital's rule can tell us about the growth rates of the exponential function and the natural logarithm. We know that limx→∞ ex = limx→∞ ln x = ∞, but looking at the graphs of the exponential function and the natural log, we can see that as x →∞, ex grows very quickly, whereas ln x grows much more slowly. We make this statement precise in our next theorem by comparing the growth rates of ex and ln x to the growth rates of some other familiar functions.
Theorem 7.6.2. For every positive integer n, we have the following limits:

Part 1 of Theorem 7.6.2 compares ex to xn. For every positive integer n, the function xn is strictly increasing on the interval [0,∞), and limx→∞ xn =∞. The larger n is, the more quickly xn increases as x increases. For example, if f (x) = x100, then f (0) = 0 and f (10) is a number that is 101 digits long, so f increases very quickly. But part 1 of the theorem says that no matter how large n is, ex grows faster than xn: when x gets very large, the ratio ex/xn gets very large, which means that ex is much larger than xn.
Similarly, part 2 of the theorem compares ln x to  If n is large, then  grows very slowly. But no matter how large n is, ln x grows more slowly than  when x gets very large, ln close to 0, and therefore ln x is much smaller than 
Proof of Theorem 7.6.2. To prove part 1, we use mathematical induction.
Base case. For the case n = 1, we must evaluate the limit

which is an indeterminate form of type ∞/∞. Differentiating numerator and denominator gives us the limit

Thus, by l'Hôpital's rule, the original limit is also infinite.
Induction step. Suppose that n is a positive integer and limx→∞ ex/xn =∞. To compute

we apply l'Hôpital's rule, which leads us to compute the limit

by the inductive hypothesis. Thus, limx→∞ ex/xn+1 =∞.
To prove part 2, note that for any positive integer n, the limit

is an indeterminate form of type∞/∞. To apply l'Hôpital's rule, we compute

Thus, limx→∞ ln 
For an alternative approach to this proof, see Exercise 30.
Although we have used the functions ex and ln x in the statement of Theorem 7.6.2, it is worth mentioning that similar conclusions hold for the functions ax and loga x, for any number a > 1. To see why, we can use Theorem 7.6.2 to justify the following calculations:

We can also use ideas from this chapter, together with l'Hôpital's rule, to evaluate limits of functions that have the form f (x)g(x). As we saw in Section 7.4, when solving calculus problems involving functions of this form, it is often helpful to use equation (7.9) to rewrite the exponentiation using the exponential function:
f (x)g(x) = eg(x) ln f (x).
We use this strategy in our next example. For more on limits of this form, see Exercises 26-28.
Example 7.6.3. Evaluate the following limits:

Solution. Applying equation (7.9) to limit (a), we see that

Now we work out the limit of the exponent:

This limit is an indeterminate form of type∞/∞, so we apply l'Hôpital's rule:

By l'Hôpital's rule, we conclude that as x →0+, x ln x → 0, and since the exponential function is continuous it follows that x x = ex ln x →e0 = 1. Thus, the value of limit (a) is 1.
For limit (b), we again begin by writing

This time there is no need to use l'Hôpital's rule to find the limit of the exponent. As x →∞, lnx →∞, so x ln x →∞and therefore x x = ex ln x →∞. Thus, limx→∞ x x =∞.
Applying the same strategy to limit (c), we begin with the equation

Next we compute

which is an indeterminate form of type ∞/∞. L'Hôpital's rule leads us to compute

Thus, as x →∞,

and therefore

In other words, the value of limit (c) is e.
Finally, to find limit (d) we rewrite the desired limit as

and then turn our attention to

As x →0+,we have sin x →0+, so ln(sin x)→−∞and therefore −ln(sin x)→∞. Also, as x →0+, ln x →−∞. Thus, our limit is an indeterminate form of type∞/∞, and we can use l'Hôpital's rule:

Now we have an indeterminate form of type 0/0, and another application of l'Hôpital's rule leads to

Thus, as x → 0+ we have ln(csc x)/ln x →−1, and therefore

We conclude that the value of limit (d) is 1/e.
According to limit (c) in the last example, limx→∞(1+1/x)x = e. We end this section by doing some calculations to illustrate this limit. If we let f (x) = (1+1/x)x, then you can use a calculator to check that
f (100) = (1.01)100 ≈ 2.70481,
f (1000) = (1.001)1000 ≈ 2.71692,
f (10000) = (1.0001)10000 ≈ 2.71815.
As expected, the values seem to be getting close to e ≈ 2.71828.

(Since c here can be any positive number, this shows that if we know that f (x) →0+ and g(x)→ 0, then we can't tell without further analysis what the limit of f (x)g(x) is. In other words, in limits, 00 is an indeterminate form.)

1Although the notation ln x is common, it is not clear how it originated. Logarithms were first developed by John Napier (1550-1617), so some suggest that "ln" stands for "logarithm of Napier," but there doesn't seem to be much evidence to support this interpretation. In 1668, in his book Logarithmotechnia, Nicolaus Mercator (1620-1687) (no relation to the Mercator of map fame) discussed natural logarithms using the Latin phrase "logarithmus naturalis." In his book Lehrbuch der Mathematik, published in 1875, Anton Steinhauser (1802-1890) suggested denoting the natural logarithm of a number a by "log. nat. a (spoken: logarithmus naturalis a) or ln. a" (p. 277). Steinhauser appears to have used the "log. nat." notation in the rest of his book, but the notation "ln x" then appeared without explanation in 1893 in the book Uniplanar Algebra, by Irving Stringham (1847-1909).







Chapter 8
Techniques of Integration
8.1 Partial Fractions
As we have already observed, integration is generally harder than differentiation. In this chapter we will consider a number of techniques for evaluating integrals. These techniques will not allow us to evaluate all integrals, but they will greatly increase the range of integrals we can deal with.
We begin by considering algebraic reexpressions that sometimes make an integral easier.
Example 8.1.1. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. For integral (a), you might be tempted to try the substitution u = x2 +2. But for that substitution we would have du = 2x dx, and without an extra factor of x in the integral it would be difficult to make this part of the substitution work. A better approach is to simply multiply out the integrand:

To evaluate integral (b), we split the fraction into a sum of two fractions:

The integrals in Example 8.1.1 illustrate that it is usually easier to integrate a sum than a product or a quotient. For this reason, to integrate a complicated function it is sometimes helpful to rewrite the function as a sum of simpler functions if possible. Often this idea is useful for integrating rational functions.
For example, observe that

It follows that

But what if we were faced with solving the first integral in equation (8.2), and we didn't know that the integrand had come from the fraction addition in equation (8.1)? Is there a way to figure out how to break up the integrand as a sum of simpler fractions?
For example, let's try to evaluate

The denominator here is the same as in equation (8.2): x2 − x −6 = (x + 2)(x −3). So we can guess that, as in equation (8.1), the integrand might be a sum of fractions with denominators x +2 and x −3. To find the numerators, we look for numbers A and B such that

Adding the fractions on the right, we have

and equating the numerators we get

Notice that we think of equation (8.4), and therefore also equation (8.5), as an equation between functions; in other words, we want these equations to hold for all values of x. The formula 2x +9 on the left-hand side of equation (8.5) defines a function whose graph is a straight line with slope 2 and y-intercept 9. The formula on the right defines a function whose graph is also a straight line, with slope A + B and y-intercept −3A + 2B. For some values of A and B these two lines would cross, which means that equation (8.5) would be true for one value of x. But the only way the equation can be true for all values of x is if the two lines are exactly the same. In other words, the lines must have the same slope and y-intercept, which means that

These equations say that the coefficients of x on both sides of equation (8.5) are equal, and also the constant terms are equal.
This is a system of two simultaneous equations with two unknowns, A and B. We hope you have seen methods for solving such systems of equations before. One method is to multiply the first equation by 3 and then add it to the second equation, so that the variable A will cancel out:

We conclude that B = 15/5 = 3. Substituting into equation (8.6a), we get A +3 = 2, and therefore A = −1. Let's confirm that the values A = −1, B =3 work in equation (8.4):

As in our previous example, we can now use this equation to solve the integral in equation (8.3):

The method we have used to split the integrand into a sum of simpler fractions is called partial fractions. In the rest of this section we will discuss how to apply this method to any rational function.
Example 8.1.2. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. For integral (a), as in our previous example we factor the denominator and use the factors to set up a guess about how to split up the integrand:

The denominators on the two sides are the same, so we only need to match up the numerators:
2 = A(x −1)+ B(2x −3),
or in other words
0 · x +2 = (A +2B) · x +(−A −3B).
As before, to ensure that this equation is true for all values of x we equate the coefficients on both sides, which leads to a system of two equations with two unknowns:
A +2B = 0,
−A −3B = 2.
Adding these two equations we find that −B = 2, and therefore B = −2. Substituting this value into either equation leads to the conclusion that A = 4. Therefore

For the first integral on the right, we substitute u = 2x −3, du = 2 dx:

Evaluating the second integral by a similar method, we conclude that

The integrand in integral (b) has the same denominator, so we could try to split it up in a similar way:

But at this point it should be clear that this decomposition won't work: the numerator on the left-hand side is 2x3 + x2 − x, and the numerator on the right-hand side will not have terms involving x3 and x2, no matter what values we choose for A and B. There is no way to make the numerators match up.
Fortunately, there is a way to get rid of the terms involving x3 and x2 on the left: divide the polynomials. The long division calculation in Figure 8.1 shows that when we divide 2x3 + x2 − x by 2x2 −5x +3 we get a quotient of x +3 with a remainder of 11x −9. In other words,

(You can check that equation (8.7) is correct by getting a common denominator on the right-hand side.)


Figure 8.1: Dividing 2x3 + x2 − x by 2x2 −5x +3.

We can now split up the last fraction in equation (8.7):

Matching up the numerators and equating the coefficients gives us the system of equations
A + 2B = 11,
−A −3B = −9.
We will leave it to you to verify that the unique solution to this system of equations is A = 15, B = −2. Thus,

We can now finally evaluate integral (b):

Finally, for integral (c) we again begin by factoring the denominator:
u3 −u2 +u −1 = (u2 +1)(u −1).
Based on our previous examples, we might try to split up the integrand like this:

To make the numerators match, we must have
1 · u2 +0 · u −3 = B · u2 + A · u +(−A + B),
and equating coefficients leads to the system of equations
B = 1,
A = 0,
−A + B = −3.
Unfortunately, this system of equations doesn't have a solution; the values of A and B given by the first two equations don't work in the third equation. So there is no decomposition of the integrand of the form given in equation (8.8).
However, there is a different way of splitting up the integrand that does work:

Now when we equate coefficients in the numerator we get the system of equations
A +C = 1,
−A + B = 0,
−B +C = −3.
This system of equations can be solved by the same method we used in our earlier examples. But for the purpose of illustrating another possibility we will use a different method. We can rewrite the third equation as C = B −3, and then substituting B −3 for C in the first equation we get A + B −3 = 1, or in other words A + B = 4. With these changes, the system of equations reads
A + B = 4,
−A + B = 0,
C = B −3.
If we can solve the first two equations for A and B, then the third equation will give us C. Now we rewrite the second equation as B = A, and substitute A for B in the first equation:
2A = 4,
B = A,
C = B −3.
Now we can read off the solution: from the first equation we get A = 2, the second then gives us B = 2, and the third says C = 2−3 = −1. So the decomposition of the integrand is

We can now evaluate integral (c); we leave the details to you and just give the answer:

Example 8.1.2 illustrates the basic idea behind the method of partial fractions: to write a rational function as a sum of simpler rational functions, we factor the denominator, use this factorization to set up a guess about how the rational function might be decomposed, with unknown numbers in the numerators of the decomposition, and then solve for these unknown numbers. We saw in parts (b) and (c) of the example that some guesses work out and some don't. In other words, for some guesses it is possible to solve for the unknown numbers in the numerators, and for some guesses there is no solution. Is there a way to set up the guess so that there will always be a solution? The answer is yes. It can be shown that the following procedure always works.
To decompose a rational function  as a sum of simpler rational functions:
1.Make sure that the degree of P(x) is less than the degree of Q(x). If not, divide P(x) by Q(x), as in part (b) of Example 8.1.2.
2.Factor Q(x) into linear and quadratic factors. It can be shown that such a factorization always exists, although it is not always easy to find it.
3.Set up a guess about how to decompose P(x)/Q(x), based on the factorization of Q(x). Table 8.1 shows what terms to include in this guess for each factor of Q(x).


Table 8.1: Setting up a partial fractions decomposition of 

4.Add the fractions in your guess. The denominator of the sum should be Q(x). Set the coefficients of the numerator of the sum equal to the corresponding coefficients of P(x).
5.Solve the resulting system of simultaneous equations.
Example 8.1.3. Evaluate the integral

Solution. The denominator is
(x +1)2(x2 −2x +5) = (x2 +2x +1)(x2 −2x +5) = x4 +2x2 +8x +5.
Numerator and denominator both have degree 4, so we divide, as shown in Figure 8.2, getting a quotient of −2 and a remainder of 5x3 + 17x +6. This tells us that

Next, we use Table 8.1 to set up a guess about how to split up the last fraction above. Notice that according to row three of the table, the factor (x +1)2 leads to two terms in the guess.

Equating the coefficients of the numerators leads to the system of equations
A +C = 5,
−A + B +2C + D = 0,


Figure 8.2: Dividing −2x4 + 5x3 −4x2 + x −4 by x4 + 2x2 + 8x +5.

3A −2B +C +2D = 17,
5A +5B + D = 6.
It is tedious, but not really difficult, to show that the unique solution to this system of equations is
A = 3, B = −2, C = 2, D = 1.
Thus, the integral can be rewritten in the form

To evaluate the last integral, we complete the square in the denominator and then make the substitution u = x −1, x = u +1, du = dx:

Note that we have used Exercise 1 from Section 7.5 to evaluate the last integral. Putting everything together, we see that the answer to the original integral is

8.2 Integration by Parts
The integration technique we will study in this section is simply the product rule for derivatives turned around backwards. According to the product rule, for any two differentiable functions f and g,

Reversing this derivative equation, we get the integration formula

While this equation is correct, it isn't very useful in this form; you wouldn't very often come across an integral in which the integrand happened to have the form f (x)g′(x)+ g(x) f′(x). But rearranging the equation leads to a more useful equation:

Note that in equation (8.10)we have dropped the "+C" because we think of the integral on the right-hand side of the equation as including a " +C" term.
Example 8.2.1. Evaluate the integral

Solution. Let f (x) = ln x and g(x) = x. (For the moment, don'tworry about how these functions were chosen. We'll discuss that later.) Then

We can now write the required integral in terms of f and g and then apply equation(8.10):

We can check our answer to the last example by differentiating. Of course, since we used the product rule backwards in our solution, we use the product rule forwards in our check.

The method we used to evaluate the integral in the last example is called integration by parts. Before doing more examples, we introduce a shorthand version of equation (8.10). If we let u = f (x) and v = g(x), then as in integration by substitution we can write
du = f′(x) dx,dv = g′(x) dx.
Using these abbreviations, we can rewrite equation (8.10) in the form

Example 8.2.2. Evaluate the integral

Solution. Let u = x. If our integral is to have the form of the left-hand side of equation (8.11), then we will need to have dv = cosx dx, so we let v = sin x. With this choice of u and v we have du = dx and dv = cos x dx, so by equation (8.11) the value of the integral is

The hardest part of the method of integration by parts is choosing the functions to be represented by u and v in equation (8.11). In order for the method to be applicable, we need to choose u and v so that the integral we are trying to evaluate has the form  But even if the method is applicable, it may not be helpful. The method will only be helpful if the integral on the right-hand side of equation (8.11) is easier to evaluate than the integral on the left. That is,  must be easier to evaluate than 
In most cases, we choose u to be some function appearing in the integral that gets simpler when you differentiate it. With such a choice for u, the du in the integral on the right-hand side of equation (8.11) will be simpler than the u in the integral on the left. Once we have decided what to use for u, we know what dv must be if the integral is to have the form  and we use this to determine v. Some good choices for u are powers of x, logarithms, and inverse trigonometric functions.
Example 8.2.3. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. In integral (a), both x and ln x are on our list of good choices for u; both get simpler when differentiated. But it seems more important to simplify the ln x, so we choose u = ln x. We must therefore have dv = x dx, so we let v = x2/2. Since u = ln x, we have du = (1/x) dx, so

For integral (b), the factor x2 makes the integral more difficult to deal with, and this factor will get simpler if we differentiate it. So we choose
u = x2,dv = e2x dx.
To find du and v, we differentiate u and integrate dv;

Applying integration by parts, we get

We must still evaluate  Comparing this to the original integral,  we see that we have made progress. The troublesome factor x2 has changed to x; it has gotten simpler, but it hasn't disappeared altogether. The natural next step is to use integration by parts again! This time we use

(If you are uncomfortable using the letters u and v twice in the same problem to stand for different things, you could use, say, u1 and v1 for this second application of integration by parts. But at this point we are done with our original values of u and v, so there should be no danger of confusion if we reuse these letters.) Integration by parts now gives us

Putting it all together, we conclude that

Integral (c) involves an inverse trigonometric function, which is a good choice for u. So we let

Integration by parts gives us

To evaluate the remaining integral, we use the substitution u = 1− x 2, du = −2x dx, (−1/2) du = x dx:

Thus, the value of the original integral is

Finally, the natural logarithm in integral (d) is a good choice for u in integration by parts, so we let

This gives us

Next we divide 2t2 by t2 +1, getting a quotient of 2 and a remainder of −2. In other words,

In all of the integrals in Example 8.2.3, we let u stand for a function that got simpler when it was differentiated. Sometimes it works to let u stand for a function that doesn't get simpler when it is differentiated, as long as it also doesn't get significantly more complicated. We illustrate this with our next example.
Example 8.2.4. Evaluate the integral

Solution. If we let u = ex, then we will have du = ex dx. In order to be able to apply integration by parts we need to have dv = cosx dx, so we let v = sin x. Integration by parts now gives us

It's not clear that we've made any progress, but surprisingly we can get the answer by using integration by parts again on the integral on the right-hand side. This time we use u = ex, dv = sin x dx, du = ex dx, v = −cos x:

The original integral now appears on the right-hand side of equation (8.12). It may seem that we are just going in circles, but we can actually use equation (8.12) to solve for the desired integral. Since ex cos x is continuous at all numbers, we know that it has an antiderivative on the interval (−∞,∞). Let F (x) be such an antiderivative. Then according to equation (8.12),

In other words, this is a general formula for all antiderivatives of ex cos x on (−∞,∞). But since F (x) is one such antiderivative, there must be some number C0 for which
F(x) = ex (sin x +cos x)− F(x)+C0.
We can now solve this equation for F(x). We get 2F(x) = ex (sin x +cos x)+C0, and therefore

The term C0/2 is a constant; if we rename it C, then we have the following formula for all antiderivatives of ex cos x:

The reasoning we used in the last example is usually written more briefly, but less carefully, by treating ∫ ex cos x dx in equation (8.12) as an unknown and solving for it. Adding  to both sides of equation (8.12), we get

and dividing through by 2 gives the answer—except that the "+C" is missing. The more careful reasoning we gave in our solution to Example 8.2.4 shows why the " +C" belongs in the answer.
Since our solution to Example 8.2.4 was a bit unusual, it might be worthwhile to check it by differentiating:

as expected.
There is also a version of integration by parts for definite integrals. If f′ and g′ are continuous on an interval containing the numbers a and b, then by the product rule and the second fundamental theorem of calculus,

Splitting up the integral on the left and rearranging the equation, we get

In other words, in the shorthand notation we have been using in this section,

To illustrate the use of this version of integration by parts, we evaluate

The appearance of an inverse trigonometric function in the integral suggests the use of integration by parts. We let u = tan−1 x and dv = dx, and therefore

Applying integration by parts, we get

8.3 Trigonometric Integrals
In this section we discuss some techniques that can be used to evaluate integrals involving trigonometric functions. Since all trigonometric functions can be expressed in terms of the sine and cosine functions, we begin by considering integrals that involve just these two functions.
For example, consider

We can evaluate this integral by using the substitution u = sin θ, du = cos θ dθ:

What made this substitution work is the fact that the integrand has the form of an expression involving sin θ that is multiplied by cos θ. The factor cos θ, together with dθ, got replaced with du, and the rest of the integrand could be expressed in terms of u. Similarly, if the integrand is an expression involving cos θ that is multiplied by sin θ, then the substitution u = cos θ, du = −sin θ dθ should work.
Sometimes the identity cos2 θ+sin2 θ = 1 can be used to put an integral into a form in which one of these substitutions can be used. For example, consider . We have

The integral on the right is now an expression involving cos θ that is multiplied by sin θ, so we can use the substitution u = cos θ, du = −sin θ dθ:

A key step in this example was replacing sin2 θ with 1−cos2 θ. We think of this as "trading in two factors of sin θ for two factors of cos θ." Since we started with three factors of sin θ, after the trade-in we had one sin θ left, and this is exactly what we needed to make the substitution u = cos θ work. In general, we can trade in factors of either sin θ or cos θ two at a time, and we usually want to trade in all factors except one. This means that we should look for odd powers of sin θ or cos θ.
Example 8.3.1. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. Since the power of sin θ in integral (a) is odd, we can trade in all factors of sin θ except one:

Now we are ready for the substitution u = cos θ, du = −sin θ dθ:

Integral (b) involves tan x, which we have not yet discussed. Later in this section we will study some techniques that are sometimes helpful for integrals involving the tangent function. But one method we can always use is to fill in the definition of tan x in terms of sin x and cos x:

The last integral involves both even and odd powers of sin x, but the cos x in the denominator can be thought of as (cos x)−1, which is an odd power of cos x. So let's see if we can put the integrand into the form of an expression involving sin x that is multiplied by cos x. We begin by multiplying and dividing by cos x:

Now we can use the substitution u = sin x, du = cos x dx:

The integrand in the last integral is a rational function, so we use techniques from Section 8.1. We leave the details to you, and just record the main steps:

Finally, we fill in u = sin x to get the answer to the original integral. Notice that since we know −1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1, we can eliminate the absolute value signs:

The techniques we have been using so far can be applied when either the sine function or the cosine function is raised to an odd power. Butwhat if both are raised to even powers? In that case, there are some trigonometric identities that can be helpful. To derive these identities, we combine the equation 1 = cos2 θ +sin2 θ with the double-angle formula cos(2θ) = cos2 θ −sin2 θ. First we add and subtract these two equations:

Dividing the resulting equations by 2, we get the identities

Example 8.3.2. Evaluate the integral

Solution. Since both sin θ and cos θ are raised to even powers, we rewrite the integrand using the identities in equation (8.13):

In the last step, we have separated out the odd powers of cos(2θ), which can now be handled by the methods discussed earlier in this section. We evaluate the final two integrals separately. For the first, we use the substitution u = sin (2θ), du = 2 cos(2θ) dθ:

For the second integral, we use (8.13) again:

Putting it all together, our final answer is

Integration by parts is also sometimes helpful for integrals involving powers of trigonometric functions. We illustrate this with the integral

where n is an integer and n ≥ 2. To apply integration by parts, we use

u = sinn−1 θ,
dv = sin θ dθ,

du = (n −1) sinn−2 θ cos θ dθ,
v = −cos θ.


Integration by parts now yields

The integral we are trying to evaluate now appears on the right-hand side of (8.14). Imitating the method we used in Example 8.2.4, we can use equation (8.14) to solve for the desired integral. Adding  to both sides of equation (8.14), we get

and therefore

Notice that there is no need to include a " +C" on the right-hand side of this equation, since the integral on the right includes an arbitrary constant term.
Equation (8.15) tells us how to rewrite an integral of a power of sin θ in terms of an integral in which the power of sin θ has been reduced by 2. It is therefore called a reduction formula for integrals of powers of sin θ. It is often helpful to use this formula repeatedly when evaluating an integral. We illustrate this by giving an alternative solution to Example 8.3.2:

You may be worried that this answer looks different from the answer we got in Example 8.3.2. In Exercise 23 we ask you to show that the two answers are equal.
We will see in a later section of this chapter that the tangent and secant functions often appear together in integrals. One way to deal with them is to rewrite them in terms of the sine and cosine functions. We begin by using this approach to find antiderivatives of tangent and secant.
Example 8.3.3. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. In integral (a), once we write tan θ in terms of sin θ and cos θ, we can use the substitution u = cos θ, du = −sin θ dθ:

Some mathematicians prefer to reexpress this answer using the fact that

Thus, we can also say that

The integrand in integral (b) involves an odd power of cos θ, so we use the substitution u = sin θ, du = cos θ dθ:

We can now use partial fractions to finish the integration:

Once again, this answer can be expressed in a different form. In Exercise 24 we ask you to show that this answer can be rewritten in the form

Many of the ideas we used for integrals involving sine and cosine can be adapted to work with tangent and secant. We will often find it useful to use one of the following substitutions:

u = tan θ,
u = sec θ,

du = sec2 θ dθ,
du = sec θ tan θ dθ.


We can "trade in" secants and tangents two at a time, using the identity tan2 θ +1 = sec2 θ. Thus, if an integral involves an even power of sec θ, then we can trade in all factors of sec θ except two and then use the substitution u = tan θ, du = sec2 θ dθ. If an integral involves an odd power of tan θ, then we can trade in all factors of tan θ except one and then use the substitution u = sec θ, du = sec θ tan θ dθ.
Example 8.3.4. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. Integral (a) contains an even power of sec θ, so we use the substitution u = tan θ, du = sec2 θ dθ:

In integral (b), the power of tan θ is odd, so we use the substitution u = sec θ, du = sec θ tan θ dθ:

We can also use similar methods to derive a reduction formula for integrals of powers of the tangent function. For any integer n ≥ 2 we have

We now use the substitution u = tan θ, du = sec2 θ dθ to compute

Substituting into equation (8.16), we get the reduction formula

As an example of the use of this reduction formula, we compute tan4 θ dθ:

There is also a reduction formula for secn θ dθ. To derive it, we use integration by parts, with

u = secn−2 θ,
dv = sec2 θ dθ,

du = (n −2) secn−2 θ tan θ dθ,
v = tan θ.


This gives us

Adding  to both sides of this equation we get

and therefore

The reduction formula (8.18) can be used to handle the most difficult combination of powers of tangent and secant: an even power of tangent times an odd power of secant.
For example,

We have not yet said anything about integrals involving the cotangent and cosecant functions, but the methods for dealing with these functions are almost exactly the same as those for the tangent and secant functions. We illustrate this with one example.
Example 8.3.5. Evaluate

Solution. For an integral involving sec4 x, we would trade in two factors of sec x and then use the substitution u = tan x, du = sec2 x dx. So in this example, we trade in two factors of csc x and then use the substitution u = cot x, du = −csc2 x dx:

27.Many integrals involving trigonometric functions can be evaluated using the substitution u = tan(θ/2). This substitution is sometimes called the Weierstrass substitution, after Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass (1815-1897), although it was used much earlier by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783). In this problem you will use this substitution to compute

8.4 Substitution with Inverse Functions
Consider the integral

We are going to evaluate this integral by using the substitution  You might expect that our first step would be to compute

However, there is a small problem with this equation: this formula for du is undefined when x = 0, but the domain of the integrand in (8.19) includes all real numbers. We will resolve this problem by doing the details of the substitution a bit differently from the way we have done previous substitutions. Initially we will simply proceed in a way that seems natural, without worrying about justifying our steps. Afterwards we'll come back and show that our reasoning can be justified.
Since the cube root function is the inverse of the cubing function, the equation u =  is equivalent to x = u3, and from that equation we compute dx = 3u2 du. Replacing  with u, dx with 3u2 du, and the limits of integration x = a and x = b with the corresponding u-values  and  we get

We can now justify the procedure we have followed by observing that it is just a backwards form of our usual substitution method. If we were starting with the integral on the right-hand side of equation (8.20), then our usual substitution method would allow us to use the substitution x = u3, dx = 3u2 du to get the integral on the left. We would substitute  for u in the denominator, and the limits of integration  and  in the integral on the right would be converted to the corresponding x-values  and  which are used in the integral on the left. Thus, by Theorem 5.5.3, the two integrals are equal, and therefore equation (8.20) is correct. However, in this example we are going in the opposite direction: we are starting with the integral on the left, and converting it into the integral on the right.
To evaluate the integral on the right-hand side of equation (8.20), we now divide 3u2 by u2 +1:

Thus, the answer to our original integral is

The "backwards" substitution method we used in this example can also be used if the integral is indefinite. Once again, we work out the answer first by proceeding in the way that seems most natural, and justify our work afterwards. As before, we use the substitution  x = u3, dx = 3u2 du. In the case of an indefinite integral, there are no limits of integration, and our final step is to reexpress the answer in terms of the original variable x:

In Exercise 19 we ask you to check that this answer is correct. But we would like to know not merely that the answer is correct, but also that the method we used to reach that answer can be justified. So let's see if we can use the calculations we have done to show that equation (8.22) is correct.
We begin by rewriting equation (8.21) with different letters:

Next we take the derivative with respect to x of both sides of this equation:

Finally, we apply the first fundamental theorem of calculus on the left, and we note that the terms on the right involving a are constants, so their derivatives are 0:

This shows that the answer we found in equation (8.22) is correct.
Before doing more examples, let's see if we can formulate the procedure we used in this example as a general method. Suppose that some function f is continuous on an interval I, and we want to evaluate  where a and b are numbers in I. Our plan is to do a substitution of the form u = g−1(x). Here g is a one-to-one function whose domain is some interval J and whose range is I. It follows that the domain of g−1 is I and its range is J. Thus, the equation u = g−1(x) makes sense for all x ∈ I, and we have u = g−1(x) ∈ J. In our example, g was given by the formula g(x) = x3, leading to the substitution u = g−1(x) =  and the intervals I and J were both (−∞,∞). To carry out the substitution, we rewrite the equation u = g−1(x) as x = g(u). Assuming that g is differentiable on J, we can then write dx = g′(u) du. Performing the substitution suggested by these equations leads to the equation

Again, to justify this equation we can perform the substitution x = g(u), dx = g′(u) du in the integral on the right-hand side to get the integral on the left. When we do this substitution, the limits of integration u = g−1(a) and u = g−1(b) in the integral on the right get converted to the corresponding values x = g(g−1(a)) = a and x = g(g−1(b)) = b for the integral on the left. As long as g′ is continuous on J, we can use Theorem 5.5.3 to conclude that equation (8.23) is correct.
We can also use this new substitution method in indefinite integrals. To see why, suppose we are able to find an antiderivative for f (g(u))g′(u) on the interval J:

Then we can use the second fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate the integral on the right-hand side of equation (8.23):

Thus, this is also the value of the integral on the left-hand side of (8.23):

Switching letters in this equation, we can say that for all x in the interval I,

Taking the derivative of both sides of this equation, and applying the first fundamental theorem of calculus, we can say that for all x ∈ I,

We will therefore get the correct answer to the indefinite integral if we perform the substitution u = g−1(x), x = g(u), dx = g′(u) du as follows:

Example 8.4.1. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. For integral (a), we begin with the substitution  According to the definition of the square root function, this means that x = u2 and u ≥ 0. From the equation x = u2 we get dx = 2u du, and substituting into the integral we get

Next, we use integration by parts. Since our integral is now written in terms of u, we will use the variables u1 and v1 in our integration by parts. We use

u1 = 2u,
dv1 = sec2 u du,

du1 = 2 du,
v1 = tan u.


Integration by parts now gives us

where we have used part (a) of Example 8.3.3 to evaluate the last integral. Finally, we get the answer for the original integral by substituting  for u:

In integral (b), we find it simplest to use the substitution  We rewrite this as x = (u −1)3, compute dx = 3(u −1)2 du, and then substitute:

Since integral (c) contains the inverse function sin−1 t, we use the substitution u = sin−1 t. By definition of the inverse sine function, this means

and from the equation t = sin u we get dt = cos u du. Substitution now leads to the equation

Fortunately, we solved the integral on the right-hand side of this equation in Example 8.2.4, so we can just fill in the answer:

Finally, we must rewrite the answer in terms of t. We have u = sin−1 t and sin u = t. To express cos u in terms of t, we use the identity cos2 u = 1−sin2 u = 1−t2, so  And since we also know −π/2 ≤ u ≤ π/2, we can rule out the negative value for cos u, so  Therefore

It seems that for integral (d) we should substitute either  or  but which should we use? In fact, we will use  because for all x ≥ 0,

From  we get x = u6 and dx = 6u5 du, and therefore

We end this section by giving one more example of an inverse function substitution in a definite integral. We will compute the integral

by using the substitution  Rewriting this as x = (u −1)2/2, we get dx = (u −1) du. For the limits of integration x = 0 and x = 8, the corresponding u-values are  and  Thus,

8.5 Trigonometric Substitutions
Sometimes, an integral that appear to have nothing to do with trigonometry can be evaluated by making a substitution that introduces a trigonometric function into the integral. For example, consider this integral:

We are going to evaluate this integral by using the substitution θ = tan−1 x. This substitution may seem completely mysterious at this point: the inverse tangent function doesn't appear anywhere in the integral, so why would we introduce it into the problem by making this substitution? But as you will see, this substitution will simplify the integral.
We begin with the fact that according to the definition of the inverse tangent function, θ = tan−1 x means

From the equation x = tan θ we get dx = sec2 θ dθ, and then the substitution yields

The reason this substitution is helpful is that it allows us to simplify the square root in the denominator:

Which answer is correct, sec θ or −sec θ? Well, since −π/2 < θ < π/2, we have sec θ > 0, and therefore

We can now evaluate the integral:

where we have used part (b) of Example 8.3.3 in the last step. To complete the evaluation we must rewrite the answer in terms of x. We already know that tan θ = x, and when we simplified the square root we discovered that

Therefore the value of the integral is

It is not hard to show that the expression inside the absolute value signs is always positive, so we can actually drop the absolute value signs. Readers who have solved Exercises 29-35 in Section 7.5 may recognize that our answer is equal to sinh−1 x.
Note that not only does the integrand in this example not involve any trigonometric functions, but the answer also does not contain a trigonometric function. And yet, somehow a detour through the land of trigonometry allowed us to evaluate the integral! The reason is that the trigonometric identity tan2 θ +1 = sec2 θ allowed us to simplify  once we replaced x with tan θ. Table 8.2 lists several trigonometric identities, each of which makes it possible for us to simplify a certain square root by making a trigonometric substitution.


Table 8.2: Trigonometric substitutions.

Example 8.5.1. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. Integral (a) contains  and Table 8.2 suggests that we can simplify this if we replace x with sin θ. We therefore use the substitution θ = sin−1 x, which means

Notice that the domain of the integrand in integral (a) is [−1, 0) ∪(0, 1], and for values of x in this set, sin−1 x is defined, so this substitution makes sense.
Since x = sinθ, we have dx = cosθ dθ. The purpose of the substitution is to simplify the square root, and it is often helpful to do this simplification first:

But −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2, so cos θ ≥ 0, and therefore

We are now ready to evaluate the integral:

Note that we used equation (8.24) not only in the first step, but also in the last step, when we reexpressed the answer in terms of x. This is one reason why it is usually helpful, when doing a trigonometric substitution in an integral, to write out the simplification of the square root before evaluating the integral.
The square root in integral (b) doesn't exactly fit the pattern of any of the entries in Table 8.2, but it is close enough that we can adjust for the differences. We will be able to simplify the square root if 4x2 gets replaced by tan2 θ, or in other words if 2x = tan θ, so we use the substitution θ = tan−1(2x). According to the definition of the inverse tangent function, this means

Once again, before evaluating the integral we work out the square root:

where we have used the fact that −π/2 < θ < π/2 to determine that sec θ is positive. We also need to compute

Now we are ready to perform the substitution in the integral:

We have eliminated the square root, but now we have a slightly tricky trigonometric integral. There is more than one way to evaluate this integral. Motivated by the fact that the power of tan θ is odd, we will use the substitution u = sec θ, du = sec θ tan θ dθ. For a different approach see Exercise 19.

The denominator in the last integral factors, so we use partial fractions:

We have eliminated the absolute value signs because for −π/2 < θ < π/2, sec θ ≥ 1. Finally, we get the answer to the original integral by applying equation (8.25):

For integral (c), we want to simplify  If we multiply the identity sec2 θ −1 = tan2 θ by 4 we get 4 sec2 θ −4 = 4 tan2 θ, which suggests that we will be able to simplify the square root if we replace x with 2 sec θ. We therefore use the substitution θ = sec−1(x/2), which means

Notice that the domain of the integrand is (−∞,−2) ∪(2,∞), and sec−1(x/2) is defined for all x in this domain.
From x = 2 sec θ we get dx = 2 sec θ tan θ dθ, and

Unfortunately, if 0 ≤ θ < π/2 then tan θ ≥ 0, and if π/2 < θ ≤ π then tan θ ≤ 0. Thus, as with so many problems involving the inverse secant function, we need to consider the two parts of the domain separately.
For x > 2 we have 0 < θ < π/2, so tanθ > 0 and therefore

We can now perform the substitution and evaluate the integral:

To finish the problem, we must express sin θ in terms of x. We know sec θ = x/2 and  and often once you know the values of two trigonometric functions it is easy to find the rest of them. In this case, from secθ = x/2 we get cos θ = 2/x, and therefore

Another way to determine the formula for sin θ is to draw the right triangle shown in Figure 8.3. Thus, we have



Figure 8.3: Since 0 < θ < π/2 and sec θ = x/2, θ is one of the angles of a right triangle in which the hypotenuse has length x and one leg has length 2. The Pythagorean theorem determines the length of the other leg, and all trigonometric functions can then be determined. In particular, we can see that 

We still have to consider x < −2. For these values of x we have π/2 < θ < π and tan θ < 0, and therefore

We leave it to you to carry out the substitution in this case and verify that the answer is exactly the same. Alternatively, you can differentiate the answer we computed in the case x > 2 and verify that it is an antiderivative of the integrand not only on (2,∞), but on (−∞,−2) as well.
We can extend the method of trigonometric substitution to a wider range of integrals by combining it with algebraic reexpressions such as completing the square. We illustrate this in our next example.
Example 8.5.2. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. The square root in integral (a) contains a quadratic expression, but it doesn't fit any of the patterns in Table 8.2. However, we can match it with one of those patterns if we first complete the square. To do this, it is usually easiest to begin by factoring out the coefficient of x2, which in this case is −1:
4x − x2 = −(x2 −4x)= −(x2 −4x +4−4)= −((x −2)2 −4) = 4−(x −2)2.
Thus, the square root inside the integral can be rewritten in the form

Now the trigonometric identity 4−4 sin2 θ = 4 cos2 θ suggests that we will be able to simplify the square root if we replace x −2 with 2 sin θ. We therefore use the substitution θ = sin−1((x −2)/2), which means

We have x = 2 sin θ +2 and dx = 2 cos θ dθ, and

where we have used the fact that −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 to conclude that cos θ ≥ 0.
Substitution now allows us to evaluate the integral:

Integral (b) also contains a square root, since . Again, we begin by completing the square:
t2 −2t +4 = t2 −2t +1+3 = (t −1)2 +3.
We will be able to use the trigonometric identity 3 tan2 θ +3 = 3 sec2 θ if we replace t −1 with , so we make the substitution

With this substitution, we will have  and

Thus,

We can now use the reduction formula (8.18) to complete the evaluation:

Substitutions involving the inverse tangent function are sometimes useful even in integrals that don't contain square roots. In integral (c) we'll use the same substitution we used in integral (b):

To reexpress this answer in terms of t, we compute

Thus,

Exercises 8.5
1-18: Evaluate the integral.


19.In this exercise, we consider an alternative approach to Example 8.5.1(b).
(a) As in the text, we use the substitution θ = tan−1(2x) to get

We know (see Example 8.3.3(b)) that sec θ dθ = ln | sec θ +tan θ|+C. Based on this, see if you can guess a formula for csc θ dθ. Check your guess by differentiating, and adjust your guess if necessary. Once you have an answer for csc θ dθ, complete the evaluation of the integral in Example 8.5.1(b).
(b) Show that your answer is equivalent to the answer for this integral given in the text.
20.Evaluate the integral

by using the substitution θ = sec−1 |x|. Notice that the domain of the integrand is (−∞,−1] ∪[1,∞), and for all values of x in this domain, |x| ≥ 1. This means that you only need to apply the inverse secant function to numbers in the interval [1,∞), and you will have 0 ≤ θ < π/2. However, you will still need to consider the cases x ≤ −1 and x ≥ 1 separately.
21.Find the volume of the solid generated when the region under the curve y = 1/(x2 +1), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 is rotated about the x-axis.
22.Find the centroid of the region under the curve y = sin x, 0 ≤ x ≤ π/2.
23.This problem came up on the National Public Radio program Car Talk on Nov. 6, 2010. A truck has a gas tank in the shape of a cylinder whose axis is horizontal. The diameter of the cylinder is 20 inches. The gas gauge is broken, so the trucker checks his gas by inserting a dowel into the tank vertically and checking how deep the gas is. Of course, when the tank is full, the depth is 20 inches, and if the depth is 10 inches, then the tank is half full.
(a)How deep will the gas be when the tank is one quarter full? (Note: You will only be able to find an approximate answer.)
(b)A few months later, the question in part (a) was used as a puzzler on Car Talk. The hosts of the show, Tom and Ray Magliozzi, suggested the following solution: Cut out a piece of cardboard in the shape of a semicircle with radius 10 inches. Then find the centroid of this half disk by finding the point where the piece of cardboard will balance on the tip of a pencil. Draw a line from the center of the disk through the centroid to the circumference, and measure the distance along this line from the centroid to the circumference. This distance is the depth of the gas when the tank is one quarter full. Is this solution correct?
8.6 Numerical Integration
In the last few sections we have studied integration techniques that allow us to evaluate a variety of integrals. However, there are many integrals that cannot be evaluated by any of these techniques. For example, integrals of the form

play an important role in probability theory, but they cannot be evaluated by the techniques we have studied.1 What can we do if we need to know the value of such an integral?
Of course, a definite integral is, by definition, a limit of Riemann sums, so we can get an approximate answer for any definite integral by computing a Riemann sum. Recall that to compute a Riemann sum for  where a < b and f is continuous on [a, b], we first pick a positive integer n and divide the interval [a, b] into n smaller intervals, each of width △x = (b−a)/n. The endpoints of these smaller intervals are xi = a +i△x for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n. Next, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n we choose a sample point  between xi−1 and xi. Our Riemann sum is then 
A natural way to choose the sample points is to let  be the midpoint of the interval [xi−1, xi ]. With this choice, the Riemann sum is often called the midpoint rule approximation for the definite integral, and it is denoted Mn. In other words, if we let  then

If f(x) is positive for a ≤ x ≤ b, then the midpoint rule can be thought of as giving the total area of a collection of n rectangles, as illustrated in Figure 8.4. Recall that if f(x) is negative for some values of x, then some rectangles will extend below the x-axis, and the areas of these rectangles will be subtracted rather than added.
For example, let's try computing the midpoint rule, with n = 6, for the integral

We have  and △x = (2−(−1))/6 = 1/2, and this leads to the values shown in Table 8.3. (The numbers in the last column of the table are approximate values,


Figure 8.4: The midpoint rule approximation for  is the total area of the blue rectangles.



Table 8.3: Computing the midpoint rule for 

accurate to four decimal places.) Plugging these values into the formula in equation (8.26) gives us

The region inside the rectangles in Figure 8.4 doesn't match the shape of the region under the graph of f very closely. This suggests that we might be able to get a better approximation if we compute the area of a region that matches the region under the graph more closely. In Figure 8.5 we have replaced the rectangles from Figure 8.4 with trapezoidswhose upper vertices lie on the curve y = f (x). For each i, let Pi be the point (xi, f (xi)). Then the top of the first trapezoid is the line segment from P0 to P1, the top of the next is the segment from P1 to P2, and so on. The sum of the areas of these trapezoids is called the trapezoid rule approximation for the definite integral, and it is denoted Tn.


Figure 8.5: The trapezoid rule approximation for  is the total area of the blue trapezoids.

To find a formula for the trapezoid rule, note that the left and right sides of the first trapezoid have height f(x0) and f(x1), and therefore its area is △x(f(x0)+ f(x1))/2. Computing the areas of the other trapezoids similarly and adding, we get the formula

Notice the pattern of the coefficients of f(xi) in this formula: 1, 2, 2,..., 2, 1. As before, if f(x) is negative for some values of x then this formula will result in some areas being subtracted rather than added.
Returning to the example  with n = 6, we compute the values in Table 8.4. Filling in these values in formula (8.28), we get the approximation



Table 8.4: Computing the trapezoid rule approximation for 

Is the trapezoid rule more accurate than the midpoint rule? The difference  tells us how much the true value of the integral differs from the midpoint rule approximation; we call it the error in the midpoint rule. Similarly,  is the error in the trapezoid rule. The following theorem gives us some information about the errors in the midpoint and trapezoid rules. (For a proof, see Exercises 13 and 14.)
Theorem 8.6.1. Suppose f is continuous on [a, b] and f′′(x) is defined for all x in (a, b). Suppose also that K is a number such that for all x in (a, b), | f′′(x)| ≤ K. Then for any positive integer n:

Theorem 8.6.1 does not tell us the exact value of the error in either the midpoint rule or the trapezoid rule. Rather, for each rule it gives an upper bound on the absolute value of the error. This upper bound tells us how much confidence we can have in the accuracy of the rules. Notice that the upper bound for the error in the trapezoid rule is twice as large as the upper bound for the midpoint rule! This doesn't mean that the error in the trapezoid rule is always twice as large as the error in the midpoint rule, but in practice the trapezoid rule is often less accurate than the midpoint rule.
In order to apply Theorem 8.6.1, we have to find a number that can play the role of K in the theorem. For example, let's try applying the theorem to our estimates of  We have  To determine a suitable value for K we will use methods from Chapter 4 find the minimum and maximum values of f′′ on the interval [−1, 2]. Since f′′ is continuous on [−1, 2], it must have minimum and maximum values, and each of these values must be attained at either an endpoint of the interval or at a critical number of f′′. To find the critical numbers, we compute the derivative of f′′—that is, f′′′:

Setting f′′′(x) equal to 0, we see that the critical numbers are 0 and  Thus, minimum and maximum values of f′′ (x) on [−1, 2] can occur only at x = −1, 0,  or 2. Next we compute f′′(x) for these values of x:

We conclude that the minimum value of f′′(x) for −1 ≤ x ≤ 2 is −2, and the maximum value is 4e−3/2 ≈ 0.89.
We now know that for all x in (−1, 2), −2 ≤ f′′(x) ≤ 4e−3/2 ≈ 0.89, and therefore | f′′(x)| ≤ 2. Thus, we can use K = 2 in Theorem 8.6.1. Filling in a = −1, b = 2, and n = 6, we conclude that

In other words, the midpoint rule approximation M6 ≈ 1.6374 differs from the true value of  by at most 0.0625, and the trapezoid rule approximation T6 ≈ 1.6120 differs from the true value by at most 0.125.
We can improve the accuracy of these approximations by increasing n. For example, for n = 500 we have

Using a computer, we find that M500 ≈ 1.6289. With this very accurate estimate of the value of the integral, we can now see how large the errors really are when n = 6:

The error in the midpoint rule is negative in this case, indicating that the midpoint rule gives a value slightly larger than the true value of the integral. The absolute values of both errors are smaller than the bounds we computed from Theorem 8.6.1, as expected, and the midpoint rule is about twice as accurate as the trapezoid rule.
This example illustrates our earlier observation that, despite the appearance of Figures 8.4 and 8.5, the trapezoid rule is often less accurate than the midpoint rule. One weakness of the trapezoid rule is that it ignores the concavity of f. This is evident in Figure 8.5, where the tops of the trapezoids are straight line segments, even though the graph of f is curved. But this weakness is also an opportunity: by replacing the straight tops of the trapezoids in Figure 8.5 with curves that match the shape of the graph of f more closely, we will be able to get a more accurate approximation.
Here's another way of describing the trapezoid rule. Let g1 be the linear function whose graph is the straight line through the points P0 and P1 in Figure 8.5. Then the area of the first trapezoid in that figure is  and in the trapezoid rule we use this as an approximation for  Similarly, if g2 is the function whose graph is the line through P1 and P2, then the area of the second trapezoid is  and we use this as our approximation for  Adding up similar approximations for the integral of f on each interval [xi−1, xi] leads to the trapezoid rule.
To improve on the trapezoid rule, we will replace g1 and g2 with a single function g whose graph passes through all three of the points P0, P1, and P2. We will use a function g of the form
g(x) = A(x − x1)2 + B(x − x1)+C,
whose graph is a parabola, as shown in Figure 8.6. We leave it to you to verify (see Exercise 15) that the graph of g passes through the points P0, P1, and P2 if and only if the coefficients are given by the formulas

Our hope is that with this choice of coefficients, not only will the graph of g pass through P0, P1, and P2, but it will also curve in the same direction as f between these points, thus staying closer to the graph of f than g1 and g2 do. We can then use  as an approximation for 


Figure 8.6: The graph of g is a parabola passing through the points P0, P1, and P2. The area of the blue region is  which is approximately equal to 

To carry out this plan, we evaluate  using the substitution u = x − x1, and then we fill in the formulas from (8.30):

Thus, it appears that

Similar reasoning, using a parabola passing through the points P2, P3, and P4, leads to the approximation

And we can continue in this way to estimate the integral of f on the intervals [x4, x6], [x6, x8], and so on. Notice that since each approximation is on an interval of width 2△x, we must require n to be even so that these intervals will fill up the interval [a, b] exactly.
Adding these approximations leads to the Simpson's rule approximation for  which is denoted Sn. It is named after Thomas Simpson (1710-1761), who published it in 1743, although it was known already a century before that. For any even positive integer n, using (8.31), (8.32), and similar formulas for the other intervals, we get the formula

As with the trapezoid rule, it is important to notice the pattern of the coefficients of f (xi) in this formula: 1, 4, 2, 4, 2,..., 4, 2, 4, 1. The Simpson's rule approximation is equal to the area of the blue shaded region in Figure 8.7.


Figure 8.7: The Simpson's rule approximation for  is equal to the area of the blue region.

To try out Simpson's rule on the integral  with n = 6, we can use the values from Table 8.4. Plugging into formula (8.33), we get

This is remarkably close to the value  that we found earlier.
As with the midpoint and trapezoid rules, there is a theorem that gives a bound on the size of the error in Simpson's rule:
Theorem 8.6.2. Suppose f is continuous on [a, b] and f (4)(x) is defined for all x in (a, b), where f (4) is the fourth derivative of f. Suppose also that K is a number such that for all x in (a, b), | f (4)(x)| ≤ K. Then for any even positive integer n,

Example 8.6.3. Find the decimal value of ln 3 with error at most 0.001.
Solution. According to the definition of the natural logarithm function,

We now estimate the value of this integral by using Simpson's rule. We begin by applying Theorem 8.6.2 to see how to achieve the required accuracy. We have f (x) = 1/x = x−1, and therefore f(4)(x) = 24x−5 = 24/x5. For 1 < x < 3 we have

so we can use K = 24 in the theorem. Thus,

We can therefore achieve the desired accuracy by ensuring that

or in other words  Since n must be an even integer, we will use n = 10.
Since a = 1 and b = 3, we have △x = 1/5, which gives us the values in Table 8.5. Therefore

8.7 Improper Integrals
In this section we will study integrals like

The definition of definite integrals in Section 5.3 does not apply to this integral, because ∞ is not a number. Thus, we will need to extend the definition of integration to cover this new kind of integral. Since a variable can approach∞, but it cannot be equal to ∞,a natural approach is to interpret the integral as follows:

Integrals of this kind are called improper integrals. Here is the general definition.
Definition 8.7.1. If f is continuous on [a,∞), then we define the improper integral  by the equation

If this limit is defined, then we say that the integral converges; otherwise, it diverges.
For example, for any t > 1 we have

Therefore, according to Definition 8.7.1,

This is an example of an improper integral that converges.
Geometrically, these calculations tell us that the area of the region under the curve y = 1/x2 from x = 1 to x = t is 1−1/t. As t increases, the region extends further and further to the right and the area increases, approaching 1 as t →∞. It seems reasonable, then, to say that the area of the region under the curve y = 1/x2 that begins at x = 1 and extends infinitely far to the right is 1. This is the striped region in Figure 8.9.
Making a small change in this integral has a large effect on the answer:

Thus, the area under the curve y = 1/x from x = 1 to x = t gets larger and larger as t increases, eventually exceeding any number we might name. We therefore say that the area of the entire region under the curve y = 1/x to the right of x = 1 is infinite. This is the blue region in Figure 8.9. We also say that  diverges.
The two improper integrals we have worked out are part of a more general pattern.
For future reference, it will be useful to record this pattern.
Theorem 8.7.2. Let p be any real number.



Figure 8.9: The black curve is the graph of y = 1/x2, and the blue curve is y = 1/x. The area of the striped region is 1, and the area of the blue shaded region is infinite. Both regions extend infinitely far to the right.

Proof. We have already worked out the cases p = 1 and p = 2. The calculation for any p > 1 is similar to the case p = 2:

Notice that we have used the fact that p > 1 to conclude that as t →∞, tp−1→∞ (see Theorem 7.4.9). Thus, the integral converges.
For p < 1, we compute

We can use a similar idea to define improper integrals whose lower limit is −∞.
Definition 8.7.3. If f is continuous on (−∞, b], then

For example,

where in the final step we used our observation, from Section 7.5, that limt→−∞ tan−1 t = −π/2. This integral represents the area of the blue region in Figure 8.10, which extends infinitely far to the left.

Figure 8.10: The area of the blue region is 
The symmetry of the figure suggests that the area under y = 1/(x2 +1) for x ≥ 0 is also π/2, and this is confirmed by the following calculation:

And this might lead us to say that the total area under the curve y = 1/(x2 +1), for all values of x, both positive and negative, is π/2+π/2 = π. To express this using an integral requires a new definition.
Definition 8.7.4. Suppose that f is continuous on (−∞,∞). If  and  both converge, then we say that  converges and

If either  or  diverges, then we say that  diverges.
For example, according to this definition,

Although we have specified in Definition 8.7.4 that an integral from −∞ to ∞is to be split into two integrals at 0, in fact we will get the same answer if we split it at any number we choose. In other words, for any number a we can write

This is justified by part 3 of the following theorem.
Theorem 8.7.5. Suppose a < b.
1. If f is continuous on [a,∞), then

where we interpret this equation to mean that either both improper integrals converge and the two sides of the equation are equal, or both improper integrals diverge.
2. If f is continuous on (−∞, b], then

where again the equation means that either both sides are defined and equal, or both sides are undefined.
3. If f is continuous on (−∞,∞) then

where once again either both sides are defined and equal or both sides are undefined.
Proof. For part 1, we have

The proof of part 2 is similar.
Part 3 follows from parts 1 and 2:

Example 8.7.6. Evaluate the following expressions:

Solution. For part (a), we split the integral into two integrals, as suggested by Definition 8.7.4:

The first integral on the right is

Since this integral diverges, there is no need to evaluate the second one; according to Definition 8.7.4, integral (a) diverges.
However, the limit in part (b) is defined, as the following calculation shows:

The limit in part (c) is also defined, but the value is different from the limit in part (b):

Example 8.7.6 illustrates how subtle improper integrals can be. In both parts (b) and (c), the upper limit of integration approaches ∞and the lower limit approaches−∞, but the values of the two limits are different! Perhaps this makes it seem reasonable that the improper integral in part (a) diverges; there would be no way to assign a value to it that is compatible with both parts (b) and (c). In Exercise 28 we ask you to show that this unusual situation never arises with improper integrals that converge.
So far we have discussed areas of regions that extend infinitely far to the left or right, but a region can also extend infinitely far up or down. For example,  and therefore the region under the curve  for 0 < x ≤ 1 extends up infinitely far just to the right of the y-axis, as shown in Figure 8.11. The area of this region should be represented by the integral  but we cannot apply the definition of definite integrals in Section 5.3 to this integral, because  is not continuous on [0, 1]. Once again, we must extend our definition of integration to make sense of this integral, and as before we do this by taking a limit of an integral.

Figure 8.11: The region under the curve 
Definition 8.7.7. Suppose that f is continuous on (a, b], but f is not continuous from the right at a. Then we define the improper integral  by the equation

Similarly, if f is continuous on [a, b), but f is not continuous from the left at b, then

For example, according to this definition,

Thus, the area of the blue shaded region in Figure 8.11 is 2. Similarly, we have

This means that the area of the red shaded region in Figure 8.12 is 3/2. Of course, the integral is negative because the region is below the x-axis.

Figure 8.12: The region between the curve  and the x-axis for 0 ≤ x < 1.
Improper integrals of the type considered in Definition 8.7.7 are harder to recognize than those in Definitions 8.7.1, 8.7.3, and 8.7.4, because the symbol ∞does not appear in the integral notation. To see that an integral of this type is improper, you must examine the integrand and notice that it has a discontinuity.
There are other kinds of improper integrals, but rather than trying to list all the possibilities, we just state the general principles that we use to evaluate improper integrals:
1.An integral  is improper if either one of the limits of integration is ±∞ or f has a discontinuity.
2.If there is only one problem of the kind identified in 1, and the problem occurs at one of the limits of integration, then we evaluate the integral by taking a limit of a (proper) integral, as in Definitions 8.7.1, 8.7.3, and 8.7.7.
3.In other situations, we split up the integral as a sum of two or more integrals that can be evaluated as in 2. If any of these integrals diverge, then the original integral diverges.
Example 8.7.8. Evaluate the following integrals:

Solution. Integral (a) may not appear to be improper, and you might be tempted to evaluate it like this:

The problem with this calculation is that although tan x is continuous on the intervals [0, π/2) and (π/2, π], tan(π/2) is undefined, so the second fundamental theorem of calculus does not apply. In fact, since limx→π/2− tan x =∞and limx→π/2+ tan x = −∞, the graph of the tangent function has a vertical asymptote at x = π/2. The integral is therefore improper, and we must split it up as suggested in principle 3 above:

We must now evaluate the two integrals on the right-hand side separately.
The first integral on the right is

Thus, the first integral diverges, and therefore integral (a) diverges.
Integral (b) is clearly improper, because the upper limit of integration is∞. But it is also improper at the lower limit of integration, since the graph of the integrand has a vertical asymptote at x = 2. We therefore split the integral into a sum of two improper integrals. As in part 3 of Theorem 8.7.5, we can split it wherever we choose; the answer will be the same no matter where we split it. We have arbitrarily chosen to split the integral at x = 3:

To evaluate the two integrals on the right-hand side, it will be easiest to first evaluate the indefinite integral. We use the substitution
θ = sec−1(x/2), x = 2 sec θ, dx = 2 sec θ tan θ dθ,
which allows us to simplify the square root:

(Notice that since x ≥ 2 and θ = sec−1(x/2), we have 0 ≤ θ < π/2, and therefore tan θ is positive.) The indefinite integral on the interval (2,∞) is therefore

Now we can evaluate the improper integrals:

and therefore

The integrand in integral (c) is continuous on [1,∞), so we can evaluate the integral with a single limit:

Notice that  and  both diverge, and therefore

This does not contradict Theorem 5.3.6. According to that theorem, for any t > 1, 
and therefore

But the last limit above cannot be evaluated by finding the limits of the two integrals separately and then subtracting, since those limits are undefined. The lesson of this example is that facts about proper integrals do not necessarily apply to improper integrals.

Chapter 9
Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates
9.1 Parametric Equations
Consider a particle moving in the xy-plane. To describe how its position changes over time, we might define two functions as follows:
f(t) = the x-coordinate of the particle at time t,
g(t) = the y-coordinate of the particle at time t.
In other words, the coordinates (x, y) of the particle at any time t are given by the equations x = f(t), y = g(t).
For example, suppose a particle moves in the plane during the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 5, and its coordinates at any time during this interval are given by the equations

By substituting values of t between 0 and 5 into these equations, we can find the position of the particle at any time in this interval. In Figure 9.1 we have computed the position of the particle at several times and then plotted these points. The trajectory of the particle must be a curve passing through these points, as illustrated in the figure.
In this example, it is not hard to determine what this trajectory is. As t runs through all values from 0 to 5, x = 9 −2t runs through all values from 9 down to −1.

Figure 9.1: Graphing the trajectory of the particle in equations (9.1).
Solving for t in this equation, we see that each value of x in the interval [−1, 9] arises from exactly one value of t, namely t = (9− x)/2, and therefore there is exactly one point on the trajectory with this x-coordinate. The y-coordinate of this point is

Thus, the trajectory is the part of the parabola y = (x2 −10x +9)/4 between x = −1 and x = 9, traversed from right to left.
The equations we started with in this example, equations (9.1), express the coordinates (x, y) of a varying point in terms of a third variable t. The variable t is called a parameter, and the equations are called parametric equations. In many examples the parameter represents time, but this need not be the case. Any equations that express the coordinates of a varying point in terms of another variable are called parametric equations. Such equations determine a curve in the plane; the curve is the trajectory of the varying point as the parameter runs through all values in its domain.
For example, according to the definitions of the trigonometric functions, if we start at the point P with coordinates (1, 0) and travel a distance of θ units counterclockwise around the unit circle, we will arrive at the point Q with coordinates (cos θ, sin θ) (see Figure 9.2a). Thus, the equations x = cos θ and y = sin θ, for 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π, are parametric equations for the unit circle. As θ runs through all values from 0 to 2π, the point (x, y) given by these equations travels counterclockwise once around the circle. The parameter in this case is θ, which does not represent time, but rather represents the distance along the circumference of the circle from P to Q, or, equivalently, the radian measure of the angle POQ in the figure. More generally, for any constant r > 0, we can rescale the circle by a factor of r to get a circle of radius r centered at the origin, which is represented by the parametric equations x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ. And for any numbers a and b, if we shift this circle a units horizontally and b units vertically, then we will get a circle of radius r centered at the point (a, b), with parametric equations x = a + r cos θ, y = b+r sin θ, for 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π. This is illustrated in Figure 9.2b.

Figure 9.2
A well-known curve that is most easily described using parametric equations is the cycloid. Consider a wheel rolling along a straight road, and choose a distinguished point on the circumference of the wheel. The path traced by this distinguished point as the wheel rolls along the road is called a cycloid. For example, if we attach a light to the circumference of a bicycle wheel, then an observer watching a bicyclist ride past on a dark night will see the light trace out a cycloid.
To derive parametric equations for the cycloid, we take the road to be the x-axis, and we assume that a wheel of radius r starts out resting on the origin and then rolls to the right. Our distinguished point on the circumference of the wheel will be the point that is initially in contact with the road at the origin. For our parameter, we will use the angle θ through which the wheel has turned after it has rolled some distance to the right.
The initial position of the wheel is shown as a blue circle in Figure 9.3. After it has rolled through some angle θ, the wheel will be resting on the point Q in the figure, and the distinguished point will be at P. The part of the wheel that has been in contact with the road up to this point is the arc PQ, and the part of the road it has been in contact with is the segment OQ; these are shown in red in the figure. Since the wheel has rolled without sliding, arc PQ and segment OQ have the same length.
To find this common length, notice that angle PCQ is θ radians, so the fraction of the full circumference of the wheel that is taken up by arc PQis θ/(2π). Since the circumference of the wheel is 2πr, this means that the length of arc PQ is (θ/(2π))(2πr) = rθ. Therefore OQ has length rθ, and it follows that the coordinates of C, the center of the wheel, are (rθ, r).

Figure 9.3: Finding parametric equations for a cycloid.
Thus, at this time the wheel is a circle with radius r centered at the point (rθ, r). Fortunately, we have already worked out parametric equations for such a circle. Since angle PCR is 3π/2−θ, the coordinates of the point P are (rθ +r cos(3π/2−θ), r + r sin(3π/2−θ)). We can simplify these coordinates by applying trigonometric identities:
cos(3π/2−θ) = cos(3π/2) cos θ + sin(3π/2) sin θ
= 0 · cos θ +(−1) · sin θ = −sin θ,
sin(3π/2−θ) = sin(3π/2) cos θ −cos(3π/2) sin θ
= (−1) · cos θ +0 · sin θ = −cos θ.
Thus, the coordinates of P are given by the functions

These are our parametric equations for the cycloid. The range of values 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π represents one full rotation of the wheel, during which the distinguished point traverses the entire curve shown in Figure 9.3, beginning at the origin and returning to contact with road at the point (2πr, 0).
In Figure 9.3, it appears that the cycloid passes the vertical line test, so it is the graph of some function h. We can confirm this by observing that for all θ ∈ (0, 2π),

and therefore f is strictly increasing on the interval [0, 2π]. It follows that f has an inverse function f −1. The domain of f −1 is [0, 2πr], and its range is [0, 2π]. This means that each value of x between 0 and 2πr corresponds to exactly one value of θ, namely θ = f −1(x), so there is exactly one point on the cycloid with this x-coordinate. The y-coordinate of this point is y = g(θ) = g(f−1(x)). In other words, the cycloid is the graph of the function h = g ◦ f−1.
Recall that in Section 7.2, we worked out the calculus of inverse functions. In particular, in Theorem 7.2.2 we showed that if a function is strictly increasing and continuous, then its inverse is continuous as well. Thus, f −1 is continuous, and it follows that h is also continuous, since it is a composition of continuous functions. In fact, according to Theorem 7.2.2, since f is differentiable and f′(θ) = 0 for θ ∈ (0, 2π), f −1 is differentiable on (0, 2πr), and therefore h = g ◦ f −1 is as well. One way to find h′(x) would be to use the formula for the derivative of f −1 given in Theorem 7.2.2 (see Exercise 21). But it is perhaps a little easier to proceed as follows. We begin with the equations
y = h(x), x = f(θ).
By the chain rule, we have

and therefore as long as dx/dθ = 0,

We have already computed dx/dθ in equation (9.3) above and verified that it is nonzero on the interval (0, 2π), and

Thus,

For example, consider a cycloid generated by a wheel of radius r = 6. When θ = 4π/3 we have

Thus, the point  is on the cycloid. At this point, the slope of the tangent line to the cycloid is

This is illustrated in Figure 9.4.
The difficulty we faced in computing dy/dx was caused by the fact that our parametric equations (9.2) give us a formula for y in terms of θ, not x. By differentiating this formula we can compute dy/dθ, but it is not so easy to see how to compute dy/dx. Equation (9.4), which is simply a rearranged form of the chain rule, shows how dy/dθ can be used to compute dy/dx. One way to remember equation (9.4) is to think of it as saying that the derivative dy/dx will be unchanged if we "divide numerator and denominator by dθ." Of course, this doesn't really make sense; derivatives are not fractions, and dθ is not a number. But once again we have a form of the chain rule that tells us that derivatives act in certain ways as if they were fractions. This idea can be useful in other situations as well.

Figure 9.4: A cycloid with r = 6. The tangent line to the cycloid at the point (8π +  has slope 
For example, let's compute d2 y/dx2. It will make our calculations easier to follow if we give a name to dy/dx, so we introduce the notation

We now want to compute d2y/dx2 = dy′/dx.
Notice that equation (9.5) expresses y′ in terms of θ, not x. From this equation we can easily find dy′/dθ, but we want dy′/dx. This is exactly the same as the difficulty we faced when computing dy/dx, and we can use the same idea as before to deal with the difficulty. Imitating our previous reasoning, we can show that we will get the right answer if we "divide numerator and denominator of dy′/dx by dθ":

Using equation (9.5), we find that

so

Notice that for 0 < θ < 2π, d2y/dx2 is negative, and therefore h is concave down. This confirms the shape of the curve in Figures 9.3 and 9.4.
Curves that are given by parametric equations do not always pass the vertical line test, so they are not always graphs of functions. But often it is possible to break the curve into pieces so that each piece is the graph of some function. For each piece, we can then imitate the reasoning we used with the cycloid to study the function and determine the shape of its graph.
Example 9.1.1. Sketch the curve C given by the parametric equations
x = f(t) = 3t3 −18t2 +27t +10,
y = g(t) = t3 −6t2 +35.
Solution. We first compute

Clearly f′(t) = 0 when t is 1 or 3 and g′(t) = 0 when t is 0 or 4, and checking sample points we find that the signs of f′(t) and g′(t) can be summarized as follows:

Looking at this number line, we can see that f and g are both strictly increasing on the interval (−∞, 0]. In other words, as t increases through this interval, x and y both increase, and the point (x, y) on the curve C moves to the right and up. On the interval [0, 1], f is strictly increasing and g is strictly decreasing, so as t increases from 0 to 1, x increases and y decreases, and the point (x, y) moves to the right and down. Similarly, as t increases from 1 to 3, the point (x, y) moves to the left and down, as t increases from 3 to 4, (x, y) moves to the right and down, and as t increases beyond 4, (x, y) moves to the right and up. Plotting the points at t = 0, 1, 3, 4 and filling in the direction of motion between these points, we can see that the general shape of the curve must be as shown in Figure 9.5.
Figure 9.5 is not a very accurate picture of C; we will improve on it shortly. But it is already accurate enough to allow us to see that C is not the graph of a function. Indeed, any vertical line x = c for c between 10 and 22 will cross C three times, violating the vertical line test. But we can break C into three pieces, indicated by the colors black, red, and blue in the figure, so that each piece is the graph of a function.
To spell this out more precisely, we let C1 be the part of C generated by values of t in the interval (−∞, 1], C2 the part for values of t in the interval [1, 3], and C3 the part for t in [3,∞). The overall shape of C1 is indicated in black in Figure 9.5, C2 in red, and C3 in blue. Imitating the reasoning we used for the cycloid, we can show that these three pieces of C are the graphs of three differentiable functions h1, h2, and h3. To find the derivatives of these functions, we "divide the numerator and denominator of dy/dx by dt" to get the formula


Figure 9.5: The general shape of the curve C in Example 9.1.1.
Formula (9.6) gives the derivatives of all three of the functions h1, h2, and h3. For t < 1 it is equal to h′1(x), for 1 < t < 3 it is h′2(x), and for t > 3 it is h′3(x). The formula cannot be applied at t = 1 or 3, since at these points the denominator is 0.
Similarly, we can find a single formula that gives the second derivatives of all three functions. Letting y′ = dy/dx, we compute

and therefore

Using this information, let's try to draw C1 more accurately. Since f (1) = 22 and

the set of x-coordinates of points on C1 is the interval (−∞, 22]. This interval is the domain of the function h1. For t < 1, the only point where either dy/dx or d2 y/dx2 changes sign occurs when t = 0 and x = f (0) = 10. Substituting appropriate sample points into equations (9.6) and (9.7), we find that

We conclude that the signs of h′1 and h′′1  are as shown on the following number line:

Thus, h1 is strictly increasing on (−∞, 10] and strictly decreasing on [10, 22], with a local maximum at the point where t = 0 and x = 10, and it is concave down on the entire interval (−∞, 22]. The graph of h1—that is, the curve C1—is shown in black in Figure 9.6.
We use a similar method to sketch C2 and C3. We begin by making number lines indicating the signs of the derivatives of h2 and h3. Notice that since f is strictly decreasing on the interval [1, 3], C2 is traversed from right to left, as indicated in Figure 9.5. We have therefore chosen to draw our number line for h2 with the values of t running from right to left, so that the x values will appear in their proper order.

Figure 9.6: The curve C in Example 9.1.1. The curve C1 is shown in black, C2 in red, and C3 in blue.
In the first of these number lines we see that t = 2 is another important point to plot. At t = 2, we have x = f(2) = 16 and y = g(2) = 19. We can read off from this number line that h2 is strictly increasing on [10, 22], concave down on [10, 16], and concave up on [16, 22], with an inflection point at x = 16. We see from the second number line that h3 is strictly decreasing on [10, 22], strictly increasing on [22,∞), and concave up on [10,∞); it has a local minimum at x = 22. The graphs are shown in Figure 9.6.
There is one more point that is perhaps worth commenting on. In Figure 9.6, it appears that C has vertical tangent lines at t = 1 and t = 3. The easiest way to confirm this is to reverse the roles of x and y in our calculations. The part of the curve between t = 0 and t = 4 is the graph of an equation x = j (y), for some function j, and

At the points where t = 1 and t = 3 we have dx/dy = 0, and therefore the tangent lines at these points have equations of the form x = 0 · y +c = c; that is, they are vertical. For an alternative way to see this, see Exercise 23.
The lesson of Example 9.1.1 is that if a curve is given by parametric equations expressing x and y as differentiable functions of a parameter t, then the curve can often be broken into pieces so that each piece is the graph of a differentiable function. The pieces will correspond to intervals of t values on which dx/dt has one sign, with each piece being traversed either left to right or right to left, depending on the sign of dx/dt. The first and second derivatives of these functions can be computed using the formulas

The signs of these derivatives can then be used in the usual way to determine the shape of the curve.

19.Let P be a distinguished point attached to a wheel of radius r, and let a be the distance from the center of the wheel to P. The path traced by P as the wheel rolls along a road is called a trochoid. (If a = r, then the point P is on the circumference of the wheel, and the trochoid is a cycloid. But in this problem, we consider other possible values of a.)
(a)Find parametric equations for the trochoid.
(b)Sketch the graph of the trochoid in the case r = 2, a = 1. (For example, if a reflector is attached halfway along one of the spokes of a bicycle wheel of radius 2, then this trochoid would be the path of the reflector as a bicyclist rides by.)
(c)Sketch the graph of the trochoid in the case r = 1, a = 2. (In this case, a > r, so the distinguished point P is beyond the circumference of the wheel. Such a trochoid could be the path of a point on the flange of a train wheel as the train goes by.)
20.Figure 9.7 shows the design of an elliptical trainer. The axle of a wheel of radius 10 inches is attached at the origin O to a track lying along the positive x-axis. One end of a rigid rod is attached to the circumference of the wheel at P, and the other end rests on the track at Q. The rod can pivot around P, and the end of the rod at Q can slide along the track. The rod is 40 inches long, and a foot pad is attached to the center of the rod at M. When an exerciser uses the trainer, the wheel rotates, and the foot pad at M traces a closed curve C.

What do these limits represent in Figure 9.6?
9.2 Arc Length
Consider a curve C given by parametric equations x = f (t), y = g(t), for a ≤ t ≤ b. In this section, we will address the question: What is the length of C?
As usual in calculus, we begin by trying to find away to get an approximate answer. Our method will be to cut the curve into pieces, approximate the length of each piece, and then add up these approximations. If this leads to a Riemann sum, then we should be able to use an integral to compute the exact length of the curve.
To carry out this plan, we first divide the interval [a, b] on the t-axis into n equal pieces, for some positive integer n. Each piece will have width △t = (b−a)/n, and the division points will be ti = a + i△t for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n. The i th piece is the interval [ti−1, ti], and when values of t in this interval are plugged into the parametric equations they generate a piece Ci of the curve C. If we let si be the length of Ci, then the total length of C is  We now want to approximate si.
For each i, let Pi be the point on C corresponding to t = ti; in other words, Pi is the point with coordinates (f (ti), g(ti)). Then Ci is the piece of C that begins at Pi−1 and ends at Pi. We will approximate its length, si, with the length of the line segment from Pi−1 to Pi. In other words, if we let △xi = f (ti)− f (ti−1) and △yi = g(ti)− g(ti−1), then by the distance formula, our approximation is

Adding these approximations, we conclude that the total length of C is approximately

The line segments  for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, form a polygonal path that follows the general shape of the curve C, as illustrated in Figure 9.8. Since Qn is the sum of the lengths of all of these line segments, it is the length of this polygonal path. Intuitively, it seems that as n increases, this polygonal path will follow the shape of C more and more closely, and Qn will get closer and closer to the length of C. We therefore compute the exact length as a limit:


Figure 9.8: The curve C, shown in black, is approximated by the blue polygonal path.
Unfortunately, the sum that defines Qn does not have the form of a Riemann sum. In a Riemann sum, every term should include a factor of △t, but this factor does not appear in the sum in equation (9.8). But we can easily introduce such a factor by dividing by (△t)2 inside the square root and multiplying by △t outside the square root:

The fractions inside the square root in this formula look like they are related to derivatives. Indeed, if we assume that f is differentiable on [a, b], then we can use the mean value theorem to conclude that for each i, there is some number  between ti−1 and ti such that

Similarly, if g is also differentiable on [a, b], then for each i, there is a number  between ti−1 and ti such that

Substituting into equation (9.9), we find that

We are making progress; the sum in equation (9.9) is almost a Riemann sum. The only remaining problem is that each term in the sum involves two sample points in interval number i,  whereas in a Riemann sum there should be only one sample point. But if n is large, so that △t is small, then  and  will be very close together. If we assume that f′ and g′ are continuous on [a, b], then the small discrepancy in the sample points shouldn't make much difference. In other words, the sum

should be close to Qn, and therefore also a good approximation of the length of C. In fact, it can be shown (see Exercise 15) that limn→∞ Qn = limn→∞ Rn. Therefore the exact length of C is

Rewriting the derivatives in Leibniz notation, we have

Example 9.2.1. Find the lengths of the following curves:

Solution. For part (a), we have

and therefore by equation (9.12) the length of the curve is

Since cos t and sin t are both nonnegative for t between 0 and π/2, we can drop the absolute value signs and evaluate the integral using the substitution u = sin t, du = cost dt:

Our method for part (b) is similar:

and therefore

For 0 ≤ t ≤ 2, t −3 is negative, so |t −3| = 3 −t, and the length of the curve is

The curve in part (c) is not given by parametric equations, so equation (9.12) doesn't apply. But we can easily convert it to parametric equations by writing it like this:
x = t, y = t2, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
Now we have

and therefore

Unfortunately, this is a somewhat challenging integral. To evaluate it, we use the substitution θ = tan−1(2t), which means

This substitution gives us

We first evaluate the indefinite integral, using our reduction formula for powers of secant, equation (8.18):

Finally, we evaluate the definite integral to find the length of the curve:

The method we used in part (c) of Example 9.2.1 can be used to find the length of any curve of the form y = f (x), for a ≤ x ≤ b, as long as f′ is continuous on [a, b]. We first rewrite the curve in parametric form using the equations
x = t, y = f (t), a ≤ t ≤ b,
and then equation (9.12) tells us that the length of the curve is

Rewriting this answer in Leibniz notation, this means that

Similarly, the length of a curve of the form x = f (y), a ≤ y ≤ b is

Example 9.2.2. Find the length of the curve

Solution. We first compute

For y between 1 and 2 we can drop the absolute value signs, and the length of the curve is

We have now derived three formulas for the length of a curve, given in equations (9.12), (9.13), and (9.14). There is a relationship between these formulas that can be made explicit by introducing some new notation. In equation (9.12), if we pretend that dt is a number, and not part of our notation for derivatives and integrals, then we can move the final dt inside the square root as a dt2 and then "cancel" with the "denominators" of the derivatives:

Of course, this calculation doesn't really make sense, and the final integral above does not use standard integral notation. But it is striking that similar calculations with equations (9.13) and (9.14), moving either dx or dy inside the square root, lead to exactly the same result.
We therefore introduce the notation  and say that the length of a curve is given by the formula

Again, this formula doesn't really mean anything, but it is a useful mnemonic that can help you remember how to compute the length of a curve. By "factoring" either dx, dy, or dt out of the square root in the formula for ds, you can obtain the integrands in equations (9.12), (9.13), and (9.14):

Thus, equation (9.15) can be thought of as a shorthand version of all of our length formulas. Equation (9.15) also has the advantage that the formula  is reminiscent of the distance formula  which was the basis of all of our length calculations.

Now let Qn and Rn be the sums defined in equations (9.10) and (9.11). As in the text, we assume that f′ and g′ are continuous on [a, b]. In the next part, you will prove that limn→∞ Qn = limn→∞ Rn.
(b)Suppose ϵ > 0. Since g′ is continuous on [a, b], by Theorem 5.6.2 it is uniformly continuous on that interval. Thus, there is some δ > 0 such that if s, t ∈ [a, b] and |s −t| < δ, then |g′(s)− g′(t)| < ϵ/(b−a). Let N be an integer larger than (b−a)/δ. Now show that if n > N then |Qn − Rn| < ϵ.

9.3 Surface Area
In the last section, we found a formula for the length of a curve C given by parametric equations x = f(t), y = g(t), for a ≤ t ≤ b. In this section we assume that y = g(t) ≥ 0, so that C does not go below the x-axis, and we compute the area of the surface generated when the curve C is rotated about the x-axis. This is illustrated in Figure 9.9. Once again, our method will be to approximate this area with a Riemann sum, and then to find the exact answer with an integral.
While the problem we have proposed no doubt reminds you of the volumes that we computed in Chapter 6, there are important differences. In Chapter 6, we rotated a region bounded by given curves about an axis to generate a solid. To find the volume of the solid, we cut the region into slices and approximated each slice with a rectangle. But in this section, it is not a region bounded by the curve C that is being rotated about an axis, but rather the curve itself. Thus, we will be cutting the curve C into pieces, not a region bounded by C. We will approximate each piece of C with a line segment, as we did in our length calculations in the last section. Thus, our method in this section will combine ideas from the last section with ideas from Chapter 6.

Figure 9.9: When the curve C is rotated about the x-axis, it generates a surface.
We begin by cutting the curve C into n pieces, for some positive integer n, exactly as we did in the last sections. Thus, we again let △t = (b−a)/n, and for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n we let ti = a + i△t and we let Pi be the point with coordinates (f (ti), g(ti)). The numbers ti divide the interval [a, b] on the t-axis into n pieces, and the points Pi divide the curve C into corresponding pieces. The i th piece of [a, b] is the interval [ti−1, ti ], and values of t in this interval correspond to the piece Ci of C that runs from Pi−1 to Pi. As before, we will approximate Ci with the line segment from Pi−1 to Pi. The length of this line segment is  where △xi = f (ti)− f (ti−1) and △yi = g(ti)− g(ti−1).
Let S be the area of the surface generated when C is rotated about the x-axis; this is what we want to compute. If we let Si be the area of the part of this surface that is generated by Ci, which is shown in gray in the center of Figure 9.10, then  We now approximate Ci with the line segment from Pi−1 to Pi, and we approximate Si with the area of the surface generated when this line segment is rotated about the x-axis. This surface is shown in blue on the right in Figure 9.10.
You may not be familiar with the formula for the area of the blue surface in Figure 9.10. We therefore temporarily set aside our computation of S to derive the formula for the area of this surface. The surface is called the lateral surface of a frustum of a cone, because we can think of it as being cut off of the end of a cone, as illustrated in the center of Figure 9.11. We will find a formula for the lateral surface area of a frustum in terms of the radii at either end of the frustum, labeled r1 and r2 in Figure 9.11, and the length l, which is called the slant height of the frustum. Let x be the distance along the surface of the cone from the frustum to the apex of the cone, as indicated in the figure.
If we cut the lateral surface of the cone along a line from the base to the apex and then flatten it out, we get a sector of a circle, as illustrated on the right in Figure 9.11.

Figure 9.10: When Ci is rotated about the x-axis, it generates the gray surface in the center. We approximate Ci with the line segment from Pi−1 to Pi, which generates the blue surface on the right.

Figure 9.11: Computing the lateral surface area of a frustum of a cone.
The lateral surface of the frustum becomes the blue band along the outer edge of this sector. The length of the outer edge of the sector is the same as the circumference of the base of the cone, which is 2πr1, and the circumference of the entire outer circle on the right in the figure is 2π(l + x). Therefore the fraction of the circle taken up by the sector is 2πr1/(2π(l + x)) = r1/(l + x). The area of the outer circle is π(l + x)2 and the area of the inner circle is πx2, so the area of the ring between the two circles is
π(l + x)2 −πx2 = π[(l + x)2 − x2] = π[l2 +2lx] = πl(l +2x).
The fraction of this ring taken up by the blue band is r1/(l + x), so the area of the blue band, which is the same as the lateral surface area of the frustum, is

We would now like to eliminate x from this formula. To do this, we use the triangle on the left in Figure 9.11, which is the top half of a vertical cross section through the cone. By similar triangles, we see that

and therefore

Substituting into equation (9.16), we see that the lateral surface area of the frustum is

It may be a little easier to understand and remember the formula for the lateral surface area of the frustum if we rewrite it in the form

We can think of (r1 +r2)/2 as the average radius of the frustum, and therefore 2π (r1 +r2)/2 is the average circumference. Thus, equation (9.17) says that the lateral surface area of the frustum is the average circumference times the slant height. Note that in our calculations we assumed that r1 = r2. If r1 = r2, then the blue surface in Figure 9.11 becomes a cylinder, whose lateral surface area is the circumference times the height. Thus, equation (9.17) is correct even if r1 = r2.
We are ready now to return to the computation of S, the area of the surface generated when the curve C is rotated about the x-axis. Recall that our plan was to approximate Si, the area of the part of the surface generated by the i th piece of C, with the area of the blue surface on the right in Figure 9.10. Using equation (9.17), we now have a formula for this approximation:

Adding up these pieces, we conclude that

As in the last section, to turn this into a Riemann sum we first factor out △t and apply the mean value theorem to conclude that if f and g are differentiable on [a, b], then

for some two numbers  and  between ti−1 and ti.
Once again, the last sum above is still not a Riemann sum. This time, there are four values in the interval [ti−1, ti] that appear in the ith term of the sum: the two endpoints, ti−1 and ti, and two values in between,  and  But as before, if we assume that g, f′, and g′ are continuous on [a, b], then it shouldn't make much difference if we change all of these values of t to a single sample point in the ith interval. In other words, we have the approximation

This approximation is a Riemann sum.
Finally, to get the exact answer, we take the limit as n →∞, which turns the Riemann sum into an integral:

Alternatively, we could write the integral in the form

But perhaps the most useful form of the integral comes from recognizing the geometric origin of each term in the integral. The y-coordinate of a point on C represents the radius of the circle traced by the point when it rotates about the x-axis, so that 2πy is the circumference. The rest of the integrand is what we called ds in the last section. So it may be best to remember the formula for surface area in the form

This formula should make sense if you compare it to equation (9.17): the circumference factor in the integral corresponds to the average circumference of the frustum, and ds corresponds to the slant height.
Example 9.3.1. Find the areas of the following surfaces:
(a)The surface generated when the curve x = t3, y = t2, for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, is rotated about the x-axis.
(b)The surface generated when the curve y = x2, for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, is rotated about the y-axis.
(c)The surface of a sphere of radius r.
(d)The surface generated when the circle x2 + y2 = a2 is rotated about the line x = b, where b > a > 0.
Solution. For part (a), we can simply apply equation (9.18) to see that the surface area is

To evaluate the integral, we use the substitution

This leads to the calculation

The curve in part (b) is not given by parametric equations, and it is rotated about the y-axis, not the x-axis, so we cannot use equation (9.18) to find the requested surface area. However, we can use equation (9.19). The independent variable in the specification of the curve is x, so it is easiest to write ds in the form

When a point on the curve is rotated about the y-axis, the radius of the circle it traces is x, so by equation (9.19) the surface area is

The substitution u = 1+4x2, du = 8x dx now gives the solution:

To generate the surface of a sphere of radius r for part (c), we let C be the top half of the circle of radius r centered at the origin and then rotate C about the x-axis. We can represent C by the parametric equations
x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π.
Using θ as our independent variable, we have

The radius of the circle generated when a point on C is rotated about the x-axis is y = r sin θ, so by equation (9.19) the surface area of a sphere of radius r is

You probably knew this formula already, but you may not have known where it came from.
Finally, the surface in part (d) is called a torus; it is the surface of a donut, as illustrated in Figure 9.12. We can represent the circle with the parametric equations x = a cos θ, y = a sin θ, for 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π. When a point on this circle is rotated about the line x = b, it generates a circle of radius b− x = b−a cos θ, and we have


Figure 9.12: When a circle is rotated about a line not passing through the circle, it generates a torus.
Thus, the surface area of the torus is

9.4 Polar Coordinates
So far, whenever we have wanted to specify the location of a point in the plane, we have done so by giving the x- and y-coordinates of the point. This method of identifying points is called the Cartesian coordinate system. It is named for René Descartes (1596-1650), who proposed the use of such coordinates in 1637. However, for some problems it is convenient to use a different method of assigning coordinates to points. In this section we study one such alternative coordinate system, the polar coordinate system.
The Cartesian coordinate system requires two axes, a horizontal x-axis and a vertical y-axis, crossing at a distinguished point called the origin. The x- and y-coordinates of a point P could be thought of as giving us directions for getting from the origin to P; the x-coordinate tells us how far to move horizontally from the origin, and the y-coordinate tells us how far to move vertically.
In the polar coordinate system there is also an origin, but there is only one axis, called the polar axis. The polar axis is a ray—that is, a half-line—beginning at the origin O, and usually drawn extending to the right. Once again, the coordinates of a point P give directions for traveling from O to P, but now the directions specify how far to travel, and in which direction. The polar coordinates of P are (r, θ), where r is the distance from O to P, and θ is the counterclockwise angle from the polar axis to the ray from O through P, as shown in Figure 9.14.


Figure 9.14: The polar coordinate system.

Example 9.4.1. Plot the following points in polar coordinates:

Solution. The solution is shown in Figure 9.15. To locate the point P, we draw a ray from the origin making an angle of π/4 in the counterclockwise direction from the polar axis, and then travel 3 units along this ray. The value θ = −π/2 for the point Q means that we should make an angle of π/2 in the clockwise direction from the polar axis. Thus, Q is located 2 units down from the origin.

Figure 9.15: The solution to Example 9.4.1.
Finally, for the point R, note that 9π/4 = 2π + π/4, and therefore the direction indicated by θ = 9π/4 is the same as the direction for θ = π/4. Thus, R is exactly the same point as P.
Example 9.4.1 illustrates a feature of polar coordinates that does not occur in Cartesian coordinates: two different sets of coordinates can refer to the same point. For another example of this, note that the point Q in Figure 9.15 could also be represented by the polar coordinates (2, 3π/2). In fact, each point in the plane has infinitely many sets of polar coordinates: the point (r, θ) is the same as (r, θ + 2πn) for any integer n. The origin can be represented by the coordinates (0, θ), for any value of θ.
It will be convenient to introduce one more convention. We have described Q as the point you reach by traveling 2 units down from the origin, but we could also say that it is the point you reach by traveling −2 units up from the origin. Since θ = π/2 represents the up direction, we will also assign the polar coordinates (−2, π/2) to Q. More generally, if r is positive, then we will say that the coordinates (−r, θ) represent the point obtained by determining the direction indicated by the angle θ, and then moving in the opposite direction a distance of r units, as illustrated in Figure 9.16. This means that the coordinates (−r, θ) and (r, θ + π) always represent the same point.

Figure 9.16: In polar coordinates, (−r, θ) represents the same point as (r, θ + π).
It is often useful to be able to convert between polar and Cartesian coordinates. When using both coordinate systems, we will set up our axes so that the origins of the two coordinate systems coincide and the polar axis lies along the positive x-axis. If r > 0, then the point P with polar coordinates (r, θ) will lie on the circle of radius r centered at the origin O, with the ray from O through P making an angle of θ measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. As we saw when we studied parametric equations for this circle in Section 9.1 (see Figure 9.2), the Cartesian coordinates of P will be

Notice that the point with polar coordinates (−r, θ) also has polar coordinates (r, θ + π), and therefore its Cartesian coordinates are
x = r cos(θ +π) = −r cos θ, y = r sin(θ + π) = −r sin θ.
It follows that equations (9.20) are correct when r is negative as well. And when r = 0, the point (r, θ) is the origin, and equations (9.20) give x = y = 0, which are the Cartesian coordinates of the origin. Thus, equations (9.20) can be used to convert any polar coordinates (r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates.
The conversion in the other direction is not quite so simple, since each point has multiple sets of polar coordinates. However, equations (9.20) imply that

and if x ≠ 0 then

These equations can be useful for converting Cartesian coordinates to polar.
Example 9.4.2. Perform the following coordinate system conversions:
(a)The point P has polar coordinates (4, π/3). What are its Cartesian coordinates?
(b)The point Q has Cartesian coordinates (−3, 3). What are its polar coordinates?
Solution. We can solve part (a) by simply plugging the polar coordinates of P into equations (9.20):

Thus, P has Cartesian coordinates 
For part (b), we begin by applying equations (9.21) and (9.22) to see that

We conclude that

However, not every combination of these values of r and θ gives polar coordinates for Q. One way to see this is to convert each of these combinations back to Cartesian coordinates using equations (9.20), to see which ones represent Q. We leave it to you to verify that Q has the following polar coordinates:

The other combinations of these values of r and θ give polar coordinates for the point (3,−3), and therefore don't represent Q.
We often represent a curve in the plane as the graph of an equation involving x and y in Cartesian coordinates. But sometimes it is more convenient to represent a curve as the graph of an equation involving r and θ in polar coordinates. As usual, to draw the graph of such an equation, we plot all points whose coordinates make the equation true. But in polar coordinates, there is an extra complication: each point has multiple sets of polar coordinates. What do we do if one set of coordinates for a point makes the equation true, but another set of coordinates for the same point makes the equation false? We will follow the convention that such a point should be included in the graph; if any set of coordinates for a point makes an equation true, then that point is included in the graph of the equation.
For example, the graph of the equation r = 3 is the circle of radius 3 centered at the origin, as shown in Figure 9.17a. Any point on this circle could be written in polar coordinates as either (3, θ) or (−3, θ + π), for some value of θ. The first of these sets of coordinates satisfies the equation r = 3, and the second doesn't. But since there is at least one set of coordinates that satisfies the equation, the point is included in the graph. Figure 9.17b shows the graph of the equation θ = π/6, which is a straight line. The points on the line above and to the right of the origin have coordinates (r, π/6) with r > 0, and those below and to the left of the origin have r < 0.

Figure 9.17
In Cartesian coordinates, we frequently graph equations of the form y = f (x). Similarly, in polar coordinates we will often graph equations of the form r = f (θ). For example, consider the equation r = 1+cos θ. As a first step in sketching the graph of this equation, we could plot some points. In Figure 9.18a, we have computed the values of r corresponding to several values of θ, and we have plotted the corresponding points in polar coordinates in Figure 9.18b. The graph of the equation is a curve passing through these points.
For each value of θ, the corresponding point (r, θ) on the graph lies on a ray from the origin making an angle of θ with the polar axis. You might think of this ray as representing a stick with one end attached to the origin, and the point (r, θ) as a bead on this stick that is r units from the origin. Several positions of the stick and bead are shown in Figure 9.18b.
To understand the shape of the curve between the points we have plotted, it might help to look at the graph of the equation r = 1+cos θ in Cartesian coordinates, but with the horizontal axis labeled θ and the vertical axis labeled r. This graph is shown in Figure 9.18c; it is simply the familiar graph of the cosine function, shifted up one unit. It is clear from this graph that as θ increases from 0 to π, r decreases from 2 down to 0. In our bead-and-stick metaphor, when θ increases from 0 to π, the stick starts out lying along the polar axis and then rotates counterclockwise π radians. As the stick rotates, r decreases from 2 to 0, so the bead starts out 2 units from the origin and slides along the stick toward the origin. The top half of the graph is the path traced out by the bead, which spirals in toward the origin. As θ →π−, r → 0+, and the curve approaches the origin from the left. As θ continues to increase from π to 2π, r increases from 0 back to 2, and the curve spirals out again, producing the bottom half of the graph. Notice that if 0 ≤ θ ≤ π and r = 1+cos θ, so that (r, θ) is a point on the top half of the graph, then since cos(2π −θ) = cos θ, the point (r, 2π −θ) is also on the graph. It follows that the bottom half of the graph is the mirror image of the top half, as seen in Figure 9.18b. This curve is called a cardioid, because it looks like a heart.

Figure 9.18: Graphing the equation r = 1+cos θ.
Example 9.4.3. Graph the equation r = sin(3θ) in polar coordinates.
Solution. We begin by graphing r = sin(3θ) in the Cartesian rθ-plane; see Figure 9.19a. We see in this graph that as θ increases from 0 to π/3, r increases from 0 to 1 and then decreases back to 0. Thus, for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/3 the graph in polar coordinates spirals out from the origin and then back in again. This generates the upper-right "leaf" in Figure 9.19b.
For π/3 ≤ θ ≤ 2π/3, r decreases from 0 down to −1 and then increases again to 0. This generates another leaf, but since r is negative, this leaf points down rather than up. Finally, the upper-left leaf in the figure corresponds to 2π/3 ≤ θ ≤ π.


Figure 9.19: Graphing the equation r = sin(3θ).

For values of θ in the range π ≤ θ ≤ 4π/3, r is negative, and we trace the upper-right leaf again. In fact, all further values of θ repeat parts of the curve we have already graphed. To see why, let θ0 be any angle and let r0 = sin(3θ0), so that the point (r0, θ0) is on the graph. Now let (r1, θ1) be the point on the graph with θ1 = θ0 + π and r1 = sin(3θ1). Then
r1 = sin(3(θ0 + π)) = sin(3θ0 + 3π) = −sin(3θ0) = −r0.
Thus, (r1, θ1) = (−r0, θ0 + π), which represents the same point as (r0, θ0). The curve in this example is called a three-leaf rose.
Sometimes it is possible to figure out the graph of an equation involving r and θ in polar coordinates by reexpressing the equation in terms of the Cartesian coordinates x and y, as illustrated in our next example.
Example 9.4.4. Graph the following equations in polar coordinates by finding equivalent equations in terms of the Cartesian coordinates x and y:
(a) r = csc θ, (b) r = cos θ.

Figure 9.20
Solution. In part (a), the given equation means r = 1/sin θ, or in other words r sin θ = 1. But by the second equation in (9.20), this is equivalent to the Cartesian equation y = 1, whose graph is a horizontal line through 1 on the y-axis, as shown in Figure 9.20a.
Part (b) is harder to convert to Cartesian coordinates. We begin by multiplying both sides of the given equation by r to get the equation

We need to be careful here, because we have changed the meaning of the equation: there are solutions to equation (9.23) that are not solutions to the original equation in part (b). Specifically, if r = 0 then equation (9.23) will be true for all values of θ, but this is not the case for the equation in (b). But all of these solutions are sets of polar coordinates that represent the origin, and the origin is on the graph of the equation in (b), since that equation is true when r = 0 and θ = π/2. Thus, although equation (9.23) has more solutions than equation (b), when we plot these solutions in polar coordinates, we don't get any more points.
It is easy now to reexpress equation (9.23) in terms of x and y. By equations (9.20) and (9.21), equation (9.23) is equivalent to
x2 + y2 = x.
Rewriting this equation in the form (x −1/2)2 + y2 = 1/4, we see that its graph is the circle of radius 1/2 centered at the point (1/2, 0), which is shown in Figure 9.20b.
We close this section by considering one more example, the equation r = 1+ 2 cos2 θ. The graphs of this equation, in both Cartesian and polar coordinates, are shown in Figure 9.21. As θ increases from 0 to π, r decreases from 3 to 1 and then increases to 3 again, producing a dip at the top of the polar curve. It appears that there are inflection points on either side of this dip. Can we find them?

Figure 9.21: Graphing the equation r = 1+2 cos2 θ.
Equations (9.20) give us formulas for the x- and y-coordinates of any point on the polar graph in Figure 9.21b:

These are parametric equations: they express x and y in terms of the parameter θ. As θ runs from 0 to π, the top half of the curve is traversed from right to left, and as θ runs from π to 2π, the bottom half is traversed from left to right. We can now use the methods of Section 9.1 to give a detailed analysis of the shape of the curve. By symmetry, we may as well focus on just the top half of the curve.
We begin by computing

Thus,

Setting dy/dx = 0, we find that the top half of the curve has horizontal tangent lines when cos θ = 0 or  In the range 0 ≤ θ ≤ π, this happens when θ = π/4, π/2, 3π/4, and according to the parametric equations (9.24), the x-coordinates of these points are  The sign of dy/dx is shown in the number line below.

Thus we see that the top half of the curve has local maximum points at  and a local minimum at x = 0. These points are easily visible in Figure 9.21b.
Next we compute d2y/dx2. Setting y′ = dy/dx, we find (after some extensive algebraic calculations that we leave to you) that

The numerator here is a quadratic in cos2 θ, and the quadratic formula tells us that d2y/dx2 will be 0 when  But cos2 θ must be between 0 and 1, so the only possible solution is

Thus, d2y/dx2 = 0 when  which happens when θ ≈ 1.274, 1.868. The corresponding values of x are  These are the x-coordinates of the inflection points that we noticed in Figure 9.21b. The concavity can now be read off from the following number line:

Generalizing from our last example, we see that for any function f, the polar curve r = f (θ) can be converted to parametric form by using the equations
x = r cos θ = f (θ) cos θ, y = r sin θ = f (θ) sin θ.
We can then use the methods developed earlier in this chapter to study the curve. For more on this, see Exercises 21-23.

9.5 Areas in Polar Coordinates
One of the most important applications of integration is the calculation of areas. If f is continuous on an interval [a, b] and f (x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ [a, b], then as we saw in Chapter 5,  is the area of the region under the curve y = f (x) for a ≤ x ≤ b. This region consists of all points (x, y) satisfying the inequalities a ≤ x ≤ b, 0 ≤ y ≤ f (x); it is shaded blue in Figure 9.22.
In this section, we study the analogous problem for polar coordinates. Consider the curve given in polar coordinates by the equation r = f (θ) for α ≤ θ ≤ β. We will assume that f is continuous on [α, β] and f (θ) ≥ 0 for all θ ∈ [α, β], and we wish to compute the area of the region determined by the inequalities α ≤ θ ≤ β, 0 ≤ r ≤ f (θ). We might describe this as the region inside the curve r = f (θ) for α ≤ θ ≤ β; it is shaded blue in Figure 9.23. We will assume that α < β ≤ α + 2π, so that the region does not wrap all the way around the origin and overlap with itself.

Figure 9.22: Computing areas in Cartesian coordinates: The lines x = xi divide the region under the curve y = f (x) into vertical strips. We approximate the ith strip with the region  which is a rectangle. The area of this rectangle is 

Figure 9.23: Computing areas in polar coordinates: The lines θ = θi divide the region inside the curve r = f (θ) into wedges. We approximate the ith wedge with the region  which is a sector of a circle. The area of this sector is 
Recall that to compute the area in Cartesian coordinates under the curve y = f (x), a ≤ x ≤ b, we begin by dividing the interval [a, b] into n pieces, each of width △x = (b−a)/n, with division points x0, x1, ..., xn. The lines x = xi divide the region under the curve into vertical strips, and the area under the curve is the sum of the areas of these strips. For each i, we choose a sample point  and we approximate the ith strip with the rectangle xi−1 ≤ x ≤ xi,  You could think of this rectangle as what the ith strip would be if the function f were constant on the interval [xi−1, xi]; it is the striped rectangle in Figure 9.22. The area of this rectangle is  so the area under the curve is approximated by the Riemann sum  The exact area is the limit of this Riemann sum as n →∞, which is 
To find the area in polar coordinates inside the curve r = f (θ), α ≤ θ ≤ β, we imitate this procedure. Thus, we begin by dividing the interval [α, β] into n pieces, each of width △θ = (β −α)/n. The division points are θi = α +i△θ for 0 ≤ i ≤ n. The lines θ = θi divide the region inside the curve into wedges, as illustrated in Figure 9.23. For each i, we choose a sample point  and we approximate the ith wedge with the region θi−1 ≤ θ ≤ θi,  This region, which is striped in Figure 9.23, is a sector of a circle. This sector is what the ith wedge would be if f were constant on the interval [θi−1, θi]. To continue with our area calculation, we need to find the area of this sector.
We can think of the sector as being cut from a circle of radius  The area of this circle is  The angle of the sector is △θ, so the fraction of the circle represented by the sector is △θ/(2π). Thus, the area of the sector is

This is our approximation of the area of the ith wedge.
Adding these approximations, we see that the area A inside the curve r = f (θ), α ≤ θ ≤ β, is approximately This approximation improves as n increases, so as usual we find the exact answer as a limit:

Substituting r for f (θ), we can say that the area inside the curve r = f (θ), α ≤ θ ≤ β, is

Example 9.5.1. Find the areas of the following regions:
(a)The region inside the cardioid r = 1+cos θ (see Figure 9.18b).
(b)The region inside one leaf of the three-leaf rose r = sin(3θ) (see Figure 9.19b).
(c)The region that is inside one leaf of the three-leaf rose r = sin(3θ) and outside the circle 
Solution. To get the entire interior of the cardioid in part (a), we use the range of θ values 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π. Thus, by equation (9.25), the area inside the cardioid is

To evaluate this integral, we use the identity cos2 θ = (1/2)(1+cos(2θ)):

For part (b), recall from Example 9.4.3 that the upper-right leaf of the three-leaf rose corresponds to values of θ in the range 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/3. Thus, the area of this leaf is

Finally, for part (c) we must first find where the circle  intersects the three-leaf rose r = sin(3θ), so we set sin To find the intersection points on the upper-right leaf we consider only 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/3, which means 0 ≤ 3θ ≤ π. For these values of θ, the solutions are 3θ = π/3, 2π/3, or in other words θ = π/9, 2π/9, as shown in Figure 9.24.
The area we want to compute is the area of the region in Figure 9.24 that is shaded blue but not striped. To find this area, we will subtract the area of the striped region from the area of the blue region. Applying equation (9.25) to both r = sin(3θ) and  we see that the desired area is

Chapter 10
Infinite Series and Power Series
10.1 Infinite Series
As we observed in Section 2.8, the meaning of decimal notation suggests that an infinite decimal expansion represents a sum of infinitely many numbers. For example, you are probably familiar with the fact that 1/3 = 0.333 . . ., where the digit 3 is repeated forever. The first 3 after the decimal point stands for 3/10, the next represents 3/100, and so on. Thus, this decimal expansion says that

But the right-hand side of this equation is a sum of infinitely many numbers, and we could never actually add up infinitely many numbers. So what does this sum mean?
In this chapter, we will study such infinite sums. To express these sums, we introduce the notation

A sum of this kind is called an infinite series. The symbol "∞" above the summation sign means that the terms in the series go on forever, and therefore there are infinitely many numbers to be added up. But we still need to explain what it means to write a sum of infinitely many numbers.
Our problem here is similar to the situation we faced when dealing with improper integrals of the form  Recall that when we studied improper integrals, we defined  to be  We use a similar approach for infinite series:
Definition 10.1.1. We define the value of an infinite series  as follows:

If the limit above is defined, then we say that the infinite series converges, or that it is convergent. Otherwise, it diverges, or it is divergent.
Thus, to evaluate an infinite series we don't actually add up infinitely many numbers. Rather, we get approximate answers by adding up the first N terms of the series, for large integers N. As N increases, we add more and more terms, and the approximations improve. As usual in calculus, we define the exact answer to be a limit of approximations.
The quantity  is called the Nth partial sum of the infinite series  We will often denote the Nth partial sum by sN; in other words, we write

The sequence  is called the sequence of partial sums for the infinite series. Definition 10.1.1 says that the value of an infinite series is the limit of its sequence of partial sums:

For example, consider the infinite series

The first few partial sums are

Based on these values, you might guess that in general, sN = (2N −1)/2N = 1−1/2N. In fact, this formula is correct; we ask you to verify it by mathematical induction in Exercise 20. Using this formula for sN, we can evaluate the infinite series:

Example 10.1.2. Evaluate the following infinite series:

Solution. For series (a), we begin by listing the first few terms of the series:

The first few partial sums are:
s1 = 1,
s2 = 1+(−1) = 0,
s3 = 1+(−1)+1 = 1,
s4 = 1+(−1)+1+(−1) = 0.
It should be clear at this point that the general pattern for all partial sums is

These partial sums do not approach a limiting value; rather, they continue to bounce back and forth between 1 and 0 forever. Thus, limN→∞ sN is undefined, and the series in (a) diverges.
Definition 10.1.1 was motivated by an analogy between series and integrals. To compute series (b), we continue this analogy by borrowing an idea from our study of integration: partial fractions. Factoring the denominator in series (b) leads us to set up the following partial fractions decomposition:

We leave it to you to solve for A and B in order to derive the equation

Substituting into our series, we see that the Nth partial sum of the series is

Notice that in the sum on the right-hand side above, the −1/6 in the first term cancels with the 1/6 in the second term, the −1/10 in the second term cancels with the 1/10 in the third term, and so on. The only numbers that don't cancel are the 1/2 in the first term and the −1/(4N +2) in the last term. Thus, we have

Sums that can be evaluated by recognizing patterns of cancellation like the one in this example are called telescoping sums. (You may recall that we saw an example of a telescoping sum in Section 5.1; see equation (5.5).)
Now that we have a formula for sN, we can evaluate series (b):

In the rest of this chapter, we will often find it useful to consider series of the form

A series of this form is called a geometric series. In such a series, each term after the first is r times the term before it. The number a is the first term in the series.
In fact, we have already seen three examples of geometric series in this section:
1.If a = 3/10 and r = 1/10, then series (10.2) takes the form

This is the example with which we started this section.
2.If a = r = 1/2, then the geometric series becomes

This is the next example we considered, the series in (10.1).
3. If a = 1 and r = −1, then we get

This is series (a) from Example 10.1.2.
To find the value of the geometric series (10.2), we need a formula for the Nth partial sum. There is a clever trick that leads to such a formula. First, we write out the terms in the Nth partial sum, sN. Next, we multiply this sum by −r and write this new sum beneath the first, shifting the terms over so that corresponding terms in the two sums match up. Finally, we add the two equations and note that most terms cancel out:

We conclude that sN −rsN = a −arN, or in other words sN (1−r) = a(1−r N). As long as r = 1, we can divide by 1 −r to get the formula

Using this formula, we can now find the value of any geometric series.
Theorem 10.1.3. Suppose a = 0.
1. If −1 < r < 1 then the geometric series  converges, and

2. If r ≤ −1 or r ≥ 1 then the geometric series  diverges.
Proof. For part 1, suppose that −1 < r < 1. We plan to use equation (10.3) to evaluate the geometric series, so we need to find limN→∞ r N. If r = 0, then 0 < |r | < 1, and by part 4 of Theorem 7.4.9, limN→∞ |r N| = limN→∞ |r |N = 0. It follows, by Theorem 2.4.11, that limN→∞ r N = 0. Of course, if r = 0 then limN→∞ r N = 0 as well. Thus, by equation (10.3),

Now we turn to the proof of part 2. If r > 1, then by part 3 of Theorem 7.4.9, limN→∞ r N =∞. Plugging into equation (10.3), we conclude that

with the sign depending on the sign of a. If r = 1, then equation (10.3) doesn't apply, but fortunately it is easy to find the value of sN:

We conclude that, once again, limN→∞ sN = ±∞, with the sign depending on the sign of a.
Next we consider the case r = −1. In this case,

Since we have assumed a = 0, this means that sN is bouncing back and forth between two different values, and as in part (a) of Example 10.1.2, limN→∞ sN is undefined and the series diverges.
Finally, suppose that r < −1. Then r = −p for some number p > 1, and

As before, we have limN→∞ pN =∞. This means that if N is a large integer, then the factor 1−(−1)N pN will be a large positive number if N is odd, and a large magnitude negative number if N is even. We conclude that as N →∞, the partial sums sN bounce back and forth between large magnitude positive and negative numbers, without approaching a limit. Thus, the geometric series diverges.
We can use Theorem 10.1.3 to evaluate the three geometric series that we saw earlier in this section. If a = 3/10 and r = 1/10, then by part 1 of the theorem,

Thus, the value of the decimal expansion 0.333 . . . is 1/3, as expected. In the case a = r = 1/2, we get

in agreement with our evaluation of series (10.1). And when a = 1 and r = −1, part 2 of Theorem 10.1.3 tells us that the series  diverges, as we found in part (a) of Example 10.1.2.
So far we have written all of our infinite series with the terms numbered by the variable n, and with the value of n starting at 1 and running through all the positive integers. But as with finite sums, the terms of an infinite series can be numbered by a different variable, and the value of the variable can start at a number other than 1. We extend Definition 10.1.1 to such series in the obvious way. For example, the geometric series (10.2) could also be written like this:

Since the list of numbers added up in (10.4) is exactly the same as in (10.2), we have  More precisely,

Many facts about finite sums carry over to infinite series. For example, the first two parts of the following theorem are based on Theorem 5.1.1.
Theorem 10.1.4. Let  be any two infinite series.
1.If  both converge, then so does  and

2.For any number c = 0, the series  and  either both converge or both diverge. If they converge, then

3.For any integer k ≥ 2, the series  and  either both converge or both diverge. If they converge, then

Proof. All three parts of the theorem can be proven by simply applying the definition of the value of an infinite series, Definition 10.1.1, together with facts about finite sums and limits. For example, to prove part 1, suppose that  and  both converge; say  and  This means that

Therefore

We leave the proofs of the other two parts as exercises for you (see Exercise 21).
Example 10.1.5. Evaluate the following series:

Solution. Like integrals, series are often easier to evaluate if they can be split up as sums, as in part 1 of Theorem 10.1.4. We therefore rewrite series (a) as follows:

Before we can apply Theorem 10.1.4 to write this as a sum of two simpler series, we must check that these simpler series converge. Fortunately, this is easy to verify, since they are both geometric series. To see this, and to identify the values of a and r for each series, we write them in the form of series (10.2).

Thus, the value of series (a) is

Series (b) is also a geometric series, but we must apply some exponent rules to see this. This time, we write it in the form of series (10.4).

10.2 Convergence Tests
Unfortunately, many infinite series are very hard to evaluate, because it is often difficult to find a formula for the Nth partial sum of a series. We therefore lower our sights, at least temporarily, and rather than trying to find the value of a given series, we will simply try to determine whether the series converges or diverges. To do this, we will develop a number of tests that can be used to establish convergence or divergence of a series.
There are several reasons for studying such tests. First of all, if we are able to establish that a series diverges, then there is no need to try to compute the value of the series; the series does not have a value. Secondly, if we determine that a series converges, then we know that the sequence (sN)∞N=1 of partial sums converges to the value of the series. Even if we are not able to find the exact value of the series, we can get an approximate answer by computing sN for some large integer N. In many cases we will be able to determine the degree of accuracy of the approximation, and an approximate answer that achieves some desired degree of accuracy may be all that we need in some situations. Finally, sometimes showing that a series converges is the first step in finding its exact value. (We have already seen similar reasoning in some previous examples, such as Examples 2.9.6 and 2.9.7.) In several cases in this chapter we will show that a series converges, and then later, once we have developed more advanced techniques, we will use the fact that the series converges to find its exact value.
Our first convergence test is based on the following fact about convergent series.
Theorem 10.2.1. If  converges, then limn→∞ an = 0.
Proof. Suppose that  converges; say  Then limN→∞ sN = L, where as usual, sN is the Nth partial sum of the series:

To complete the proof, we must compute limn→∞ an. To do this, we express an in terms of partial sums:
an = (a1 +a2 + · · ·+an)−(a1 +a2 + · · ·+an−1) = sn −sn−1.
Taking the limit as n →∞, we get

As an immediate consequence of this theorem, we get the following convergence test:
Corollary 10.2.2 (Test for Divergence). If it is not the case that limn→∞ an = 0, then  diverges.
Proof. Assume that limn→∞ an is not equal to 0. If  converges then, by Theorem 10.2.1, limn→∞ an = 0, contrary to our assumption. Therefore it cannot be the case that  converges, so it must diverge.
For example, consider the series

Since

the test for divergence tells us that series (10.5) diverges. Notice that we were able to reach this conclusion without having to find a formula for the Nth partial sum of the series.
It is important to recognize that the test for divergence does not say that if limn→∞ an = 0, then  converges. In fact, if limn→∞ an = 0 then  may converge and it may diverge. We will see many examples of both of these possibilities in the rest of this chapter. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we will need more convergence tests.
It turns out that it is much easier to tell whether or not a series converges if all of the terms of the series are nonnegative. The reason is that if all of the terms are nonnegative, then as we add more and more terms of the series, the sum can only increase. This means that the sequence of partial sums will be weakly increasing.
Let's work this out more carefully. Consider a series  and suppose that for every n, an ≥ 0. Let (sN)∞N=1 be the sequence of partial sums of the series. Then for every positive integer N, we have
sN+1 = a1 +a2 + · · ·+aN +aN+1 = sN +aN+1 ≥ sN,
since aN+1 ≥ 0. Therefore the sequence (sN)∞N=1 is weakly increasing. To test the series for convergence, we must determine whether or not this weakly increasing sequence converges.
Now, recall what we learned about weakly increasing sequences in Section 2.9. According to Theorem 2.9.5, if the set of partial sums has an upper bound, then the sequence (sN)∞N=1 converges, and if not then limN→∞ sN =∞. Thus, to determine whether or not the sequence of partial sums converges, we can try to find an upper bound for the partial sums. We will do this by trying to overestimate sN, which is often much easier than finding the exact value. If we are able to find an upper bound for the partial sums, then limn→∞ sN exists—in fact, it is equal to the least upper bound—and therefore the series  converges. If we can show that there is no upper bound, then we can conclude that limN→∞ sN =∞, and therefore  diverges.
One way to overestimate a partial sumsN is with an integral. As we know, integrals are closely related to sums, but they are often easier to compute. This idea leads to our next convergence test.
Theorem 10.2.3 (Integral Test). Consider a series  whose terms are given by a formula an = f (n), for some function f. Suppose that f is continuous and weakly decreasing on [1,∞), and for all x ≥ 1, f (x) ≥ 0.
1. converges, then  converges.
2. then  
Proof. The fact that f (x) ≥ 0 for all x ≥ 1 implies that for every positive integer n, an ≥ 0. As we have observed, it follows that the sequence  of partial sums of the series is weakly increasing, and therefore we can discover whether or not the series converges by determining whether or not the partial sums have an upper bound.
To prove part 1, suppose that  converges. This means that we can let  Figure 10.1a shows a Riemann sum approximation for  where N is some positive integer. All of the striped rectangles have width 1. The height of the first rectangle is f (2) = a2, and therefore its area is a2 · 1 = a2. Similarly, the next rectangle has height and area f (3) = a3, the next has height and area a4, and so on. Since f is weakly decreasing, if 1 ≤ x ≤ 2 then f (x) ≥ f (2), which means that the top of the first rectangle stays below the curve y = f (x). Similarly, the tops of all of the other rectangles stay below the curve y = f (x), and therefore the sum of the areas of the rectangles, which is a Riemann sum for f on the interval [1, N], is less than or equal to the integral. In other words,

Adding a1 to both sides of this inequality, we get

Thus, using an integral we have found an overestimate of sN.
But this overestimate is not yet an upper bound for the partial sums, because the right-hand side of (10.6) depends on N. To turn the overestimate into an upper bound, we need an upper bound for  This is where we make use of the fact that  converges. By Theorem 8.7.5 we have

Since f (x) ≥ 0 for all x ≥ 1, it is clear that  Therefore

and combining this with (10.6), we see that for every positive integer N,

In other words, a1 + L is an upper bound for the set of partial sums of the series, and therefore the series converges.
Now we turn to the proof of part 2. Suppose that  This time we will use the Riemann sum approximation illustrated in Figure 10.1b. The area of the first striped rectangle in Figure 10.1b is a1, the area of the next is a2, and so on. Since the tops of the rectangle are now above the curve y = f (x), we see that

In other words,  is an underestimate of sN. By our assumption,

 
Figure 10.1: Using  to estimate partial sums.
so (10.7) implies that

Example 10.2.4. Determine whether the following series converge or diverge:

Solution. For series (a), let f (x) = 1/x. Clearly f is continuous and weakly decreasing on [1,∞), and f (x) ≥ 0 for all x ≥ 1. We can therefore apply the integral test. Since

part 2 of Theorem 10.2.3 tells us that series (a) diverges.
Similarly, for series (b) we apply the integral test with f (x) = 1/x2. This time we find that

so by part 1 of Theorem 10.2.3, series (b) converges.
Notice that limn→∞ 1/n = limn→∞ 1/n2 = 0. Thus, the terms of both of the series in Example 10.2.4 approach 0 as n →∞, but one series converges and the other diverges. This illustrates our earlier statement that if limn→∞ an = 0, then  may converge and it may diverge.
Let's see if we can generalize Example 10.2.4. Both of the series in the example have the form  in series (a), we have p = 1, while p = 2 in series (b). Series of this form are sometimes called p-series. Recall that in Section 8.7 we studied improper integrals of the form  and we found that this integral converges if p > 1 and diverges if p ≤ 1. Applying the integral test, we get an analogous result for p-series.
Theorem 10.2.5 (p-Series Test). Let p be any real number.
1.If p > 1, then  converges.
2.If p ≤ 1, then  
Proof. For x ≥ 1, let f (x) = 1/xp ≥ 0. As long as p ≥ 0, f′(x)= −px−p−1 ≤ 0, and therefore f is continuous and weakly decreasing on [1,∞). Thus, we can apply the integral test. According to Theorem 8.7.2,  converges if p > 1 and  if p ≤ 1, and by the integral test we get the same conclusions for  
If p < 0, then f is strictly increasing on [1,∞), so we cannot use the integral test. But in this case it is easy to see that for every positive integer n, 1/np ≥ 1, and therefore for every positive integer N,

Thus,

In the p-series test, the case p = 1 is particularly important, because it is the borderline between convergent and divergent p-series; the series  diverges if p = 1, but converges if, for example, p = 1.01, or p = 1.001. You might say that the p-series with p = 1 diverges, but just barely. This series is called the harmonic series. In other words, the harmonic series is the series

The partial sums of the harmonic series are called the harmonic numbers, and are denoted HN. Thus, for any positive integer N,

The sequence of harmonic numbers approaches ∞, but very slowly. For example, H100 ≈ 5.187, H1000 ≈ 7.485, and H10000 ≈ 9.788. For more on the harmonic numbers, see Exercise 24.
Example 10.2.6. Determine whether the following series converge or diverge:

Solution. Series (a) is a p-series:

Since p = 4/3 > 1, the series converges by the p-series test.
For series (b), we would like to apply the integral test, using the function f (x) = 1/(x ln x). But notice that the values of n in the series start at n = 2 rather than n = 1—in fact, the series could not start at n = 1, since f (1) is undefined. So we cannot apply the integral test exactly as written in Theorem 10.2.3. However, you can easily check that in the proof of the integral test, the number 1, which was both the beginning value for n in the series and also the lower limit of the improper integral, could be replaced by any integer. Thus, although we stated the integral test for series whose terms start at n = 1, the test actually works for series in which n starts at any integer. Indeed, all of our theorems about series can be generalized in this way.
It is easy to see that f is continuous and weakly decreasing on [2,∞), and for all x ≥ 2, f (x) ≥ 0. Therefore the integral test applies. To evaluate the improper integral, we use the substitution u = ln x, du = (1/x) dx:

Thus, by the integral test, series (b) diverges.
Finally, for series (c), we try the integral test with
 
Unfortunately, the hypotheses of the integral test are not satisfied. Although f is continuous on [1,∞), we have f (x) ≥ 0 only for x ≥ e ≈ 2.718. To see if f is increasing or decreasing, we compute
 
Thus, f′(x) = 0 when ln x = 7/4, or x = e7/4 ≈ 5.755. Checking the sign of f′(x) on either side of this critical number, we find that f is strictly increasing on [1, e7/4] and strictly decreasing on [e7/4,∞). Thus, we cannot apply the integral test directly to series (c). But f is weakly decreasing on [6,∞), and f (x) ≥ 0 for x ≥ 6, so we can apply the integral test to the series
 
and according to part 3 of Theorem 10.1.4, this series converges if and only if series (c) converges.
To evaluate the required improper integral, we first evaluate the indefinite integral using integration by parts, with u = ln x −1, dv = x−4/3 dx, du = x−1 dx, and v = −3x−1/3:
 
Thus,
 
Note that we have used Theorem 7.6.2 to see that  Since  converges, we conclude by the integral test that series (10.8) converges, and by part 3 of Theorem 10.1.4, series (c) converges as well.
Although the integral test can be useful for showing that a series converges, it does not tell us what the series converges to. In particular, although part 1 of Theorem 10.2.3 says that we can show that a series converges by computing an improper integral, it does not say that the value of the series is the same as the value of the improper integral. So how can we compute the value of the series?
We can get an approximate answer by computing a partial sum. Suppose that we have determined that a series  converges. If we let s denote the exact value of the series and sN the Nth partial sum, then for large integers N, s ≈ sN. How good is this approximation? As in our study of numerical integration, we define the error of the approximation to be the difference between the exact value and the approximation. Since
 
the error is
 
The sum on the right-hand side above is called the Nth tail of the series; it consists of all terms of the series that are missing from the Nth partial sum. We will denote the Nth tail by tN:
 
Using this notation, what we have shown is that s −sN = tN, and this suggests that one way to try to determine the accuracy of the approximation s ≈ sN is to study tN.
For example, in part (b) of Example 10.2.4 we showed that  converges.
If we let s denote the value of this series, then we can approximate s by computing a partial sum. Using a computer to do the arithmetic, we find that the 100th partial sum is
 
This gives us an approximate value for s, and the error in the approximation is given by the 100th tail of the series:
 
To determine the accuracy of the approximation, we now examine t100.
All the terms in the series are positive, so it is clear that t100 ≥ 0. We can use the idea behind the proof of the integral test to overestimate t100. In Figure 10.2, the area of the blue region is  and the areas of the striped rectangles are 1/1012, 1/1022, and so on. Since the rectangles are all contained in the blue region, we see that
 
(For a more careful justification of the inequality in this calculation, see Exercise 20.) Since s −s100 = t100, we conclude that 0 ≤ s −s100 ≤ 0.01, and therefore
s100 ≤ s ≤ s100 +0.01.
In other words, the exact value of the series is between about 1.63498 and 1.64498. Of course, we can get greater accuracy by computing sN for larger N. (For more on using partial sums to approximate this series, see Exercise 25.)
 
Figure 10.2: Estimating  
Finding the exact value of this series is far more difficult. The problem of finding the exact value of  was first proposed by Pietro Mengoli (1626-1686) in 1644, and the problem remained unsolved for almost a century, despite the efforts of many of the best mathematicians of the time. In 1689, Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705) mentioned the problem in his Tractatus de Seriebus Infinitis, which was published in Basel, Switzerland, and as a result the problem came to be known as the Basel problem. The problem was finally solved in 1735, when Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) showed that the answer is π2/6, whose decimal value is about 1.64493. For two proofs of this result, see Exercises 26 and 27.

10.3 The Comparison and Limit Comparison Tests
In the last section, we found that we can sometimes determine whether or not a series converges by comparing the series to an improper integral. In this section, we show that we can get similar results by comparing a series to another series. When we first stated the integral test in the last section, we assumed that the numbering of the terms in our series started with 1, but later we realized that we could generalize to series in which the term numbers started at some other integer. This time we state our results in the more general form from the start. Our main result in this section is the following convergence test.
Theorem 10.3.1 (Comparison Test). Suppose that  and  are two infinite series, and for all integers n ≥ k,
0 ≤ an ≤ bn.
1.If  converges, then  converges.
2.If  diverges, then  diverges.
Proof. To prove part 1, suppose that  As we saw in the last section, since we have an ≥ 0 for all n ≥ k, the partial sums of the series  are weakly increasing, and therefore we can show that the series converges by finding an upper bound for the partial sums. But this is easy to do, because for every N ≥ k,
 
Thus, L is an upper bound for the partial sums, and therefore the series  converges.
Part 2 follows immediately from part 1: if  diverges, then  must diverge as well, because if it converged, then by part 1,  would converge, contrary to our assumption.
Notice that in the proof of part 1 we showed that for every N ≥ k,   By the preservation of weak inequalities by limits, it follows that
 
We can also say more about the series in part 2 of the theorem. The only way that a weakly increasing sequence of partial sums can fail to converge is if the partial sums approach∞. It follows that in part 2 we must have  
Intuitively, you could think of the comparison test as saying that a series with nonnegative terms will converge if the terms are "small enough," and diverge if the terms are "too large." In part 1, the terms of the series  are small enough for the series to converge, and the terms of the series  are even smaller, so they must
also be small enough for the series to converge. In part 2, the terms of  are too large for the series to converge, and the terms of  are even larger, so they are also too large for convergence.
Example 10.3.2. Determine whether the following series converge or diverge:
 
Solution. You could test series (a) for convergence by using the integral test, but it is easier to recognize that it is similar to the p-series  which we already know converges. Before we can use the comparison test, we must work out the necessary inequalities. Clearly for every positive integer n we have n2 +1 ≥ n2 > 0, and therefore
 
We can now apply part 1 of the comparison test, with an = 1/(n2 +1) and bn = 1/n2, to conclude that series (a) converges.
Series (b) consists of the odd-numbered terms of the harmonic series:
 
This time we compare to the series
 
which is 1/2 times the familiar harmonic series. We know that the harmonic series diverges, and by part 2 of Theorem 10.1.4, multiplying the terms by 1/2 does not change this. Thus, series (10.9) diverges. For n ≥ 1 it is clear that 2n ≥ 2n −1 > 0, and therefore
 
so by part 2 of the comparison test, series (b) diverges.
What makes series (c) hard to analyze is that the quantity 3 +sin n fluctuates as n increases. But we know that sin n is always between −1 and 1, so for every positive integer n, 2 ≤ 3 +sin n ≤ 4 and therefore
 
The series  and  are geometric series, with r = 1/4 in the first case and r = 1/2 in the second. In both cases we have −1 < r < 1, so both series converge. But which one should we compare series (c) to? Looking back at the statement of the comparison test, we see that if we let an = 1/(3+sin n)n and bn = 1/2n then we can use part 1 of the test to conclude that series (c) converges.
Finally, we also compare series (d) to the convergent geometric series  For every n ≥ 1 we have  and
 
By part 1 of the comparison test, series (d) converges.
As with the integral test, we can use the idea behind the comparison test to estimate the tail of a convergent series. For example, let s be the exact value of series (d) in the last example:
 
The terms of this series shrink very quickly, and as a result one doesn't need to add very many terms to get a good approximation of s. For example, the third partial sum of the series is
 
The error in the approximation s ≈ s3 is given by the third tail of the series:
 
To overestimate t3, we note that for n ≥ 4, n2 ≥ 4n, which implies that  ≤ 1/24n. We can therefore compare t3 to the series  As we observed after the proof of the comparison test, the proof shows that
 
But the last series above is a geometric series, so we can evaluate it easily:
 
Clearly t3 ≥ 0, so we have 0 ≤ t3 ≤ 1/61440. Since s −s3 = t3, this means that 0 ≤ s −s3 ≤ 1/61440, so
 
In other words, the value of the series is between about 0.564453 and 0.564469. We don't know the exact value of the series, but just by adding the first three terms we have found a very good approximation.
It is important to check the necessary inequalities before applying the comparison test; if the inequalities go in the wrong direction, then the test cannot be used. For example, consider the series
 
A natural idea is to compare this series to the p-series
 
Since p = 1/2 < 1, series (10.11) diverges. But  so
 
and that means that the comparison test won't help us. The comparison test only applies if either the series with larger terms converges (part 1) or the series with smaller terms diverges (part 2). But in this case, the series with larger terms diverges, and the comparison test has nothing to say about that situation. A good way to think about it is that the terms of series (10.11) are too large for the series to converge, but the terms of series (10.10) are smaller. Maybe they are so much smaller that the series converges; without further analysis, we can't be sure.
It is possible to use the comparison test to determine whether or not the series (10.10) converges—see Exercise 29. But it is probably easier to use the following variant of the comparison test.
Theorem 10.3.3 (Limit Comparison Test). Suppose that  and  are two infinite series, and for all integers n ≥ k, an > 0 and bn > 0. Suppose also that limn→∞ an/bn is defined, and limn→∞ an/bn > 0. Then the series  and  either both converge or both diverge.
The idea behind the proof of the limit comparison test is very simple. Suppose that limn→∞ an/bn = L > 0. Then for large integers n, an/bn ≈ L, and therefore an ≈ L · bn. According to part 2 of Theorem 10.1.4, multiplying the terms of a series by a nonzero constant does not affect the convergence or divergence of the series. Therefore it seems reasonable that  and  should either both converge or both diverge.
Turning this idea into a proof requires that we work out the approximation an ≈ L · bn more carefully. Here are the details.
Proof. Let L = limn→∞ an/bn > 0. We now apply the definition of sequence limits. Let ϵ = L/2 > 0. Then by the limit definition, there must be some integer N ≥ k such that if n is an integer and n > N, then |an/bn − L| < ϵ. In other words, for every integer n > N, an/bn is between L −ϵ = L − L/2 = L/2 and L +ϵ = L + L/2 = 3L/2, and therefore
 
Suppose now that  converges. Then by Theorem 10.1.4, converges. By inequality (10.12), we can now apply the comparison test to conclude that  converges, and therefore  converges.
Similarly, if  diverges, then  diverges. By inequality (10.12) and the comparison test, diverges, and therefore  diverges.
Let's return now to the comparison of the series  and  We were unable to apply the comparison test to these series, so let's try the limit comparison test. We begin by computing
 
Since this limit is defined and positive, the limit comparison test tells us that the two series either both converge or both diverge. Since  is a divergent p-series, we conclude that  diverges as well.
Example 10.3.4. Determine whether the following series converge or diverge:
 
Solution. In series (a), the term −n in the denominator seems less important than the term n2, so we try comparing the series to the simpler series
 
This is a p-series with p = 3/2 > 1, so it converges. Unfortunately, the terms of series (a) are larger, so the comparison test doesn't apply. We try the limit comparison test instead. Since
 
the limit comparison test tells us that series (a) converges.
In series (b), when n is large, the exponent 1+1/n in the denominator is just slightly larger than 1. This means that the terms of the series are slightly smaller than the terms of the harmonic series. The harmonic series diverges, but just barely. Are the terms of series (b) enough smaller to make the series converge? The limit comparison test gives us the answer. We have
 
Since the harmonic series diverges, by the limit comparison test, series (b) diverges as well.

Show that this series converges. (This shows that decimal notation always succeeds in specifying a number.)
10.4 The Ratio and Root Tests
If a series  is geometric, then each term after the first is some fixed number r times the previous term. In other words, for every positive integer n, an+1/an = r.
Now consider a series  in which the ratios an+1/an are close to some number L, but not exactly equal to it. It is reasonable to think that such a series might be comparable to a geometric series with a ratio r that is close to L. That is the motivation for our next convergence test.
Theorem 10.4.1 (Ratio Test). Suppose  an is an infinite series, and for all n ≥ k, an > 0. Suppose also that either limn→∞ an+1/an is defined or limn→∞ an+1/an =∞, and let L = limn→∞ an+1/an. (Thus, either L is a number or L =∞.)
1.If L < 1, then  converges.
2.If L > 1 (including the case L =∞), then  diverges.
Proof. Since the terms of the series are all positive, it is clear that L ≥ 0. To prove part 1, suppose that L < 1. Let r be any number such that L < r < 1. Then by the sequence version of Theorem 2.8.8, there must be some integer N ≥ k such that for every integer n ≥ N, an+1/an ≤ r, and therefore an+1 ≤ anr. Since this is true for every integer n ≥ N, we have
aN+1 ≤ aNr,
aN+2 ≤ aN+1r ≤ (aNr)r = aNr 2,
aN+3 ≤ aN+2r ≤ (aNr 2)r = aNr 3,
and in general, for every n ≥ N,
0 ≤ an ≤ aNr n−N.
We can now apply the comparison test to the series
 
The second series above is a geometric series, with 0 < r < 1, so it converges. It follows, by the comparison test, that  converges, and therefore  converges.
The proof of part 2 is similar. If L > 1, then we can choose r such that L > r > 1, and then we can find an integer N ≥ k such that for every integer n ≥ N, an ≥ aNr n−N . Since aN > 0 and r > 1, limn→∞ aNr n−N =∞, and therefore limn→∞ an =∞. It follows, by the test for divergence, that  diverges.
Note that if L = 1, then the ratio test doesn't tell us anything. The reason for this is clear from the proof: In the proof, we compared the ratio an+1/an to numbers that were close to L, but not equal to L. We needed some "wiggle room" between L and 1 to be able to make appropriate comparisons, so the idea of the proof wouldn't work if L = 1. In fact, if L = 1 then the series may converge and it may diverge; see Exercise 17.
The ratio test works best when the ratio an+1/an can be simplified easily. For example, the ratio test is often useful when the formula for an involves exponential functions or factorials.
Example 10.4.2. Determine whether the following series converge or diverge:
 
Solution. In series (a), the nth term is an = 2n/n!. Since the formula for an involves both 2n and n!, the ratio test seems like a good bet. When computing the limit of an+1/an, it is often helpful to group together corresponding parts of the formulas for an and an+1. In this case, we group together the exponential terms and the factorial terms before simplifying:
 
By part 1 of the ratio test, series (a) converges.
Similarly, for series (b) we compute
 
Once again, we conclude that the series converges.
The computation for series (c) is a bit more difficult:
 
Note that in the final step we have used limit (c) from Example 7.6.3. Since e ≈ 2.718 > 1, part 2 of the ratio test tells us that series (c) diverges.
As usual, finding the exact values of the convergent series in Example 10.4.2 is much harder than showing that they converge, but we can get approximate answers by computing partial sums. For series (a), using a computer for the arithmetic, we find that
 
If we let s denote the exact value, then the error in the approximation s ≈ s10 is the tail
 
In Exercise 18 we ask you to show, by comparing this tail to a geometric series, that 0 ≤ t10 ≤ 0.000062. Thus, the exact value of the series is between about 7.388995 and 7.389057. Is it just a coincidence that e2 ≈ 7.389056? No, it turns out that the exact value of the series is e2, but you'll have to wait until Section 10.8 to find out why.
Series (b) in Example 10.4.2 converges a little more slowly, but the 20th partial sum turns out to be a very good approximation:
 
This time, the easiest way to estimate the error is to compare the tail to an improper integral. In Exercise 19, we ask you to show that 0 ≤ t20 ≤ 0.00064, so the value of series (b) is between about 5.99954 and 6.00018. You can probably guess that the exact value is 6, but again we're not ready yet to explain why.
Sometimes it is useful to combine the ratio test with other tests. For example, consider the series
 
The presence of n! in the denominator suggests that the ratio test might be helpful, but the −7 in the denominator will interfere with the cancellation that would allow us to simplify an+1/an. Furthermore, the hypotheses of the ratio test are not satisfied: the terms of this series are negative for n ≤ 3, but the ratio test requires positive terms.
We therefore proceed as follows. First, we drop the first three terms and study the series
 
that takes care of the problem of negative terms. If we can determine whether or not series (10.14) converges, then the answer will be the same for series (10.13). Next, we compare series (10.14) to the similar but simpler series
 
For this last series, the ratio test works well:
 
Since L < 1, by the ratio test, series (10.15) converges.
Unfortunately, the terms of series (10.14) are larger, so the comparison test doesn't apply. We therefore try the limit comparison test, which requires that we compute the limit
 
Since L > 0, we can conclude by the limit comparison test that series (10.14) converges, and therefore (10.13) converges as well.
The intuition behind the ratio test is that it allows us to tell if a series is comparable to a geometric series. Another convergence test that is based on a similar intuitive idea is the root test.
Theorem 10.4.3 (Root Test). Suppose  is an infinite series, and for all n ≥ k, an ≥ 0. Suppose also that either  is defined or  and let  
1.If L < 1, then  converges.
2.If L > 1 (including the case L =∞), then  an diverges.
Proof. The proof is similar to the proof of the ratio test. For part 1, suppose that L < 1. Choose a number r such that L < r < 1, and then choose an integer N ≥ k such that if n is an integer and n ≥ N, then  Then for every integer n ≥ N,
0 ≤ an ≤ r n.
Since 0 < r < 1, the geometric series  converges. By the comparison test,  converges, and therefore  converges.
If L > 1, then we choose r such that L > r > 1, and we choose an integer N ≥ k such that for every integer n ≥ N, an ≥ r n. Since r > 1, limn→∞r n =∞. Therefore limn→∞ an =∞, so  diverges by the test for divergence.
Example 10.4.4. Determine whether the following series converge or diverge:
 
Solution. In series (a), it is easy to compute the nth root of the nth term, so we use the root test. We begin by computing
 
By part 2 of the root test, we conclude that series (a) diverges. You can reach this same conclusion by using the ratio test, but the calculations are much harder; see Exercise 20.
Series (b) looks similar to the geometric series  so it seems reasonable to try using either the ratio test or the root test. It turns out that the ratio test doesn't work for this series—see Exercise 21. But the root test does work:
 
so by part 1 of the root test, series (b) converges.
It is interesting to compare series (b) in the last example to the geometric series  
 
The terms in the two series are the same, but they appear in different orders. We say that one series is a rearrangement of the other. Notice that since the orders of the terms in the two series are different, the partial sums are also different. Are the values of the series the same? See part (b) of Exercise 21. We will have more to say about rearrangements in the next section.

10.5 Absolute Convergence and the Alternating Series Test
So far, almost all of our convergence tests have applied only to series whose terms are nonnegative. How can we test a series for convergence if some of its terms are negative? Often, the best thing to try first is our next theorem.
Theorem 10.5.1 (Absolute Convergence Test). If  converges, then  converges.
Proof. We will use the fact that for every integer n ≥ k, −|an| ≤ an ≤ |an|, and therefore
0 ≤ an +|an|≤ 2|an|.
Suppose that  converges. Then  converges, and by the comparison test it follows that  converges. To show that  converges, we rewrite it in the form
 
We have just shown that  converges, and by part 2 of Theorem 10.1.4,  converges, so by part 1 of the same theorem, converges.
 converges, then we say that  converges absolutely. In this terminology, what Theorem 10.5.1 says is that if a series converges absolutely, then it converges. What makes this fact useful is that the terms of the series  are nonnegative, and therefore we can apply the convergence tests we have developed over the last few sections to it.
Example 10.5.2. Determine whether the following series converge or diverge:
 
Solution. We have
 
which converges, since it is a p-series with p = 2 > 1. Therefore series (a) converges absolutely, so it converges. For the value of the series, see Exercise 18.
For series (b), we use the fact that for every positive integer n, −1 ≤ sin n ≤ 1, and therefore
 
Since  is a convergent geometric series, converges by the comparison test, so series (b) converges by the absolute convergence test.
Finally, for series (c), we test
 
for convergence by using the ratio test. We begin by computing
 
By part 2 of the ratio test, we conclude that series (10.16) diverges. But what about the original series (c)? The absolute convergence test says that if (10.16) converges, then (c) converges; but it doesn't say that if (10.16) diverges, then (c) diverges.
Nevertheless, we can use the calculations we have done to complete this example. To see how, look back at the proof of the ratio test. The proof of part 2 of the test showed that if limn→∞ an+1/an > 1, then limn→∞ an =∞. In this case, since we computed that L =∞> 1, we can conclude that limn→∞(2n)!/(2nn!)=∞. But then
 
is undefined, because the terms oscillate between large magnitude positive and negative numbers. We conclude, by the test for divergence, that series (c) diverges.
The reasoning we used in part (c) of the last example can be applied whenever we use the ratio test to show that a series does not converge absolutely, and similar reasoning works for the root test as well. These facts are important enough that we record them as new versions of the ratio and root tests.
Theorem 10.5.3 (Ratio Test for Absolute Convergence). Suppose  is an infinite series, and for all n ≥ k, an = 0. Suppose also that either limn→∞ |an+1|/|an| is defined or limn→∞ |an+1|/|an| =∞, and let L = limn→∞ |an+1|/an|.
1.If L < 1, then  converges absolutely.
2.If L > 1, then  diverges.
Theorem 10.5.4 (Root Test for Absolute Convergence). Suppose  is an infinite series. Suppose also that either  is defined or  and let  
1.If L < 1, then  converges absolutely.
2.If L > 1, then  diverges.
Proofs. The first parts of both theorems follow immediately from the original ratio and root tests: if L < 1 in either theorem, then  converges, which means that  converges absolutely.
If L > 1 in either theorem, then the proofs of the original ratio and root tests show that limn→∞ |an| = ∞. It follows that limn→∞ an cannot be 0, so  diverges by the test for divergence. This proves part 2 of both theorems.
Unfortunately, our other convergence tests do not have similar versions for absolute convergence. Furthermore, it is not true in general that if  diverges, then  diverges. For example, consider the series
 
This series is called the alternating harmonic series, because the terms are the same as those of the harmonic series, except that they alternate positive and negative. Of course, if we take the absolute values of the terms of series (10.17) then we get the harmonic series, which diverges, so the alternating harmonic series does not converge absolutely. But it turns out that it does converge.
To see why, let's look at the first few partial sums of the alternating harmonic series:
 
If we mark these partial sums on a number line, as in Figure 10.3, then we see that they jump back and forth, with the jumps getting smaller and smaller. In the figure, it looks plausible that the partial sums are zeroing in on a limiting value somewhere between s6 ≈ 0.617 and s5 ≈ 0.783.
To confirm that the alternating harmonic series converges, we pick out the crucial properties of the series that are responsible for the behavior of the partial sums that we see in Figure 10.3, and use them to formulate another convergence test.
Theorem 10.5.5 (Alternating Series Test). Suppose  is a series whose terms alternate positive and negative. Suppose also that |ak|≥ |ak+1| ≥ |ak+2| ≥ · · · and limn→∞ |an| = 0. Then  converges.
Proof. For each integer n ≥ k, let bn = |an|. Then the hypotheses of the theorem tell us that bk ≥ bk+1 ≥ bk+2 ≥ · · · and limn→∞ bn = 0. We will assume that the series starts with a positive term; the proof for a series that starts with a negative term is similar. Since the terms alternate positive and negative, this means that ak = bk, ak+1 = −bk+1, ak+2 = bk+2, and so on. Thus, the series is
 
For N ≥ k, let  the Nth partial sum. The key idea in the proof is to determine the order of these partial sums. Since 0 ≤ bk+2 ≤ bk+1,
bk −bk+1 ≤ bk −bk+1 +bk+2 ≤ bk −bk+1 +bk+1 = bk;
in other words,
sk+1 ≤ sk+2 ≤ sk.
Similar reasoning shows that every partial sum is between the previous two partial sums. This means that sk+1 ≤ sk+3 ≤ sk+2, sk+3 ≤ sk+4 ≤ sk+2, and so on. Therefore the partial sums are ordered as follows:
 
This ordering matches the way the partial sums are arranged in Figure 10.3.
Another way to describe the ordering (10.18) is to say that the intervals [sk+1, sk], [sk+3, sk+2], [sk+5, sk+4], ... form a nested sequence of intervals. The widths of the intervals are
sk −sk+1 = bk −(bk −bk+1) = bk+1,
sk+2 −sk+3 = (bk −bk+1 + bk+2)−(bk −bk+1 + bk+2 −bk+3) = bk+3,
sk+4 −sk+5 = (bk −bk+1 + · · · + bk+4)−(bk −bk+1 + · · ·+bk+4 −bk+5) = bk+5,
and so on. Since limn→∞ bn = 0, the widths of the intervals approach 0, and therefore we can apply the nested interval theorem (Theorem 2.8.7) to conclude that there is a unique number s that belongs to all of the intervals. This means that
 
Furthermore, both the left and right endpoints of the nested intervals approach s, which implies that limN→∞ sN = s. In other words, the series  converges to s.
 
Figure 10.3: The first six partial sums of the alternating harmonic series.
A useful observation from the proof of the alternating series test is that according to (10.19), the value s of the series is between any two successive partial sums. It follows that, in the notation of the proof, for any N ≥ k,
|s −sN| ≤ |sN+1 −sN| = |(ak + · · ·+aN +aN+1)−(ak + · · ·+aN)|
= |aN+1| = bN+1.
In other words, the magnitude of the error in the approximation s ≈ sN is at most the absolute value of the first term missing from the partial sum sN . Keep in mind that these conclusions are based on the proof of the alternating series test, and therefore they apply only to series that satisfy the hypotheses of that test.
Returning to the alternating harmonic series (10.17), we have an = (−1)n−1/n, and therefore bn = |an| = 1/n. Clearly 1 ≥ 1/2 ≥ 1/3 ≥ · · · and limn→∞ 1/n = 0, so the alternating series test tells us that the series converges. Furthermore, if we want to approximate the value s of the series with error at most, say, 1/200 = 0.005, then it will suffice to compute the 199th partial sum s199, since the magnitude of the error in this approximation will be at most the absolute value of the first missing term:
 
Computation leads to the values
s199 ≈ 0.6957, s200 ≈ 0.6907.
The value of the series must be between these two partial sums. You may recall that in Section 7.3 we found that ln 2 ≈ 0.693. It turns out that this is the exact value of the alternating harmonic series. One proof of this can be found in Exercise 19, but we will give a more satisfying explanation in Section 10.7.
A series that converges, but does not converge absolutely, is said to converge conditionally. The alternating harmonic series is our first example of a series that converges conditionally. Let's try a more challenging example. Consider the series
 
As in the proof of the alternating series test, we will use the notation
 
To see if series (10.20) converges absolutely, we must determine whether or not the series
 
converges. A natural test to try is the ratio test. Unfortunately, we find that
 
and therefore
 
Thus, the ratio test is inconclusive; we'll need to try something else.
We leave it as an exercise for you (see Exercise 23) to check that for all n ≥ 1,
 
The series
 
is 1/2 times a p-series with p = 1/2 < 1, so it diverges. Therefore, by (10.23) and the comparison test, series (10.21) diverges, which means that series (10.20) does not converge absolutely.
However, (10.20) does satisfy the hypotheses of the alternating series test: Clearly the terms alternate positive and negative. According to (10.22), for every n,
 
so bn+1 ≤ bn. And (10.23) implies that limn→∞ bn = 0. Therefore the series converges conditionally. As usual, if we let s denote the value of the series, then we can approximate s by computing partial sums. For this series we have
s199 ≈ 0.687, s200 ≈ 0.727,
so s must be between these two numbers. It turns out that the exact value of series (10.20) is  but, yet again, we will have to ask you to wait to find out why.
If a series converges, why should we care whether the convergence is absolute or conditional? We give one example to illustrate the importance of this distinction. Recall that we say that one series is a rearrangement of another if the two series consist of the same terms, but added up in a different order. We saw one example of a rearrangement at the end of the last section. Here is another example: Let  be the series
 
This series is a rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series; the terms of both series consist of all numbers of the form (−1)n−1/n. In the alternating harmonic series, the terms alternate positive and negative, whereas in series (10.24), we have two positive terms, then one negative, then two positive, then one negative, and so on. Surprisingly, in this case changing the order of the terms changes the value of the series! The value of the alternating harmonic series is ln 2 ≈ 0.693, but computation shows that the 100th partial sum of series (10.24) is about 1.03971. It turns out that the value of the series is (3/2) ln 2 ≈ 1.03972; for a proof, see Exercise 21.
How can changing the order of the terms change the value of a series? The value of a series is, by definition, the limit of its partial sums, and changing the order of the terms certainly changes the partial sums. But that's only because partial sums are partial: which terms are included in any partial sum depends on the order of the terms. Shouldn't the effect of these changes disappear when we take the limit of the partial sums, which takes all of the terms into account? The answer, it turns out, is that it depends on whether the series converges absolutely or conditionally.
Theorem 10.5.6.
1.If a series converges absolutely, then all rearrangements of the series converge to the same value.
2.If a series converges conditionally, then for every real number c there is a rearrangement of the series that converges to c.
Part 2 of the theorem is sometimes called the Riemann rearrangement theorem. For proofs of both parts, see Exercises 24 and 25.

10.6 Power Series
We have now developed methods that allow us to tell in many cases whether or not a series converges. But often, after showing that a series converges, we have been unable to find the exact value of the series. For example, here are four series whose convergence we have verified in the last few sections:
 
The first two are series (a) and (b) from Example 10.4.2, and the third and fourth are series (10.17) and (10.20) from Section 10.5. We have told you that the values of these series are, respectively, e2, 6, ln 2, and  but we have not yet explained why these values are correct.
To give these explanations, we will turn to an idea that has helped us out several times in the past: the paradox of generalization. Instead of studying the series in (10.26), we will study these series:
 
Of course, these four series contain an unspecified number x, so their values will depend on the value of x. In other words, we can think of them as defining functions. If we can determine what these functions are, then we will be able to find the values of series (10.26a-d) by substituting 2 for x in series (10.27a), 1/2 for x in series (10.27b), 1 for x in series (10.27c), and −1/4 for x in series (10.27d).
Series like the ones in (10.27)are called power series. Here is the general definition.
Definition 10.6.1. Suppose  is a sequence of numbers. Then the series
 
is called a power series. The number cn is called the coefficient of xn in the power series.
For example, consider the power series in which all of the coefficients are 1:
 
This is a geometric series with first term a = 1 and ratio r = x, so if −1 < x < 1 then it converges to a/(1−r) = 1/(1− x), and for other values of x it diverges. In other words, we have
 
We could think of equation (10.28) as saying that, although the function f (x) = 1/(1− x) is not a polynomial, the restriction of this function to the interval (−1, 1) is almost a polynomial; it can be written as a power series, which is just like a polynomial except that it has infinitely many terms. Polynomials are among the easiest functions to work with in calculus: they are continuous everywhere, and their derivatives and integrals are easy to compute. It is natural, then, to wonder what will happen if we apply the concepts of calculus to power series. Are functions defined by power series continuous, and can we differentiate and integrate them? As we will see in the next section, the calculus of power series is almost as easy as the calculus of polynomials.
Notice that the set of values of x for which the power series in (10.28) converges is an interval centered at 0, the interval (−1, 1). We call this the interval of convergence of the power series. It turns out that the set of values of x for which a power series converges is always either just the number 0 or an interval centered at 0.
Theorem 10.6.2. For any power series
 
one of the following is true:
1.The power series converges only when x = 0.
2.There is some positive number R such that the power series converges absolutely if |x| < R and diverges if |x| > R.
3.The power series converges absolutely for all values of x.
If statement 2 of the theorem is true, then the series may converge absolutely, converge conditionally, or diverge when x = ±R. Thus, the interval of convergence of the power series may be (−R, R), [−R, R), (−R, R], or [−R, R]. The number R is called the radius of convergence of the power series. It is customary to say that if statement 1 is true then the radius of convergence of the power series is 0, and if statement 3 is true then the radius of convergence is infinite.
The key idea for the proof of Theorem 10.6.2 is the following lemma.
Lemma 10.6.3. Suppose a and b are real numbers such that |a| < |b|. If the power series  converges when x = b, then it converges absolutely when x = a. If it diverges when x = a, then it diverges when x = b.
Proof. Suppose that the power series converges when x = b; in other words, the series  converges. Then by Theorem 10.2.1, limn→∞ cnbn = 0. Setting ϵ = 1 in the definition of limits, we see that there is some positive integer N such that for every integer n > N, |cnbn| < 1. It follows that for every n > N we have
 
We now apply the comparison test to the series
 
Series (b) is a geometric series, and since |a| < |b|, |a/b| < 1. Therefore series (b) converges. By the comparison test, series (a) converges as well. Therefore  converges, which means that  converges absolutely. This proves the first statement in the lemma. The second statement follows immediately from the first.
Proof of Theorem 10.6.2. Let A be the set of all values of x for which the power series converges. If x = 0, then the value of the power series is
 
(Recall our convention that 00 = 1; see the footnote on page 165.) Thus, the series converges when x = 0, so 0 ∈ A.
If A has no upper bound, then for every real number r, there is some b ∈ A such that b > |r |. Since b ∈ A, the series converges when x = b, and therefore, by the lemma, it converges absolutely when x = r. Thus, the series converges absolutely for every value of x, so statement 3 of the theorem is true.
Now suppose that A has an upper bound. Then by the completeness of the real numbers, we can let R be the least upper bound of A. Notice that since 0 ∈ A, R ≥ 0.
Consider any number r. If |r| < R, then since R is the least upper bound of A, |r | is not an upper bound, so there must be some b ∈ A such that b > |r |. As before, since b ∈ A, the series converges when x = b, and we conclude by the lemma that the series converges absolutely when x = r. On the other hand, if |r| > R, then we can find a number a such that R < a < |r |. Since R is an upper bound for A, it cannot be the case that a ∈ A, so the series diverges when x = a. By the last statement in the lemma, it follows that the series diverges when x = r.
To summarize, we have shown that for every number r, if |r| < R then the power series converges absolutely when x = r, and if |r| > R then it diverges when x = r. It follows that if R > 0 then statement 2 of the theorem is true, and if R = 0 then statement 1 is true.
Example 10.6.4. Determine the values of x for which the following power series converge:
 
Solution. In each series, we treat x as a fixed but unknown number and test the series for convergence using the methods we have developed in the previous sections. Every power series converges when x = 0, so we only need to test the series for x = 0. Often a good first step is to use either the ratio test or the root test for absolute convergence. (Note that, since x could be negative, the series could have both positive and negative terms even if all of the coefficients are positive.)
Applying the ratio test for absolute convergence to series (a), we begin by computing
 
By the ratio test for absolute convergence, if |x|/3 < 1 then the series converges absolutely, and if |x|/3 > 1 then it diverges. In other words, the series converges absolutely if |x| < 3 and diverges if |x| > 3. (We leave it as an exercise for you to check that the root test for absolute convergence would lead to the same conclusion.) This is case 2 of Theorem 10.6.2, and the radius of convergence is 3. If x = ±3 then the ratio test is inconclusive, and we need to use a different test. We check these two values of x separately.
If x = 3, then the series takes the form
 
This is the harmonic series, and as we already know, it diverges.
On the other hand, if x = −3 then the series is
 
This time we have the alternating harmonic series, which converges. Thus, the interval of convergence of series (a) is [−3, 3).
Notice that series (b) is the same as (10.27a). To test it for absolute convergence, we again use the ratio test for absolute convergence, so we compute
 
This shows that no matter what x is, L = 0 < 1, and therefore the series converges absolutely for all values of x. This is case 3 of Theorem 10.6.2. The interval of convergence of series (b) is (−∞,∞), and the radius of convergence is infinite.
Series (c) is the same as (10.27d). As before, a good first step is the ratio test for absolute convergence:
 
By the ratio test for absolute convergence, the series converges absolutely if 4|x| < 1, or in other words |x| < 1/4, and it diverges if 4|x| > 1, or |x| > 1/4. The interval of convergence extends from −1/4 to 1/4, but once again we must do separate tests to see if the endpoints are included.
At x = 1/4 and x = −1/4, the series is
 
These are series (10.21) and (10.20), and we showed in the last section that the first diverges and the second converges conditionally. Thus, the interval of convergence for series (c) is [−1/4, 1/4).
Finally, we turn to series (d). We could use the ratio test or root test for absolute convergence, but in this case, it seems simpler to start with the comparison test. For all values of x we have
 
The series  is a geometric series, and it converges if |x|/2 < 1. Thus, by the comparison test, series (d) converges absolutely if |x| < 2. On the other hand, if x = ±2 then the series becomes
 
We leave it to you to verify that limn→∞ n2/2n = 0 (try l'Hôpital's rule on limx→∞ x2/2x = limx→∞ x2/ex ln 2, or apply Theorem 7.6.2), and therefore
 
By the test for divergence, we conclude that series (d) diverges when x = 2. Similarly, when x = −2 the terms of the series oscillate between values close to 1 and −1, and therefore the series diverges by the test for divergence. There is no need to check values of x with |x| > 2: examining the possibilities in Theorem 10.6.2, we see that the radius of convergence of series (d) must be 2, and therefore the interval of convergence is (−2, 2).
As a consequence of part (b) of this example, we get the following fact, which will be useful to us later:
Proposition 10.6.5. For every real number x,
 
Proof. As we showed in the last example, for every value of x, converges. It follows, by Theorem 10.2.1, that the terms approach 0. (Notice that you can also deduce this proposition from Exercise 19 in Section 2.9.)
So far, the only power series whose value we know is  as we saw in (10.28), for −1 < x < 1 this series converges to 1/(1− x), and for other values of x it diverges. We can find the values of some other power series by substituting other expressions for x in (10.28). For example, substituting −3x for x, we can say that if −1 < −3x < 1 then
 
and for other values of x this series diverges. To solve the inequality −1 < −3x < 1, we divide through by −3 (and reverse the direction of the inequalities) to get 1/3 > x > −1/3. Thus, we can say that
 
Let's try another example. Suppose we want a power series that converges to x/(x2 +4). We begin by writing
 
Now we substitute −x2/4 for x in (10.28) to get
 
The inequality −1 < −x2/4 < 1 is equivalent to 4 > x2 > −4, and the solution to this inequality is −2 < x < 2. Thus, we have
 
where we have used part 2 of Theorem 10.1.4 in going from the first line to the second. Notice that this series has only odd powers of x, but in Definition 10.6.1 we defined a power series to be a series that has a term of the form cnxn for every integer n ≥ 0. To view (10.29) as a power series, we think of the even powers of x as having coefficients of 0. In other words, to express x/(x2 +4) as a series that matches our definition of a power series, we would write
 
However, we usually won't bother to include terms with coefficient 0 when we write power series.3
We close this section with one more example. This time we will find a power series representation for the function
 
We begin with partial fractions. Using the methods of Section 8.1, you should be able to derive the partial fractions decomposition
 
Next, we find a power series representation for each fraction on the right-hand side. For the first of these fractions, we have
 
Substituting −x/2 for x in (10.28), we see that if −1 < −x/2 < 1 then
 
Since the inequality −1 < −x/2 < 1 is equivalent to −2 < x < 2, we conclude that
 
Similarly, we have
 
We now want to combine (10.31) and (10.32), but we can do this only for values of x that work in both equations—that is, only for −1 < x < 1. For these values of x, we use part 1 of Theorem 10.1.4 to deduce that
 
We leave it to you to verify, by the test for divergence, that this power series diverges for all other values of x.

10.7 Calculus with Power Series
In the last section we introduced the idea of power series, but we have not yet fully explained why this idea will be useful to us. What makes power series so useful is the possibility of applying to them the fundamental concepts of calculus: limits, derivatives, and integrals.
Theorem 10.7.1. Suppose the power series  has a positive radius of convergence, and let I be its interval of convergence. For x ∈ I let
 
Then:
1.The function f is continuous on I.
2.The function f is differentiable on the interior of I, and for all x in the interior of I,
 
3.On the interval I,
 
For the most part, the theorem says that the application of calculus concepts to power series works exactly as one might expect. In particular, derivatives and integrals of power series can be computed by differentiating or integrating the individual terms of the series, using the usual power rules for derivatives and integrals, exactly as one would when differentiating or integrating a polynomial. This is sometimes called "term-by-term differentiation and integration." Notice that the series for f ′(x) starts with n = 1 rather than n = 0, because the n = 0 term of the series for f (x) is the constant c0, whose derivative is 0, and therefore this term drops out when we differentiate. The only surprise in the theorem is the restriction of the differentiation formula in part 2 to the interior of the interval of convergence. As we will see, this restriction is necessary; sometimes things go wrong with the differentiability of f, or the formula for f′(x), at the endpoints of I.
The proof of Theorem 10.7.1 does not require any concepts beyond those that we have already introduced. However, the arguments are somewhat long and technical. We therefore put off the proof until the end of this chapter, and turn now to applications of the theorem.
We begin with the familiar geometric series
 
Substituting −x for x, and noting that −1 < −x < 1 if and only if −1 < x < 1, we see that
 
Now we're going to use part 3 of Theorem 10.7.1, term-by-term integration. Integrating equation (10.34), we get
 
In other words, the right-hand side of (10.35) gives a general formula for all antiderivatives of 1/(1+ x) on the interval (−1, 1). But clearly ln(1+ x) is one such antiderivative. It follows that for some number C,
 
To evaluate C, we set x = 0 in (10.36). On the left-hand side we get ln(1+0) = 0, and on the right we get
 
Thus, C = 0, and substituting this into (10.36) we see that
 
Notice that the series in (10.37) is series (10.27c) from the last section, written using slightly different  -notation. Rewriting the series in the notation of (10.27c), we can say that
 
We are not quite done with series (10.27c). We have found its value on the interval (−1, 1), but that is not the entire interval of convergence of the series. At the endpoints x = ±1, the series becomes:
 
Thus, when x = 1 the series is the alternating harmonic series, which converges, but when x = −1 it is −1 times the harmonic series, and therefore it diverges. It follows that the radius of convergence must be 1, and the interval of convergence is (−1, 1].
Here's another way of describing the situation. We can define a function g, with domain (−1, 1], by the equation
 
What equation (10.38) says is that, for −1 < x < 1, g(x) = ln(1+ x). But we have not yet determined the value of g(1).
To find g(1), we apply Theorem 10.7.1 to g. According to part 1 of the theorem, g is continuous on its domain (−1, 1], and in particular this means that it is continuous from the left at 1. Therefore
 
Thus, the equation g(x) = ln(1+ x) holds on the entire interval (−1, 1]:
 
This, finally, is the complete determination of the value of the power series (10.27c); for values of x outside of the interval (−1, 1], the series diverges.
Now that we have a complete understanding of the power series (10.27c), we can use it to find the value of series (10.26c), as suggested at the beginning of the last section. Setting x = 1 in equation (10.39), we find that
 
Thus, we have finally discovered why the alternating harmonic series converges to ln 2.
Notice that we have found a power series representation for the function g(x) = ln(1+ x) on the interval (−1, 1], and g is differentiable on this interval, but the power series for g′(x) = 1/(1+ x) only works on the interval (−1, 1); it diverges when x = 1. This illustrates why it was necessary to restrict part 2 of Theorem 10.7.1 to the interior of the interval of convergence.
We can also use term-by-term integration to find a power series representation for the inverse tangent function. We begin by substituting x2 for x in (10.34). Since the solution of the inequality −1 < x2 < 1 is −1 < x < 1, this gives us
 
Now we integrate term-by-term. Since we know that tan−1 x is an antiderivative of 1/(1+ x2), we conclude that for some number C,
 
By substituting 0 for x in this equation we discover that C = tan−1 0 = 0, and therefore
 
Once again, it turns out that the interval of convergence of the series in (10.40) is larger than (−1, 1). We leave it to you to verify that the interval of convergence in this case is [−1, 1]. As in our last example, to find the values of the series at the endpoints of this interval we use continuity. Let h be the function with domain [−1, 1] defined by the equation
 
Equation (10.40) says that for −1 < x < 1, h(x) = tan−1 x, and by part 1 of Theorem 10.7.1, h is continuous on [−1, 1]. We can therefore find h(±1) by taking limits:
 
This means that we can extend equation (10.40) to the entire interval of convergence:
 
For example, setting x = 1 in equation (10.41), we find that
 
This explains the result of Exercise 20 in Section 10.5.
Example 10.7.2. Compute
 
with error at most 0.01.
Solution. It is possible to evaluate this integral by using the methods of Chapter 8, but it is very difficult. It is easier to write the integrand as a power series and then use term-by-term integration. Substituting x2 for x in (10.41), we get
 
The solution to the inequality −1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1 is −1 ≤ x ≤ 1, so using term-by-term integration we find that on the interval [−1, 1],
 
Since the limits of integration in the requested definite integral belong to the interval [−1, 1], we can use this antiderivative in the fundamental theorem of calculus:
 
Clearly this last series satisfies the hypotheses of the alternating series test, so if we approximate it with the sum of the first three terms then the magnitude of the error will be at most 1/105 < 0.01. Thus, we can achieve the requested accuracy with the approximation
 
Example 10.7.3. Evaluate the power series
 
Solution. This series looks like the series for tan−1 x, except that it involves even powers of x rather than odd powers. However, if we factor a −1/2 out of the series, then we see that it is actually more closely related to the series for ln(1+ x). Applying (10.39), with x2 substituted for x, we get
 
Since the solution to the inequality −1 < x2 ≤ 1 is −1 ≤ x ≤ 1, we conclude that
 
We have now derived two new power series formulas, equations (10.39) and (10.41), by using term-by-term integration. Let's try working out another by using term-by-term differentiation. We're going to figure out what function is represented by the power series  which was series (10.27b) in the last section.
We start with our series for 1/(1− x), equation (10.33), and differentiate both sides:
 
The coefficient in the nth term of this series is n, and the coefficient in the nth term of series (10.27b) is n2. We'll need another application of term-by-term differentiation to get another factor of n. It takes just a few more steps to complete the derivation.
Multiplying equation (10.42) by x, we get
 
and then differentiating again gives us
 
By the quotient rule,
 
and substituting this into equation (10.44) leads to
 
Finally, to get a formula for power series (10.27b), we multiply through by x again:
 
Once again, as suggested at the beginning of the last section, we can use this formula to clear up a mystery left over from a previous section. Substituting 1/2 for x in (10.45), we get
 
This gives us the value of series (10.26b), which originally appeared as series (b) in Example 10.4.2. When we first studied this series in Section 10.4, we computed some partial sums and showed that the value of the series was between 5.99954 and 6.00018, and we guessed that the value was 6. Now we know that our guess was correct.
We have now cleared up two mysteries from previous sections: we have found the values of two of the power series in equations (10.27), and we have used these to find the values of two of the series in (10.26). We will find the values of the other two in Sections 10.8 and 10.9. But we have also discovered that, surprisingly, some familiar functions can be expressed as power series. In particular, in equations (10.39) and (10.41) we have expressed ln(1+ x) and tan−1 x, at least for certain ranges of values of x, as power series.
You may be wondering at this point if we can modify our formula for ln(1+ x) in order to express ln x as a power series. One possibility is to substitute x −1 for x in equation (10.39), which gives us
 
Simplifying, we get
 
Equation (10.46) expresses ln x as an infinite series, but the series doesn't quite fit our definition of a power series, since it involves powers of x −1 rather than powers of x. The series in (10.46) is called a power series in x −1. More generally, we extend our definition of power series as follows.
Definition 10.7.4. Suppose  is a sequence of numbers and a is a number. Then the series
 
is called a power series in x −a, or a power series centered at a.
From now on we will use the term "power series" to include power series in x −a. Notice that if a = 0 then we get back our original definition of power series. Thus, the power series we have studied up until now are power series centered at 0.
Many of our previous results for power series centered at 0 can easily be extended to power series centered at any number. For example, notice that equation (10.46) holds for values of x in an interval centered at 1. In general, we have the following version of Theorem 10.6.2.
Theorem 10.7.5. For any power series
 
one of the following is true:
1.The series converges only when x = a.
2.There is some positive number R such that the series converges absolutely if |x −a| < R and diverges if |x −a| > R.
3.The series converges absolutely for all values of x.
Theorem 10.7.5 follows immediately from Theorem 10.6.2 simply by substituting x −a for x. As before, we refer to R as the radius of convergence of the power series. We can also generalize Theorem 10.7.1 to get the following theorem.
Theorem 10.7.6. Suppose the power series  has a positive radius of convergence, and let I be its interval of convergence. For x ∈ I let
 
Then:
1.The function f is continuous on I.
2.The function f is differentiable on the interior of I, and for all x in the interior of I,
 
3.On the interval I,
 
To illustrate how Theorem 10.7.6 follows from Theorem 10.7.1, we sketch the idea behind the proof of part 2. Let g be the function defined by the equation
 
Then f (x) = g(x −a). By Theorem 10.7.1, g is differentiable on the interior of its interval of convergence, and
 
We can now find f′(x) by the chain rule:
 
Let's give one more example to illustrate these new ideas. We're going to write 1/(1− x) as a power series again, but this time we'll write it as a power series in x +1. We begin with the reexpression
 
Next, we substitute (x +1)/2 for x in our original power series for 1/(1− x), equation (10.33):
 
Since the solution of the inequality −1 < (x +1)/2 < 1 is −3 < x < 1, our final answer is

10.8 Taylor Series
In the last section, we discovered power series representations for the functions ln x and tan−1 x, but we found these power series mostly by luck. It turns out that many familiar functions can be written as power series, but to show this we'll need a more systematic method of finding such series. We will begin to develop such a method in this section.
The method is based on a formula for the coefficients of any power series representing a function f. Suppose that
 
where R > 0. Then in particular equation (10.47) holds when x = a, so
 
Thus, we have a formula for the first coefficient of the power series: c0 = f (a).
It turns out we can find the next coefficient by taking the derivative of f. Differentiating equation (10.47), we get
 
Evaluating again at x = a gives us
 
so we have found a formula for the next coefficient: c1 = f′(a).
Of course, to get the next coefficient we differentiate again. Differentiating (10.48) leads to
 
We have chosen not to multiply out the coefficients in (10.49), because we want to see the pattern in the formula for these coefficients. Evaluating again at x = a, we get
 
and therefore c2 = f′′(a)/2!.
Let's work out one more coefficient. Differentiating (10.49) gives us
 
When x = a this says that
 
so c3 = f′′′(a)/3! = f(3)(a)/3!.
Here are the coefficients we have computed so far:
 
You can probably guess that c4 = f(4)(a)/4!, c5 = f(5)(a)/5!, and, in general,
 
And, indeed, it is not hard to extend the reasoning we have given to show that this general formula for cn is correct. Notice that this formula works even in the case n = 0 if we interpret f (0), the "0th derivative" of f, to be f itself.
We summarize our conclusions in a theorem:
Theorem 10.8.1. Suppose that
 
where R > 0. Then for every n ≥ 0,
 
Filling in the formula for cn in the power series in Theorem 10.8.1, we see that the series has the form
 
There is a name for this series:
Definition 10.8.2. Suppose that for every positive integer n, f (n)(a) is defined. Then the power series
 
is called the Taylor series for f centered at a. When a = 0, the series takes the simpler form
 
This is the Taylor series for f centered at 0, but it is also often called the Maclaurin series for f.
Taylor and Maclaurin series are named for Brook Taylor (1685-1731) and Colin Maclaurin (1698-1746), who were among a number of mathematicians who studied power series representations of functions in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.
It is important to understand what Theorem 10.8.1 says and what it doesn't say. In the terminology of Definition 10.8.2, what the theorem says is that if any power series centered at a converges to f (x) in an interval around a, then that series must be the Taylor series for f centered at a. However, it does not say that the Taylor series is guaranteed to converge to f (x). To put it another way, the theorem says that if you are looking for a power series in x −a that converges to f (x) in some interval around a, then you may as well focus your attention on the Taylor series, because no other series has any hope of working. The Taylor series may or may not work, but if it doesn't work, then nothing does.
For example, consider our series for ln x from the last section:
 
In this case, f (x) = ln x and a = 1. According to Theorem 10.8.1, this series must be the Taylor series for f centered at 1. To verify this, we need to compute f(n)(1) for all n ≥ 0. Here are the first few values:
 
The pattern is probably clear at this point: 1) 0, and for every 1, n)(x) (−1)n−1(n −1)!/xn and f(n)(1) = (−1)n−1(n −1)!. Thus, the coefficients of the Taylor series are c0 = 0 and, for n ≥ 1,
 
Looking back at equation (10.50), we see that these are precisely the coefficients of the power series in that equation. Thus, series (10.50) is, as expected, the Taylor series for ln x centered at 1.
While it is nice to see Theorem 10.8.1 confirmed in the case of the natural logarithm function, the real usefulness of the theorem comes from applying it to functions for which we don't yet know a power series representation. For example, suppose we want to find a power series centered at 0 that converges to the function f (x) = ex in some interval around 0. Theorem 10.8.1 suggests that we try the Maclaurin series, so we need to compute f (n)(0) for all n ≥ 0. As soon as we compute the first few values, the pattern becomes clear:
 
Evidently, f (n)(x) = ex and f (n)(0) = e0 = 1 for every n ≥ 0, and therefore the Maclaurin series is
 
Again, we want to stress that we don't yet know if series (10.51) converges to ex; what we do know is that if any power series centered at 0 works, then it has to be this one. Of course, we're hoping that this series converges to ex, but there are two things that could go wrong. The series could diverge, at least for some values of x. And even if the series converges, it might converge to something other than ex. (For an example of how a Taylor series for a function f can converge to something other than f (x), see Exercise 25.) We need to address both of these worries.
Fortunately, the first worry has already been taken care of. Series (10.51) is the same as series (10.27a) from Section 10.6. We studied this series in part (b) of Example 10.6.4, and found that it converges for all values of x. We can therefore define a function g with domain R by the equation
 
The question we need to address now is whether or not g(x) = ex.
From the point of view of calculus, the most distinctive property of the function f (x) = ex is that it is equal to its own derivative: f′(x) = f (x). As a first step toward seeing if g(x) = ex, let's see if g has this property. By term-by-term differentiation, we see that
 
So g at least shares this property with f: it is equal to its own derivative. If you did Exercise 25 in Section 7.4, then you know that it follows that there must be some constant C such that g(x) = Cex. For those who didn't do that exercise, we give a solution here. Our plan is to show that g(x)/ex is equal to a constant (note that ex is never 0, so division by ex is acceptable). Often in calculus the easiest way to show that something is constant is to show that its derivative is 0, so we use the quotient rule to compute
 
Thus, there is some number C such that for every x, g(x)/ex = C, and therefore g(x) = Cex.
All that remains is to compute C, which we do by plugging in a convenient value for x. Setting x = 0, we get
 
Thus, g(x) = Cex = ex. In other words, we have shown that the Maclaurin series for ex converges to ex for all values of x:
 
Using this power series representation for ex, we can clear up one more mystery from before. Setting x = 2 in equation (10.52), we get
 
This confirms the guess at the value of series (10.26a) that we made all the way back in Example 10.4.2.
We could also compute the Taylor series for ex centered at some other number. For example, to find the Taylor series centered at 3, we first observe that for all n ≥ 0, f (n)(x) = ex, and therefore f (n)(3) = e3. Therefore the Taylor series is
 
We ask you to verify in Exercise 19 that this series also converges to ex for all values of x.
Let's try another example. We're going to see if we can find a power series centered at 0 that converges to the function f (x) = sin x. Once again we begin by computing the Maclaurin series, which means that we must find f (n)(0) for n ≥ 0:
 
This time there is a pattern of four numbers that repeats: 0, 1, 0, −1. Thus, the Maclaurin series is
 
Leaving out the terms that are 0, we have alternating positive and negative terms with odd powers of x:
 
As before, there is more work to do to determine whether or not this power series converges to sin x. We leave it as an exercise for you (see Exercise 20) to check that the series converges for all values of x. We can therefore let g be the function with domain R defined by the equation
 
We must now investigate whether or not g(x) = sin x.
Imitating the reasoning we used in the case of ex, we ask: Is there a distinctive property of the function f (x) = sin x? A reasonable candidate is the fact that f′′(x) = −sin x = −f (x). To see if g has the same property, we compute:
 
Yes, g has the same property.
Once again, our next step is to show that some quantity is constant by showing that its derivative is equal to 0. We are going to show simultaneously that g(x) = sin x and g′(x) = cos x, which motivates us to compute
 
We conclude that there is some number C such that for every x,
(g(x)−sin x)2 + (g′(x)−cos x)2 = C.
As usual, we evaluate C by setting x = 0. Using equations (10.53) and (10.54), we find that
 
and therefore
C = (g(0)−sin 0)2 + (g′(0)−cos 0)2 = (0−0)2 +(1−1)2 = 0.
We conclude that for all x,
(g(x)−sin x)2 + (g′(x)−cos x)2 = 0.
But the only way this can happen is if g(x) = sin x and g′(x) = cos x. In other words, we have simultaneously found two power series formulas:
 
Example 10.8.3. Find the following series:
(a) The Maclaurin series for the function  
(b) The Taylor series centered at π/6 for the function g(x) = sin x.
Solution. Although we could use the definition of Maclaurin series for part (a), it is easier to use other methods to find a series representation for f. Using exponent laws and (10.52), we see that for all x,
 
By Theorem 10.8.1, this must be the Maclaurin series for f.
Similarly, by the sum rule for the sine function and equations (10.55), for all x we have
 
Notice that we have included the terms with coefficient 0 in the power series for cos(x −π/6) and sin (x −π/6), to make it easier to add these two series in the last step. Again, by Theorem 10.8.1, we conclude that this is the Taylor series for g centered at π/6. In Exercise 24 we ask you to verify this directly from the definition of Taylor series.
Example 10.8.4. Evaluate the following series:
 
Solution. These series are easy to evaluate if you recognize how they are related to Maclaurin series we have studied. Series (a) is the result of substituting −1 for x in the Maclaurin series for ex, and therefore, by (10.52),
 
Similarly, after a little rewriting we can use (10.55b) to evaluate series (b):
 
Power series have many applications. The most straightforward use of power series is to find particular values of functions, as in our next example.
Example 10.8.5. Compute sin (20◦) with error at most 0.0001.
Solution. First, we must convert 20◦ to radians. Since 360◦ is 2π radians, 20◦ is 20π/180 = π/9 radians. Therefore, by (10.55a),
 
The terms of this series alternate positive and negative, and, since π/9 < 1, it is not hard to see that the terms decrease in magnitude. Also, by Proposition 10.6.5, the terms approach 0. Therefore all of the hypotheses of the alternating series test hold, and that implies that if we approximate the value of the series with a partial sum, then the magnitude of the error will be at most the absolute value of the next term. Calculation shows that (π/9)5/5! ≈ 0.00004 < 0.0001. Thus, we can say that, with error at most 0.0001,
 
In fact, as your calculator will tell you, sin(20◦) ≈ 0.34202.
Power series can also be used to solve calculus problems that might be difficult to solve by other methods. Our next two examples illustrate this.
Example 10.8.6. Compute  with error at most 0.01.
Solution. We used the midpoint and trapezoid rules to approximate this integral in Section 8.6, and found that the value was approximately 1.6289. Now we'll evaluate the integral by expressing the integrand as a power series. Substituting −x2 for x in (10.52) and then integrating term-by-term, we get
 
We leave it as an exercise for you (see Exercise 22) to show that if we approximate the last series in (10.56) with its 10th partial sum, then the error in the approximation will be at most 0.01. Using a computer to do the arithmetic, we find that
 
Example 10.8.7. Find
 
Solution. This limit is an indeterminate form of type 0/0. It can be solved by l'Hôpital's rule (see Exercise 23), but it may be easier to proceed by expressing numerator and denominator as power series. By (10.41) and (10.55a), if −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and x = 0 then
 
By the continuity of power series (part 1 of Theorem 10.7.1), we can find the limits as x → 0 of the numerator and denominator of the last fraction above by substituting 0 for x. Therefore

10.9 The Binomial Series
It is straightforward to compute that
(1+ x)2 = 1+2x + x2,
(1+ x)3 = 1+3x +3x2 + x3,
and if you know the binomial theorem then you can generalize and give a formula for (1+ x)n for any nonnegative integer n (and if not, then see Exercise 1). But in this section, we will see that we can even generalize to (1+ x)p for any real number p. To do this, we will find a power series representation for the function f (x) = (1+ x)p. We begin by finding the Maclaurin series for f.
As usual, we must compute f (n)(0) for all n ≥ 0:
 
It will be convenient to have notation for the values of f (n)(0), so we define (p)0 = 1, (p)1 = p, (p)2 = p(p−1), (p)3 = p(p −1)(p−2), and, in general,
(p)n = p(p−1)(p−2) · · · (p−(n −1)).
These numbers are called falling factorials, because, like factorials, they are products of decreasing lists of numbers. (Indeed, it is not hard to see that for any integer n ≥ 0, (n)n = n !.) Falling factorials could also be defined by the following recursive definition:
(p)0 = 1, and for every integer n ≥ 0, (p)n+1 = (p)n· (p−n).
Using falling factorial notation, we have f (n)(0) = (p)n, and therefore the Maclaurin series for f is
 
This power series is called the binomial series with exponent p.
If p is a nonnegative integer, then for n > p the nth term of the series will be 0. For example, if p = 2 then the series takes the form
 
Of course, for all x this series converges to 1+2x + x2 = (1+ x)2. In Exercise 1 we ask you to show that if p is any nonnegative integer, then the binomial series with exponent p turns into a finite sum that is equal to (1+ x)p for all values of x.
However, we are most interested in seeing what happens if p is not a nonnegative integer. In that case, all of the coefficients in the Maclaurin series are nonzero, and we can use the ratio test for absolute convergence to determine the radius of convergence. Applying the recursive definition of falling factorials to help us simplify, we get
 
Thus, the series converges absolutely if |x| < 1 and diverges if |x| > 1. (We'll worry about the endpoints later.) We can therefore define g(x), for −1 < x < 1, by the formula
 
We now want to see if g(x) = (1+ x)p.
As in the last section, we begin by looking for a distinctive property of f (x) = (1+ x)p. Since f′(x) = p(1+ x)p−1, we have
(1+ x) f(x) = (1+ x)p(1+ x)p−1 = p(1+ x)p = pf (x).
To see if g has the same property, we first compute
 
This is just like the binomial series, except that the subscripts on the falling factorials are one larger than the exponents on x. Thus, we can rewrite this series with different -notation and then apply the recursive definition of falling factorials to get
 
Now, look at the two series on the right-hand side of (10.59). The first is just the binomial series again, so it is equal to g(x). And the second is very similar to the first step in (10.58). In fact, rewriting it to see how it relates to g′(x), we see that
 
Substituting into the right-hand side of (10.59), we get
g′(x) = pg(x)− xg′(x),
and therefore
 
In other words, g′ is related to g in exactly the same way that f′ is related to f.
Imitating the approach we used with ex, we now check that g(x)/(1+ x)p is a constant. (Note that, since we are only considering x in the open interval (−1, 1), the denominator here is not 0.) Applying (10.60), we see that
 
Thus, there is some number C such that for all x ∈ (−1, 1), g(x)/(1+ x)p = C, and therefore g(x) = C(1+ x)p. Finally, we set x = 0 to find C:
 
We conclude that g(x) = (1+ x)p. In other words, we have proven the following theorem.
Theorem 10.9.1. For every real number p,
 
Let's try the theorem out with a few different values of p. If p = −1, then the theorem says that
 
We already knew this; it is equation (10.34) from Section 10.7. In this case, the series diverges when x = ±1, so (−1, 1) is the entire interval of convergence.
But we can discover a new power series formula by setting p = −1/2 to get
 
Now, it turns out that we can work out a formula for the falling factorial (−1/2)n that appears in this series. We start with
 
To simplify the product of odd integers in the numerator, we multiply and divide by all even integers from 2 to 2n:
 
Thus, we have
 
Finally, plugging this into series (10.61) gives us
 
This time, it turns out the power series converges at one of the endpoints. Setting x = ±1 in (10.62) gives us two series we have already studied. When x = 1 we get series (10.20), and when x = −1 we get (10.21). We showed in Section 10.5 that the first of these converges and the second diverges, so the interval of convergence for series (10.62) is (−1, 1]. Imitating the reasoning we used in Section 10.7, we can use continuity to extend (10.62) to this interval:
 
We can use (10.63) to resolve one remaining unsolved problem from before. Setting x = 1 in equation (10.63), we find that
 
This confirms our stated value for series (10.20), which was the same as (10.26d). We have now verified the values of all four of the series in (10.26). (For the value of series (10.27d), see Exercise 12.)
Since  we can also use (10.63) to find a power series for sin−1 x. First we substitute −x2 for x in (10.63), which gives us
 
The solution to the inequality −1 < −x2 ≤ 1 is −1 < x < 1, so we can integrate term-by-term to conclude that
 
When x = 0 this means that
C = sin−1 0 = 0,
so we have
 
Finally, it follows from (10.23) that
 
and the series  is a convergent p-series, so by the comparison test, the series in (10.64) converges absolutely when= ±1. Therefore we can extend (10.64) by continuity to the interval [−1, 1]:
 
For example, we have
 
We have now found power series for many familiar functions. We summarize the most important of these in Table 10.1. We end this section with two more examples of applications of power series.
 
Table 10.1: Power series representations of some familiar functions.
Example 10.9.2. Compute  with error at most 0.001.
Solution. While there are other ways to do this computation, one possibility is to use the binomial series. Since  must be a little more than 2. But how much more?
We start by rewriting the problem as
 
Next, we turn to the binomial series. By Theorem 10.9.1,
 
and therefore
 
We leave it to you to check (see Exercise 11) that, after the first term, this series satisfies the hypotheses of the alternating series test, and therefore we can achieve the desired accuracy by adding terms until we reach a term whose absolute value is at most 0.001. Since the n = 4 term is about −0.0003, we can use the approximation
 
Example 10.9.3. Compute
 
with error at most 0.001.
Solution. We substitute x3 for x in (10.64) and then integrate term-by-term:
 
If we approximate the value s of this series with a partial sum sN, then the error will be the tail
 
To overestimate this tail, we first apply (10.23) to see that
 
Now, as in the proof of the integral test, we can overestimate the tail tN with an improper integral:
 
To achieve an error of at most 0.001 = 1/1000, we choose N so that  1000, which means
 
Thus, we can get the desired accuracy by using the approximation

1.If p is a nonnegative integer, then (1+ x)p can be expanded as a polynomial. This polynomial can be thought of as a power series in which all terms beyond some point are 0, and by Theorem 10.8.1, this series must be the Maclaurin series for (1+ x)p.

(Hint: Use Exercise 26 in Section 7.5. Note that the series above is not a power series, because the powers of x are in the denominators of the terms. It is called a Laurent series, after Pierre Alphonse Laurent (1813-1854).)
10.10 Taylor Polynomials and the Taylor Remainder
In the last few sections we have studied functions defined by power series. In this section, we will see that it can also be useful to treat the partial sums of a power series as functions.
Consider the Taylor series for a function f centered at a:
  
The Nth partial sum of this series is the function
  
Notice that TN is a polynomial of degree at most N. (The formula above can be put in the form in which we usually write polynomials by multiplying out all of the powers of x −a.). The function TN is called the Nth-order Taylor polynomial for f centered at a. If a = 0, then it is also called the Nth-order Maclaurin polynomial for f. The formula for TN (x) consists of those terms of the Taylor series that involve powers of x −a up to N. If the Taylor series converges to f (x) for some value of x, then
 
In other words, for large N, TN (x) should be close to f (x).
For example, in part (b) of Example 10.8.3 we showed that the Taylor series for the function f (x) = sin x centered at a = π/6 is
 
and this series converges to sin x for all values of x. The first few Taylor polynomials for this function are
 
Figure 10.4 shows the graphs of f and these four Taylor polynomials. All of the curves pass through the point (π/6, 1/2), and it appears that as N increases, the graph of TN follows the shape of the graph of f more and more closely near this point. The graph of y = T3(x) stays quite close to the graph of y = f (x) over the interval −π/2 ≤ x ≤ π/2.
Will this trend continue? Figure 10.5 shows the graphs of f and T25. Remarkably, the graph of T25 is almost indistinguishable from the graph of f over the entire range −3π ≤ x ≤ 3π.
 
Figure 10.4: The graphs of the function f (x) = sin x (blue), and the Taylor polynomials T0, T1, T2, and T3 (red). The black dot is the point (π/6, 1/2).
 
Figure 10.5: The graphs of the function f (x) = sin x (blue) and the Taylor polynomial T25 (red).
Let's try another example. As we saw in Section 10.8, the Taylor series for the function f (x) = ln x centered at a = 1 is
 
and this series converges to ln x for 0 < x ≤ 2. In Figure 10.6 we see that the graph of the Taylor polynomial T25 is very close to the graph of f on the interval (0, 2], but it deviates sharply beyond that interval. In the rest of this section, we investigate this phenomenon.
 
Figure 10.6: The graphs of the function f (x) = ln x (blue) and the Taylor polynomial T25 (red).
To understand the relationship between a function and its Taylor polynomials, let's look at the Taylor polynomials in order. Consider a function f and its Taylor polynomials TN centered at some number a. The Taylor polynomial T0 is the constant function T0(x) = f (a), so its graph is the horizontal line y = f (a). This line intersects the graph of f at the point (a, f (a)). The graph of T1 is the graph of the equation y = T1(x) = f (a)+ f′(a)(x −a), which we can rewrite in the form
y − f (a) = f′(a)(x −a).
This is the point-slope form for the line through the point (a, f (a)) with slope f′(a). But that means that the graph of T1 is the line tangent to the graph of f at the point (a, f (a))! If you look back at Figure 10.4, you'll see that the graph of T0 is a horizontal line through the point (π/6, 1/2), and the graph of T1 is the line tangent to the curve y = sin x at that point.
Another way to describe the relationship between f and T1 is to say that T1(a) = f (a) and T 1′ (a) = f′(a). Since T1(a) = f (a), the graph of T1 touches the graph of fat the point (a, f (a)), and since  the two graphs have the same slope at that point. But T1 is a linear function, and therefore  
Similar results hold for T2:
 
As with T1, the fact that T2(a) = f (a) and  means that the graphs of T2 and f touch at the point (a, f (a)), and they have the same slope at that point. But now we also have  which means that the concavity of T2 matches that of f at (a, f (a)). The graph of T2 is a parabola that matches the shape of the graph of f near (a, f (a)) more closely than the tangent line does, because it curves the same way as f at x = a. Once again, this is visible in Figure 10.4.
We'll let you check that  = f ′′′(a), and  The pattern is probably clear now. In general,
 
It is not hard to verify this by extending the calculations we did above for T2. But there is another way of looking at it that makes equations (10.66) make intuitive sense. We can think of the Taylor polynomial TN (x) as a power series in which all terms beyond a certain point have coefficient 0:
 
By Theorem 10.8.1, this must be the Taylor series centered at a for TN. Thus, the Taylor series centered at a for TN is the same as the series for f up to term number N, and it follows, by the formula for the coefficients of the Taylor series, that the derivatives of TN and f at a match up to the Nth derivative. But TN is a polynomial of degree at most N, and therefore  That is precisely what equations (10.66) say.
To summarize what we have discovered so far, we can say that the reason that the shape of the graph of TN is similar to the shape of the graph of f near the point (a, f (a)) is that TN and its first N derivatives agree with f and its derivatives at a. What is remarkable is that, although this matching of derivatives holds only at the number a, the similarity in the shapes of the graphs often extends over a large interval around a.
The similarity between the graphs of f and TN means that in many cases, if N is large, then f (x) ≈ TN (x). It turns out that we can use (10.66) to analyze the accuracy of this approximation. As usual, we define the error of the approximation to be the difference between f (x) and TN (x). This difference is called the Nth Taylor remainder, and it is denoted RN (x). Thus,
 
Since TN (a) = f (a), RN (a) = 0. For x = a, the following theorem gives a formula for RN (x).
Theorem 10.10.1 (Taylor's Theorem). Suppose that x = a, and let I be the closed interval with endpoints a and x. (Thus, either I = [a, x] or I = [x, a], depending on whether x > a or x < a.) Suppose also that f (N) is defined and continuous on I, and f (N+1) is defined on the interior of I. Then there is some number c in the interior of I such that
 
The Nth-order Taylor polynomial TN (x) includes all terms of the Taylor series up to (f (N)(a)/N!)(x −a)N, so the first term missing from TN(x) is (f(N+1)(a)/(N +1)!) (x −a)N+1. Notice that this is almost the same as the formula for RN (x) in Taylor's theorem. Thus, we could describe Taylor's theorem as saying that the Nth Taylor remainder is the same as the first term of the Taylor series that is missing from TN (x), except that the derivative f (N+1) is evaluated at some point c between a and x, rather than at a.
Proof of Taylor's Theorem. We will assume that x > a, so that I = [a, x]; the proof when x < a is similar. It may be worthwhile to first work out the case N = 0. In that case, the hypothesis of the theorem says that f is continuous on [a, x] and differentiable on (a, x). We have R0(x) = f (x)− T0(x) = f (x)− f (a), so what we must prove is that for some c in the interval (a, x), f (x)− f (a) = f′(c)(x −a), or equivalently
 
But we already know that this is true: it is just the mean value theorem!
To prove the theorem for N > 0, we will find a number c such that a < c < x and
 
Our method will be to apply Cauchy's mean value theorem, Theorem 4.8.8, N +1 times to the fraction on the left-hand side above. To do this, we will need to know something about the first N +1 derivatives of the numerator and denominator of the fraction.
For the numerator, note that by (10.66),
 
 
To work out the derivatives of the denominator, we let g(x) = (x −a)N+1. Then
 
We are now ready for the application of Cauchy's mean value theorem. Since RN (a) = g(a) = 0, we have
 
By Cauchy's mean value theorem, there must be some number c1 such that a < c1 < x and  
But now by (10.67) and (10.68) we also have R′N (a) = g′(a) = 0, so we can rewrite this in the form  
and then apply Cauchy's mean value theorem again to conclude that for some number c2, a < c2 < c1 < x and
 
Continuing in this way, after N +1 applications of Cauchy's mean value theorem we will have a number cN+1 such that a < cN+1 < x and
 
According to (10.67) and (10.68), this means that
 
and setting c = cN+1, it follows that
 
which is what we had to prove.
Example 10.10.2. Compute sin (20◦) with error at most 0.0001.
Solution. We have already done this computation in Example 10.8.5, but we redo it now in a slightly different way, using Taylor's theorem to guarantee the accuracy of our approximation. Let f (x) = sin x. As we showed in Example 10.8.5, 20◦ is π/9 radians, so we must compute f (π/9). We will approximate this value by using the Maclaurin series representation for f:
 
Let TN be the Nth-order Maclaurin polynomial for f; thus, TN (x) consists of all terms of the Maclaurin series up to the x N term. Our plan is to compute TN (π/9) for some N that is large enough to achieve the desired accuracy. Since the error in the approximation is given by RN (π/9), we must choose N so that |RN (π/9)| ≤ 0.0001.
Setting a = 0 and x = π/9 in Taylor's theorem, we get
 
Unfortunately, this formula involves an unknown number c between 0 and π/9. As usual, we deal with this problem by overestimating |RN (π/9)|, rather than trying to compute it exactly. Since f (x) = sin x, f(N+1)(c) is either ±sin c or ±cos c, and it follows that | f(N+1)(c)| ≤ 1. Therefore
 
If we try out a few values of N, we discover that
 
so we can achieve the desired accuracy with the approximation sin(20◦) ≈ T4(π/9).
Taking all terms of the Maclaurin series up to the x4 term, we see that
 
(Notice that the coefficient of x4 in the Maclaurin series is 0, so T4(x) turns out to be a polynomial of degree 3.) Our answer is therefore
 
According to the definition of the Taylor remainder, RN (x) = f (x)− TN(x). One enlightening way of rewriting this, using the formula for the remainder from Taylor's theorem, is
 
Thus, Taylor's theorem says that we can get the exact value of f (x) by writing down the Taylor polynomial TN+1(x), and then, in the last term, replacing f (N+1)(a) with f(N+1)(c), for some number c between a and x.
Another helpful way of rewriting the definition of the remainder is TN (x) = f (x)− RN (x). This leads immediately to the following observation.
Theorem 10.10.3. For every N ≥ 0, let TN be the Nth-order Taylor polynomial for f centered at a, and let RN be the Nth Taylor remainder. For any value of x, if limN→∞ RN (x) = 0, then the Taylor series converges to f (x).
Proof. Suppose that for some value of x, limN→∞ RN (x) = 0. Then the value of the Taylor series is
 
As an example of the use of this theorem, consider again the Taylor series for the function f (x) = ln x centered at a = 1:
 
We already know that this series converges to ln x when x = 2, but let's see how we can confirm this fact by using Theorem 10.10.3. As we saw in Section 10.8, for any N ≥ 1, f(N)(x) = (−1)N−1(N −1)!/xN. Applying Taylor's theorem with a = 1 and x = 2, we conclude that for some c in the interval (1, 2),
 
According to Theorem 10.10.3, if we can show that limN→∞ RN (2) = 0, then we can conclude that the Taylor series converges to f (x) = ln x when x = 2. Unfortunately, our formula for RN (2) contains an unknown number c. But as usual, we can deal with this problem by overestimating |RN (2)|. Since 1 < c < 2, we have
 
Since limN→∞ 1/(N +1) = 0, we conclude by the squeeze theorem that limN→∞ |RN (2)| = 0, and therefore limN→∞ RN (2) = 0. Theorem 10.10.3 now tells us that the Taylor series converges to ln x when x = 2.
Example 10.10.4. Use Theorem 10.10.3 to show that the Maclaurin series for sin x converges to sin x for all values of x.
Solution. Let f (x) = sin x. It is easy to see that when x = 0, the Maclaurin series converges to f(0) = sin 0 = 0. For any x = 0, we have
 
for some number c between 0 and x. Since f (N+1)(c) is either ±sin c or ±cos c, |f(N+1)(c)| ≤ 1, and therefore
 
By Proposition 10.6.5, limN→∞ |x|N+1/(N +1)! = 0. Therefore limN→∞ |RN (x)| = 0 by the squeeze theorem, so limN→∞ RN (x) = 0. It follows, by Theorem 10.10.3, that the Maclaurin series converges to sin x.

10.11 Proof of Theorem 10.7.1
Most of what we have learned about power series in the last few sections has relied on Theorem 10.7.1, but we have not yet proven that theorem. In this section we present the proof. For the convenience of the reader, we first restate the theorem.
Theorem 10.7.1 (restated). Suppose the power series  has a positive radius of convergence, and let I be its interval of convergence. For x ∈ I let
 
Then:
1.The function f is continuous on I.
2.The function f is differentiable on the interior of I, and for all x in the interior of I,  
3.On the interval I,
 
Of course, it is important that we not use in the proof any results from the last few sections that depend on this theorem, since this would result in circular reasoning. We will use only ideas that were discussed before our original statement of the theorem.
One fact that we will use several times is the triangle inequality. Recall that the triangle inequality says that for any two numbers a and b, |a +b| ≤ |a| + |b|. In fact, the triangle inequality holds more generally for sums of more than two numbers: for any numbers a1, a2, ..., aN,
|a1 +a2 + · · ·+aN|≤ |a1| + |a2| + · · ·+|aN |,
or equivalently, in  -notation,
 
If  converges, then we can let N →∞to conclude that
 
We ask you to verify these extended versions of the triangle inequality in Exercise 1.
Proof of Theorem 10.7.1. For N ≥ 0, let
 
Then sN is a polynomial of degree at most N, and for all x ∈ I,
 
Thus,  converges to f (x) for every number x in the interval I. One of the key ideas in the proofs of parts 1 and 3 of the theorem is the following fact about the nature of this convergence.
Lemma 10.11.1. Suppose that b > 0 and b is in the interior of I. Suppose also that ϵ > 0. Then there is some positive integer M such that for every N > M and every x ∈ [−b, b], | f (x)−sN (x)| < ϵ.
Note that since I is centered at 0, [−b, b] ⊆ I. It follows that for each x ∈ [−b, b], limN→∞ sN (x) = f (x), which means that there must be some M such that for every N > M, | f (x)−sN (x)| < ϵ. But in this statement, for different values of x, the choice of M might be different. The significance of the lemma is that it says that there is a single choice of M that will work for all values of x in [−b, b]. In other words, we can find an M such that for every N > M, sN (x) is within ϵ of f (x) over the entire interval [−b, b], not merely at one point in that interval. We say that the functions sN converge uniformly to f on the interval [−b, b].
Proof of Lemma 10.11.1. Since b is in the interior of I, according to Theorem 10.6.2, the power series converges absolutely when x = b. Thus, we can choose a positive integer M such that for every N > M,
 
The difference on the left-hand side above is equal to the Nth tail of the series  If we denote this tail by tN, then for every N > M we have
 
Now consider any N > M and x ∈ [−b, b]. Then |x| ≤ b, and therefore |cnxn|≤ |cnbn| for every n. Combining this with our extended version of the triangle inequality, we find that
 
which is what we needed to prove.
We now turn to the proof of part 1 of the theorem. The hardest part of the proof is the verification of one-sided continuity of f at the endpoints of I, if those endpoints belong to I. We will put off this part of the proof until the end, and begin by proving that f is continuous on the interior of I.
Suppose that a is in the interior of I; we must prove that limx→a f (x) = f (a). We will use the ϵ-δ definition of this limit statement, so we begin by assuming that ϵ > 0.
Since a is in the interior of I, and I is an interval centered at 0, we can choose some b > 0 such that b is also in the interior of I and −b < a < b. Let δ1 = min(b−a, a −(−b)) > 0, so that −b ≤ a −δ1 < a < a +δ1 ≤ b. By Lemma 10.11.1, we can choose some N such that for all x ∈ [−b, b], | f (x)−sN (x)| < ϵ/3. Since sN is a polynomial, it is continuous at a, so we can choose δ2 > 0 so that if 0 < |x −a| < δ2 then |sN (x)−sN (a)| < ϵ/3. Let δ = min(δ1, δ2) > 0. We verify now that δ fulfills the requirements in the ϵ-δ limit definition.
Suppose that 0 < |x −a| < δ. Then 0 < |x −a| < δ2, so
 
Also, |x −a| < δ1, so a −δ1 < x < a +δ1, and therefore −b < x < b. Thus, a and x both belong to [−b, b], and therefore by the choice of N,
 
Combining (10.69) and (10.70) and applying the triangle inequality, we can now compute
 
This shows that limx→a f (x) = f (a). Since this conclusion holds for every a in the interior of I, we have shown that f is continuous on the interior of I.
Now we turn to the proof of part 3 of the theorem. Our plan is to prove that for all x ∈ I,
 
From this it will follow, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, that
 
In other words, on I,
 
as claimed in part 3 of the theorem.
Once again, we leave consideration of the endpoints of I for later; for the moment, we will focus on proving that (10.71) holds for x in the interior of I, and hence that part 3 holds on the interior of I. It is clear that (10.71) holds when x = 0, since both sides of the equation are 0. We now prove (10.71) for x > 0; a similar argument would work for x < 0.
Notice that for any N, it is easy to integrate sN, since it is a polynomial. We have
 
Thus, by the definition of infinite series,
 
Substituting into (10.71), we see that what we must prove is that
 
We prove this by using the definition of limits.
Suppose ϵ > 0. By Lemma 10.11.1, there is some positive integer M such that for all N > M and all t ∈ [−x, x], | f (t)−sN (t)| < ϵ/(2x), and therefore
 
Applying Corollary 5.3.8 to the right half of this inequality, we conclude that
 
Similarly, the left half implies that  Therefore
 
This completes the proof of (10.72), which establishes that part 3 of the theorem holds on the interior of I.
Using part 3 for the interior of I, we can now prove part 2. We begin by showing that the proposed series for f′(x) converges on the interior of I. Our method is similar to the one used in the proof of Lemma 10.6.3.
Suppose that x is in the interior of I. Then we can choose a number b such that b > |x| and b is also in I, so  converges. By Theorem 10.2.1, it follows that limn→∞ cnbn = 0, so there is some positive integer N such that for all n > N, |cnbn| < 1. Therefore for all n > N,
 
We leave it to you to check, using the ratio test, that  converges. By the comparison test, it follows that  converges, and therefore  converges. In other words, the series in part 2 of the theorem converges on the interior of I.
Let
 
As we have just seen, the interval of convergence for this series includes the interior of I. Applying part 3 for the interior of the interval of convergence, we can conclude that on the interior of I,
 
In other words, if we assign any value to C in the formula on the right above, then we get an antiderivative of g on the interior of I. Assigning the value C = c0, we get
 
Thus, f is an antiderivative of g on the interior of I, which means that for x in the interior of I,  
This proves part 2 of the theorem.
All that remains is to prove parts 1 and 3 at the endpoints of I, if those endpoints belong to I. For these proofs we will use a method called summation by parts. Recall the integration by parts formula for definite integrals:  The formula for summation by parts looks very similar:
Lemma 10.11.2 (Summation by Parts). For any numbers u0, u1, ..., uN, v0, v1, ..., vN+1,
 
Proof. The proof is just simple algebra:
 
 
Now suppose that b is the right endpoint of I, and b ∈ I. We will prove that parts 1 and 3 of the theorem can be extended to b; the proof for the left endpoint of I would be similar.
For part 1, we must prove that limx→b− f (x) = f (b). This is known as Abel's theorem, after Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829). It will simplify the proof if we assume initially that f (b) = 0. Later we will show how to eliminate this assumption.
For 0 < x < b, we have
 
We now apply summation by parts, with
 
and in general, for n ≥ 1,
 
With this choice of notation,
 
Thus, by the summation by parts lemma,
 
Rearranging this equation, we can say that
 
We now let N →∞ in (10.74). Notice that since 0 < x < b, limN→∞(x/b)N = 0, and
 
Applying these observations and equation (10.73), we see that when N →∞in (10.74), we get
 
In other words, if 0 < x < b then
 
We can now use equation (10.75), rather than the original power series representation of f (x), to prove that limx→b− f (x) = 0 = f (b). Suppose ϵ > 0. Since limn→∞ vn = f (b) = 0, we can choose a positive integer N such that for all n > N, |vn| < ϵ/2, and then we can rewrite equation (10.75) in the form
 
Our plan now is to show that, if x is close to b and less than b, then both terms on the right in (10.76) are small.
The second of these terms will be small as long as 0 < x < b. To see why, we use the extended triangle inequality, the fact that |vn| < ϵ/2 for n > N, and the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
 
 
The first term in (10.76) is a polynomial, so it is easy to see that
 
Thus, we can choose some δ1 > 0 such that if b−δ1 < x < b then
 
Now let δ = min(δ1, b) > 0, and suppose that b−δ < x < b. Since δ ≤ b, this implies that 0 < x < b, so (10.77) holds. And also δ ≤ δ1, so b−δ1 < x < b, and therefore (10.78) holds. Combining these with (10.76), we conclude that
 
This completes the proof that limx→b− f (x) = 0 = f (b).
To finish the proof of part 1 of the theorem, we must explain how to eliminate the assumption that f (b) = 0. If f (b) = 0, then we define g(x) = f (x)− f (b). Clearly g has the power series representation
g(x) = f (x)− f (b) = (c0 + c1x + c2x2 + · · ·)− f (b) = (c0 − f (b))+c1x +c2x2 + · · ·,
and this representation has the same interval of convergence as the series for f, namely I. But g(b) = f (b)− f (b) = 0, so by what we have just proven, g must be continuous from the left at b. Therefore
 
so f is also continuous from the left at b.
Finally, we extend part 3 of the theorem to the endpoint b. To do this, we must prove that (10.71) holds when x = b. In other words, we must show that
 
The hardest part of the proof is showing that the series on the right-hand side above converges. For this we will again use summation by parts.
As before, we let v0 = 0 and vn = c0 + c1b + · · ·+cn−1bn−1 for n ≥ 1, so that vn+1 −vn = cnbn. This time we let un = b/(n +1). Then for every positive integer N, the summation by parts lemma gives us
 
To prove convergence of the series in (10.79), we now want to let N →∞.
As we observed before, limn→∞ vn = f (b). It follows that there is some positive integer N such that for all n > N, |vn − f (b)| < 1, and therefore
 
We ask you in Exercise 2 to verify that the series
 
is a telescoping series that converges. We can then use the comparison test to conclude that
 
converges absolutely, and therefore, letting N →∞in (10.80), we get
 
Thus, the series on the right-hand side of (10.79) converges.
To complete the proof of (10.79), let
 
We have already shown that g(x) = h(x) for x in the interior of I. We now want to use continuity to extend this equation to b.
Since we have already extended part 1 of the theorem to b, we know that f is continuous from the left at b, so g(b) is defined. Furthermore, by the first fundamental theorem of calculus, g is differentiable from the left at b, and therefore also continuous from the left at b. We have also now shown that h(b) is defined, and applying part 1 of the theorem to h we know that h is also continuous from the left at b. Therefore
 
In other words, we have established equation (10.79), which completes the extension of part 3 of the theorem to b.

|a1 +a2 + · · · + aN|≤ |a1| + |a2| + · · ·+|aN |.
(Hint: Use the triangle inequality (Theorem 1.1.5) and mathematical induction.)
(b) Show that if a series  converges absolutely, then
 
(Hint: Use part (a) and the preservation of weak inequalities by limits (Corollary 2.8.9).)
2. Show that for any positive integer N and any numbers K and b, the series
 
converges. (Hint: Show that it is a telescoping series.)
3. For each positive integer N, let sN be the function with domain (−∞,∞) defined by the formula sN(x) = x/N . Let f be the function with domain (−∞,∞) defined by the formula f (x) = 0.
(a) Show that for every real number x, limN→∞ sN (x) = f (x).
(b) Show that the functions sN converge uniformly to f on the interval [−1, 1]. In other words, show that for every ϵ > 0 there is some positive integer M such that for every N > M and every x ∈ [−1, 1], | f (x)−sN (x)| < ϵ.
(c) Show that the functions sN do not converge uniformly to f on the interval (−∞,∞). In other words, show that it is not the case that for every ϵ > 0 there is some positive integer M such that for every N > M and every x ∈ (−∞,∞), | f (x)−sN (x)| < ϵ. (Hint: Suppose the functions sN do converge uniformly to f on (−∞,∞). Then in particular, letting ϵ = 1, there must be some positive integer M such that for every N > M and every x ∈ (−∞,∞), | f (x)−sN (x)| < 1. Now derive a contradiction by finding an N > M and an x ∈ (−∞,∞) such that | f (x)−sN (x)| ≥ 1.)

3Strictly speaking, series (10.29) and (10.30) are different; for example, their sequences of partial sums are different. However, their values, which are by definition the limits of their sequences of partial sums, are the same.
