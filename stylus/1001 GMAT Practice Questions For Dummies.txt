Introduction
Welcome to 1,001 GMAT Practice Questions For Dummies. Pay no mind to the dummies part of the title. Obviously, if you're gearing up to tackle an MBA program, you're no dummy. You've already successfully finished high school and college, and you might even have a master's degree. Now you're ready to take your education to a higher level.
What you have probably learned after skimming through admissions requirements is that many MBA programs include scores from the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) as an admissions requirement. So how do you prepare for such a rigorous exam? Clearly, you need to become familiar with the topics covered and the types of questions you'll be faced with. You need practice accompanied by pointers on how best to answer the questions. This book provides all the guidance you need. Along with its 1,001 relevant practice opportunities, this book gives answers and detailed explanations that show simple and effective ways to solve the often challenging GMAT questions. 
What You'll Find
This book serves as comprehensive, standalone preparation for the GMAT, or you can use it in conjunction with the latest edition of GMAT For Dummies (Wiley). Either way, this book helps you identify question types and content areas you need to work on. The practice questions are constructed to closely resemble the actual exam questions in both format and level of difficulty so that you will know what to expect when you take your exam. The abundance of questions gives you ample opportunity to practice until you're feeling confident and prepared on the big day.
If you miss a question, read the answer explanation and try to figure out where you went wrong. Go back and solve it again, this time avoiding your earlier mistake. Read the answer explanations for the questions you get right as well. Often, the answer explanation will reveal not only the solution to the question but also how to answer it most efficiently. This strategy helps you internalize concepts and skills.
Whatever you do, keep a positive spirit. This book contains challenging questions not unlike those you might encounter on the GMAT. These questions are not meant to discourage you but rather to show you how to solve and master them. 
How the Questions Are Organized
This book has two parts. The first part contains 1,001 practice questions divided among seven chapters. These chapters are organized around the four sections of the GMAT: Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA), Integrated Reasoning (IR), Quantitative, and Verbal. The second part of the book contains the answers and detailed answer explanations.
The AWA requires you to write an analytical critique of a presented argument. The IR questions require you to apply analytical reasoning and math skills to various data-intensive scenarios. The Quantitative section consists of problem solving and data sufficiency questions. These questions test your knowledge and understanding of arithmetic, basic probability and statistics, algebra, and geometry. The Verbal section consists of reading comprehension, sentence correction, and critical reasoning questions. These questions test your ability to read and comprehend unfamiliar written material, to recognize and apply the basic rules of standard written English, and to use logical reasoning and critical thinking.

It comes also with a free, one-year subscription to hundreds of practice questions online. Not only can you access this digital content anytime you want, on whichever device is available to you, but you can also track your progress and view personalized reports that show you which concepts you need to study the most.

Part 1
The Questions
IN THIS PART ...
Practice analytical writing questions.
Answer integrated reasoning questions.
Work on quantitative questions involving problem solving and data sufficiency.
Tackle reading comprehension and sentence correction questions.
Practice critical reasoning questions.







Chapter 1
Analytical Writing Assessment
The Analytical Writing Assessment on the GMAT is one question, presented at the beginning of your test. You are given the question prompt and then a reading passage of several paragraphs that presents an argument. Your task is to write a response to that passage that analyzes the logic presented in the passage. You need to agree or disagree with the argument's logic and explain why the flaws you see in the argument are problematic. 
The Problems You'll Work On
When working through the Analytical Writing Assessment questions presented here, be prepared to do the following: 
Read a longer passage than at any other point on the GMAT. It will present an argument, often around something related to business, education, or science, and that argument will contain flaws.
Analyze the argument for logical flaws and outline a response.
Write a four- to six-paragraph essay based on your outline in which you agree or disagree with the argument, and analyze the flaws within it.
Proofread the essay carefully before submitting it. 
What to Watch Out For
To increase your chances of scoring well, make sure to do the following: 
Firmly agree or disagree with the argument.
Give yourself enough time to plan, write, and proofread your essay.
Don't get drawn into an entirely personal response. Your essay must show logic and intelligence. 
For Questions 1 through 5, you will be asked to write a critique of the argument presented below. You may, for example, consider what questionable assumptions underline the thinking, what alternative explanations or counterexamples might weaken the conclusion, or what sort of evidence could help strengthen or refute the argument.
Read the argument and the instructions that follow it, and then make any notes that will help you plan your response. Write your response on a separate sheet of paper. If possible, type your essay on a computer or laptop. Observe the 30-minute time limit. 
1. A speaker at a role playing games event made the following statement:
"Although role playing games — or RPGs — such as Dungeons & Dragons have been widely criticized for having a negative effect on our youth, encouraging them to be 'nerds without social skills' as one reporter put it, this is not a valid viewpoint. If we look at a survey from last year, more young adults who play RPGs value social skills and courtesy than ever before by almost a 2 to 1 margin compared to the same survey from 10 years ago. This evidence suggests that RPGs are actually promoting social interaction and friendship among the young adults playing them. More people should play them."
Discuss how well-reasoned you find this argument. In your discussion, be sure to analyze the line of reasoning and the use of evidence in the argument. For example, you may need to consider what questionable assumptions underlie the thinking and what alternative examples or counterexamples might weaken the conclusion. You can also discuss what sort of evidence would strengthen or refute the argument, what changes in argument would make it more logically sound, and what, if anything, would help you better evaluate its conclusion. 
2. The following appeared in a promotional mailing sent by the publishers of a community directory, encouraging local businesses to buy an ad in the next edition:
"One of the best ways to reach new customers is also one of the cheapest. That's why it makes sense to purchase an ad in the Stipeville Business Directory! Local business owners who have purchased an ad in years past will tell you the same thing! Did you know that three of our town's top-ten doctors, two of our top-five caterers, and several of our top pet groomers bought ads last year? And we don't want to name names, but a local hairdresser forgot to place her ad before our deadline last year, and she reports that her business dropped by 5%! Well, she's buying an ad this year, and so should you! The Stipesville Business Directory is a must-buy for all local businesses!"
Discuss how well-reasoned you find this argument. In your discussion, be sure to analyze the line of reasoning and the use of evidence in the argument. For example, you may need to consider what questionable assumptions underlie the thinking and what alternative examples or counterexamples might weaken the conclusion. You can also discuss what sort of evidence would strengthen or refute the argument, what changes in argument would make it more logically sound, and what, if anything, would help you better evaluate its conclusion. 
3. A school board member recently made the following statement at a meeting:
"I'm concerned about how poorly the students at Richmeade Senior High School are scoring on their standardized tests. Their math tests scores were, in particular, dreadful, scoring about 20 points lower than the students at Richmeade Prep School, which you all know is just down the road. I've been investigating what the Prep School does differently and noticed that in April, they do not offer any extracurricular or special activities, including school field trips, dances, and shows, before the tests are given. They also require all students to take the exam in order to graduate. Therefore, I propose that we also ban extracurricular and special activities for the month of May since we give the test in June. That should help our students focus."
Discuss how well-reasoned you find this argument. In your discussion, be sure to analyze the line of reasoning and the use of evidence in the argument. For example, you may need to consider what questionable assumptions underlie the thinking and what alternative examples or counterexamples might weaken the conclusion. You can also discuss what sort of evidence would strengthen or refute the argument, what changes in argument would make it more logically sound, and what, if anything, would help you better evaluate its conclusion. 
4. A recent column in a conventional cosmetic industry newsletter noted:
"Many customers buy organic makeup products because they are concerned about the consequences of the widespread use of chemical class Zbt in the conventional cosmetics industry. It's part of our job to convince those customers that they're misinformed. You might begin by pointing out that while chemical class Zbt has been shown — in very high dosages — to cause scarring in animal studies, no study has ever show that its presence causes scarring on human test subjects. You can conclude by noting that there is clearly no reason for even the most concerned customer to waste her money on organic makeup products. Perfectly safe makeup, you can say, is available without the hassle of searching out organic cosmetics."
Discuss how well-reasoned you find this argument. In your discussion, be sure to analyze the line of reasoning and the use of evidence in the argument. For example, you may need to consider what questionable assumptions underlie the thinking and what alternative examples or counterexamples might weaken the conclusion. You can also discuss what sort of evidence would strengthen or refute the argument, what changes in argument would make it more logically sound, and what, if anything, would help you better evaluate its conclusion. 
5. A banking executive recently made the following comments in an address to shareholders:
"North Bank was once run out of a single storefront on Main Street. Now we have five satellite locations around North Town. However, North Bank was more profitable when it only had that single storefront than it is today with 6 locations. Therefore, I'm proposing that we close our five satellite locations and move all of our business to our original location. This will improve our profitability and customers will enjoy the nostalgic feel of doing their business at a single location."
Discuss how well-reasoned you find this argument. In your discussion, be sure to analyze the line of reasoning and the use of evidence in the argument. For example, you may need to consider what questionable assumptions underlie the thinking and what alternative examples or counterexamples might weaken the conclusion. You can also discuss what sort of evidence would strengthen or refute the argument, what changes in argument would make it more logically sound, and what, if anything, would help you better evaluate its conclusion.






Chapter 2
Integrated Reasoning
The GMAT Integrated Reasoning (IR) section consists of 12 multiple-part questions that must be completed in 30 minutes. Your answers for each of the multiple parts of an IR question must all be correct to get credit for the question. You have access to an onscreen calculator for this section of the test. The IR questions require you to apply critical reasoning and math skills to various data-intensive scenarios. The questions are presented in the following four different formats: 
Table Analysis questions present data in sortable tables. You use the data to choose one of two opposing answer choices for each of three statements.
Two-Part Analysis questions present a short written explanation of a situation or math problem in which two portions of related information are unknown. You are asked to make two choices, one for each of the unknown portions.
Graphics Interpretation questions present information in a graph or other visual image. You must complete two missing pieces of information in one or two statements by choosing from drop-down menus.
Multi-Source Reasoning questions present several sources of information, such as text material, graphs, diagrams, charts, and tables. You must synthesize the information and draw logical conclusions to answer three questions. Two of the questions are multiple-part questions. For these two questions, you choose one of two opposing answer choices for each of three statements. The other question is a five-option multiple-choice question, for which you must select the one best answer choice. 
The Problems You'll Work On
When working through the IR questions in this chapter, be prepared to 
Read and understand graphical or visual representations of information.
Recognize cause and effect.
Identify relationships in information. 
What to Watch Out For
Don't make these mistakes: 
Being confused because questions present excess data that you don't need.
Answering questions based on your personal knowledge instead of on the information given.
Failing to pace yourself so that you can answer all the questions in the given timeframe. 
6. The table shows data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Manufacturing and Trade Inventories and Sales, May 12, 2017, report on estimated sales, inventories, and inventories-to-sales ratios for domestic activities of retailers in the U.S. To make it easier to observe underlying trends and other non-seasonal movements, the data are adjusted for seasonal variations and, in the case of sales, for trading-day differences and holiday variations. The inventories to sales ratios show the relationship of the end-of-month values of inventory to the monthly sales. These ratios can be interpreted as indicating the number of months of inventory that are on hand. For example, a ratio of 2.5 indicates that a business has enough merchandise on hand to cover two and a half months of sales (Source: U.S. Bureau of the Census, Merchant Wholesalers: Inventories to Sales Ratio).
On the actual exam, the table is interactive, and you can sort it in ascending order by selecting the column title you want to sort by from the drop-down menu above the table. The table below is shown sorted by different column titles to simulate the exam.

Analyze the following information to answer Questions 22 through 24. 


Incentive Program (Tab 1)
Radio station WXXX is owned by Allmedia Investments, Inc. WXXX generates revenue by selling advertising air time. However, due to competition from the internet, television, newspapers, and other radio stations, bringing in advertising dollars is a competitive challenge for WXXX.
To sustain station profitability, WXXX station manager, Rock Talley, with guidance from Kathy Chen, Allmedia's chief financial officer, created an incentive program to increase annual first-quarter revenues. Under the program, current clients who increase their first-quarter advertising dollars by an additional $25,000 receive an all-expenses-paid 12-day tour of Spain for two people. New clients must purchase $25,000 of advertising to be eligible.
The first quarter of the program ran from January 1 to March 31 of the current year. Throughout the quarter, each client received advertising air time for the $25,000. The cost to WXXX for the trip to Spain was $3,500 for each of the two people, for a total of $7,000 per client.


Talley Memo to Chen (Tab 2)
From: Rock Talley, WXXX Station Manager
To: Kathy Chen, CFO, Allmedia Investments, Inc.
I have two primary concerns about the WXXX advertising incentive program. First, I suspect that clients are purchasing advertising air time that they don't need in order to obtain the paid trip to Spain. One couple, who has a family-owned business, told me pointblank that the station's offer induced them to buy the additional advertising. I'm worried that we may be encouraging clients such as this one, who have small businesses and do not employ a paid financial manager, to make unsound business decisions.
Second, based on the results from the first quarter (see the attached table), the incentive program does not appear to be cost-effective. WXXX pays the full cost of $7,000 for the trip to Spain, and it requires a minimum of $10,000 to cover the advertising air time costs for the time sold in the incentive package to the client. Thus, we need $17,000 in additional monies from each incentive program participant to break even from the program. We should be realizing a net profit of $8,000 per client participant. However, in actuality, because our sales personnel offered reduced rates to current clients that had quarterly contracts, only a few clients paid the full $25,000 that was necessary for program eligibility.

The table shows the business name of each client who participated in the incentive program during the first quarter, the total amount of advertising dollars received from the client upon accepting the station's trip offer, and the amount of these advertising dollars that are additional monies not already accounted for in a quarterly contract with the client.

Memo to district administrators from Superintendent Chewel (Tab 1)
From: Superintendent Chewel, Cityville ISD
To: All district administrators
This memo is to inform you of an exciting initiative that has been approved by the Cityville Independent School District Board of Trustees. The board has established a committee consisting of representative teachers and administrators from across the district, a school board member, parent members, and student representatives to implement a district-wide campaign to increase water consumption by students in Cityville ISD schools. The committee has already received federal and state authorization for the campaign. The campaign will be known as the Drink Water Campaign, or the DW Campaign, for short.
The idea for this campaign came to the board from a local dental hygienist who presented compelling evidence from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Dental Association, and the American Dental Hygienists Association on the importance of water consumption to the oral health of children. The two main takeaways of the hygienist's presentation are the following: 
Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), such as soda, provide calories with no beneficial nutrients and are associated with a greater risk of dental caries.
Given that 63 percent of youth in the U.S. consume at least one SSB daily, there is a need to motivate children to drink water instead of SSBs.
As across the U.S., the 84,000 students in Cityville ISD schools do not drink enough water, with many preferring instead to drink SSBs, which puts them at risk of dental caries. The primary goal of the DW Campaign is to increase water consumption, while decreasing SSB consumption, by students in Cityville ISD schools for the purpose of improving their oral health.
A logic model and narrative for the campaign are attached.

Logic Model Narrative (Tab 3)
This logic model for the Drink Water (DW) campaign graphically depicts a campaign to increase consumption of water, in lieu of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), by students in Cityville ISD schools for the purpose of improving their oral health. The model shows the logical connections that flow from inputs to outputs to short-, intermediate-, and long-term outcomes. Enlisting the support of parents and the parent teacher organization (PTO) is vital to the campaign's success. Also, the assistance of state- and district-level partners/stakeholders including the State Department of Health Services Oral Health Program (DSHS OHP), the school Health Advisory Council (SHAC), and the State Dental Association (SDA) will increase the likelihood of anticipated outcomes. Evaluation will occur on a yearly basis by analysis of data from parent and teacher surveys regarding student water and other-beverage consumption behavior, and from parents' reports of their children's oral health.

Chapter 4
Quantitative: Data Sufficiency
The Data Sufficiency questions are mixed in with the Problem Solving questions to make up the 37 questions of the GMAT Quantitative section, which must be completed in 75 minutes. (The directions for the specific question types will be presented each time they appear.) Data Sufficiency questions are exclusive to the GMAT. Each Data Sufficiency question poses a question, followed by two statements. Your task is to evaluate the statements to determine at what point there is or is not sufficient information to answer the question. Unlike the Problem Solving questions, you do not actually have to answer the question posed. Instead, you select one of five fixed answer choices that offer different options about the sufficiency of the information provided in the two statements. Remember: The five answer choices are exactly the same and in the same order for each question. No calculators are permitted during the Quantitative section. 
The Problems You'll Work On
When working through the Data Sufficiency questions in this chapter, be prepared to select your answer choice based on your understanding of 
Basic math, including fractions, decimals, ratios and proportions, percent, and exponents.
Probability and Statistics, including counting techniques, permutations and combinations, basic probability, arithmetic mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
Algebra, including polynomials, linear equations and inequalities, quadratic equations, basic function concepts, and systems of linear equations.
Geometry, including angles, lines, two-dimensional shapes, three-dimensional solids, perimeter, area, surface area, volume, the Pythagorean theorem, and coordinate geometry.
Word problems, including percentages, rate-time-distance, consecutive integers, ages, work rate, coins, mixtures, divisibility, factors, sequences, and equation setup. 
What to Watch Out For
Don't make these mistakes: 

Failing to memorize the five fixed answer choices so you don't have to refer to them.
Failing to check whether the second statement is sufficient when the first statement is determined to be sufficient.
When the question posed is a yes or no question, carelessly deciding about sufficiency without ensuring that a definite yes or no answer is possible.
Spending too much time on a question that it is too difficult for you, instead of making a guess and moving on.

Questions 496 through 501 are based on the following passage. 


Literature in the second half of the twentieth century in the United States bears only a faint resemblance to the writing accomplished between 1900 and 1950. Early in the century, arguments as to what distinguished American literature from British led to the emphasis on plain character and plain language that marked the writing done in both realism and naturalism. Then, with the modernist sweep to overthrow most existing literary traditions (always using Ezra Pound's rationale that making it new was to be primary), the innovation that made American poetry, fiction, and drama of keen interest to the world settled in.
By 1950, however, traditional aesthetic innovation was wearing thin. The United States had endured the Great Depression, a long decade of hardship that not only dampened the promise of the American dream but changed literary methods to a surprising extent. The amalgam of cryptic modernist innovation and almost sentimental proselytizing that characterized the collective, proletarian novel and the speech-lined poems of the Depression gave rise to incredible variety: despite the paper shortages of World War II, published writing in the United States continued to be influential. It is in the aftermath of the war, once people had righted their perceptions about causation and blame, and had admitted again the atrocity of war itself (as well as of the Holocaust and the atomic bomb), that literature — whether called contemporary or postmodern — began to change.

Questions 502 through 506 are based on the following passage. 


Incandescent lamps, like the sun, produce light by burning; the light they emit is a by-product of heat. Only a tiny percentage — 5 percent or less — of the energy used by an incandescent lamp produces light. The balance of the energy used produces heat, so incandescent lamps are supremely inefficient. But, like the sun, incandescent sources emit the visible wavelengths as a continuous band. Candlelight, firelight, and incandescent lamplight are sensed as familiar and comforting because they provide light in the same way the sun does. The apparent whiteness of the light given off by an incandescent lamp depends on the temperature at which it burns, called its color temperature.

Questions 507 through 510 are based on the following passage. 


In 1971, Robert James Fischer (nicknamed Bobby) shocked the chess world by winning 19 consecutive games against an extremely high level of competition. This feat has been compared to throwing back-to-back no-hitters in major league baseball. During his peak playing period, from the mid 1960s into the early '70s, players spoke of "Fischer Fever," where they felt ill just having to play against him. Just as with José Rail Capablanca, Fischer had an aura of invincibility — which wasn't far from the truth. Fischer was head and shoulders above the best players of his day.
His abrupt withdrawal from chess was tragic. Rumors of Fischer sightings were rampant, and the public was often tantalized by stories of his impending reemergence. Unfortunately, Fischer waited more than 20 years before playing in public again. His behavior, always intense, became increasingly odd over the years and prevented him from ever again competing at the highest level.

Questions 511 through 514 are based on the following passage. 


The world of Minecraft is made of cubic blocks, materials such as dirt or stone that you can break down and rebuild into houses or craft into useful items. A block made of a material such as sand is referred to as a sand block. Because the side length of every block measures 1 meter, most distances are measured in blocks as well: If you read about an object that's located "three blocks up," it's the distance from the ground to the top of a stack of three blocks. In addition to building and crafting, you have to defend against monsters and eventually face them head-on. As the game progresses, your goal becomes less about surviving and more about building structures, gathering resources, and facing challenges to gain access to more blocks and items.

Questions 515 through 519 are based on the following passage. 


The "morning star" isn't a star; it's always a planet. And sometimes two Morning Stars appear at once, such as Mercury and Venus. The same idea applies to the "evening star": You're seeing a planet, and you may see more than one. "Shooting stars" and "falling stars" are misnomers, too. These "stars" are meteors — the flashes of light caused by small meteoroids falling through Earth's atmosphere. Many of the "superstars" you see on television may be just flashes in the pan, but they at least get 15 minutes of fame.

Questions 520 through 525 are based on the following passage. 


The United States Constitution is the oldest, continuous, national republican document in existence today. It was not the first. Republics, or mixed regimes as they are also known, existed long before the Americans crafted theirs in 1787. Most did not last very long. In the ancient world, the Roman republic collapsed when it degenerated into empire. During the Renaissance, the Florentine republic in Italy survived a mere 14 years, from 1498 to 1512. It dissolved when the powerful Medici family, which had once ruled Florence, re-established a dictatorship.
According to the classical republican tradition, republics were fragile political organizations, because the critical balance between the various branches of government could easily crumble when one or two dominated the others. The Americans modeled their constitution on the British government with its one-person executive and two-part legislature. The British failed to create a true republic, because a hereditary monarch led the executive branch and hereditary aristocrats controlled the upper house, the unelected House of Lords. Large landowners controlled the House of Commons and only a few men possessed the right to vote. Americans believed that after separating from the British Empire, they could create a true republican structure where citizens participated in decision-making and enjoyed peaceful transitions of power.

Questions 526 through 530 are based on the following passage. 


Video has become a common element that you should consider in the design of your website. The soaring popularity of YouTube, its influence in search engine rankings, and the amount of times it is shared through social media have contributed to the widespread acceptance and use of online video for all sorts of purposes. For some sites, this capability becomes an intricate design element. For others, it may be considered only as a marketing tool. Research supports the idea that video increases customer engagement (how the customer interacts with your site and brand) and can increase product sales (when using video for product reviews or testimonials, for example). You must weigh the pros and cons of video and decide where and when it will be used across your site, along with how to use it in a way that supports, rather than detracts, from your site's usability.

Questions 531 through 536 are based on the following passage. 


A more serious hazard associated with canned food is botulism, the potentially fatal form of food poisoning that may result if the food is not heated for a sufficient period of time to a temperature high enough to kill all Clostridium botulinum (or C. botulinum) spores. C. botulinum is an anaerobic (an = without; aerobic = air) organism that thrives in the absence of oxygen, a condition nicely fulfilled by a sealed can. If a low-acid food (such as green beans or peas or potatoes) is incorrectly canned, botulinum spores not destroyed by high heat during the canning process may produce a toxin that can kill by paralyzing muscles, including the heart muscle and the muscles that enable you to breathe.
To avoid potentially hazardous canned food, don't buy, store, or use any can that is:

Swollen: The swelling suggests that bacteria are growing inside and producing gas.
Damaged, rusted, or deeply dented along the seam: A break in the can permits air to enter and may promote the growth of organisms other than C. botulinum.

Questions 537 through 541 are based on the following passage. 


Just as individual stock prices can plummet, so can individual real estate property prices. In California during the 1990s, for example, earthquakes rocked the prices of properties built on landfills. These quakes highlighted the dangers of building on poor soil. In the decade prior, real estate values in the communities of Times Beach, Missouri, and Love Canal, New York, plunged because of carcinogenic toxic waste contamination.

Questions 542 through 547 are based on the following passage. 


To the uninitiated, the world of intellectual property often appears an impenetrable collision of legal, scientific and economic themes. Indeed, the study of intellectual property draws from these three disciplines in a way that our educational and philosophical systems struggle to reconcile. Technically-expert lawyers, scientists and economists find it equally difficult to adopt a holistic overview and to look beyond their specialized field. Whilst Patent Offices have recently intensified their efforts to be more accessible, publishing readable introductions to the very basic terms of intellectual property, and guides to initial patent application, these laudable efforts fail to penetrate the heart of the problem as we see it: the connection of legal procedure, beyond its mere application, with technological development and the business strategy that drives it.

(B) People who file for patents often do not understand the process for doing so, even when supplied with information about how to go about it. The information provided must be improved. 
(C) A good education for a teenager is the result of teachers, administrators, and the student him- or herself working together to understand how best to move forward. 
(D) Many people who feel that they understand the practice of law quite well are, in fact, deluded. The American legal system is extraordinarily complex, and most Americans have not even made the basic effort to understand it.

Questions 548 through 552 are based on the following passage. 


You can't chop vegetables, slice meat, or whip up a cake batter if you can't even fit a cutting board or a mixing bowl on your counter, so take a good look at your countertops. What's on them? Coffeemakers, blenders, food processors, racks of spice jars or canisters of flour and sugar, stacks of bills, permission slips, and grade school art projects? Is your countertop doubling as a magazine rack, plant holder, or wine rack? Consider this: Your kitchen counters aren't meant to be storage units. They are meant to be food preparation areas. A clean, clear counter space can inspire the creation of a great meal. A cluttered one is more likely to inspire a call to the pizza delivery guy.
If your kitchen counter is cluttered with paraphernalia beyond usefulness, that's a problem you can fix. The ultimate test for whether something should be allowed valuable countertop real estate is how often you use it. If you use an appliance or food ingredient (like coffee or flour) almost every day, then go ahead and give it hallowed ground. Otherwise, stow it. Be ruthless. Put away the mixer, the food processor, the bread machine, and the rice cooker. Away with the herb and spice rack, the bottles of nut oil and fancy vinegar. Find a better spot for the mail and the bills. As you rid your counters of this clutter, you also get rid of your excuses for not having the space to cook dinner.

Questions 553 through 558 are based on the following passage. 


High-level programming languages must be converted to low-level programming languages using an interpreter or compiler, depending on the language. Interpreted languages are considered more portable than compiled languages, while compiled languages execute faster than interpreted languages. However, the speed advantage compiled languages have is starting to fade in importance as improving processor speeds make performance differences between interpreted and compiled languages negligible.
High-level programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Ruby are interpreted. For these languages the interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement one line at a time into machine code. High-level programming languages like C++, COBOL, and Visual Basic are compiled. For these languages, after the code is written a compiler translates all the code into machine code, and an executable file is created. This executable file is then distributed via the internet, CD-ROMs, or other media and run. Software you install on your computer, like Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X, are coded using compiled languages, usually C or C++.

Questions 559 through 564 are based on the following passage. 


Any gardener recognizes the value of pollinating insects. Various insects perform an essential service in the production of seed and fruit. The survival of plants depends on pollination. You may not have thought much about the role honey bees play in our everyday food supply. It is estimated that in North America around 30 percent of the food we consume is produced from bee-pollinated plants. Bees also pollinate crops, such as clover and alfalfa that cattle feed on, making bees important to our production and consumption of meat and dairy. The value of pollination by bees is estimated at around $16 billion in the United States alone.
These are more than interesting facts; these are realities with devastating consequences if bees were to disappear. And sadly, the health of honey bees has been compromised in recent years. Indeed a spring without bees could endanger our food supply and impact our economy. It's a story that has become headline news in the media.

Questions 565 through 570 are based on the following passage. 


Step outside on a clear night and look at the sky. If you're a city dweller or live in a cramped suburb, you see dozens, maybe hundreds, of twinkling stars. Depending on the time of the month, you may also see a full Moon and up to five of the eight planets that revolve around the Sun. A shooting star or "meteor" may appear overhead. What you actually see is the flash of light from a tiny piece of comet dust streaking through the upper atmosphere. Another pinpoint of light moves slowly and steadily across the sky. Is it a space satellite, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, or just a high-altitude airliner? If you have a pair of binoculars, you may be able to see the difference. Most airliners have running lights, and their shapes may be perceptible. If you live in the country — on the seashore away from resorts and developments, on the plains, or in the mountains far from any floodlit ski slope — you can see thousands of stars. The Milky Way appears as a beautiful pearly swath across the heavens. What you're seeing is the cumulative glow from millions of faint stars, individually indistinguishable with the naked eye. At a great observation place, such as Cerro Tololo in the Chilean Andes, you can see even more stars. They hang like brilliant lamps in a coal black sky, often not even twinkling, like in van Gogh's "Starry Night" painting.

Questions 571 through 575 are based on the following passage. 


The Constitution created a democratic republic, not a democracy. In a democracy, citizens vote directly on government policies, while in a republic, they elect representatives to develop policies on their behalf. Vestiges of democracy remain in America. They include the New England town meeting when residents directly vote on issues, such as whether the town should purchase a new police cruiser. The ballot initiative, also called the referendum, exists in over 40 states, allowing voters to make specific policies, such as whether a state should repeal its capital punishment law. Most laws in the United States today, however, are passed by representatives elected by the citizens. This system comprises the republic.

Questions 576 through 580 are based on the following passage. 


Color temperature in light sources is a measurement of heat in degrees Kelvin (K). Color temperatures over 5,000 K, the hottest, are sensed as sharp, clear blue-white. In contradictory language the color of light delivered by this hot radiation is referred to as "cool." Temperatures around 2,700-3,000 K, actually cooler, are perceived as warm in color, tilting toward yellow and red. The heat- light- color relationship is recognized in colloquial language; something that is "white- hot" is dangerously hotter than something "red- hot."

Questions 581 through 586 are based on the following passage. 


Huey Long was a traveling salesman, a lawyer, and a world-class demagogue. He was elected governor of Louisiana in 1928 on a populist platform, and he actually did some good things for the state, such as making school text-books free and improving roads and highways. But he also ran a corrupt administration that was not above roughing up, blackmailing, or slandering those who opposed him. By 1930, the "Kingfish" was as close to an absolute dictator as there was in the country. He controlled the legislature and, after winning a U.S. Senate seat, refused to promptly vacate the governor's office, thus holding both jobs for a while.
Originally an FDR supporter, Long broke with the White House mostly for egotistical reasons. He proposed a "Share Our Wealth" program that called for confiscating family fortunes of more than $5 million and annual incomes over $1 million and guaranteeing every family $2,500 a year, a homestead, and a car. Long had a national following and announced he would run against FDR at the head of a third party in 1936. Private polls showed he might garner 4 million votes, enough to tip the election to the Republicans. But he never got the chance. In September 1935, Long was shot to death on the steps of the Louisiana capitol by a man whose family he had ruined.

Questions 593 through 599 are based on the following passage. 


Slide an apple pie in the oven, and soon the kitchen fills with an aroma that makes your mouth water and your digestive juices flow. But boil some cabbage and — what is that awful smell? It's sulfur, the same chemical you smell in rotten eggs. Cruciferous vegetables (the name comes from crux, the Latin word meaning cross, a reference to their x-shape blossoms), such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, kohlrabi, mustard seed, radishes, rutabaga, turnips, and watercress, all contain stinky sulfur compounds such as sulforaphane glucosinolate (SGSD), glucobrassicin, gluconapin, gluconasturtin, neoglucobrassicin, and sinigrin whose aromas are liberated when the food is heated.

Questions 600 through 606 are based on the following passage. 


The largest part of the brain, which is what you actually see when you look at a brain from above or the side, is the neocortex. The neocortex is really a 1.5 square foot sheet of cells wadded up a bit to fit inside the head. The neurons in the neocortex form a complex neural circuit that is repeated millions of times across the cortical surface. This repeated neural circuit is called a minicolumn.
The brain contains many specialized areas associated with particular senses (vision versus audition, for example) and other areas mediating particular motor outputs (like moving the leg versus the tongue). The function of different brain areas depends not on any particular structure of the minicolumns within it, but its inputs and outputs. So even though the cell types and circuits in the auditor cortex are similar to those in the visual and motor cortices, the auditory cortex is the auditory cortex because it receives inputs from the cochlea (a part of the ear) and because it sends output to areas associated with processing auditory information and using it to guide behavior.

Questions 607 through 611 are based on the following passage. 


David Packard, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, said, "You are likely to die not of starvation for opportunities, but of indigestion of opportunities." Most small businesses succeed in keeping their owners more than busy — in some cases, too busy. If you provide needed products or services at a fair price, customers will beat a path to your door. Your business will grow and be busier than you can personally handle. You may need to start hiring people. I know small-business owners who work themselves into a frenzy by putting in 70 or more hours a week.
If you enjoy your work so much that it's not really work and you end up putting in long hours because you enjoy it, terrific! But success in your company can cause you to put less energy into other important aspects of your life that perhaps don't come as easily.

Questions 612 through 615 are based on the following passage. 


Kale is a strong winter green that's increasingly finding its way to the summer table. Although it's traditionally sautéed, baked, or simmered in stews and soups, inventive cooks have found that treating it to a massage turns this tough cookie of a green into one that's soft and silky. You'll find two kinds of kale at your market: curly and lacinato, also known as Tuscan or dinosaur kale ("dino" for short). Lacinato is less fibrous and grassy tasting than curly kale, and we recommend it over curly kale for making salads.

Questions 621 through 625 are based on the following passage. 


Sunflowers are made up of two families, and they provide the bees with both pollen and nectar. Each family is readily grown from seed, but you may find some nurseries that carry them as potted plants. When you start sunflowers early in the season, make sure you use peat pots. They are rapid growers that transplant better when you leave their roots undisturbed by planting the entire pot. Helianthus annuus include the well-known giant sunflower as well as many varieties of dwarf and multi-branched types. Sunflowers no longer are only tall and yellow. They come in a wide assortment of sizes (from 2 to 12 feet) as well as a range of colors (from white to rust). There are several varieties with a mixture of colors. Watch out for the hybrid that is pollenless because it is of little use to the bees. Several varieties will easily self-seed, even in the cold Northeast.

Questions 626 through 630 are based on the following passage. 


Early republics defined citizens as only male property owners and excluded all others. Landowning citizens possessed a stake in society; they were public spirited and had the desire and qualifications to participate in decision-making. No one held office for a long period of time, because when citizens rotate in and out of office they avoid corrupting influences. The great Renaissance theorist Niccolo Machiavelli argued in his Discourses on Livy that this public spiritedness promoted virtue the highest ideal a republican citizen could achieve. Rooted in the Latin res publica, the term republic literally means the "public thing." In the eighteenth century, the American Constitution framers used the word republic, or res publica, to refer to the "common good," the "public good," or the "good of all."

Questions 635 through 640 are based on the following passage. 


The earth formed 4.5 billion years ago. Evolutionary biologists believe that single-celled prokaryotic life (cells without a cell nucleus) appeared on earth less than one billion years after that. What's remarkable about this date is that geophysicists believe this was the earliest point at which the planet had cooled enough to sustain life. In other words, life appeared almost the instant (in geological time) that it was possible. For unknown reasons, it took more than another billion years for Eukaryotic life (cells with nuclei) to appear, another billion years for multicellular life to evolve from eukaryotic cells, and another billion years for humans to appear — which we did less than a million years ago.

Questions 647 through 652 are based on the following passage. 


Color is, first, a sensory event. Every color experience begins as a physiological response to a stimulus of light. Colors of light are experienced in two very different ways. The colors on a monitor screen are seen as direct light. The colors of the real world— of printed pages, physical objects, and the surrounding environment— are seen as reflected light.
The perception of colors seen as direct light is straightforward: wavelengths of light reach the eye directly from a light source. The experience of real-world color is a more complex event. Real-world colors are seen indirectly, as light reflected from a surface. For tangible objects and printed pages, light is the cause of color, colorants (like paints, inks, or dyes) are the means used to generate color, and the colors that are seen are the effect.

Questions 653 through 656 are based on the following passage. 


Indeed, the whole concept of "politics" changes during the latter half of the twentieth century. Early on, United States politics in regard to literature was a more limited reflection of European dissatisfactions, played out in the inevitable, and usually clamorous, battles of "left" and "right." In literary circles, the bleak influence of European existentialism changed the priorities of, particularly, drama, but also led to worldwide recognition of such fiction writers as William Faulkner, Nelson Algren, James Agee, Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright, and John Steinbeck. European opinion colored the critical reception of much United States writing.
By the later twentieth century, however, after the furor of the challenging 1960s rights movements in both race and gender, "politics" took on a much more inclusive definition. Rather than being rooted in governmental policies, it stemmed from the deepest dichotomy possible: that of the human being set in opposition to the non-human.

Questions 657 through 659 are based on the following passage. 


In February 1819, the territory of Missouri petitioned Congress to be admitted as a state. At the time, America consisted of 11 slave and 11 free states, so the question was whether Missouri, with 10,000 slaves, should be admitted as a slave state or be forced to free its slaves before it was allowed into the fold. Debate on the issue raged across the country. Finally, Henry Clay crafted a compromise in March 1820. Under the aptly named Missouri Compromise, Missouri was admitted as a slave state, and the territory of Maine came in as a free state, keeping a balance of 12 slave and 12 free.

Verbal: Sentence Completion
The Sentence Completion section on the GMAT is about 12 questions in the Verbal section of the GMAT. These questions will be mixed in with the Reading Comprehension and Critical Reasoning questions, but the directions specifically for each type of question will be presented each time they appear. In the Sentence Completion section, you are presented with a sentence that may contain a grammatical error in the underlined portion. The first answer choice presents the underline portion as written, while the following answer choices make corrections in some way. 
The Problems You'll Work On
When working through the Reading Comprehension questions presented here, be prepared to 
Read the entire sentence to determine what type of sentence it is, and look for errors.
Focus on the underlined portion of the sentence and locate the error.
Be familiar with common types of grammatical errors, including in subject-verb agreement; pronoun usage; language about amount or size; placement of phrases; and more.
Determine the correct answer and make sure it fits in the sentence as a whole. 
What to Watch Out For
Try to avoid these common traps: 
Errors that are not in the underlined portion; you can't fix those.
Sentences that are written in a complicated fashion but are actually correct.
Small errors in subject-verb agreement, which are easy to miss.

Chapter 7
Verbal: Critical Reasoning
The Critical Reasoning section on the GMAT consists of about 12 questions in the Verbal section of the GMAT. These questions will be mixed in with the Reading Comprehension and Sentence Completion questions, but the directions specifically for each type of question will be presented each time they appear.
In Critical Reasoning, you are shown a passage that presents an argument of some kind (often dealing with a business, government, or education topic). Some passages have multiple questions. You must choose the answer that best answers the question based on your understanding of the logic in the passage. 
The Problems You'll Work On
When working through the Reading Comprehension questions presented here, be prepared to 
Read the entire passage and be able to summarize the logical argument presented there.
Understand what the question is asking for you to do, which will often be to find a way to strengthen or weaken the argument.
Choose the answer that best fits with what the question is asking. 
What to Watch Out For
Try to avoid these common pitfalls: 
Answers that fix the argument in the passage but do not answer the question posed.
Attempts to make you take leaps forward in inferring. Instead, take small hops in logic.
Answers that play to your natural assumptions. Instead, look clearly at the passage's logic.
Dialogues: They seem like conversations, but they still present arguments.  
Questions 839 through 840 are based on the following passage.

Pineapple farmers earn a higher price when the fruit is more difficult to find in grocery stores. When the crop is plentiful, the price drops.

(C) Morning hours would allow the clinic to see, on average, 20 additional patients per day. 
(D) Many people in Davis County rely on the clinic for basic health care services, such as vaccinations. 
(E) Lyme Disease has been on the rise in Davis County over the last year. 
Questions 990 through 991 are based on the following passage. 


The owner of a store in Fernville says, "If we want to save our downtown shopping area, we need to protest the opening of a CheapDeals on the outskirts of our town! CheapDeals is a menace. They opened a store in St. Barbara last year, and 20 percent of the stores in that town filed for bankruptcy! St. Barbara didn't protest the arrival of CheapDeals, but we're not going to make the same mistake here in Fernville!" 
990. The conclusion to the argument presented is based on which of the following assumptions? 
(A) Bankruptcy is an unfortunate but likely part of running a business. 
(B) People tend to support local businesses when they know the store owners. 
(C) CheapDeals does not want bad publicity. 
(D) More people would shop in Fernville's downtown if they knew more about the stores there. 
(E) CheapDeals won't build in a town where they have been clearly told they are not welcome. 
991. The store owner quoted could strengthen his argument with which of the following facts, if true? 
(A) CheapDeals often undercuts the price of local competitors. 
(B) The downtown shopping area is a historical landmark. 
(C) CheapDeals tries to keep a low-profile; the publicity from a protest has kept the company from setting up shop in other towns. 
(D) St. Barbara's shop owners held several protests against CheapDeals. 
(E) The land CheapDeals is looking to purchase is not actually in what is considered downtown. 
Questions 992 through 993 are based on the following passage. 


An exhibit of the Royal jewels is planned for the museum's upcoming season. In deciding insurance costs, the director the museum said, "We do not need to insure the smaller items. Insuring the larger jewels, such as the tiaras and crowns, will be sufficient. If the larger pieces are stolen, the amount we will receive will more than cover the cost of all the jewels." 
992. What of the following facts, if true, would most seriously weaken the director's logic? 
(A) The insurance company may not allow the larger jewels to be insured for more than they're worth. 
(B) If the jewels were to be stolen, thieves might target the smaller items, which will be displayed less securely, rather than the larger items. 
(C) Some of the smaller jewels have quite large stones. 
(D) The jewels will be displayed in several rooms. 
(E) The museum's security system was recently overhauled and is now widely agreed to be among the best in the world. 
993. The logical flaw in the reasoning is most similar to that in which of the following statements? 
(A) "I'm not going to buy insurance on my boat because we rarely have flooding or typhoons here." 
(B) "Let's try all of the flavors before deciding on which one we want to have for our cake." 
(C) "I'm going to reserve the most expensive dining room, which will be big enough to hold all of us. If some of the group doesn't come along, we can move to a smaller room." 
(D) "I put on sunscreen before leaving the house, but I didn't bother with insect repellent. The sunblock should be strong enough to keep away any mosquitos that show up." 
(E) "The jewelry case needs to be as far back from the window as possible. That's the only way I can think of to protect it if someone hurls a rock or a brick through the window." 
Questions 994 through 995 are based on the following passage. 


"If the student body wants to have more parking spots at our school," Principal Lavine said, "they need to raise the money to buy the field in front of the school building so that it can be turned into a parking lot. We're out of options since the faculty parking lot takes up the property behind the building, and Lake Matteo is on one side, while parking for visitors and parents is on the other." 
994. What role does the portion of the passage in bold play in the argument? 
(A) It is an inference used in the creation of the argument. 
(B) It is an assumption that feeds the argument. 
(C) It presents facts in support of the argument. 
(D) It presents a premise upon which the argument is based. 
(E) It is the conclusion of the argument. 
995. Which of the following facts, if true, would most weaken the argument presented? 
(A) The field in front of the school building is prohibitively expensive. 
(B) The parking for visitors and parents is rarely used, so 30 empty spaces are often available next to the school but forbidden to the students. 
(C) Turning a field into a parking lot is not an easy task. 
(D) Lake Matteo often floods in the springtime. 
(E) The student government has been asking for more parking for the last three years because the majority of students drive to school. 
Questions 996 through 998 are based on the following passage. 


Julian noticed a strange discrepancy when he visited the city of New Winchester. The city has numerous corner stores that sell candy and other small purchases, but there are well-stocked grocery stores around town that sell the same products for far less money. 
996. Which of the following would prove least helpful for Julian to study in order to find the reason for the discrepancy? 
(A) A map of New Winchester, marking the location of all corner stores and grocery stores. 
(B) A list of the most purchased items at a corner store. 
(C) A survey of New Winchester shoppers about their buying preferences. 
(D) A historical map showing the growth of neighborhoods in New Winchester. 
(E) A spreadsheet of the average purchases at a corner store in New Winchester. 
997. What fact, if true, could help explain the discrepancy that Julian has noted? 
(A) New Winchester's grocery stores are not as numerous as its corner stores. 
(B) The grocery stores are located on the outskirts of town, whereas the corner stores are in residential areas. 
(C) Most people prefer fewer choices. 
(D) The grocery stores publish lavish sales bills, which are left around town for people to pick up. 
(E) The corner stores often lower the price by a few cents if a customer does not have exact change. 
998. Which of the following is a logical conclusion for Julian to make? 
(A) There must be something appealing about the corner stores that make people willing to spend slightly more money there than at the grocery store. 
(B) New Winchester citizens are very loyal shoppers. 
(C) The grocery stores must provide terrible customer service. 
(D) The corner stores must offer some sort of frequent shopper incentive. 
(E) There must be racial/ethnic reasons why people shop where they do. 
Questions 999 through 1,000 are based on the following passage. 


The small country of Mapple could, in theory, be the world's largest exporter of lettuce, but it isn't. The explanation is that 75 percent of Mapple's farmland is owned by the government. This hurts Mapple's lettuce production because the government doesn't have the flexibility necessary for efficient lettuce farming that private industry possesses. 
999. The answer to which of the following questions would be most relevant to evaluating the adequacy of the explanation? 
(A) Who owns the 15 percent of the farmland that isn't owned by the government? 
(B) How does lettuce production from Mapple's government-owned farmland compared to production from farmland owned by private industries? 
(C) Would a larger country be better suited to producing lettuce than Mapple? 
(D) What percentage of Mapple's lettuce is consumed domestically? 
(E) Has the government stated any plans to sell farmland to private industry, provided that the price is fair? 
1000. Which of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the argument? 
(A) Mapple's lettuce production is still five times what it was 10 years ago. 
(B) Lettuce is a hardy crop and can withstand a great deal of fluctuation in water and sunlight. 
(C) There's no discernable difference in the amount of lettuce produced per acre by the government's farmland and by farmland owned by private industry. 
(D) Many of the non-government owners of farmland in Mapple once worked for the government's agricultural department. 
(E) Private industry has fewer restrictions placed on it in terms of treatment of worker and working conditions than the government's regulations. 


The McAllister Bridge was supposed to relieve traffic congestion in the town of Allegheny, but even though the bridge opened last year, congestion has increased. To relieve the traffic problems in Allegheny, therefore, the traffic commission should order the McAllister Bridge closed. 
1001. Which of the following, if true, most weakens to the conclusion presented in the passage? 
(A) Ship captains have complained that the McAllister Bridge disrupts shipping on the river it spans, hurting the local economy. 
(B) The bridge is only open from 6:00 to 8:00 a.m. on weekdays. 
(C) The increased traffic in Allegheny is largely because of a new shopping center that opened for business in the town shortly after the McAllister Bridge was opened. 
(D) The McAllister Bridge allows inhabitants of Allegheny to reach downtown Pittsburgh in less than 40 minutes, as opposed to the two hours the trip required before the bridge opened. 
(E) The bridge's toll is so low that it will take over 100 years for the bridge to pay for itself.

 A well written sample essay that will score well on the GMAT exam is shown below:
The speaker, perhaps in an attempt to make an argument that battles persistent and unfair stereotypes about young people who enjoy playing role playing games, makes a leap in logic that leads to a flawed argument. Her premises are flawed, and thus, her conclusion (that more people should play role playing games) is unsupported.
To begin with, let's consider the premises of the argument. The speaker states one stereotype about RPG players that is undoubtedly persistent and unfair, the idea that they are "nerds without social skills." But in order to refute this idea, she provides a statistic from a survey that states that young adults who play RPGs value social skills and courtesy more than those who were surveyed 10 years ago. There are two essential flaws in the premise of that argument.
First, the speaker fails to recognize that the survey she is using asked the same group — young people who play RPG's — ten years apart. Suggesting that RPGs are the reason the young people value social skills and courtesy now fails to recognize that, according to the survey, 10 years ago, young people who play RPGs did not value social skills and courtesy. It's clear that what has changed cannot be the playing of RPGs, which the group that is being surveyed does as a precondition of being part of the group.
The second essential flaw is that the speaker fails to connect the results of the survey, which indicate that young people who play RPGs "value" social skills and courtesy, with her interpretation, which is that the evidence suggests that role playing games "are actually promoting social interaction and friendship." The logic is stretched too far. One can value something without promoting it. It's also worth noting that "promoting" an ideal and "practicing" an ideal are not the same thing. By conflating these three distinct ideas, the speaker weakens her already flawed argument. It would be better if she stated that those who value a quality will often seek to practice it themselves.
Additionally, whether or not RPG players value, promote, or practice social skills and courtesy, this is a strange premise to support the idea that more people should play RPGs. There are many more qualities about RPGs that might make them alluring to new players, and these qualities have nothing to do with whether their co-players are courteous or good have social skills, or whether their own social skills will be improved by playing RPGs. These include an interest in the created narrative and the enjoyment in feeling like one is immersed in a fantastical world.
It's admirable of this speaker to try to eradicate a tired cliché about young people who participate in role-playing games. The statistic that she provides, however, is not well used in making this argument. Instead of her current flawed logic, the speaker might point out that the change in valuing "social skills and courtesy" over the last 10 years among RPG players shows that they have become increasingly aware of their false reputation and wish to show that they do not fit the stereotype. The idea that they "value" these qualities most likely goes hand in hand with practicing them themselves, and thus welcome new players. The speaker might also suggest other, more compelling reasons for new players to try RPGs. It's likely that the speaker would do better to find a different statistic or anecdotal proof to make her case. As the argument stands now, it is too flawed to carry much weight.
This essay would likely score a 6 (out of 6) on the GMAT. It fulfills the prompt by considering and explaining the questionable assumptions that underline the speaker's principal argument, and showing how or why those assumptions are likely misinterpretations. The essay is well organized and moves smoothly, with plenty of transitions between ideas. The writer also proposes alternative evidence that could help the speaker strengthen her argument. Finally, the tone throughout is notably even. The writer of this essay praises the speaker's assumed good will and is gentle in rebuking her flawed ideas.

A well written sample essay that will score well on the GMAT exam is shown below:
Most of us have faced a so-called "hard sell," when a salesperson reaches too far and acts too aggressively in a desperate attempt to secure our business. Unfortunately, that's what's happened with the Stipesville Business Directory's mailing as shown in the prompt. The advertisement uses faulty logic to make a flawed argument that may ultimately turn potential advertisers away from the Directory, instead of increasing sales.
The premise is wrong from the first line, which states that "one of the best ways to reach new customers is also one of the cheapest." This line of thinking is doesn't make much sense, as no facts or figures are provided to show that the Business Directory is an inexpensive choice compared to other means of alerting potential customers about one's business. It also assumes that local business owners value "cheapness," which may not be true.
The ad continues to make a flawed argument with the statement that "local business owners" who bought ads in the Directory in past years will testify that doing so is "one of the best" ways to reach new customers. This argument has no meat to it since no testimonials from local business owners are included. It's possible that the Directory is more helpful for businesses like repair shops, which rely on serving customers faced with emergencies, than businesses like hair salons, which rely on repeat customers and word of mouth. But that argument is not considered here.
Perhaps the most glaring error in the ad is the assumption presented in the listing of "three of our town's top doctors, two of our top-five caterers, and several of our top dog groomers" who bought ads last year. There's no means provided of understanding what "top" means here: Are these businesses the top in a local newspaper's customer satisfaction survey or the top in money earned or some other means of measuring their success? And by what means is their success, however it is measured, tied to their participation in the business Directory? This information is not explained and thus equates participation in the Stipesville Business Directory with success as a business in a way that is not at all clear.
Additionally, this flawed logic continues with an anecdote about an unnamed hairdresser who apparently attributes her 5% drop in business to not purchasing an ad in the Stipesville Business Directory. This is flimsy evidence, and without knowing more about the hairdresser, we cannot be sure that the drop in her business is related to her failure to place an ad in the Directory. Her business might be located in an area of Stipesville where construction has taken place over several months, causing a decrease in visitors. Or she might have taken a vacation of a month or more, during which time her business would obviously see a decrease in earnings.
The shoddiness of the arguments presented ends up making the Stipesville Business Directory seem like an organization that's overaggressive and abrasive, which is unfortunate. The inclusion of more detailed testimonials from satisfied local business owners who bought ads would provide more convincing, if anecdotal, evidence. The Directory's compilers might also try to accrue more convincing figures, perhaps by surveying local businesses before and after they've placed ads. This sort of information, presented coherently, would ultimately be much more convincing to local business who are on the fence about placing an ad in the Stipesville Business Directory.
This essay would likely score a 6 (out of 6) on the GMAT. It fulfills the prompt by considering and explaining the questionable assumptions that underline the speaker's principal argument, and showing how or why those assumptions are unconvincing in a piece of writing that seeks, above all, to convince. The essay is well organized and moves smoothly, using transitions between ideas well, working down the advertisement in a way that makes natural sense. The writer also proposes alternative ways that the ad could be written to make it more convincing. While the tone of this essay borders on being too harsh, the case made here is very convincing.

A well written sample essay that will score well on the GMAT exam is shown below:
Imagine telling a group of high school seniors that their prom, senior trip, senior work day, and the school musical have been cancelled. Why? They need to focus on raising their test scores on a standardized test that in no way benefits them, but only helps the school from which they will soon graduate — the very school that just cancelled all their senior activities. If the school board member quoted in the argument gets his way, that's exactly what will happen.
The argument he makes is not just cruel but deeply flawed. To begin with, he does not prove his opening premise, that the students at Richmeade Senior High School (RSHS) are scoring poorly on their standardized test. He fails to point out that the only standardized test given in June is an exit test for graduating high school seniors, and that RSHS has never required students to sit for it unlike Richmeade Prep. It's also possible that, as is typical for a private school, Richmeade Prep has a smaller class than Richmeade Senior High School.
It would be most practical to simply make taking the test mandatory for all graduating RSHS seniors. That would significantly improve the scores. But instead of suggesting that, the school board member presents another flawed argument. He points out that Richmeade Prep School doesn't offer any extracurricular or special activities during the month before the test is given and suggests that RSHS try the same thing. He mentions but fails to grasp the important fact that Richmeade Prep School gives the test in May, after they may have had a two-week break for spring break and/or spring holidays, which is typical for American high schools. Thus, the students are only required to focus on the test for two weeks instead of a month.
But more importantly, there is faulty logic at work here. The elimination of extracurricular and special activities does not automatically lead to an uptick in students' studying for their standardized tests. Indeed, even if students react without the rancor suggested in the first paragraph, there's no reason to think that they'll spend more time in test preparation. The standardized tests do not benefit the students taking them, even if their scores are very high.
There are ideas that might do better to increase students' desire to both sit for and do well on the tests. A program might be presented which demonstrates to students how high scores on the test would benefit the younger students in the school, for example. Or the RSHS might move the testing forward to the same timeframe as Richmeade Prep, and thus make the senior activities a reward for doing well on it. A discount on Senior Prom tickets might be given to any senior who takes the test. Finally, simply requiring that students at Richmeade Senior High School take the test, the way that Richmeade Prep does, will go a long way toward solving the problem.
No matter what other ideas are tried, it's clear that the connection between Richmeade Prep's test scores and the RSHS is tangential at best. There are financial reasons for a school to want to do well on a standardized test, so it may be worthwhile to develop a new plan. But this will require far greater research, and a better understanding of logical cause and effect, to avoid the disaster suggested in the opening paragraph.
This essay would likely score a 6 (out of 6) on the GMAT. It fulfills the prompt by considering and explaining the questionable assumptions that underline the speaker's principal argument. The writer unpacks the lengthy series of false assumptions that the speaker has made in a well-organized way. It transitions clearly from one idea to the next. The writer validates the concern the speaker has but shows alternative ways for the concern to be addressed. Finally, the writer opens with a gripping idea that should propel readers to continue.

A well written sample essay that will score well on the GMAT exam is shown below:
The article in a conventional cosmetic industry newsletter makes one case for why a customer might not need to buy organic makeup products. The author of this article is writing on behalf of the conventional cosmetics industry and clearly wants to undercut the growing movement towards buying organic cosmetics. However, the argument presented here is not convincing and might even drive more business into organic cosmetics!
The author relies on selected facts from a study of the chemical class Zbt, mentioning that chemical class Zbt has never been shown to cause scarring on human test subjects. While this fact may be true, using it reveals that it has been shown to cause scarring in animal studies. This begs the question as to whether any studies have been done on human subjects at all! Clearly, this is poor logic. In a situation in which a conventional cosmetic industry employee is trying to convince a potential customer to buy their product using this fact, many potential customers would not be convinced. They might ask not only if tests were ever done on human subjects, but whether the scarring on animals was so severe that tests on humans were not allowed. Even if customers don't ask, the idea that chemical class Zbt causes scarring in animal studies will remain a vivid picture in their minds. That's not going to improve sales.
It would be better for the conventional cosmetic industry employee to use nearly any other argument than the one presented here, which ends up begging too many questions that are not answered. A better argument is briefly alluded to at the end of the column, when it is mentioned that "searching out organic cosmetics" is a "hassle." Pursuing this line of thought would be more convincing because many consumers would respond well to the idea that they are too busy to specially search out certain items that are not widely available. In addition, you can build a case around the expense of organic cosmetics, which are often twice or even three times as expensive as conventional cosmetics. Organic makeup can be both difficult to find and expensive to purchase, and reminding customers of these facts will not beg any questions about the likelihood of scarring. This argument is not well-reasoned, but another, better, argument is available.
This essay would likely score a 6 (out of 6) on the GMAT. While it is shorter than other example essays, it fulfills the prompt by considering and explaining the questionable assumptions that underline the speaker's principal argument, and showing how the argument would be picked apart by the very people it hopes to convince. In a tone that is fair-minded, the author also suggests several alternative arguments that could be made to amplify the stance of the article while rejecting the argument made at this time.

A well written sample essay that will score well on the GMAT exam is shown below:
In his zeal to cut costs and increase profits, the bank executive quoted here employs dubious logic. Let's take a look at how his arguments fall apart.
To begin, consider the comparison he makes between the profits of today's six locations versus the profits of a single location. The executive says — without any statistical proof — that the main location was once more profitable than the combined profit from the six locations that North Bank offers today. He then attributes the loss in profitability to having six locations, without ever quite explaining what he means. It's not clear if he feels that six locations are more expensive to operate, or if customer usage has somehow declined, or how, exactly, the increase in locations means a decrease in profits. It's counter-intuitive — although not impossible — that a bank with one location would do less business than a bank with six. More explanation is needed.
It's also worth noting that the executive doesn't give a timeframe for when the single bank was more profitable. With more information, the story could be clearer. It's possible, for example, that he refers to a time when North Bank not only had but one location, but was also the only bank in town. A monopoly on the town's business would surely increase profits. Logically, the bank cannot be expected to meet the same profit margin today that it could many years ago when that was so.
While there is more to say about the first premise, let's move on to the second premise. The executive claims that customers will enjoy the "nostalgic feel" of having to use one North Bank location for their business. This does not match up with any easily seen trends in banking, in which more and more people prefer to use ATMs and online banking instead of traveling several miles to do their banking in person. But even if the case could be made that, for some reason, North Bank's customers are not following the trends, proof is needed but not provided. Believing the logic here requires the acceptance of a premise that is unproven and goes against common observation.
Perhaps there is a logical case to be made for reducing North Bank to one location. The executive could, for example, provide evidence that shows five branches bring in less money that they spend in salary and building costs. But that is not the argument he makes here, and thus, this argument must be rejected as illogical and unconvincing.
This essay would likely score a 6 (out of 6) on the GMAT. The writer does a good job of exposing the two assumptions the executive made in his comments and showing why they are not logically sound. The writer also makes good use of transitions and moves logically and clearly from one point to the next, closing by making a suggestion of what a more convincing case would be before soundly rejecting this case.

10.1. B. two
10.2. D. four
For 10.1, according to condition (b), if item 1 is selected, then two cases are possible. Case I. Suppose item 1 and item 3 are selected. Given that item 4 is not selected, then, according to condition (c), item 2 must be selected. Neither condition (a), (d), nor (e) requires that additional items must be selected. Thus, if item 1 and item 3 are selected, a total of three items must be selected. Case II. Suppose item 1 and item 4 are selected. Then none of conditions (a) through (e) requires that additional items must be selected. Thus, if item 1 and item 4 are selected, a total of two items must be selected. Therefore, the minimum number of items that must be selected if item 1 is selected is two.
For 10.2, if item 5 is selected, then only two cases that satisfy all conditions are possible. Case I. Item 5, item 1, item 3, and item 2 are selected. This combination does not violate any of the conditions (a) through (e). Item 4 cannot be selected because of condition (b), and item 6 cannot be selected because of condition (e). Thus, if item 5, item 1, item 3, and item 2 are selected, then the maximum possible number of items that can be selected is four. Case II. Item 5, item 6, item 4, and item 2 are selected. This combination does not violate any of the conditions (a) through (e). Item 3 cannot be selected because of condition (d), and item 1 cannot be selected because of condition (e). Note that item 4 and item 2 can both be selected. Condition (c) applies only if item 4 is not selected. Thus, if item 5, item 6, item 4, and item 2 are selected, the maximum possible number of items that can be selected is four. Therefore, the maximum possible number of items that can be selected if item 5 is selected is four.

12.1. E. Anyone who likes swimming likes the ocean
12.2. A. Anyone who likes the ocean likes swimming
For 12.1, the correct choice is the statement for which Aziz and Presley are both committed to believing is true. Aziz's second statement that "anyone who does not like the ocean, does not like swimming" is logically equivalent to "anyone who likes swimming likes the ocean." Presley's second statement that "liking the ocean is a necessary condition for liking swimming" is also logically equivalent to "anyone who likes swimming likes the ocean." Thus, they both agree on statement E.
For 12.2, the correct choice is the statement for which one of the two people, Aziz or Pressley, is committed to believing is true, and the other person is committed to believing is false. Aziz's first statement that "Anyone who does not like swimming must not like the ocean either" is logically equivalent to "Anyone who likes the ocean likes swimming." Thus, Aziz believes statement A is true. Pressley's first statement, "That's not true. I do not like swimming, but I do like the ocean" refutes statement A and gives a counterexample. Thus, Aziz and Pressley disagree on statement A.
Statements B, C, and D are all logically equivalent to "anyone who likes the ocean does not like swimming," which Pressley does not express a committed opinion on.

For 19.1, the histogram shows an imbalance created by the one low score between 25.5 and 40.5. The result of this imbalance is that the mean of the scores will be influenced by this low score, but the median will not. As a result, the mean of the 20 exam scores is less than the median of the 20 exam scores.
For 19.2, because of the grouping of the scores into intervals, the exact scores are not shown in the histogram. However, from the question information, you know that each score is a multiple of 5. Thus, the possible scores between 25.5 and 40.5 are 30, 35, and 40; between 55.5 and 70.5 are 60, 65, and 70; between 70.5 and 85.5 are 75, 80, and 85; and between 85.5 and 100.5 are 90, 95, and 100. There were no scores between 40.5 and 55.5, meaning there were no scores of 45, 50, or 55. The least possible mean score corresponds to the case where each student scored the minimum score in the interval in which the score falls. That is, 1 score of 30, 5 scores of 60, 9 scores of 75, and 5 scores of 90. Therefore, the least possible value for the mean (arithmetic average) score on the exam is

For 22.1, the statement is not supported by the information provided. Chen provided guidance; and, given she is Allmedia's CFO, she likely expects the incentive program to yield a net profit. However, there is no information indicating that this outcome is of primary importance to her. Therefore, the correct answer is No.
For 22.2, Talley has concerns about the incentive program, but having these concerns does not necessarily mean that he thinks the program should be discontinued. He might just want modifications to be made to the program. Therefore, the correct answer is No.
For 22.3, from Talley's concern in his memo to Chen about the incentive program possibly leading some clients to buy advertising they don't need, you can reasonably conclude that Talley is uncomfortable with WXXX being involved with clients in that way. Therefore, the correct answer is Yes.

The table shows that the station obtained a total of $202,000 in additional monies from these 12 clients, resulting in a deficit of . Therefore, the statement is true, and the correct answer is Yes.
For 23.2, Talley's memo states the radio station needed $17,000 in additional monies from each incentive program participant to break even. Table 1 shows that only four of the 10 current clients met that minimum. Therefore, the statement is true, and the correct answer is Yes.
For 23.3, the median amount of additional advertising purchased by current clients participating in the incentive program was $14,500, not $16,000. Therefore, the statement is false, and the correct answer is No.

However, you must remove from this number, the number of ways for the two 3s to be adjacent to each other. There are four ways for the two 3s to be adjacent to each other as illustrated here with ? marks taking the place of the other three digits: 33???, ?33??, ??33?, and ???33. Therefore, the number of ways to select the location for the two 3s is the number of ways to select two of the five place value locations minus the four ways in which the two selected locations would be adjacent. This number is . Now, for each of these 6 ways, there are  ways to arrange the other three digits. This is true because there are 3 ways to select the first digit; and, for each of these ways, there are 2 ways to select the next digit; and, for each of these ways, there is just 1 way to select the last digit. Therefore, there are  ways to arrange the given digits into a 5-digit number so that the two occurrences of the digit 3 are separated by at least one other digit.

A. Statement (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not sufficient.
From the question information  and  because both are positive integers. From (1) , which, because , implies  (and so implies ), yielding an answer of Yes to the question posed. Thus, (1) is sufficient.
According to (2) , so it's possible for  (if say x = 1 and y = 75) or for  (if say x = 4 and y = 80). So (2) is not sufficient to give a definite Yes or No answer to the question posed. Therefore, statement (1) alone is sufficient.

B. Statement (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient.
From the question information, the total time for the trip is 4 hours . And the total distance traveled . Thus, the average speed, call it s, in terms of x and y, is . Using (1), substitute  into  to obtain 

You have two variables, s and y, and only one equation , so (1) is not sufficient.
Using (2), gives , so (2) is sufficient. Therefore, statement (2) alone is sufficient.

C. Both statements TOGETHER are sufficient, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient.
From (1) you can conclude that x and y have the same sign because their product is positive, but without additional information you cannot determine whether . Thus, (1) is not sufficient.
From (2) you can conclude that y and z have opposite signs because their product is negative, but without additional information, you cannot determine whether .
Taking (1) and (2) together, if y is positive, then x is also positive, and z is negative, so . If y is negative, then x is also negative, and z is positive, so . Therefore, in either case, you can answer Yes to the question posed. Therefore, both statements together are sufficient, but neither statement alone is sufficient.

B. Statement (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient.
From (1), if n is a prime number, then the answer to the question is No, because there are no prime number factors k such that . However, if n is not a prime number (for example, if ), the prime number factor k could be 3 or 5, so then the answer to the question is Yes. You have no way of knowing whether n is prime or not, so (1) is not sufficient.
Using (2), 10! is the product of all positive integers descending down from 10 to 1. Then n is one of the nine integers from  to . Note that any prime number  is a factor of 10! Thus, 2 is a factor of , , , , and ; 3 is a factor of  and ; 5 is a factor of ; and 7 is a factor of . Thus, for each integer n from  to , there is a prime number factor k of n. So the answer to the question posed is Yes. Thus, (2) is sufficient. Therefore, statement (2) alone is sufficient.

Let A = the amount, in gallons, of water added to the barrel, and let B = the barrel's capacity, in gallons. Then  = the amount, in gallons, of water already in the barrel. From (1), , implies , which is one equation with two unknowns. Without additional information, you cannot determine an exact value of B. Thus, (1) is not sufficient.
From (2), , which is equivalent to , the same equation as in (1). Thus, (2) is not sufficient.
Taking (1) and (2) together results in , which leads to the same conclusions as in (1) and (2). Therefore, statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient.

E. Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient.
Let M = the number of math teachers in the group of 9 teachers, then  is the percent of math teachers in the group. From (1), , which leads to inconclusive results because you can't assume there are only two math teachers in the group. So M could be a range of values. Thus, (1) is not sufficient.
Statement (2) provides no information about M. Thus, (2) is not sufficient.
Taking (1) and (2) together leads to inconclusive results because you cannot determine an exact value of M from the information given. Therefore, statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient.

B. Statement (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient.
From (1),  leads to inconclusive results. For example, if  and , then  is true, yielding answer of Yes to the question posed. But if  and , then  is false, yielding answer of No to the question posed. Thus, (1) is not sufficient.
From (2),  implies . Hence,  is true, yielding an answer of Yes to the question posed. Thus, (2) is sufficient. Therefore, statement (2) alone is sufficient.

E. Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient.
Let D = the number of people in the group who own a dog, and C = the number of people in the group who own a cat. Then  = the number of people in the group who own either a dog or a cat or both,  = the number of people in the group who own both a dog and a cat, and  = the number of people in the group who own neither a dog nor a cat. From (1),  implies . But without additional information, you cannot determine an exact value of . Thus, (1) is not sufficient.
From (2),  implies . But without additional information, you cannot determine an exact value of . Thus, (1) is not sufficient.
Taking (1) and (2) together, you have . So without additional information, you cannot determine an exact value of . Therefore, statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient.

D. Each statement ALONE is sufficient.
From (1),  implies . Thus, (1) is sufficient.
From (2),  implies . Thus, (2) is sufficient. Therefore, each statement alone is sufficient.

B. Statement (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient.
From (1),  implies , or, equivalently, . Given that m and n are positive integers, ; otherwise, m would be negative. To assure that m is an integer, the possible values for n are 2 and 4, in which case  or 3, respectively. Hence,  or . Thus, (1) is not sufficient.
From (2)  implies  or, equivalently, . Hence, , which implies . (It cannot equal -3 because m and n are both positive). Thus, (2) is sufficient. Therefore, statement (2) alone is sufficient.

B. Statement (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient.
Let  = the first term of sequence G,  = the nth term of sequence G, and  = the 51st term of sequence G. From (1), . But without further information, you cannot determine an exact value of . Thus, (1) is not sufficient.
From (2), because , and so on, then , from which you have . Hence, . Thus, (2) is sufficient. Therefore, statement (2) alone is sufficient.

E. Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient.
From (1),  implies . Without knowing whether b is positive or negative, you cannot give a definite Yes or No answer to the question posed. If , then , yielding an answer of No to the question posed. But if , then , yielding an answer of Yes the question posed. Thus, (1) is not sufficient.
From (2),  leads to inconclusive results. If  and , then , yielding a Yes answer to the question posed. But if  and , then , yielding a No answer to the question posed. Thus, (2) is not sufficient.
Taking (1) and (2) together, the examples in (2) satisfy all conditions given and lead to inconclusive results. Therefore, statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient.

D. Each statement ALONE is sufficient.
From (1), , which implies . Thus, (1) is sufficient.
From (2), because 4 members left team B, . Thus, (2) is sufficient. Therefore, each statement alone is sufficient.

E. Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient.
From (1),  implies that  tenths digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Thus, (1) is not sufficient.
From (2),  implies that  tenths digit is 3, 4, 5, ... , or 9. Thus, (2) is not sufficient.
Taking (1) and (2) together,  implies  tenths digit can be 3 or 4. Therefore, statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient.

D. Each statement ALONE is sufficient to answer the question.
It is given that  and . From (1),  implies . Because  implies x, y, and z are three different odd integers, then . Hence, , which you can solve for an exact value of z. Thus, (1) is sufficient.
From (2), given that , then  and . Thus, (2) is sufficient. Therefore, each statement alone is sufficient.

A. Statement (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not sufficient.
From (1),  implies . Because any number raised to an even power is positive, . Hence, , yielding an answer of Yes to the question posed. Thus, (1) is sufficient.
From (2),  leads to inconclusive results. For example,  can be positive if, say,  and . Or  can be negative if, say,  and . Thus, (2) is not sufficient. Therefore, statement (1) alone is sufficient.

D. Each statement ALONE is sufficient.
From (1),  implies . Given , then . Similarly,  implies . Given , then . Hence, . Because a and b are both positive this equation implies  or, equivalently, , yielding a Yes answer to the question posed.
From (2),  leads to the same results as shown in (1). Thus, (2) is sufficient. Therefore, each statement alone is sufficient.

B. Statement (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient.
Let x, y, and z be the prices of the three chairs. And, for convenience, let . From (1),  implies . This inequality leads to inconclusive results. The prices of the chairs can be under $600, yielding a No response to the question posed, if , , and . And the prices of the chairs can be over $600, yielding a Yes response to the question posed, if , , and . Thus, (1) is not sufficient.
From (2),  implies , yielding a Yes response to the question posed. Thus, (2) is sufficient. Therefore, statement (2) alone is sufficient.

C. Both statements TOGETHER are sufficient, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient.
Let B = the number of tokens that Blake has, and K = the number of tokens that Kylie has. Then  equals the total number of tokens that Blake and Kylie have. From (1), . Hence, . The value of this quantity will vary, depending on the value of K. Thus, (1) is not sufficient.
From (2), , which implies  could be 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24.
Taking (1) and (2) together, if , then  and . None of the other possible values for  yield integer values for B, K, and . Therefore, both statements together are sufficient, but neither statement alone is sufficient.

A. Statement (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not sufficient.
It is given that machines A, B, and C, working together, can complete the job in 24 hours. Thus, the portion of the job the three machines, working together, can complete in 1 hour is . Let T = the time it would take machine A to complete the job, working alone. Hence, the portion of the job that machine A can do in 1 hour is . From (1), given machines B and C, working together, can complete the job in 36 hour, the portion of the job they can do in 1 hour, when working together, is . It follows that , which you can solve for an exact value of T. Thus, (1) is sufficient.
From (2), given machines A and C, working together, can complete the job in 48 hour, the portion of the job they can do in 1 hour, when working together, is . Let K = the time it would take machine C to complete the job, working alone. Then , which is one equation with two unknowns. Without additional information, you cannot determine an exact value of T. Thus, (2) is not sufficient. Therefore, statement (1) alone is sufficient.

Chapter 5


B. Literature in the United States changed dramatically in the second half of the 20th century.
Essentially, you're looking for the thesis of the passage, so it will most likely be fairly broad, but be careful not to select an answer [like Choice (A)] that's too broad. Choice (B) walks the line between capturing the entirely of the passage but also being specific to the two paragraphs here. It's the best choice.

A. The aftermath of the war.
The last sentence is a complicated one with many clauses, which is why the GMAT test-makers have chosen it to ask this question, hoping you will read through it too quickly and choose the wrong answer. However, a careful read reveals that Choice (A) is the main subject of the sentence, and other choices describe what happened during the aftermath. It's the best choice.

D. An emphasis on plain character and plain language.
The answer to this question is factual. You need only find it in the passage itself. Choice (D) is taken directly from the passage.

A. ... historical events in each country radically changed their writers in non-analogous ways.
Inference questions are tricky. Simply answering with a fact isn't enough. You must find the step beyond what's said in the passage. Here, Choice (B) is a fact from the passage, while Choices (C) and (D), whether true or not, are factual responses. Choice (A) is best here because it points to a trend that is hinted at but not explicitly stated in the passage.

E. To recognize as different or unique
Even if you can't figure out what the word means, it is clearly used as a verb in the sentence, and only Choice (E) is a verbal definition.

D. It provides a turn from the topic of the first paragraph, clarifying what the purpose of the passage will be.
The word "however" in the second paragraph should be a hint that it's contradicting or turning away (even slightly) from the first paragraph. A careful read shows that the second paragraph clarifies what the passage will be about, as it turns slightly away from the premise of the opening. Choice (D) is thus the best.

B. While an incandescent lamp may produce heat, many people will continue to use them because the light is familiar and comforting.
With an inference question, you always want to make a short jump, not a long leap. Choice (D) represents a long leap — it may be true, but it's not implied in the passage. Choice (B), however, is a very small hop that even uses words from the passage, making it the best choice.

D. It provides additional factual information about the topic of the passage.
The topic of the passage is the incandescent lamp. The last sentence provides additional information about the light given off by such lamps. Choice (D) is best.

C. About 95 percent
So long as you read the question carefully and take a moment to a brief calculation, you'll choose correctly. If 5 percent or less of the lamp's energy is given to producing light, that means that 95 percent or more is given to other tasks. Choice (C) is best.

C. Despite their inefficiencies, there are reasons why incandescent lamps remain popular.
The passage is not a screed against incandescent lamps. In fact, suggesting that they be eliminated isn't even suggested. Choice (C) is the closest to capturing the real point of the passage.

A. Visible, obvious
The best definition of apparent as used here is Choice (A). The whiteness is visible or obvious.

E. The first paragraph describes Fischer's prowess in chess at the height of his career, and the second paragraph describes the fall he experienced.
The answer here is fairly obvious if you've read the passage, but the question is designed to keep you reading for as long as possible. Choice (E) is ultimately the best answer.

B. He finds Fischer's ultimate fate tragic, but also finds fault with Fischer.
Only Choice (B) fits the tone of the passage. Fischer's withdrawal is described as "tragic" but the use of the word "unfortunately" hints at the idea that the author thinks the chess master should have made different decisions.

D. José Rail Capablanca was also a successful chess player with a high degree of self-confidence.
Choice (D) is best here. The author's reference to Capablanca means that he sees a connection between Fishcer and the other chess player. It's not too much of a stretch to infer that they shared some characteristics, as seen in Choice (D).

C. Anxiety about playing a match against Fischer that was so extreme that it causes physical illness.
This is a factual question, so don't try to infer what the symptoms of the "fever" are, beyond what the passage describes. That's best captured in Choice (C).

B. Crafting characters and structures, and gathering resources.
The answer is in the passage — you just need to take the time to read it and the answer choices carefully to find one that matches. Choice (B) is correct. Remember not to bring your outside knowledge into the game. You might play Minecraft, but you can only respond based on what the passage says.

D. An overview of the game of Minecraft, aimed at those who might want to try playing it.
The author is seeking to explain how to play the game. It is clear from the first sentence, which explains Minecraft in extremely simple terms, that her audience is intended to be people who are not very familiar with the game. Choice (D) is best.

A. Minecraft is a game that allows players to change in their focus the more they play it.
The inference of the last sentence is that the game will change as you play it, because it will be "less about surviving" and "more about building... . " Choice (A) is a logical step in inferring — the game can become what the player wants.

B. Creating a physical object or a representation of a physical object
Choice (B) is best here. Choice (A) is a type of craft, which is not the same thing. Choice (D) has some merit, but in a virtual world "sculpting" is less likely to be the meaning as Choice (B). Choices (C) and (D) represent ways to craft, but they're not quite right for this question. People playing Minecraft would not need to program computer code.

E. Some Stars Aren't What You Think!
The best title captures some understanding of the main point of the passage, which is that the Evening and Morning Stars are not actually stars at all. Choice (E) is the best of the answers here.

B. Mercury and Venus
This is a factual question, so all you need to do is read the passage to find the correct information carefully. Choice (B) is the right answer.

D. Many Americans may have ideas about the sky that show their interest but lack of understanding about astronomy.
The only reasonably inference you can make about the writer has to be rooted in what he's written here. Choice (D) is a safe assumption — it's clear from the passage that the writing is correcting misapprehensions, but in a friendly way.

C. A group of people on a boat spot what they think is a pack of dolphins in the ocean in the distance, but the captain informs them they're actually looking at buoys bouncing in the water.
The passage describes mistaking one thing for another, which is clarified by an expert (in that case, the author). Choice (C) describes a similar phenomenon.

E. Wrong names
The best alternative for misnomer is incorrect names. It is incorrect to name a meteor a "shooting star," making Choice (E) the best answer. Notice that Choice (A) is correct but too broad. A misnomer is a kind of mistake — Choice (E) explains which kind.

C. Allowing one of the branch of the government to be tied to a hereditary monarch and aristocrats.
It is strongly implied in the passage that the Americans saw the British monarchy and hereditary aristocrats to be a flaw that kept their government from being a true republic. Choice (C) is best.

D. Factual and learned
You may be thinking "What tone?" because the author here has avoided a strong personal tone. The best answer, therefore, is Choice (D) because the passage sticks to the facts intelligently.

D. It provides historical proof of the assertion the author has made earlier.
The bolded portion is factual, and a careful reading shows that the facts are included to provide support for the idea mentioned in the sentence before it: "Most did not last very long." Choice (D) is best.

B. The American who set up the country's government tried to do something uniquely long-lasting yet based in the historical example of republics that came before.
Choice (B) best captures the main idea of this long passage. The Americans who set up the government the country still uses were aware of republics that came before, as well as the government of Britain, and created their new government in response to those examples.

D. A dictatorship
As clearly stated in the passage, the republic was followed by a dictatorship, making Choice (D) correct.

E. Landowners
The passage states that "Large landowners controlled the House of Commons" so Choice (E) is best.

D. Including video elements in a website is increasingly common, and may be a good choice for your site.
The passage suggests (but does not insist upon) including video on one's website. Choice (D) thus expresses the main idea of the passage the best.

C. Business owners who are deciding what elements to include in their web pages.
The passage is clearly aimed at business owners, but the emphasis is not on those who are deciding about whether to have an online presence, as in Choice (A), but rather those who have decided to have one and now want to figure out what to include. That makes Choice (C) the best answer.

A. It increases.
The passage includes the following: "Research supports the idea that video increases customer engagement... . " That makes the answer Choice (A).

D. Video should be used carefully on a website, as it can work against the site's accessibility and enjoyment.
In the last sentence of the passage, it is suggested that website owners should "weigh the pros and cons of video" and use it in a way that "supports, rather than detracts." That points out the correct answer as Choice (D).

D. The ever-increasing interest in YouTube
This is an unusual variation on this type of question, but you might see it on the test. The point is for you to find a phrase that best matches the original phrase in meaning. Here, Choice (D) is best because it means something akin to "soaring popularity."

B. Swollen and damaged
The last section of the passage, in the bullet points, answers this question. The passage advises avoiding cans that are swollen and damaged. Choice (B) is right.

E. They provide a helpful list of characteristics to look for that is drawn from the main paragraph.
In this case, the bullet points flow from the main paragraph, adding more information, not contradicting or repeating it. In this case Choice (E) is thus the best.

A. Botulism is a serious health hazard, but there are steps you can take to avoid the risk of mistakenly consuming it.
The correct answer is Choice (A) which captures the main idea of the entire passage in a tone that is factual.

C. Anhydration
The passage defines anaerobic to show that an- means without. Applying this rule (and knowing that hydration must be the other part because it is in every answer), the correct answer must be Choice (C).

E. Poison
Even if you are not familiar with the word toxin, its use in the passage makes it clear that it is a type of poison, so Choice (E) is correct.

C. Carefully check cans for swelling, damage, rust or deep dents, and do not consumer the food therein if you notice any of these.
The answer is in the passage, but you must take the time to read it carefully, not just skim it. Choice (C) is best.

C. Personal Real Estate Is Not a Foolproof Investment
Choice (C) best gets to the tone of the piece, which suggests that individual real estate can plummet in price. That hints at the idea of the title, that real estate is not a foolproof investment because it can sour.

D. Both towns were sites of carcinogenic toxic waste contamination.
Here, you're asked to find the factual information as listed in the passage. It's clear that Choice (D), which includes language taken directly from the passage, is the best answer.

B. Pursued legal action against the real estate agencies that did not disclose known contaminants to them before selling them property in the towns.
In an inference question, you want to make a small step away from facts and into supposition. The trick is not to wander too far away from what is already known. Here, the best choice is Choice (B), because it can be inferred from the final sentence of the passage that legal action was most likely taken. All of the other choices might be true, but there is not as much justification in the choices as in Choice (B).

A. Cautious and factual
The author's tone here is cautious, as is clear from the first sentence when he points out the pitfalls of individual real estate property as an investment. In the rest of the passage, he provides facts to prove his point. That makes Choice (A) the best selection.

D. It clarifies that some property owners were eventually compensated for their losses.
The best choice here is Choice (D) because the bolded sentence offers clarification about information presented in the passage. It suggests that while the property owners did lose money on their investment, they were eventually compensated for at least part of the lost money.

E. It summarizes attempts to fix a problem before asserting that the problem is not yet fixed.
The best choice here is clear: Choice (E). The passage explains a problem in "the world of intellectual property" as well as attempts to fix that problem, but concludes that the problem is not yet resolved.

B. By producing guides to initial patent application.
It's clearly stated in the passage that the Patent Offices "have recently intensified their efforts to be more accessible" by publishing "guides to initial patent application." Thus, Choice (B) is the best answer.

D. Intellectual property management must do a better job of connecting legal procedure with technological development and business strategy.
In this main idea question, the trick is to avoid choosing an answer that identifies an idea from the passage, but not the main idea. Choice (D) is the only one here that correctly explains the main idea of the passage.

C. Of a whole, more than the sum of its parts
In the sentence from the passage, holistic is used in its standard meaning, to suggest more than the sum of its parts. Choice (C) is correct.

D. They will have further suggestions about how intellectual property management can be approached.
The passage reads like the opening to a longer piece of writing about intellectual property management. It seems clear that further suggestions will come, making Choice (D) the most accurate of those offered here.

A. Zoos are not very well understood. Zookeepers, administrators, and veterinarians have to work together at a zoo, but often they are unable to see how their efforts appear to visitors to the zoo, even after making efforts to make the zoo accessible. Their efforts need to be combined better.
The passage identifies an area where three groups must work together, which is difficult. They've made improvements, but the overall picture is still very hard to see, and they must improve. That's the same logic as we see in Choice (A).

D. The author is gently teasing readers about the items that they might be storing on their kitchen counters instead of using them for cooking.
Choice (D) is the best answer here. The author's tone is gentle and humorous, suggesting that these items don't belong on a kitchen counter. It's too much to think the author is suggesting you get rid of these items permanently or should never have owned them at all.

C. Cleaning Off Your Counter Gets Your Ready to Cook!
The best answer here is Choice (C), which is neither too narrow, as in Choice (B), nor too broad, as in Choice (A). It captures the main idea of the passage.

B. Unsure about keeping their deep fryer on their kitchen counter, even though they only use it once a month.
The advice in the second paragraph specifically urges people to store their seldom-used appliances off their counters. Thus Choice (B) is best.

E. Maintaining a clutter-free kitchen so it is usable whenever cooking inspiration strikes.
The answer choices provided read like a list of commonly asserted ideas from cooks and cookbook writers, so it's easy to get confused. However, if you pay attention the passage, only Choice (E) is truly justified as an inference. The authors write "A clean, clear counter space can inspire the creation of a great meal."

D. Not specified, but not on a kitchen counter.
This is a supporting idea question. You just need to read the passage carefully to find the answer. Here, no system is advocated, except that the kitchen counter should not be used, so Choice (D) is best.

E. A compiled language.
The last sentence of the passage reads, "Software you install on your computer ... are coded using compiled language." Choice (E) is thus the best.

C. As the speed advantage that compiled languages have continues to decline, both languages will offer equal incentives to be used.
Choice (C) is just a small extension from the passage, which points out that the "speed advantage compiled languages have is starting to fade in importance." If that is true, it is safest to say that the languages will be continue to be equally appealing for different reasons.

B. There are two types of programming languages, and each offers advantages and disadvantages.
Choice (B) best captures the main idea of the passage: There are two main types of languages, and each has distinct characteristics to recommend them.

C. Factual and helpful
The choice between Choice (C) and Choice (E) is a little tricky here. Keep in mind the somewhat negative meaning of rote, which is typically used to describe going through the motions. Disinterested also implies a lack of true engagement with the topic. That's hard to prove here, so Choice (C) is better. The tone is definitely factual and helpful.

C. A computer translates the code into an executable file, and then it is distributed via the internet, CD-ROMs, or other media.
Choice (C) is correct. The language is taken directly from the passage, but the test-taker must carefully read both the passage and the answer choices to make the correct pick.

D. Javascript, Ruby, and C++
A half-dozen high-level programming languages are listed in the passage. Choice (D) collates three of them into a list and thus is the best choice.

E. The first paragraph provides an overview of how beneficial bees are to our world, so as to make the impact of losing them clearer when presented later.
The best choice here is Choice (E). The opening paragraph can be summed up in this sentence: "You may not have thought much about the role honey bees play in our everyday food supply." The rest of the paragraph works to prove that point, so that the next paragraph's concern about the loss of honeybees has more of an impact.

B. Beef and dairy
It's certainly possible that all of the food products mentioned here could be negatively affected by the decline of bees. However, the passage makes specific reference to "meat and dairy" as well as "cattle" so Choice (B) is the best of the answers here.

A. The health of honey bees has been so compromised in recent years that a spring without them is a possibility.
The passage mentions that honey bees have been compromised and then goes on to mention a "spring without bees" that could endanger our food supply. Choice (A) makes a reasonable inference that a spring without bees is therefore a possibility.

C. Concerned and alert
While the author is neither scheming nor hysterical, he does seem to be both concerned and alert, to judge from the tone of the second paragraph, so Choice (C) is best.

D. Scientists who have been studying bees should provide suggestions about how the rest of us can help, including keeping hives.
In this inference question, the author's tone is key. It is too urgent for Choice (A) and too calm for Choice (B). Choice (E) is not justified by the text, and Choice (C) seems like the exact opposite of what the author wants. Choice (D), therefore, is correct.

E. To expose to danger in some way
In any sentence with a bolded word, you must look carefully at the context in which it is used. Here, several accurate definitions of the word compromise are offered, but only Choice (E) is a verb version that makes sense in the sentence.

A. Cerro Tololo in the Chilean Andes
The passage notes that at Cerro Tololo you "can see even more stars" than the other places listed in the passage, so Choice (A) is right. Notice that the question is not asking for the best place in the world, but the best place mentioned in the passage.

C. The sky is a busy place, and no matter where you watch it from, you can see interesting things.
Choice (C) sums up the two main points of the passage the best. First, there are many interesting sights in the night-time sky, and secondly, no matter where you watch, you'll be able to see something worth your time.

B. The Hubble Space Telescope
The passage specifically states that space satellites, like the Hubble Space Telescope, and airliners can be mistaken for each other. Notice that while it's certainly possible that any of the choices provided could also fool an amateur, the passage is specifically referring to this comparison, so Choice (B) is right.

C. It explains the phenomenon mentioned in the sentence before it.
The bolded sentence explains what the "beautiful pearly swath across the heavens" is, as mentioned in the sentence before it. That makes Choice (C) the best.

C. "Starry Night" may have been painted in an area that the author would deem a "great observation place" like Cerro Tololo.
Choice (C) is the best inference of those offered here, because it connects to the text of the passage. "Starry Night" is mentioned as depicting a scene that is similar to what one might see at a place like Cerro Tololo, so Choice (C) makes sense.

E. Average adults interested in learning more about the night sky.
The passage is clearly aimed at people who do not already know quite a bit about the night sky, which eliminates Choices (A), (B), and (C). The students mentioned in Choice (D) are too young to understand language of this complexity, so Choice (E) makes the most sense.

E. America's Democratic Republic System
Choice (E) is best here. The passage explains why America is not a democratic republic in a factual tone.

A. They are democracies.
The example of a New England town meeting is used in the passage as an example of a vestige of democracy, so Choice (A) is the right one.

D. It turns the paragraph back to the main topic after a series of sentences that provided exceptions to the topic under discussion.
Choice (D) is best because the passage seeks to build an argument that America is a democratic republic. In order to do so fairly, several examples of a true democracy are offered, and the bolded sentence acknowledges them before turning the paragraph back to the topic.

B. Referendum; Democracy
A silly question, perhaps, but one you'll need to double-check the passage to make sure you've chosen the correct answer for. It's stated that the ballot initiative is "also called the referendum" so Choice (B) gets it right.

C. The Board of Trustees, chosen by election, vote on the next steps for an insurance company.
You're looking for a situation similar to what is explained within the passage, where a group of people elect a smaller group to make decisions for them. Choice (C) presents such an example.

D. To alert readers that something paradoxical has been noted.
The author makes use of the phrase In contradictory language to note that she is aware of what readers will surely notice: the paradox between the rise in temperature measurements and the colors we perceive them in. Choice (D) is best.

E. Yellow
Choice (E) is correct, which follows the statement in the passage that "Temperatures around 2,700 - 3,000 K ... are perceived as warm in color, tilting toward yellow and red."

B. Colloquial language about light often reflects actual observation about the color of hot things.
The end of the passage notes that the "heat-light-color relationship is recognized in colloquial language." The safest inference, then, is that it has been observed closely. Choice (B) is best.

D. The relationship between heat, light, and color is sometimes counter-intuitive.
The best answer notes the relationship between heat, light, and color [not just heat and color, as in Choice (A)], as well as some characteristic of that relationship that is expressed in the passage. Choice (D) is best.

B. Metal burning "white-hot."
The type of item burning doesn't matter; the passage states that something burning "white-hot" is hotter than something burning "red-hot" so Choice (B) is best.

C. A brief biography of a memorable American.
Choice (C) is the best answer. The passage gives a very brief biography of Huey Long.

D. Polls showed he would secure enough of the Democratic vote to swing the election to the Republican party.
According to the passage, the principal reason that the Democratic party would have been concerned was Long's likelihood of splitting the vote. Choice (D) is the best answer.

A. Long's policies hurt some of the people who he was supposed to represent as an elected official.
The safest inference is to take the words of the last sentence — that Long had "ruined" the family of the man who shot him — and draw a conclusion that he had hurt people whom he was supposed to help. Choice (A) is best.

E. "Kingfish"
The question is simple, so long as you read the passage for the answer. Huey Long was called "Kingfish."

C. Reminds or informs readers that Long did some good things on the way to his eventual demagoguery.
The use of the word "actually" is key here. It has a tone of revelation, teaching readers that Long did good things as well as bad. Choice (C) is thus the correct answer.

D. Wealthy people with annual incomes of over $1,000,000
It's not a guess: The passage states that Long's "Share Our Wealth" program would redistribute wealth of people with an annual income of over $1,000,000. It's a logical inference that those people would dislike Long.

C. Enthusiastic and supportive
The authors strike a tone of enthusiasm and support, as can best be seen in the last sentence of the passage: "Why shouldn't one of those people be you?" Thus, Choice (C) is the best offered.

E. It develops the main idea beyond the initial example to show another way it applies.
Choice (E) is the best answer here. The bolded sentence adds an additional idea to the support the thesis that "an Internet-based business model has proven to be a worthwhile investment."

D. Consider Starting an Online Business
The purpose of the passage is to explain why starting an online business might be a good choice for readers. Choice (D) is the best pick to capture that idea.

D. Smartphones
The passage specifically refers to smartphones as a technology that has made shopping online "as easy as ever." Choice (D) is thus the best.

E. It invites readers to give an Internet-based business a try.
The use of a sentence at the end of the passage can create several different effects. It could be rhetorical, as in Choice (A), or suspenseful, as in Choice (D). But here, the question serves as an invitation to read and explore more about the topic, so Choice (E) is correct.

D. Businesses of all sizes
The passage includes this sentence: "Increasingly, businesses of all sizes are also buying products and services online." That makes Choice (D) the best answer.

A. To set up a contrast between the appealing smell of apple pie baking and the less pleasant smell of cruciferous vegetables being cooked.
Here, you must look at the context of the sentence in bold. Notice how it is followed by the word "But ... " in the next sentence. You can tell that it is setting up a contrast from that alone. Choice (A) is best.

C. Sulfur Is the Smell of Cruciferous Vegetables Cooking
Of the choices presented here, Choice (C) is the best. It refers to a main idea of the passage, which is that cruciferous vegetables release a sulfurous scent.

D. Plexin
Choice (D), Plexin, is not listed in the passage, so it is the best choice. Remember to read the question carefully — so you know you're looking for the name that is NOT a sulfur compound — and also check the passage for the right answer.

B. The crucifix at the front of the sanctuary.
The word crux is defined in the passage as "the Latin word meaning cross." Thus, the best answer here is one that uses the prefix in the same way, as in Choice (B).

D. Interested in one of their distinctive characteristics
Choice (D) is correct. The author is pointing out an interesting characteristic of this type of vegetable, not dismissing them or discouraging use of them.

E. The smell of sulfurous compounds in cruciferous vegetables is heightened by heat.
The passage indicates but never explicitly states that heating cruciferous vegetables makes the sulfuric smell worse. (It states that the smells "are liberated" but you must infer the rest). That makes Choice (E) the best.

D. Carrots
Choice (D) is best because carrots are not in the passage's list of cruciferous vegetables.

C. The brain's minicolumns are key to how it works, as are the inputs it receives.
While Choices (D) and (E) contain factual information from the passage, they don't represent the main idea of the passage. Choice (C) is better at that.

A. A repeated neural circuit in the brain
You're presented with two choices that are correct — Choices (A) and (C). A quick review of the question asked, though, reveals that you're to find the "most specific" answer, which must be Choice (A).

D. It supplies further details and information about a general concept presented in the first paragraph.
The second paragraph develops the idea of the first paragraph, providing more information about how minicolumns work in the neocortex of the brain, the main idea presented in the introduction. Thus, Choice (D) is the best.

E. Auditory
The context gives you the clues you need to understand this unusual usage of audition. It's used here as opposing vision, indicating that it's an adjective too. That makes Choice (E), auditory, also an adjective relating to hearing, the best.

B. A phone system is built out of a single type of wire which adjusts to respond to the location of the call being placed.
Choice (B) most closely mimics the idea presented in the second paragraph: The brain is not build out of differing structures of minicolumns; instead, the input received and the output sent by the minicolumn defines its role.

D. Respond differently to different inputs from vision or hearing.
Choice (D) gets at a reasonable inference from reading the passage. If, as the passage suggests, minicolumns are the same in the brain and respond to become part of a certain area because of the input from a different sense, it stands to reason that they might also be able to change based on those inputs. Thus, it is correct.

D. Factual and explanatory
The author may feel wonder or be aggrieved, but that's not clear from this passage. It's factual and full of information, so Choice (D) is best.

B. It's important to find a balance between your work life and your personal life.
Choice (B) is the best conclusion. The paragraph develops the idea that even people who really love their work sometimes neglect other aspects of their lives. Choice (B) finishes that thought well.

C. To introduce in an interesting way an idea the author intends to develop.
This type of question is really an inference question: you need to infer why the author might use a quotation at this point in the passage. Here, the most likely answer is Choice (C) because the author wants to capture the attention of readers and use the quotation to introduce the main point of the passage.

B. An excessive amount of time for a small-business owner to work.
Choice (B) is best here. It's possible that the author feels that several other choices here are also true, but in a GMAT inference question, you always want to choose the small hop in logic, not a leap.

E. You may want to consider hiring an employee to help with the business.
Choice (E) is best here. The passage states, "You may need to start hiring people." Choice (D) seems like a good idea, but an accountant is not specifically referred to in the passage, so it cannot be correct.

E. A thoughtful exploration about finding a balance between a rewarding small business and a personal life.
Choice (E) is best. The passage does include a quotation and seems slightly discouraging of putting too much effort into business, but Choices (A) and (D) are too extreme. The passage mostly seems to be about finding a balance between work and personal life.

C. Enterprising
The use of inventive in the passage suggests a person who is enterprising, so Choice (C) here is best.

D. Baked
The passage suggest that kale is "traditionally sautéed, baked, or simmered," so a restaurant that prepares it in a traditional way would serve it baked, as in Choice (D).

E. Kale, which has several types, can be prepared in a myriad of ways, including an innovative new form.
Choice (E) is best. The passage does indeed indicate that there are several kinds of kale as well as a multitude of ways to prepare and serve it.

A. It is less fibrous and grassy tasting that curly kale.
A close re-read of the passage will remind you that the authors state, "Lacinato is less fibrous and grassy tasting than curly kale." Choice (A) is thus correct.

D. Competing in a chess tournament can be emotionally grueling for children, but doing so can also teach them resilience and other valuable lessons.
The author's position is that "Chess is a good was to help children deal with" loss and similar issues, and that crying after a grueling loss is natural. Thus, he is most likely to agree with the sentence in Choice (D).

B. At any age so long as the child is ready.
According to the passage, "Kids begin competing at all ages. When a child is ready for individual or team competition depends on many factors." Thus, Choice (B) is closest to what the author believes.

A. Straightforward, gently leading
The test-makers have provided answer choices with higher-level vocabulary in hopes of confusing you. Don't fall for it. The tone of the passage is best described by Choice (A): straightforward and gently leading.

C. The child is reacting to a loss in a natural way.
The author states that crying is a "natural response to loss." Therefore, the correct answer is Choice (C).

D. Chess Will Teach Children Valuable, If Sometimes Painful, Lessons
Choice (D) best gets at the author's main purpose in this passage, which is to convince parents that playing competitive chess may be hard on their child but still worth their time.

C. They do not produce pollen and thus do not attract bees.
The passage states "Watch out for the hybrid that is pollenless because it is of little use to the bees." That means that Choice (C) is correct.

D. The widely-loved sunflower is more complex than you may know.
Of the choices given here, Choice (C) is the best. It's clear that the passage is about sunflowers, but a couple of the choices — (A) and (C) — are too specific. Choice (B) is an opinion that goes further than the passage itself, and Choice (E) is never actually stated. That leaves Choice (D), which aptly explains the main idea of the passage.

B. A principal reason for maintaining a garden is to provide pollen for bees.
The most reasonable inference is to extend the author's statement to "watch out for" hybrid sunflowers that are pollenless and provide "little use" to the bees. It is not too far a jump to assume, therefore, that the author thinks garden should provide pollen for bees. Choice (B) is correct.

A. The author feels that they are an important part of the ecosystem.
Choice (A) is best here. It is clear that the author feels bees are important enough in the ecosystem that plants which do not support them should be avoided. Notice that while Choice (D) feels like it is likely true (especially given the source of the passage as stated), there's no actual proof that it is correct in the passage itself. Choice (A) is the more justified and thus, correct, choice.

B. The author's experience in trying to transplant sunflowers has taught him that using peat pots is a smart move.
The general tone of the passage is to give advice, which indicates that the author is an expert in his field. Choice (B) makes the most sense here: The author is giving advice he's learned, perhaps the hard way. The context of the sentence supports this idea.

C. To show how the concept of a republic is an ancient ideal.
The use of the term res publica is most likely to show how the idea of a republic is an ancient one, which gives it greater meaning and esteem. Choice (C) is the best.

D. The concept of a republic now used in America has been developed for thousands of years.
The passage essentially traces the historical precedent of the American concept of a republic, so Choice (D) is best.

E. It was felt that short terms of office reduced the likelihood of corruption.
Choice (E) is taken directly from the passage: "No one held office for a long period of time, because when citizens rotate in and out of office they avoid corrupting influences."

A. Virtue
The passage states that "virtue" was "the highest ideal a republican citizen could achieve." Choice (A) is best.

C. The American republic grew out of a number of historical precedents.
We may hope that the author believes Choice (E) and suspect that he thinks Choice (A), but Choice (C) is the safest answer. It is reasonable to assume that the author believes the American republic grew out of a number of historical forbearers.

D. What Is an Asterism?
There are other choices here that point out facts mentioned in the passage, but only Choice (D) gets at the main point of it: explaining what an asterism is and where readers might encounter them.

A. It provides an example so that readers can relate to the main idea of the passage.
Choice (A) best reveals the purpose of the first sentence: It gives an example of an asterism, the main topic of the passage, to set up the idea that the rest of the passage will explain what an asterism is.

E. It is a named star pattern.
The passage reads, "An asterism is a named star pattern that's not identical to one of the 88 recognized constellations." Choice (E) is thus the best.

B. An asterism may straddle several different constellations.
Reviewing the passage, Choice (B) is clearly supported by the ideas within it, so it is the best choice. Other answer may be correct, but Choice (B) is definitely correct.

C. The ocean was vitally important to the development of multicellular life.
Refer to the last sentence of the passage: "The processes that lead to multicellular life all took place in the earth's oceans." It is a reasonable inference to say that the author agrees, as Choice (C) suggests, making it the best answer.

C. Since the earth's formation 4.5 billion years ago, the development of life has been a complex process.
Of the choices provided, Choice (C) combines specificity (in the 4.5 billion years figure) with the general outline of the passage. It's the best answer here, beating out Choice (A), which is correct but also very broad.

E. Prokaryotic cells
It's clear from the passage that another term for cells without a cell nucleus is "prokaryotic cells." Choice (E) is thus the best.

D. Intrigued, informative
The author is intrigued by his topic, as the phrase "What's remarkable is ... " alone indicates. But the author is also well-informed. That makes Choice (D) the best.

A. Two billion years
If you follow the passage's math, it took two billion years for humans to develop after Eukaryotic life (cells with nuclei) appeared. Choice (A) is right.

C. Life did not have to begin at the moment it was sustainable.
If it's "remarkable" that life began at the earliest moment it could on our planet, the possibility that life did not have to start at that exact moment must also be true. Thus, Choice (C) is the best answer.

B. Innovations in electrical safety continue to be developed by Americans.
The passage begins with mention of Edison, but isn't actually about the man. The rest of the passage focuses on the development of electrical safety, and Choice (B) captures that the best.

E. Direct Current
The passage clearly defines DC as "direct current"; a careful read of the passage and answer choices will keep you from choosing any answer but Choice (E), the correct choice.

C. A passage exploring the history of containing nuclear power, beginning with a brief look at the first time it was safely processed.
Choice (C) best captures the flow of the passage: It begins with an innovation that increased the safety of the power source, and it then chronicles additional innovations that increased safety. The original passage does this as well.

A. Steam engines were responsible for a significant portion of factory accidents before electrical engines were put into use.
The safest inference is that steam engines were the cause of a significant portion of factory accidents, because the final sentence of the passage states that electrical engines improved safety on factory floors. Thus, Choice (A) is the best.

E. Serviceable
We're used to hearing the word practical as meaning something similar to Choice (A), sensible. But the word has another meaning, used here. Choice (E) captures that.

B. The first makes a general statement about events; the second offers evidence that proves that statement.
The first sentence is an overview of what the rest of the passage — including the second bolded sentence — will prove. Choice (B) is best.

C. The way light interacts with color profoundly affects the way we see.
Some of the answer choices provided here are on the right track, but are too broad, as in Choice (A) and Choice (B). Choice (C) does a better job of capturing the general point of the passage without being so broad as to be almost meaningless.

A. Blue ink
The passage lists colorants "like paints, inks, or dyes" so Choice (A) makes the most sense here.

D. Watching a streaming service on a laptop.
Reading the passage carefully will allow you to note the sentence "The colors on a monitor screen are seen as direct light." Whether you understand the science involved or not, you can tell that only Choice (D) offers a similar situation to that one.

D. Attendees at a design conference, attending a workshop on choosing colors for their graphic work.
The material presented here is introductory, so a group of scientists [Choice (C)] would be unlikely to need to know it. But it's too complex for a group of children, as in Choice (A). That makes Choice (D) the most likely audience.

E. Reflected and direct
The passage mentions direct and reflected light as the two colors of light. Choice (E) is thus correct.

E. It introduces a key concept in understanding light but is not the thesis.
The first sentence is often assumed to be the thesis of a passage, but that's not true here. Instead, Choice (E) is correct: The first sentence sets boundaries for the discussion about light but isn't the main point to be proven by the passage.

B. The era of human vs. robot had begun.
Only Choice (B) presents a continuation of the idea in the second paragraph: that of a human in opposition to a non-human. It's the best choice.

D. To back up her point with a list of examples that prove it.
Although it may seem quite obvious, the truth is that in this inference question, the safest answer is Choice (D) — to provide examples that prove her point. It's the best answer.

A. The idea of "politics" in American literature changes in the second half of the 20th century.
Choice (A) is best. The passage is difficult to follow, but the overarching point is clear from the first sentence.

C. American critical reception that was influenced by the poor review from Europe.
Remember than in an inference question, the idea is not to wander too far down the path from the passage. Choice (C) goes just a bit further than the passage itself and thus is the best choice.

D. What Was the Missouri Compromise?
Choice (D) captures the topic of the passage best. Choice (E) is a little too vague to work — it could refer to many different events — while Choice (D) is specific to this topic.

A. New states located above a certain latitude could not practice slavery.
As the last sentence makes clear, "slavery would be excluded from any new states or territories above latitude 36 degrees, 30 minutes," so Choice (A) is best.

D. Calm statement of fact
The author is not sneering or accepting — he merely restates the historical facts. Thus, the only answer that fits here is Choice (D).

Chapter 6


C. can always differentiate among the three signatures.
The correct answer is Choice (C). When the sentence involves two choices between is correct. Here, there are three signatures, so among is correct, which is only found in Choice (C). Notice that Choices D and E change the meaning of the sentence, and Choice (B) adds in an unnecessary word.

B. but until we know what they think, we can't move forward.
The best answer is Choice (B), because it matches the correct pronoun (they) with everyone, and the verb is correct as well. Choices A and D do not use the correct pronoun (and Choice (C) doesn't use the correct verb for that incorrect pronoun, anyway). Choice (E) needlessly makes the sentence more complicated by changing the word order of a common phrase.

D. but neither he nor anyone else knew the how his invention of the telephone would change the world.
This is a question about pronoun choices, so ignore those answers which do not address this, including Choice (B) and Choice (E). The sentence as is contains a pronoun error: they does not refer back to Alexander Graham Bell correctly. Choice (C) matches the pronouns correctly, but changes the meaning of the sentence, which refers to how Bell's invention would go on to change the world in the future. Choice (D) does the best job of matching the pronoun and making it clear (by the addition of the phrase nor anyone else) that the sentence is meant to show that no one, including Bell, foresaw how his invention would change the world.

A. dissolved into a debate over
The sentence is correct the way it's written, so Choice (A) is best. The idiomatic expression is debate over and the test always wants you to choose the most standard English language expression, even if other choices sound fine.

C. to speak with
Choice (C) is the only answer that uses a common English idiom, to speak with. Choices A, B, and D do not render the idiom correctly, and Choice (E) lacks the needed preposition.

B. Because she was the first to arrive at the cabin,
Choice (B) is the best, because the being construction shown in every other choice is wrong. Being is only properly used as a verb.

A. Either the Pirates or the Orioles are the winners;
The original sentence is correct, so Choice (A) is the best. When either ... or is used with plural nouns, the verb in the sentence must match the noun closest to it. In this case, that's Orioles, which is plural, making are the best choice. Choice (B) changes the meaning of the sentence.

E. rather not
Choice (E) presents the idiom correctly as commonly used in the English language. No other choice makes sense in the sentence.

B. With a mountain forming the perfect backdrop, Adil went for a run yesterday morning.
Choice (B) is the best of the sentence options offered, since it add a preposition (with) to make the phrase a mountain forming the perfect backdrop work as the introduction. The original sentence allows it to modify Adil, making him the mountain! Choice (D) is technically correct but is less streamlined than Choice (B).

A. Who do you think is the better dancer,
Choice (A) is correct because the sentence is correctly written. When the options are only two (Monique or Enrique) you must use the word better not best, which is reserved for three or more options. Choices C and D are written correctly but change the meaning of the sentence slightly.

B. more effective than the exhaust fan in the second examination room.
Of the choices provided, Choice (B) is the best. It clarifies that the comparison is between the exhaust fans in two examining rooms, whereas the original leaves it unclear as to what the second is referring to.

E. Seeing her running to catch the train,
Because you can only modify the first, underlined, part of the sentence, Choice (E) is the best. It makes clear that the people on the platform were watching Suzie, not running themselves.

D. doesn't quiet down
Because of lacrosse players is a prepositional phrase, it is not the subject of the sentence. The subject is group which is singular and thus needs a singular form of the verb, which is only found in Choice (D). Choice (C) changes the meaning of the sentence.

E. To say that Andrew likes ice cream is to understate the truth!
Choice (E) is the best because it balances To claim with to understate, which is the error in the original sentence. The test makers are hoping that you will think the mistake is with the verb, so it offers a few choices in that realm in Choices B and C.

B. to wait quietly by the door
Never split an infinitive verb, which in this case is to wait. Only Choice (B) puts the adverb (quietly) after the verb phrase. It is the only correct choice.

C. is the better ballplayer.
Remember, when you have two nouns being compared (in this case, Juan and Almanzo) you can only choose the better of them. Three or more allows you to choose the best. With this rule in mind, only Choices C and D can be considered, and Choice (D) repeats unnecessary information with the addition of of the two of them. That makes Choice (C) the best.

A. Xu wishes she could join us,
Choice (A) is correct. The sentence is fine as it is.

D. The dispute over who owned the land affected five generations of the Longfellow family.
The popular idiom is the dispute over as in Choice (D). Notice that Choice (E) offers incorrect punctuation — there's no need for a possessive — and Choice (C) misuses re: in a sentence.

B. The cookies in my lunch are smaller than those in Justin's lunch.
The sentence as is presents a false comparison by comparing the cookies to Justin's lunch. Choice (B) fixes this problem by comparing the two sets of cookies.

E. On her first visit to Paris, Parah wanted to visit the Louvre, walk by the Seine and shop in the Latin Quarter.
Balancing phrases with the same verb is the issue in this sentence. In the original, the last phrase (shopping in the Latin Quarter) doesn't match the first two. You can see the problem if you put the sentence together without the first two phrases: On her first visit to Paris, Parah shopping in the Latin Quarter. Choice (E) is the only rewrite that makes sense.

B. The girls and their coach eat together after the game.
Choice (B) matches the verb eat to the subject The girls and their coach correctly. Remember that even though coach is a singular noun, it is combined with The girls with the conjunction and, making the subject plural.

D. As we wandered through the trees, we saw spectacular scenery.
The best answer is Choice (D), which re-words the sentence so that the subject is we. The original sentence implies that the scenery was wandering through the trees, which, of course, does not make sense. Only Choice (D) fixes the problem.

A. The first and only person I thought of was you.
The sentence is correct as written, so Choice (A) is right. The test-makers are hoping that you might remember the rule to always use the plural form of a verb with you. But in this case, the subject of the sentence is The first and only person so the verb must be the singular was.

D. Belle, like many cows, eats a great deal of grass.
This is a subject-verb matching question. It's natural to match the word cows to the verb eat, but the subject of the verb is Belle, not cows. That makes Choice (D) the only correct answer.

A. The McCutcheons or the Jacksons were
The sentence is correct as written, so Choice (A) is appropriate. The subject is joined by the conjunction or, but both parts of the subject are plural, so the plural noun were is still correct.

C. Either Brenda or Xiu might like to tell that story.
The problem in the original sentence is that a plural verb, might likes, is paired with a singular subject in Either Brenda or Xiu. A simple way to tell what to do is to eliminate the names and consider Either on its own. It's clearly singular and should get a singular verb. This makes Choice (C) the best.

B. The audience was euphoric upon receiving their prizes.
Choice (B) is correct because The audience is a collective noun. These are almost always treated as a singular noun on the test. Choice (D) seems like it could be correct because the sentence has been reworded. However, notice that they no longer clearly refers to the audience.

E. Nobody wants more dessert.
This the type of question the GMAT throws at you sometimes in hopes that utterly confusing you will make you guess wrong. Don't fall for it! The sentence is incorrect, eliminating Choice (A), and the only fix for it is to change the verb to match a singular noun. That makes Choice (E) correct because it makes the verb wants. Choice (C) was close, but there's no need to make dessert plural.

C. after he stopped by.
This is a verb tense agreement question. The problem with the original sentence is that the first verb gave is in past tense, while the second verb would stop is in conditional tense. The best fix is to make both verbs past tense, and Choice (C) does that.

C. Dennis wanted to take Neil shopping for a birthday gift, but Neil wasn't available on Tuesday.
The original sentence has several pronoun errors: It's not clear whose birthday gift they're going shopping for, nor it is clear who isn't available on Tuesday. While Choice (B) partially fixes this problem, Choice (C) is the best choice. It makes the sentence much more clear. Notice that Choice (D) and Choice (E) don't eliminate the confusion but make it worse.

A. Annie asked Bill if he would tell her the truth.
The sentence is correct as written. Because the original sentence involves a man and a woman, the pronouns he and her are correct as written. While it's possible that tell her the truth is referring to a woman who is not Annie, you can assume by the answer choices that this is not correct. All of the answer choices only involve Annie and Bill.

D. Because it was sunny and warm that morning, Takeya couldn't wait to get to the beach.
The modifier of the original sentence, sunny and warm, needs to be properly placed. It's a slightly confusing that either the beach or Takeya could be described as sunny and warm, so reading the other choices is necessary. That makes it clear that beach is being described making Choice (D) the best. Notice that while Choice (E) makes a simple, clear sentence, it isn't logical: the beach isn't sunny and warm because Takeya's going to it!

B. Jade was a weaver with a fine sense of color, so her throws were exquisite.
Choice (B) fixes the problem in the original sentence: the adjectival phrase, a weaver with a fine sense of color, is modifying the throws instead of Jade. No other choice fixes this problem.

A. I brought three things to work that morning: my lunch bag, my laptop, and a copy of the report.
The sentence is correct as written, so Choice (A) is the best choice. Choice (E) is very close to being correct, but notice that it adds an unnecessary phrase (with me) that is already clear and does not need to be restated. Choice (C) similarly adds in an extra my which isn't needed.

C. In wonder, Richard stared at the polar bear, the large creature with snowy white hair.
The original sentence has a misplaced adjectival phrase, making it seem that the large creature with snowy hair is Richard. Choice (C) fixes that problem and is the only choice to do so without adding in extra words as Choice (D) does.

D. Choose from
The idiomatic expression is Choose from, so even if other choices seem reasonable, Choice (D) is correct.

B. The winner will be determined by
The idiomatic expression is determined by. Choice (B) is thus the best choice. Notice that Choice (C) changes the meaning of the sentence.

E. Rather than
The standard idiomatic expression is Rather than, making Choice (E) the correct choice.

C. We have to determine a winner between the two semi-finalists.
The best answer is Choice (C) because it follows the grammatical rule than when the quantity in question is two (two semi-finalists) the correct phrasing is between. Choice (D) also uses between but needlessly complicates the rest of the sentence.

D. The costumes for the musical are more elaborate than those of the musical last year.
This is the rare instance in which making a sentence more wordy is correct. The problem with the original is that it compares The costumes for the musical with last year. Only Choice (D) makes it clear that the comparison is between two musicals.

A. I'm trying to determine the better of the two routes suggested, because I want to find the best way to travel to Dublin.
The original sentence, for all its complexity, is correct, so Choice (A) works well here. Remember that better is used when determining between two nouns, while best is used when there are more than two (including an indeterminate amount such as way).

D. I prefer the second of the two flavors of ice cream more.
Choice (D) is the only suggestion that correctly uses the grammatical rule. When only two things are being compared, the correct wording is more. Most can only be used when three or more things are being compared.

A. Jim was the least entertaining at the party.
To choose the correct answer, you have to infer that the party had more than two people. That seems a safe bet, which means that Jim could be the least entertaining person, not just the less entertaining person. So Choice (A) is correct. Choices (C) and (D) are correct sentences, but they slightly change the meaning in each case, making Choice (A) the best.

A. A number of people stopped by my table to ask if I was OK
The sentence is fine as it is, so Choice (A) is correct. A number of is the correct term for a countable group of people, and it's safe to presume that in a restaurant, the speaker could count the number of people who stopped by. Notice that Choice (B) and (C) sound wrong — that's not always a good hint on the GMAT, but in this case, it is.

D. Much of the food was thrown out after five days,
Choice (D) is the best choice. In the original sentence, Many of the food is incorrect. When the amount is uncountable, it's grammatically correct to use Much instead, as Choice (D) does. While Choice (E) also makes this switch, after five days is also changed incorrectly.

B. Bria gave Ebron fewer cookies than she gave Nadine.
Choice (B) is the best of those offered. The original sentence misuses less cookies, which should be fewer cookies. Both Choice (B) and Choice (C) correct for this error, but Choice (C) is needlessly repetitive. That makes Choice (B) the best.

A. It took me more time than I expected, but I was able to buy more towels at the sale.
The sentence is correct as written, so there's no need to make any changes. Choice (A) is correct. Don't be fooled into not following your gut!

B. It took Sally less time at the doctor than she expected, and she was able to buy fewer pills to complete her treatment.
The key question here is whether there is an error in the original sentence and, if so, whether it's in less time or less pills. If you remember that we use fewer when the amount is countable — as presumably pills would be — that makes Choice (B) clearly the correct one.

C. Bob missed much of the discussion, and many of the key points.
Choice (C) is the best choice, because it fixes the error in the original sentence. When writing about a countable amount (as in the key points), we use many of ... not much of ... Notice that Choice (B) is a correctly composed sentence, but it slightly changes the meaning of the original sentence. That makes Choice (C) the better choice.

D. Ma started to pick her way carefully through the stones.
Choice (D) is the best, because it fixes the error in the main sentence. That's a split infinitive — to carefully pick. Choice (C) might have fooled you, but notice that it moved the adverb, carefully, to the wrong place.

B. Too many people think they can start to complain angrily about the poor service after one mistake.
The sentence is a mess, but the main error in the original version is the split infinitive: to angrily complain. Only Choice (B) fixes it by moving angrily to after the infinitive phrase.

B. If Shelly were a nice person,
This is a very tricky question. It makes use of the subjunctive mood verb tense. What you must remember about this sentence is that the subjunctive verb form of to be is always were even if the subject (Shelly) is singular. That makes Choice (B) correct. Choice (D) also employs were but changes the meaning of the sentence to nonsense.

A. That's my professor.
There's nothing wrong with this sentence. It uses a possessive correctly (That's). That makes Choice (A) the best because it correctly replaces the missing letter with an apostrophe. Although it sounds very strange, Choice (E) could be considered grammatically correct, but it's obviously not the best answer.

E. I found its match in the pile of socks.
Choice (E) is correct, because it fixes the apostrophe error in the original sentence. When using its as a possessive (that is, belong to it), there's no need for an apostrophe. It's not replacing a letter.

A. but I know it's just up the road.
The sentence is correct as written. Choice (A) correctly uses an apostrophe in it's because the word is replacing it is. Whether the meaning is that the destination is just up the road, or that the GPS is just up the road, the punctuation would remain the same.

D. Because she's the CEO, Maya likes to get to the construction site early.
The error in the original sentence is the use of Being. Unless it is being used in a phrase like human being or state of being, it's almost always incorrect. In Choice (D), that error is fixed by replacing Being with Because.

D. because he was nervous about his wife's delivery.
Choice (D) fixes the incorrect use of being in the sentence. Choice (C) replaces the pronoun he with Johann, but that's unnecessary. It's clear in the sentence who he refers to.

C. and hold a meeting with his staff.
Choice (C) is the best answer. The original sentence doesn't balance phrases: drop off and pick up are both verb phrases, and also a meeting is a noun phrase. It needs to be changed to a verb phrase as well, and the word also isn't needed.

B. Kate, like many vet technicians, works very long hours.
The prepositional phrase like many vet technicians is meant to trip you up, since it is plural. But the subject of this sentence, Kate, is singular, and should be matched with a singular verb, as in Choice (B).

D. I'm not sure why you were so upset by the phone call.
The original question mismatches the subject, you, to the verb, was. You is always matched with a plural verb even when being used as a singular pronoun.

B. the penguin wasn't going to emerge to find its food again
Choice (B) fixes the error in the sentence. The original uses it's when its is correct.

D. but David got bored and wanted to go home.
The fixed sentence is less than ideal, but remember that on the test, you can only fix the underlined portion of the sentence. Given that constraint, Choice (D) is the best because it makes clear that he is referring to David.

E. As he screamed for the goalie to block the net, Tom was escorted from the stadium by Security.
Choice (E) is the best because it clarifies that Tom was escorted from the stadium while he screamed, while the original sentence implies that Security was screaming.

A. If she were taller, Shakiya could have been a ballerina.
The sentence, which is in that tricky subjective mood, is correct as written. We choose Choice (A) because it uses a plural verb, were, which is always correct with the subjective mood.

E. but neither she nor anyone else realized her over was broken.
Choice (E) fixes the main problem in the original sentence, which is that the pronoun they is unclear. By substituting neither she nor anyone else in attendance, Choice (E) makes clear who exactly did not realize her oven was broken.

B. from the better of two schools' offers
Choice (B) fixes the error in the original sentence. Remember, you can only choose between the better of two options. And Choice (B) maintains the correct possessive form of schools from the original. Choice (E) needlessly adds in the word between.

B. To say that Acadia National Park is a beautiful place is to understate the truth.
Choice (B) fixes the error in the original, which is not balanced. It begins with a to statement: To say that ... and thus needs to be balance with another to statement, as in to understate the truth!

A. I asked Mo'chelle and her brothers to help with the fair.
There is no error in the original sentence, so Choice (A) is the best. It's typical for sentences that are completely correct to appear as if they must have errors after working on questions like these. Stay focused!

D. I was the last to leave the testing center.
The original sentence contains a subject/verb agreement error, because I should not be paired with were. Choice (D) fixes this mistake.

E. The clowns, even Dani, were not the children's favorite act.
Choice (E) fixes the error in the original sentence. The clowns is plural, but the verb in the sentence is was, which is singular. The correct choice is were. Remember that even Dani is a phrase, not the subject of the sentence.

A. Despite Elsie's reluctance, her family is asking for donations.
There's no error in the original sentence. The use of the phrase her family makes clear how the subject is connected to the introductory phrase Despite Elsie's reluctance. Choice (A) is best.

B. You lift me up as a class.
The key issue here is matching the subject, You, with the correct verb. In Choice (B), You is correctly treated as a plural verb, which makes it the best choice. There's no need to alter anything else in the sentence as in Choice (D).

D. Either Renee or Todd will take you
Choice (D) is the best offered here because it fixes the subject/verb agreement issue. Remember Either always makes the noun singular, so it must be used with will take.

C. Nobody wants to go to that club again.
Choice (C) correct fixes the subject/verb agreement problem in the original sentence. Nobody is a singular, collective pronoun and must be matched with wants.

B. Everybody loves music.
Choice (B) corrects the mistaken subject/verb agreement to Everybody loves. Everybody is a singular, collective noun. Note that Choice (D) is a correctly composed sentence but does not have quite the same meaning as the original.

E. We will play when the field is dry,
Choice (E) is the only one here that correctly fixes the subject/verb agreement error. We, which is plural, should be matched with will play.

B. after I learned the basics in high school.
The original cannot be correct because learning in high school must have come before learning in college chronologically. The conditional tense (would learn) cannot be paired with the past tense (learned). Choice (B) fixes this error.

A. Ida fixed Bruce's bike chain after he asked her to help.
Choice (A) is correct because there aren't any errors in the sentence. Both verbs — fixed and asked — are in past tense.

A. I should be the last person you ask.
Choice (A) is correct. There's no need to change anything in the sentence. While Choices (D) and (E) are both acceptable sentences, they slightly change the meaning of the original and are thus incorrect.

A. I asked Miguel if Lilly would be late.
There's no error in the original sentence. Choice (A) is therefore correct. Choice (B) might seem like the better choice, but do make sure to read the entire sentence: late has been changed to later.

D. after extensively researching vampires, publishing several other books, and crafting several early drafts.
Choice (D) fixes the parallelism error of the original sentence. While after extensively researching vampires and publishing several other books are both verb phrases, and also several early drafts is a noun phrase. Choice (D) changes it to a verb phrase.

E. subject to her availability.
Choice (E) is the best sentence. The common idiom is subject to, and that is what the test-makers are looking for you to know.

B. As great as the diner's breakfast is,
Choice (B) correctly renders the idiomatic phrase, As great as so it is the best choice. Notice that Choice (D) and (E) can be eliminated because they do not include the proper punctuation.

A. Because he is in danger of failing, Gomez went to tutoring.
The original sentence renders the idiomatic phrase in danger of correctly. Choice (A) is correct.

C. This argument is different from what we've seen before.
Choice (C) correctly places the idiomatic expression different from in the sentence.

D. Western Pennsylvania is usually defined as Pittsburgh and further west.
Choice (D) correctly uses the idiomatic expression defined as in the sentence.

B. Gretel and I agreed that the pink bubble tea tasted better than the blue bubble tea tasted.
Choice (B) is the best because it matched the comparison in a correct parallelism. The phrase the pink bubble tea tasted must not be matched to just the blue bubble tea but to the blue bubble tea tasted.

A. were prohibited from diving.
There aren't any errors in the original sentence, so Choice (A) is correct. The common phrase is prohibited from.

C. were larger than the eggs gathered in the other coop.
The original sentence has a false comparison. It compares The eggs to the other coop. Choice (C) fixes this problem by making it clear that The eggs are being compared to the eggs gathered in the other coop.

D. rather than going out to eat.
The correct idiomatic expression is rather than, and only Choice (D) uses it.

E. Marie wanted to circle the block slowly until we found a parking spot.
The original sentence splits the infinitive phrase to circle by inserting an adverb, slowly. Only Choice (E) fixes the error in a sentence that is grammatically correct.

A. George Washington had to choose the better of two men when selecting a personal secretary.
The sentence is correct as written, so Choice (A) is the best choice. Remember that when selecting between two choices, better is the correct word.

D. That's the worst of it.
The sentence incorrectly uses worse. Because of it implies more than two — or an uncountable number — worst is the correct choice, as found in Choice (D).

C. was the least interesting.
Choice (C) is best because the three movies are compared in the original sentence. When three or more things are compared, it's appropriate to use least. Do note that Choice (E) makes a false comparison because it doesn't complete the idea of what the last movie is being compared to, while Choice (D) makes a correct sentence but changes the meaning.

A. Many more people signed up for the class than I expected.
There is no error in the original sentence, so Choice (A) is correct. When writing about a countable number, the use of many is correct, and it can be assumed that the number of people who signed up for the class is countable. Note that Choice (E) is an acceptable sentence but does not convey the same meaning as the original.

B. a number of times.
When the amount is countable — as we can presume the physician asking the family was, it's proper to use the word amount. That makes Choice (B) correct. Quantity and amount are for non-countable things.

B. because of his many achievements.
The error in the underlined phrase is not the appearance of a lot, which is so controversial that the GMAT will never present it as a usage error, but in awkwardness of the phrase. Choice (B) is simpler and much more elegant. Remember that Washington's achievements are countable, so many is used.

E. I saw the play you're talking about.
The error in the original sentence is easy to spot: seen had been substituted for saw. That makes Choice (E) the correct one. Don't be thrown off by Choice (D), which "fixes" a prepositional mistake which is not always considered an error anymore.

A. The squirrel dropped its birdseed when we startled it.
The original sentence is correct, so Choice (A) is the best. The use of its without an apostrophe is correct because it is a possessive, not replacing it is.

E. It takes a long time to walk Hadrian's Wall, but it's worth it.
The error in the original sentence is the substitution of its when it's is needed. Choice (E) fixes the error. Remember that it's, with the apostrophe, is the correct substitute for it is.

C. It's about time that Carolyn realizes it's dangerous.
Choice (C) makes clear that both it's in the sentence are substituting for it is and thus should have an apostrophe. The easiest way to figure this out is to substitute it is into the sentence. In this case, it would read: It is about time that Carolyn realizes it is dangerous, which is correct.

E. Given that he was the only nominee, it's not surprising
The error in the original sentence is not with its use of it's, but in the use of Being, which is almost never correct. Choice (E) fixes this error. Notice that Choice (D) doesn't make sense — the word although doesn't work with it's not surprising.

B. From what we could see, Jill's team lost points for lack of originality, not being on the beat, and starting too late.
Choice (B) best fixes the parallelism problem in the original sentence by changing they weren't on the beat to not being on the beat so that the phrases match.

C. The pipes hiss when water runs through them.
The original sentence has an error in how the subject, pipes, matches with the verb, hisses. Only Choice (C) fixes this error. Notice that Choice (B) is a correct sentence but changes the meaning of the original, which involved pipes, not one pipe.

A. They are her best friends
You may feel that the second part of the sentence, despite all of the fights the four of them had had over the years they've known each other is poorly written — and we wouldn't disagree — but there are no errors in the first part, so Choice (A) works best! Notice that the comma is not underlined, so its placement, whether correct or not, cannot be part of the solution to the problem.

D. Carlos, like many science teachers, explains evolution very clearly.
Despite how the answer choices may mislead you, the problem in this sentence is in the subject/verb agreement. The subject is Carlos, and that must be matched with explains. Choice (D) does this correctly. That the subject ends in -s and that the sentence includes a plural phrase, like most science teachers, doesn't change the answer.

B. You, despite the other qualified candidate, are my first pick for the job.
Choice (B) is correct. You is always matched with a plural verb. Notice that while Choice (E) does so, it also uses the word candidates, although the original sentence mentions only one candidate.

B. Beverley's choice is the green; Mindy chose the gold.
Choice (B) best fixes the error in the original sentence, which substitutes a comma for a semi-colon. Semi-colons are used when two sentences that could stand independently are linked together.

C. Penelope, as is the case with many researchers, loves the library.
There's most likely an even better way to phrase this sentence, but of the choices offered here, Choice (C) is the best. It matches the subject of the sentence, Penelope, to the verb, loves, correctly. Notice that while Choice (E) is a correctly formed sentence, it changes the meaning of the original, making it not entirely clear that Penelope is a researcher herself.

B. either Susan or Daveed decides to perform the surgery.
The use of either in the original sentence means that the subject is rendered singular, and the verb must agree with a singular noun. Thus, Choice (B) is the best, with the verb decides.

D. Nobody understands the directions, so please go over them again.
Choice (D) is the best. Remember that a collective noun like nobody is almost always (and always on the GMAT) treated as a singular noun.

C. Monica sent Rachel an invitation before Rachel complained about it.
Choice (C) best reconciles the unmatched verbs in the original sentence, sent, which is past tense, and would be complaining, which is in the conditional tense. Choice (C) puts both verbs in the past tense with sent and would complain.

B. Despite trying everything she could, Dr. Geller could not save the patient.
The original sentence features a misplaced modifier: Despite trying everything she could should modify Dr. Geller, not the patient. Choice (B) is the only option that fixes this effectively.

D. Despite being an astronaut with seven missions under her belt, Rhonda still felt excited about the next one.
Choice (D) best fixes the misplaced adjectival phrase in the original sentence, which implies that An astronaut with seven missions under her belt describes the next mission, not Rhonda.

B. Before swimming the require laps, the team enjoyed a hearty breakfast.
In the original sentence, a misplaced participial phrase means that Before swimming the required laps, is modifying a hearty breakfast. Choice (B) fixes the error so that the phrase correctly modifies the team.

A. That old man is acting like a child!
Choice (A) is correct. This sentence preys on uneasiness about whether to use like or as. Remember that when two things are compared (man to child), the best choice is like.

B. Not everyone can learn to bake the way my mom does.
In the original sentence, the sentiment is expressed in the way we commonly speak. But to be grammatically correct, the sentence cannot include like because there is a verb after the words my mom.

E. The campsite appeared welcoming to the sad and scared hikers.
Choice (E) fixes the misplaced adjectives in the original sentence, making it clear that sad and scared modify the hikers, not the campsite.

B. known for her use of color, strong lines, and collage in her work.
The original sentence fails to use parallelism correctly in the three phrases. Choice (B) best fixes this error, correcting she uses collage in her work to collage in her work. This makes all three phrases match.

A. Ricardo is required to design products, create mock-ups for review, and approve the samples for production.
There are no errors in the original sentence so Choice (A) is best. Notice that while Choices (D) and (E) are tempting, Choice (D) misplaces the phrase for production, while Choice (E) incorporates a parallelism mistake.

E. To say that Ronald was an excellent dad is to give credit where it is due.
Choice (E) best fixes the error in the original sentence, which fails to balance the phrases in a parallelism structure. To say must be balanced with to give credit.

B. rather than the Steelers.
Choice (B) uses the idiomatic expression rather than correctly, so it is the best choice.

A. The race course will be defined as
The sentence renders the idiomatic phrase, defined by, correctly, so Choice (A) is correct.

D. I can conclude from your expression that your team won.
The idiomatic phrase is conclude from, so Choice (D) is the best.

E. A debate over
Choice (E) renders the idiomatic expression A debate over correctly, so it is the best choice.

D. prohibit them from
Choice (D) is the only option that correctly renders the common phrase prohibit them from, making it the correct answer.

A. The play that has always been attributed to
The original sentence correctly uses the idiomatic expression attributed to, so Choice (A) should be chosen.

D. The entrée was different than what I expected
The original sentence contains an idiomatic expression error. The correct expression is different than not different by. Choice (D) fixes this mistake. Choice (E) forms a correct sentence, but the meaning is changed with the phrase than what I expected is dropped.

C. As great as Brooklyn is, Benji prefers Pittsburgh.
The idiomatic expression is as great as, and only Choice (C) uses it correctly.

D. Dr. Huardo felt the results were the best she's seen
The error in the sentence is in the better, which is only used when comparing two items. Since the experiment has been performed for 8 years, we can assume that more than two results are being compared, and we can use the best she's seen construction, which you'll only find in Choice (D).

B. Between the two of us,
Choice (B) is the best choice because the correct phrasing is Between the two of us. When speaking of two items, we use the between construction instead of the among construction.

C. The reports have been printed for over a week, at least.
The idiomatic expression is at least, which is correctly used in Choice (C), making it the best answer.

E. The recommendations from the customer service department are more helpful than those from the human resources department.
The original sentence contains a false comparison by comparing The recommendations from the customer service department to the human resources department. Choice (E) fixes this error by adding in the clarifying phrase those from.

C. It's easy to find the answer when you're looking for it.
The original sentence contains a mistake in Its, which is substituting for It is and thus should have an apostrophe. Choice (C) fixes the mistake without changing the correct you're to the incorrect your.

E. Liu was forced to agree that the cars traveled more quickly on the highway than the buses traveled.
The flaw with the original sentence is a false comparison: the cars traveled more quickly is compared to the buses. Choice (E) makes it clear that the buses traveled. It's the best choice.

D. They're the ones asking for a replay.
The error in the original sentence is replacing They're with Their. Choice (D) fixes the problem. Remember that they're = they are.

E. Most orchid growers obsessively worry over their plants.
The error in the original sentence is in the misplacement of an adverb, obsessively. It should not split the phrase worry over. There's no problem in using Most, so Choice (E) is the best fix.

A. A number of laptops were missing from the cart,
The sentence is correct as written, so Choice (A) is best. When writing about a countable number — and presumably the laptops that were missing is a countable number — it is correct to use A number instead of An amount or A quantity.

B. Jovan applied to five colleges and now has to choose between two of them.
Choice (B) is the best answer. The original sentence uses among when between is the correct choice, as it is used for when two things are being compared.

A. Much of the project was scrapped, but our division kept all of the blueprints.
There is no error in the original sentence. It's correct to use Much in this context, when the number is not countable. The project is not a countable number. Choice (A) is the best.

C. We saw less of an increase than we were expecting after the new logo was unveiled.
Choice (C) is the best here because it uses the wording less of an increase, which is correct for an uncountable number. Notice that while Choice (D) is a correctly worded sentence, it changes the original sentence's meaning. Far less of an increase is not the same as a decrease.

A. The drive took less time than Maddie expected, so she arrived early for the meeting.
Choice (A) is correct. The sentence does not have any errors: less time is the correct phrasing.

D. You did not take time to read the instructions carefully
The original sentence splits the infinitive to read with the adverb carefully. Choice (D) fixes that error.

B. If Jim were a nice guy, he would have asked for forgiveness.
The sentence uses the subjunctive mood, expressing something that the writer wishes was true, but is not. In that tense, the verb is always were, even if the subject is singular, like Jim. Choice (B) is the only one that renders that correctly.

E. The shopping trip took Tony and Deven less time than they expected, but they ended up buying fewer shoes at the sale.
Choice (E) is the only one available that fixes the error at the end of the sentence. When writing about a countable number (such as shoes), it's correct to use fewer, not less.

C. Delores called the theater to complain angrily about the audio problems
There are several issues with this sentence, but in the underlined portion, the biggest error is splitting the infinitive to complain with angrily. Choice (C) fixes this mistake.

A. The cow chewed through its rope
The original sentence correctly spells through, as well as uses the possessive form of its. It's would only be used if substituting for it is. Thus, Choice (A) is correct.

D. Helen, the most affluent of my friends, gives lavish gifts.
The original sentence involves a subject-verb agreement error, since the subject of the sentence is Helen (not friends). Choice (D) fixes the verb to gives which correctly matches Helen.

D. After selecting Joseph, John, and Marni to lead the project, Sam regretted choosing John.
The original sentence contains a pronoun error: It's unclear whether Sam regretted choosing Joseph or John. Choice (D) clarifies which him is meant. Notice that while Choices (B), (C) and (D) all form correct sentences, they slightly change the meaning of the original and thus cannot be the best choice.

B. I didn't like the colors offered, but I had to pick one, so I chose it.
Choice (B) is the best of the answer choices offered. It correctly uses the pronoun it as a substitute for one of the colors. The error in the original sentence is to replace that phrase with them.

C. Because they were excited and happy, the soon-to-be graduates were not deterred by the gloomy day.
The original sentence contains a misplaced set of adjectives, Excited and happy. The way the sentence is worded makes it appear that the gloomy day is also excited and happy. Reorganizing the sentence and making the subject the soon-to-be graduates appear shortly after the adjectives solves this problem. Choice (C) does that.

E. As a nurse with a background in chemistry, Becca easily understood the patient's records.
The original sentence has a misplaced adjectival phrase. A nurse with a background in chemistry modifies Becca, but appears to be connected to the patient's records in the original. Choice (E) rewords the sentence to be clearer, so it is correct.

E. Having prepared the lunch, Jean left for the picnic.
Choice (E) best fixes the mistake in the original, a participial phrase that's misplaced. Before leaving for the picnic modifies Jean, not the lunch.

A. The skills we're looking for in our new hire are excellent customer service experience, a willingness to brainstorm, and a background in finance.
Choice (A) is the best because there aren't any errors in the original sentence. It balances the parallelism correctly, since all three phrases are nouns. Notice that while Choice (E) also forms a complete sentence, it changes the meaning of the original, so it cannot be the correct choice.

C. Dax, an outstanding researcher, often takes his staff to lunch, gives plenty of vacation days, and is sure to remember birthdays as well.
The original sentence contains an error in parallelism: Two of the phrases (often takes his staff to lunch, gives plenty of vacation days) are verb phrases, while he is sure to remember birthdays is a noun phase with the subject he. Choice (C) fixes this error by making all three verb phrases, so they are parallel.

B. If you are in danger of failing,
The original sentence does not correctly use a common idiom, in danger of. Choice (B) fixes that error.

A. We can conclude from the results
The original sentence is correct: The idiom is conclude from. Thus, Choice (A) is best.

D. The statistics appear to
The original sentence does not use an idiom correctly. It is common to write appear to, which is what Choice (D) offers. Thus, it is correct.

D. because of the regulations.
Only Choice (D) uses the correct idiomatic expression: because of. Thus, it is correct.

B. to contribute to the discussion.
Choice (B) uses the idiomatic expression contribute to correctly, which makes it the best choice.

D. The temperature in Austin is higher than the temperature in Dallas today.
This is a false comparison question. In the original sentence, The temperature in Austin is falsely compare to in Dallas. Choice (D) fixes the sentence so that The temperature in Austin is compared to the temperature in Dallas. The comparison is no longer false.

A. The questions on the GMAT are more challenging than the questions on the SAT.
The original sentence correctly uses a comparison by comparing The questions on the GMAT and the questions on the SAT. Thus, Choice (A) is best, since no changes are needed.

D. We don't know yet if it's a boy or a girl.
The original sentence contains its, which is used incorrectly. When replacing it is, use the version with an apostrophe: it's. Choice (D) does this without making any other changes, so it is correct.

E. The penguins swim more gracefully than the polar bears swim.
The original sentence contains a false comparison: How the penguins swim is compared to the polar bears. In Choice (E), the comparison is corrected so that how each animal swims is compared. It's the best choice.

A. Think of your assignment as an opportunity,
The original sentence uses the common idiom construction Think of ... as correctly, so it does not need to be changed. Choice (A) is best.

C. To admit you've erred is to admit you're human.
The original sentence contains a parallelism error. The phrase To admit you've erred requires another to ... phrase to balance the sentence. Only Choice (C) does so.

B. Anna carefully tried to pick her way through the glass shards.
Choice (B) fixes the error in the original sentence: a split infinitive. To pick should not be split by the adverb carefully.

A. To begin paying quickly,
In this case, the infinitive — To begin paying — is not split by an adverb because quickly appears after it in the sentence. This is correct, so Choice (A) is also correct.

D. Mary and Rick took Takeya and Leroy to the store, but Leroy didn't want to buy anything.
Choice (D) best fixes the error in the original sentence, which is the unclear use of the pronoun he. It could refer to Leroy or Rick in the original. Choice (D) shows that Leroy is meant. Don't be fooled by the fact that Choice (B), Choice (C) and Choice (E) form what appear to be correct sentence: They change the meaning of the original.

D. As he yelled that even he could see that the ball was fair, Bobby was taken away from the stadium by Mom.
In the original sentence, the phrase Yelling that even he could see that the ball was fair is misplaced because it appears to modify Mom, not Bobby. Choice (D) fixes the mistake.

D. gasps when the curtain rises
Remember that collective nouns like the audience are almost always treated as singular. The original sentence does not do that, but Choice (D) does. Notice, too, that there is no error in the curtain rises.

E. Despite our invitation, you seem surprised
Remember that you is always treated as a plural noun, even when referring to one person. Thus, it should be paired with seem. Choice (D) forms a correct sentence, but changed the verb to the past tense, which is not in line with the original. Choice (E) is the best choice.

B. works long hours.
Choice (B) best fixes the issue in the original sentence, which mistakes the subject as nurses. In fact, the subject is Mitchell, which needs the verb works.

C. and reschedule her visit to her dentist.
Choice (C) best fixes the parallelism error in the original sentence: buy a wedding gift and resole her dancing shoes are both verb phrases, while and the visit to her dentist needs to be rescheduled is a noun phrase. You can't change the first two because they are not underlined, so you're left fixing the last phrase. Choice (E) is tempting, but doesn't convey the idea needs to be rescheduled.

E. to wait quietly by the door before entering
The complicated sentence structure should not fool you into failing to notice the split infinitive: to quietly wait. Fixing it, as in Choice (E) means moving the adverb to after the phrase: to wait quietly.

A. This is its cage, but it's hiding.
There's no error in the sentence. The first its is correctly possessive: The cage belongs to it. The second it's replaces it is. Thus Choice (A) is correct.

B. Fewer classmates came to the show
Choice (B) is correct because we use fewer when considering a countable number of classmates. Since the rest of the sentence tells you that it was a class of 10, it seems reasonable that Roberto would be able to count the number of classmates exactly.

D. If I were younger,
Remember that when a sentence employs the subjunctive mood, expressing something that the speaker or writer wishes were true but is not, we always use the were form of the verb to be, even if only one person makes up the subject. Thus, Choice (B) is correct.

D. Between you and me,
The original sentence uses among when between is the correct choice for a sentence that compares two things. Choice (D) is correct. By the way, Between you and I is not how the idiomatic phrase is correctly rendered.

Chapter 7


E. It introduces a premise that the argument goes on to oppose.
The bolded portion of the passage is a premise that the rest of the argument goes on to contradict, or prove wrong. Only Choice (E) shows itself as a premise, and must be the correct answer.

E. Autopsies of coyotes killed by cars or found in dead in Keystone State Park revealed that nearly all of them had recently consumed deer meat.
Choice (E) is the best answer because the evidence it reveals helps to support the idea that coyotes have contributed the decline of the deer population in the park. Choice (A) merely restates the argument, while Choice (D) argues against it.

B. Two years ago, a dip in home mortgages dropped inflation temporarily below its stable level of 2% in recent years.
In order to weaken the conclusion in the argument, you have to find a reason for it to not be, or come, true. Choice (B) does that the best here because it provides information that indicates the rate of inflation from two years ago was a one-time blip, and that inflation has already returned to as steady rate of 2% per year.

B. In two years' time, the inflation rate will be higher than 4%.
This question is tricky because it's asking you nearly the reverse of the question before it. You must throw out the arguments made in that question and look only at the initial reading passage. If you do so, you'll see that if the passage is true, it must also be true that the inflation rate will rise to greater than 4% in two years' time, which is Choice (B). There's nothing in the argument that suggests the rate of inflation, which eliminates Choices (A) and (C). While Choices (D) and (E) might seem to intuitively true, we don't have proof of them from the initial passage.

D. Taking a protein supplement has been shown to hurt, not improve, memory.
The question asks you to find the reason that will weaken Ryan's chance of success. Only Choice (D) does that. While Choice (C) is not likely to earn him that 4.0, which Choice (E) says he wants, neither of these weaken his likelihood of success. Choice (A) might, but we don't learn if he prefers to study in the library. In Choice (B), we see a possible reason why his plan might now work, but we are not given enough information. Choice (C) is a bad habit, but Choice (D) shows a direct contradiction to his plan: He plans to take a protein supplement in order to help him improve his grades, but if Choice (D) is true, it's clear that they may not help, and, in fact, hurt his plan.

C. Ryan's Physician's Assistant suggested the protein supplement based on her observation of its success for other student-athletes at Ryan's college.
The best answer is Choice (C) because it provides evidence from a medical professional that a similar plan has recently worked for students very like Ryan.

A. It's possible to bottle milk without preservatives in a way that still makes it safe to drink.
If everything in the argument is true, then Choice (A) must be inferred. A dairy that has eliminated preservatives must have found a way to bottle milk without them. The other choices are either a leap in logic that are not supported by the argument, as in Choices (B) and (C), or restate elements of the argument, as in Choice (D), or are simply too broad to be inferred from the argument, as in Choice (E).

C. Several stores will no longer carry Lange Farm milk because customers have returned too many bottles in which the milk spoiled several days before the "Sell by" date stamped on the lid.
The basic premise of the argument is that Lange Farms says that their milk will be good and tasty for at least a week after it is bottled. Choice (C) shows that they have not been able to guarantee that their milk will not spoil without preservatives. It is thus the best choice.

B. There are no advantages to buying stamps at a shop instead of a post office.
The argument states that the people of the town are making an odd choice. In order to make that argument, it must be assumed that there are no advantages to buying stamps at a shop instead of post office, which is Choice (C). Choice (D) is a good reason to argue against the premise, but that's not what the question asks you to do.

A. What reason do the citizens of Bohlburg give when asked why they prefer to buy stamps in shops instead of the post office?
The conclusion that must be supported is that it's odd for the people of Bohlburg to buy their stamps at shops instead of the post office. The only question that will provide helpful information is Choice (A) because it directly asks why this is so. The other choices make assumptions about why people don't go to the post office — because of the distance or because certain products aren't offered there — but without input from the people of the town, these are not justified assumptions.

C. The company's workforce in Country X can be paid 15% less than the anticipated workforce in Country Y.
Choice (C) is best because it shows the financial logic that could justify remaining in Country X. While Choice (A) and Choice (D) might be important to the company, these are not logical reasons to stay in Country X. Choice (B) has no merit since the company exports its product, and Choice (E) is helpful but not a better reason than Choice (C).

C. The 5% tariff will increase by 1% every year until it reaches 10%, at which point, it will surpass the company's savings on workforce cost by remaining in Country X.
In a question like this one, it's worth your time to seek out the answer that most directly addresses the premise of the statement. Choice (C) does that here, but taking the one number in the question — 5% — and building on it to create a scenario in which the company would be foolish to stay. All the other answer choices are far too vague to be correct.

C. Pineapples grow in a three-year cycle, in which one heavy harvest is followed by two less abundant harvests.
The question asks you to support the argument that farmers should hold back a portion of an over-abundant harvest. Choice (C) best supports that particular line of logic by showing that any given pineapple farmer is sure to have two years of lean harvests after a flush one. Holding back the plentiful harvest will even out their supply.

A. Pineapples can be kept in refrigerated warehouses for a month to six weeks at maximum.
The question asks you to weaken the conclusion presented. To do that, you'll need to find the argument that presents the best roadblock to the idea of keeping extra pineapples in refrigerated warehouses to drive up the price. Choice (A), if true, shows that this plan is not likely to work because the pineapples will spoil. It is the best answer.

E. Stabilizing the riverbank in the area that belongs to J & B Warehouse would help to counteract the yearly floods.
The concern here is not why the flooding is happening, but why the town of Bettyville has decided to pursue litigation against J & B Warehouse for their role in the flooding. Choice (E) best suggests an assumption that must have been made: J & B Warehouse is particularly culpable for the flooding and their property must be stabilized.

D. Jen has been served that brand of soda at her favorite restaurant for years without realizing that she was consuming it, and has never felt sick afterwards.
Choice (D) most weakens Jen's argument, which is that the brand of soda makes her feel sick. If she was correct, she should feel ill after consuming the soda whether she knows she is doing so or not. Choice (D) shows that this is not the case.

D. "Come to think of it, in my journal, I noted that you often complained of a stomachache after we ate at restaurants that served you that brand of soda."
Dialogue questions, while a little strange, do occasionally appear on the GMAT. Here, you need to think of finding the best evidence to support Jen's assumption. Vic offers her own evidence, as in Choice (D), that strengthens Jen's assumption. That's the best choice.

B. It is a premise that will be proven by the rest of the argument.
The bolded portion of the passage is a premise that the rest of the argument goes on to prove. That means that Choice (B) must be correct. Notice that it cannot be the evidence, since it does not provide any. It must be a premise or idea.

C. The news channel based its conclusion on only 3 percent of registered voters' responses.
Here, you're asked to find the most significant mistake in the news channel's logic — in other words, where did they most go wrong with their prediction? Choice (C) is the best answer because it reminds us that the news channel polled a very small portion of registered voters. Choice (B) is a mistake as well, but less important than the extrapolating a town-wide result from 3 percent of its population.

B. It provides evidence to support a premise of the argument.
The bolded portion of the passage is evidence that supports the premise of the argument. The news channel's argument was that Stewin would win, premised on the poll results. Therefore, the registered voters polled provided evidence to support that premise. That's Choice (B). Notice that this is true even if the argument is wrong or flawed: The news channel was incorrect, but its argument was supported by a premise and evidence.

C. A recent Twitter survey of local people shows that they report finding Hitchjaw eels more disgusting than snakes or rats.
The best choice is Choice (C). The argument presented in the reading is that the zoologist thinks local people won't help to save the Hitchjaw eel because they find it off-putting. Choice (C) give evidence to support that idea, in showing that people do, indeed, find them disgusting.

B. Recent efforts by locals have helped stabilize the population of long-eared rats, a deeply disliked local pest.
The premise of the argument is that people haven't helped to save the Hitchjaw eel because they don't like them. Choice (B) points to a recent effort by locals to preserve another animal that they don't like, which argues against their logic in the passage. It best disproves the passage.

A. The zoologist should start a campaign to help people understand and grow to admire Hitchjaw eels.
The conclusion must logically flow from the argument presented. Here, the zoologist has concluded that people won't help animals that they find off-putting. However, if he was able to convince people that Hitchjaw eels are not off-putting — as in Choice (A) — public interest might turn toward helping them. That makes Choice (A) the best choice. Notice that Choice (C) is essentially restating the zoologist's conclusion in the passage.

E... . accept the gift card from Danielle and wait for the white paint to go on sale or to be able to pay an additional $10 for it.
In this question, the GMAT test-makers hope that you'll get confused by the choices. But the premise of the argument is clear: Lucy can't spend more than $30. If that is true, only Choice (E) is a logical choice because it recognizes that premise. Choice (A) might seem like a good choice, but the other premise of the argument is that Lucy wants to paint her kitchen white and it is in no way indicated that that premise is less important.

E. Luis's neck brace will be removed next week, and he will be able to resume his training schedule without further delay.
In this question, test-takers must find a premise that would help the argument make sense. In this case, Choice (E) does that because it provides an explanation that directly shows how Luis could still be the favorite. Choices (A) and (C) hint toward other reasons why he would be, but they are not as clear or convincing as Choice (E).

C. The local newspaper that made the prediction that Luis would win the annual city marathon is unaware of his injury.
The best way to weaken this argument is to attack the conclusion that Luis will win. If it can be shown, as in Choice (C), that the prediction is not based on a full understanding of Luis' situation, that would seriously weaken the conclusion. It is the correct choice.

D. The vegetable distributor principally ships to vegetable juice production companies that have no use for the leafy green tops.
To improve profits is the ultimate goal of the logic in the passage. In order to achieve that goal, only Choice (D) is helpful, providing a clear reason why eliminating the leafy green tops of the carrots would be helpful to the company buying the most carrots.

A. Many customers prefer to buy carrots with their leafy green tops, which can be used in cooking.
The question asks you to find the evidence that would most weaken the plan to cut the leafy green tops off of carrots before selling them. Choice (A) does that the best by providing evidence that carrots without their leafy green tops would be less desirable to many consumers.

D. Because of the extreme stress of the testing process, any windbreaker design that has more than two-thirds of its prototypes functional at the end of the tests is considered sufficiently durable for the consumer market.
The company's decision is based on logic that is not clear to readers. Choice (D) best provides an explanation that shows why the company decided to put the windbreaker on sale. If the test process is so extreme that it is typical for one-third of the products tested to be ruined, that only 20 windbreakers were ruined shows this product to be superior to the average.

E. Consumers often prefer to buy windbreakers that have scored much better in the tests described.
To weaken the logic behind the company's plan to put their windbreakers on sale despite the poor test results, it must be shown that those test results can weaken the potential sales. Only Choice (E) does that by showing that potential customers may be reluctant to buy windbreakers which have not scored well on such tests.

D. The other newspaper in city, the Dubsville Tribune, also reported a similar spate of complaints from their readers in the same month.
That another newspaper in the same city experienced a similar drop in subscriptions at the same time best supports the newspaper's case, so Choice (D) is best. Keep in mind that you may find the newspaper's case dubious, but you're asked to complete its logic, not attack the premises.

C. Dirk: You know as well as I have that we've eaten here every Saturday night for years, and usually there are twice as many employees working.
You want to complete the dialogue in a way that proves Dirk's point as logically as possible. If he has prior evidence that the restaurants is frequently busy on Saturday nights and usually has more staff at work, his case that they can plan for a particularly busy night is stronger. That's Choice (C).

B. We've eaten here before on a Saturday night at this time and been the only customers!
You want to improve Ellen's logic. Choice (B) does this best, by offering evidence that proves her thesis: that there is no way to predict how many people will visit the restaurant on a given Saturday night.

D. A house built on a concrete foundation will definitely survive a tornado.
The argument presented in the passage moves from a "likely" premise (the house is likely to survive) to a "definite" premise (the house will survive any tornados.) This is only possible if the assumption is that likely really means definitely, which is best expressed in Choice (D).

B. Within five miles of the house in the passage, dozens of houses with concrete foundations were destroyed in a tornado three years ago.
In order to weaken the argument, it must be shown that the assumption that a concrete foundation renders a house impervious to a tornado isn't true. Choice (B) supplies direct evidence to counteract that assumption.

B. As Muir's need for water grows, it would have no other water resources except Lake Onnipi.
In order for the argument in the passage to make logical sense, it's necessary for Lake Onnipi to be the only water resource available to the town of Muir. That argument is presented in Choice (B). If the town could access any other water supply, the concern over Lake Onnipi would be lessened.

E. If the town of Muir wants to preserve the fragile trout population of Lake Onnipi, they should consider finding other sources for water in the next few years.
Choice (E) is the best choice. The key in choosing between Choices (A) and (E) is the time frame. The passage tells you that the trout population will be affected in 20 years. Therefore, the rush to curb water usage "immediately," as in Choice (A), seems too rash. Choice (E) presents a more appropriate time frame.

C. A recent scientific study shows a strong correlation between the increase of water consumption in Muir and the decrease in the trout population in Lake Onnipi.
The question asks you to extend the argument presented. What further information would make the argument stronger? In this case, Choice (C) does so by presenting a scientific study that connects the overuse of water and the decrease of trout. It's the best answer.

B... . avoid overconsumption of carrots.
This question seems very simple, and it is. The best choice is Choice (B). People should avoid overconsumption of carrots. No other advice is justified by the passage, and Choice (E) merely repeats a statement in the passage.

E... . eat carrots to excess.
Here, you're tasked with finding a conclusion that most poorly finishes the paragraph's logic. If the paragraph is building a logical case for nutritionists to warn people not to eat too many carrots, Choice (E) is the most illogical conclusion. It encourages people to eat carrots.

D. It's unlikely that Sammy will win the collegiate championship this year.
While we can look at the situation as given and perceive that Sammy most likely won't win the championship, we do not know enough about the situation to absolutely predict that or to make predictions about the probably winner. Thus, Choice (D) is the best answer.

C. The Downintown Police Department has technology that allows it to film most of the fire alarm boxes and see who pulled them.
To support the Mayor's argument with evidence, you need to know what it is: He or she is proposing that the fire alarm boxes be removed because they're a nuisance that keep fire fighters from responding to real emergencies. The best evidence to support that is Choice (C), which would provide actual evidence of people pulling the alarms without reason. The cost of a false alarm, Choice (A), could be a nuisance, but the Mayor has not mentioned anything about the monetary cost of a false alarm so it's not as good a choice.

A. In a recent poll, only 40 percent of the residents of Downintown owned cell phones.
The Mayor's entire argument is premised on the idea that citizens of Downintown won't need to use fire alarm boxes because they'll be able to call for help on their cell phones. Choice (A) is a direct rebuttal to this idea, making it clear that the majority of citizens do not have a cell phone to use. It's the strongest argument against the Mayor's plan.

C. The fire alarm boxes could be fitted with cameras that take photos of those citizens pulling them.
Of the choices provided, Choice (C) is the best. It provides a selection of data that could be sorted into helpful photos of people pulling false alarms. Choice (A) is a step after Choice (C): First the perpetrators need to be caught before they can be fined. Choices (B) and (D) are not logically consistent, and Choice (E) not direct enough to solve this problem.

C. The word "Non-Transferrable" is a significant deterrent to customers who might have otherwise sold their vouchers online.
The logic shown by the marketing department is that marking the vouchers as "Non-Transferrable" will be, by itself, a significant deterrent. Thus, Choice (C) is the best answer.

A. A competing chain found that marking their free drink coupons "Non-Transferrable" did little to change customers' habits of selling those coupons online.
The chain does not want to pursue a court case against people who sell the vouchers. From the passage, it's clear that they just want to keep the vouchers from being sold as often as possible. The plan to mark the vouchers "Non-Transferrable" hits a snag if Choice (A) is true, as it's direct evidence that marking coupons "Non-Transferrable" did little to stop the practice of selling them.

B. Xinyuan wants to earn an A in her class. Her professor told her that she should try to get As on most of her exams. Xinyuan was able to earn an A on all of her exams, and thus, expects an A in the class.
This kind of question is rare on the GMAT, but you'll probably get one of them. Instead of asking you to look at the argument itself, it asks you to think through the logic used in the argument and then find another argument that most resembles the passage. Here, that's Choice (B). Even though the setting is a college instead of a workplace, the logic shown is the same (and as equally flawed, by the way), as in the main passage.

C. It is the conclusion to the argument.
This is an easy one. Choice (C) is correct because the bolded portion is the conclusion to the argument.

D. There might be a reason why Jane's boss wanted her to sell three, not four, houses.
It seems likely that if Jane was tasked with selling three houses in order to get a promotion, four houses would be even better. However, we don't know that for sure, and Jane has changed the criteria under which she was to be promoted. As Choice (D) suggests, there might be a reason that was a bad idea.

D. Scientific studies have consistently shown that yogurt does indeed help create a healthful environment in the digestive tract.
The argument presented is that yogurt if helpful to maintain microbes a person's digestive system. Only Choice (D) provides evidence — in the form of scientific studies — that help to prove that argument is correct. It's thus the only good choice.

A. The source of the nutritionists' belief about yogurt turns out to be a widely-discredited article from the 1950s.
If the argument is that nutritionists are recommending yogurt because it will be helpful to patients' digestive systems, that needs to be scientifically validated. Choice (A) shows that, in fact, the advice is based on a scientifically invalid piece of evidence. It most weakens the argument.

E. Surveys of park visitors show that they consistently asked for a cell phone ban, writing things like "Save us from ourselves!"
The basic premise of the argument is that people are avoiding the park because they can't tear themselves away from their cell phones long enough to enjoy being there. The administrator suggests that by banning cell phones, people may return to the park in greater numbers. The logic here is shaky, but Choice (E) best supports the idea that people want to spend time in a place where their smart phones must be put away.

B. Three years ago, there was a widely publicized incident in the park in which a hiker was hurt and unable to call for help because he didn't have a phone with him.
To attack the argument, one must find reasons why the administrator's logic is flawed, so you can either find another reason why attendance is down or find a reason why people would want to have their phones with them in the park. Choice (B) does both, so it beats Choices (A) and (C), which answer one or the other need.

C. The administration noticed that the 80 seniors who had taken two or more AP classes all were accepted into their first-choice college. The colleges reported that their AP credits strongly influenced their acceptances.
Here, you must find evidence to support the administration's decision to add five more AP classes. Choice (C) is the best answer because it shows why the administration would add courses that are not widely requested by the student body. Choice (A) makes a similar point, but with less specificity and no actual proof. Choice (E) presents another reason to add AP courses, but is likely to be less convincing than Choice (C).

B. A comparison of the number of graduates from next year's class who got into their first choice college, and the number of graduates from this year's class who got into their first choice college.
The most helpful evidence would be a comparison of the rate of getting into one's first choice colleges between this year's senior class and next year's, so Choice (B) is best. Notice that both Choices (D) and (E) are too vague and can be eliminated immediately.

D. My favorite band strictly follows an every-other-summer tour schedule, and have done so for over 20 years.
Despite appearing to be about music, this short passage is really about logic. In order to make the argument true, you have to find logic that would support the idea that if the band didn't tour last summer, they will this summer. Choice (D) best does that, by showing the pattern: if they don't tour one summer, they do the next.

A. The band has always followed a "two summers off, one summer on" touring schedule since their founding 15 years ago.
Choice (A) is the clearest evidence that the band won't tour this summer: It's not in their well-established pattern. Notice that Choice (E) is misleading: Since you know nothing about the band, the lead singer's injury may or may not be a factor. You can't tell for sure.

D. No significant changes have been made to help protect Bridgeton from flooding since 1957.
The argument made in the passage can only be true if nothing much has changed since the last time the town faced a flood. That makes Choice (D) the best answer.

B. Since 1957, Bridgeton has undertaken multiple steps to improve the town's protect against the next flood, including raising the river walls by three feet.
In order to attack the argument, it's necessary to show that the premise that the flood will be more destructive is unlikely to be true. Choice (B) does that best by showing that the town is less vulnerable to a flood than it used to be.

E. Hypoloss carries a high risk of serious complications, including internal bleeding and death.
Notice that most of the choices explain why obesity is a risk factor, but the argument is about why doctors won't prescribe Hypoloss. Choice (E) best gives a reason why that may be. The drug itself carries a "high risk" of serious complications, even death. That's most likely why doctors are reluctant to prescribe it.

D. Three recent scientific studies have found that taking Hypoloss is no less dangerous to a patient than non-prescription weight loss techniques.
It's most likely that doctors, who are scientists, would be most convinced by scientific evidence that argues for a medication that they found dubious. Choice (D) best provides that evidence.

B. Scientific studies on the safety of Hypoloss have not been conducted yet.
Doctors wouldn't want to prescribe a medication that may not prove safe to their patients. Choice (B) indicates that the jury is still out on that question.

D. Gladys: You know as well as I do that the factory on Main Street changes shifts at 5:00 p.m., and that slows traffic to a crawl every day at that time.
Gladys needs to present the best evidence she can to prove her argument is correct. Choices (A) and (B) provide evidence, but they're slimmer than Choice (D), which provides much more clear and convincing evidence.

A. It is a request that Gladys prove her argument.
Although it sounds like a sentence one might hear in a disagreement, the bolded sentence does have a role to play: It is a request that Gladys provide evidence to prove her argument that they will not get there until 6:30. Thus, Choice (A) is best.

B. The university's definition of "most deserving" is not solely based on financial need.
Since we are told almost nothing about the university's scholarship program, we can only use the information we've been given. Choice (B) best does that. Notice that all of the other choices make assumptions that we might be sure are correct, but which are not justified by the language of the passage.

A. A clear explanation of how the scholarship committee defines "most deserving."
The missing evidence that is most needed here is an understanding of how the university defines "most deserving." If given that, we might better understand the choice that was made. Choice (A) is the best answer.

D. The guidelines for the scholarship clearly define "most deserving" as being a student who cannot contribute more than $12,000 a year to their education.
For the decision to be weakened, evidence showing that the scholarship committee chose to award a student who should not have received the scholarship. Choice (D) demonstrates that the committee ignored one of the terms of the scholarship's rules.

B. The majority of customers bought dishes of ice cream, and 80% of those bought vanilla or a vanilla-based flavor.
While Choice (A) has some merit in weakening the argument, the best choice is Choice (B), because it provides evidence that the argument presented is not comprehensive enough. If the idea is to find out whether chocolate flavors are more popular than vanilla flavors overall (and not just in scoop form), Choice (B) gives the best evidence to be considered.

C. It is the evidence that Li uses in his argument.
The information in the bolded sentence is the evidence Li presents in order to support his argument, so Choice (C) is correct. Whether or not we think that the argument is a good one, that is the evidence Li is presenting to support it.

E. Green is a color people like more than red or blue.
Every answer except Choice (E) is an assumption that Li makes. With Choice (E), however, the assumption may not be correct. Li states that people buy more books with a green cover than any other color, but he doesn't indicate that he believes people like green more than any other color.

D. Business C produced more than 80% of the waste City A had to dispose of in the last year.
Don't get distracted! Business C's assertion that it should not have to pay a tax to help offset the fee paid to City B is the premise here. The best argument against it is Choice (D) which makes it clear that Business C does, in fact, produce far more garbage than City A's homeowners.

B. City A's homeowners contributed 60% of the town's waste last year. The year before that, they contributed 68%.
Business C needs to prove that homeowners in City A are contributing more to the trash problem than it is in order for the argument to work. Choice (B) does that best.

D. Many of the creative writing faculty members who've left Wadsworth College have continued teaching at nearby schools for higher pay.
Here, you want to find a reason to support the chairperson's plan. Choice (D), which indicates that creative writing faculty are leaving Wadsworth College because they can do the same work for more pay elsewhere, supports the plan the best.

E. Exit interviews with creative writing faculty members who've left the college indicate that course assignments and inadequate health benefits were the most common reasons they left Wadsworth College.
The idea here is to find the flaw in the chairperson's logic, not merely find a reason why his or her plan is not likely to be approved, as in Choice (C). Choice (E) is the best answer because it indicates that faculty members may not be more likely to stay merely because of a pay increase.

B. "Sure, but we have five months until wedding season this time."
The basic premise of the argument Chip is making is that inexperienced clerks do not help during the wedding season. But Jackie is arguing that they will have more time to train the new clerks this time. Choice (B) best shows that she's right because there is more time to train new clerks this year.

C. It is the evidence that Chip is presenting to bolster his argument.
The bolded portion is evidence that Chip is presenting to strengthen his argument against Jackie. Thus, Choice (C) is the best.

D. The "10 patients per hour" statistic is misleading because it is an average. Daytime nurses sometimes treat 15 patients per hour while night nurses may only see 5 patients per night.
The nurses' union's grievance attacks the premise of the administrator's offer. If all of the ER nurses do not actually see 10 patients per hour, some will be much more likely to earn a bonus than others. Choice (D) shows that this is true.

A. Mystique Auto charges a finance rate that is three times the rate charged by Miracle Cars, and customers must get their financing in-house when buying at Mystique.
Michael Sanchez can feel confident if he has a tangible reason in mind as to why customers would want to shop at his auto dealership instead of Mystique Auto. Only Choice (A) gives a clear, compelling reason why consumers would choose his dealership and thus justifies his belief. It is the best answer.

D. Sanchez does not know that Miracle Cars' CFO has ordered that they raise interest rates on their in-house loans, which had been well below market average.
Sanchez makes his statement with the assumption that nothing will change at Miracle Cars, so they remain in good standing, even when compared to Mystique's new offer. But Choice (D) shows that Sanchez does not have all of the information and that there is good reason to feel less confidence.

B. Meghan: "My coworkers wouldn't stop asking me where I was going on vacation. I finally made them a deal: If they would stop bothering me for an hour, long enough for me to get my report written, I would tell them all about my trip. They left me alone, and when my hour was up, I told them it was none of their business where I traveled!"
Here, you're asked to figure out the logic in an argument in the passage. Hannah's logic seems to run as follows: If I want A, I promise B if he does C. He did C, but I took away B. The closest mirror to this logic is in Choice (B), where Meghan employs the same logic. Notice that Choice (A) seems appealing because it's about a similar situation, but Steve does not use the same logic.

E. It is the conclusion to the argument.
The bolded sentence shows how the argument concluded, so it is the conclusion, as stated in Choice (E).

A. The new racquet costs 200 times the amount of the most expensive racquets made now.
All of the choices presented could weaken the expectation that the new racquet will sell well, but Choice (A) is the largest threat. It practically guarantees that the racquet will sell poorly because the price difference is so large. It is the best choice.

C. The manufacturer has secured the support of three top tennis players to act as ambassadors for the racquet. One was recently quoted as saying the racquet improved her game "more dramatically than I thought possible."
The manufacturer wants to support the idea that the racquet will sell well. Their confidence would like be well-placed if Choice (C) is correct, and several top players are endorsing the product so vociferously.

B... . time how long it takes you to read and respond to a couple of emails in your in-box and that recalculate the time you'll need?
The point of Andrew's argument is that he wants to empty his email in-box in as little time as possible, but he does not know how long it will take do so. Choice (B) is the best suggestion Diane can make. Following it would allow Andrew to make a reasonable guess on how long it will take him to empty his email box while also responding as needed.

E. A survey of Factory B's workers reveled that 78 percent would like to see technological improvements on their assembly line.
Choice (E) best supports the argument that Factory A is more advanced than Factory B. If the workers of Factory B want to see improvement that will be similar to what is already in place at Factory A, that's good evidence to support the argument as stated in the passage.

D. It presents a possible cause of a condition as the only cause of that condition without considering other causes.
The argument is clearly flawed, but figuring out where the major flaw is located is tricky. Choice (D) is best because the argument's biggest error is using one reason to explain why Factory B's output us lower than Factory A's. It may well be because of the technology of the assembly line, but that is not proven yet.

D. Chemicals used in the creation of fabrics are far more damaging to the environment than fabric scraps created in traditional clothing manufacture.
The premise of the argument is that zero waste manufacturing of clothing is not as kind to the environment as some might think it is. The best facts to support that premise is in Choice (D), which shows that a major environmental problem in manufacturing is not addressed by zero waste clothing.

D. Underage drinking has been on a steady decline for the last 25 years, long before the campaign to reduce the portrayal of it on television.
The argument that reducing the portrayal of underage drinking in films can be tied to the reduction of the same in real life becomes questionable if underage drinking has been on a steady decline for many years. Thus, Choice (D) most seriously weakens the argument.

E. There is a direct correlation between seeing an activity on television and taking part in that activity.
As strange as it may seem, there indeed must be a belief that there's a direct correlation between the portrayal of underage drinking and the rise of underage drinking to make the argument work, so Choice (D) is the best.

C. In a poll of graduating high school seniors, 60 percent reported that they did not drink alcohol on a regular basis because of negative portrayals of the same in television and movies.
Poll results are the kind of evidence that provide figures to boost an argument. Choice (C) does that for this argument.

A. Readers are not interested in distinguishing between a well written essay and a hastily written short article.
The basic premise of the argument holds that people cannot or will not distinguish between quality writing and poor writing, so long as something is provided for them to read. That makes Choice (A) the best answer.

B. Subscriptions to print-based journals that publish long, well written essays are at an all-time high.
The fact that people are buying more journals that publish essays would seriously weaken the argument that people do not care what they read. Thus, Choice (B) is best.

A. When the dosage of the drug was half of what was used in the latest round of tests, the reoccurrence rate was still 60%.
The assumption is that upping the dosage will also lower the rate of reoccurrence. Choice (A) demonstrates that there's no connection between the dosage and the reoccurrence rate. That's where the assumption is.

A. Thyroid cancer is considered a relatively small impact disease. Most people recover from it.
Choice (A) may be true, but the impact thyroid cancer has on people who have it is not a factor in the plan to double the dosage.

E. Construction of the bypass is controversial, and most town residents have signed a pledge not to use it.
Of these choices, Choice (E) provides the clearest argument for why the businesses may be wrong. If local residents have pledged not to use the bypass, it is less likely to be used, which would mean that traffic would continue as normal, passing the local businesses.

C. "Because the soda won't go bad, I can drink it tomorrow. I'm paying a little more for two sodas today, but I won't pay anything for tomorrow's soda."
The fact that the soda isn't perishable is the key to Sam's logic. Choice (C) explains that he will be able to consume the soda tomorrow and thus spread the savings into the next day.

D. It is evidence that supports the premise of his argument.
Sam's argument is that it's better to buy two sodas now instead of one soda each day because he will save money. The bolded portion is evidence that supports the premise that he will save money. Choice (D) is best.

E. The book is incorrect. Not all animals, including dogs, can see colors.
If Sparky can't see that the room is blue, it is unlikely to have a soothing effect on him. Thus, Choice (E) is best.

D. Sparky began barking a lot after Tyronicah painted her bedroom red.
However unlikely to work we may find Tyronicah's plan, the best support for it would show that Sparky is apparently affected by the color of the bedroom. Choice (D) does that.

B. It is evidence that supports the premise.
The use of statistics is almost always a presentation of evidence. Here, the sentence in bold is a statistic that is used as evidence to support the premise that there has been a significant increase in accidents. Thus, Choice (B) is best.

D. The lawmakers assume that the threat of jail time would be a deterrent for those who might have contemplated texting while driving.
While Choice (E) is likely true, it's not an inference drawn from this argument itself. The better answer is Choice (D), which looks at the specifics of this argument: Jail time is more likely to deter texting while driving than a fine.

D. The first sentence presents a theory about a topic, while the second sentence introduces the a more recent theory about that topic.
The connection between the two sentences is clear. The first explains what some scientists have put forward as a theory about PTSD, while the second seeks to replace that theory with a new idea. Choice (D) explains this well.

D. An explanation of what the new theory about the link between the impact and the patient is.
In a well written passage — which one must assume this is — the most logical next sentence would explain what the new theory is, exactly. That makes Choice (D) the best.

B. They are interested in reading new theories about PTSD.
In a question like this, the GMAT test-makers know that you're being asked to speculate. The answer will therefore be simple. In this case, the best choice is Choice (B), which is indeed so obvious as to be almost overlooked. It is the best choice because it is the only assumption of those offered that can be very safely made.

A. Bridget: But they also are able to set the price accurately. When you sell your home yourself, you run the risk of underpricing it. And keep in mind that you still have to pay for much of what the agency would cover, such as listing and closing costs.
Luke's concern is that using a real estate agent will be expensive because they take a big profit from the sale of a house. If Bridget responds with Choice (A), she is most directly speaking to that particular concern, so it's the best choice.

C. It is an assumption Luke has made to support his argument.
The sentence Luke says isn't detailed enough to be evidence: He doesn't provide any supporting information. He is using it to support his argument, but it is an assumption he is making. Choice (C) is thus the best answer.

C. Vlad has only walked around in neighborhoods that cater to the large number of American tourists who visit the city each year.
If Vlad is making his argument based on insufficient or biased evidence, the argument cannot be valid. Choice (C) presents a situation in which that would be the case: He isn't getting an accurate sampling of London's restaurant scene, and he's collecting evidence in an area that's biased towards a certain kind of patron.

D. A London daily newspaper recently polled its readers on their favorite cuisine when dining out. "American" won by 30 percent.
Evidence is best presented in quantifiable form, so far as the GMAT is concerned. Choice (D) does so with a figure that supports the idea that American food is increasingly popular in London.

B. He could argue that the practice of wearing glasses with non-prescription lenses is very common these days, citing a statistic that 25 percent of glasses-wearers do not actually need them.
Nancy refuses to wear glasses because she does not need them, and feels doing so would mislead her viewers. The best counter-argument presented here is Choice (B), which effectively points out that viewers may not assume that Nancy needs the glasses.

C. Studies show that when a news anchor feels she is lying, it is perceivable by viewers in her body language.
Nancy's argument is that wearing glasses would be a lie, which would affect her performance and/or her relationship with the audience of the show. Choice (C) most clearly speaks to that idea.

C. The author's novel will become a best-seller.
The assumption least likely to be in use here is that the novel will become a best seller. We don't know why the publisher wants to re-release this novel, and certainly have no reason to think he expects it to be a best seller. Thus, Choice (C) is the best bet.

C. The author's estate was recently taken over by a law firm capable of practicing much closer diligence.
The publisher's argument is based on the premise that the author's estate is not paying attention to what happens to the author's works. However, Choice (C) would indicate that the estate is now capable of paying far closer to attention, which would ruin the publisher's plan. It's the best answer.

A. The margin of error for the poll is greater than the difference in support between the candidates.
It's good to remember that the question has asked for the "most likely" reason, not "a plausible" reason. There are several plausible reasons, but Choice (A) is the most likely reason: It is factual and would be an immediate disincentive to publish a prediction if true.

B. Written proof that the fundraisers for this organization were paid for by generous donors so that the money raised could go to people in need.
Because Ben's specific concern seems to be that the organization is putting a great deal of money into lavish fundraisers instead of helping people in need, proof that the organization is not paying for those fundraisers would be most helpful in convincing him. Thus, Choice (B) is the right answer.

A. Over 40 percent of the organization's budget is dedicated to fundraising.
To support Ben's argument, it's necessary to find a evidence that the organization bankrolls fundraising far more than helping people in need. Choice (A) would help with that. 40 percent is a significant portion of any size budget.

D. The first sentence is evidence that Ben is using to support the argument he is making, and the second is the conclusion to his argument.
In the first bolded sentence, Ben is sharing evidence to support his argument (that the organization spends too much on lavish fundraisers). The second sentence is his conclusion: He states what he will do instead of supporting the organization. Choice (D) is best.

E. Scientific studies have conclusively proven that there's no truth to this advice.
Suzie's argument is that her mother's advice must be correct because she's followed it and never had a cramp while swimming. The best argument against this is to show that the connection is coincidental, not casual. Thus, Choice (E) is best because it provides factual proof that Suzie's argument does not make sense.

B. "I asked my doctor, and she said that this was a good policy to follow. Cramps are often caused by eating followed by vigorous exercise."
Suzie's argument is weak because it relies on what could be coincidence. It can be improved with some sort of evidence. The closest to doing that here is Choice (B), in which a scientist puts her weight behind Suzie's argument.

D... . students should be encouraged to think about whether spending time on social media is affecting their decision-making about bullying behaviors.
Most of the choices here are too broad to have been derived from the study. Choice (A) is the sort of obvious response that is a societal goal, not the result of a study. Choice (D) gives the best take-away from the study, presenting a reasonable response not a broad statement.

C. There is a direct link between the use of social media and the likelihood that the user is an online bully.
Without the assumption in Choice (C) — that social media's usage and bullying are interconnected — the argument does not make logical sense. Thus, it is the best choice.

C. The loss of a major contract with a hotel corporation has also contributed to the manufacturer's decline.
The manufacturer's argument is an attempt to show how that the factory can no longer be profitable. To do this, showing that business will not pick up is helpful. Choice (C) gives more evidence suggesting the factory's decline.

A. The manufacturer recently secured a large, multi-year contract with a restaurant chain.
A contract with a lucrative customer would argue against ceasing production. That the contract is "multi-year" is particularly compelling. Choice (A) is the best choice.

E. A beauty salon has decided to close. Few women need a weekly hairstyling session, and the products used in styling hair are very expensive. Thus, the salon is putting more money into products than its making back in sales.
The connection between a hair salon and a raincoat manufacturer may be less obvious, but the argument — essentially that supply far outpaces demand — is essentially the same. Thus, Choice (E) is correct.

E. "As you know, the Police Department is next door, and we're going to offer a discounted admission to people who present a ticket from that auction."
This question is fairly easy; you just need to find the sentence that provides actual evidence. Choice (E) does that the best, if you recognize that Choice (A) would weaken the argument, not strengthen it.

A. "The Police Department's event has three times the number of items up for auction and admission is free!"
Choice (A) provides a reasonable counter-argument: If the other event has more items and is free, people are indeed more likely to attend it. Notice that Choices (B) and (D) might provide counter-arguments if they were given more context, but without more information, Choice (A) is stronger.

D. The prior eight years are incidental, not prophetic.
The question is essentially asking you to find the biggest flaw in the argument. Here, the assumption that the rate of inflation follows a fixed pattern is the largest flaw, and Choice (D) points that out. Other choices point to flaws, but not as large as Choice (D).

E. It is evidence that supports the argument being made.
The bolded sentence presents evidence that supports the argument being made, so Choice (E) is best. Choice (C) would have been a good guess if it was about the argument, not the counter-argument.

B. It is possible to produce food without preservatives that is safe to consume.
For the passage to be true, it must also be true that Marr Foods is able to make products that are safe to consume and do not have chemicals. That makes Choice (B) the best.

C. Several other scientific studies found that preservatives were in no way harmful to those who consumed food with them.
The basic premise of the argument is preservatives are harmful to those who consume them. If that is not true, the rest of the argument falls apart. Choice (C) makes a strong argument that the scientific study presented by Marr Foods is not representative of the common consensus.

C. Neighbor A is on a plan from the water authority that provides a lower rate on water in the morning hours.
The key here it to identify the correct argument that you need to find support for. Neighbor A's chief concern is the cost of watering his lawn later in the day. Choice (C) points to why that is: He is able to save money by watering the lawn earlier.

D. That Neighbor A doesn't have a good reason for watering his lawn in the morning.
To choose the answer correctly, you need to be alert to the difference between facts and assumptions. Choices (C) and (E) are facts; Choice (D) is an assumption that Neighbor B is making about Neighbor A. Given the wording of the question, Choice (D) is thus best.

A. The first sentence is a premise to an argument, and the second sentence is a response to a counter-argument.
The first sentence presents Neighbor A's argument, and the second sentence shows that Neighbor A is rejecting Neighbor B's counter-argument. Choice (A) is correct.

B. Customers have repeatedly asked the company to offer an unlimited usage plan, which many other cell service providers already offer.
If customers do not like the new plan, it will not do well. If they do, it will do well and revenues will increase, regardless of any other detail. That makes Choice (B) the best offered.

D. A mock trial team that often makes it to the final round of competition but rarely wins is frustrated. They've decided to interview the members of the 2002 team, which won the state competition. Using those techniques, they're sure, will put them over the top to win.
The logical structure in the original passage is a flawed plan to use the idiosyncratic success of a past group of people to improve the chances of another unique group of people in winning the same title. Choice (D) best follows that logical scale.

A. It concludes the coach's argument.
The best answer is Choice (A). If the team follows the coach's plan, it will conclude in making it to the final game. Remember that the merits of the argument are not the question here. You may find it flawed, and it is, but that's not the point of the question. Avoid Choice (C).

C... . look for opportunities to schedule events before or after typical working hours and on weekends.
All of the choices here are possible, so you need to focus on choosing the one that best completes the passage. The need for further information, as in Choices (B) and (D) seems unnecessary. Choice (A) doesn't address the problem, and Choice (E) addressed the problem with the wrong people. That leaves Choice (C), the most direct response to the problem, and the best choice.

D. There's no "build up" in playing the slot machines. Each game is new and not tied to the game before it.
Sheila's theory is based on the idea that slot machines must be primed to cash out, and thus watching someone else lose repeatedly is priming the machine for her take-over and win. If Choice (D) is true, it means that her plan is meritless: Slot machines are not primed.

B. A scientific study, based on the observation of 500 slot machines at a Las Vegas casino, showed that machines that are played repeatedly are three times more likely to cash out.
The best evidence would show help to prove Sheila's theory that slot machines that have been played frequently are primed to cash out. Choice (B) provides scientific evidence that proves that, in at least one case, Sheila's theory is true.

D. When Jane says that she prefers to go to the beach when it is less crowded, she may not mean that there are actually fewer people on the beach than at any other time of the day.
The trick with this question is to understand that the logic it is seeking is not Jane's internal logic, but rather, how Jane's choice can be justified logically. Choice (D) does that best because it explains what Jane is most likely thinking.

B. An explanation of an apparent discrepancy in her argument.
Jake is presenting a discrepancy between what Jane says she prefers and what she actually does. He's found an error and wants her to explain it. Choice (B) is correct.

E. Reducing an avalanche's impact by 50 percent is not the same as reducing the likelihood of an avalanche by 50 percent.
The answer here is obvious if you take the time to read through everything presented to find it. Any reduction in an avalanche's impact is not the same as being less likely to have an avalanche. Thus, Choice (E) is the best answer.

C. When the impact of an avalanche is reduced, the avalanche is less likely to travel further down the mountain and affect skiers.
The main problem with the argument made by the marketing company is that it conflates the impact of an avalanche with having an avalanche at all. Choice (C) provides further evidence to solve the problem, making it the right choice.

D. Company L's speed at producing widgets has repeatedly caused accidents that ultimately cost the company more money than producing at a lower rate.
Here, you're looking for a reason why the owner of Company K would not fully embrace Company L's methods. Choice (D) provides the best evidence why this would be true: Company L's methods are both dangerous and costly.

A. Because Company K's production line was already more efficient than Company L's, a few more small changes should allow Company K to produce widgets at a rate of 150 a minute.
In order to attack the argument presented, you need to find a reason why Company K shouldn't stop at just two improvements. Choice (A), which reveals that the Company could soon be producing 150 widgets a minute, is the best choice.

B. The first sentence is evidence used in building the argument, and the second sentence is the conclusion of the argument.
Choice (B) is best here. The first sentence presents evidence that helps to build the argument (even if it seems to be countering the main argument), while the second sentence presents the conclusion of the argument, using the evidence from the first sentence.

B. In a poll of recent law school graduates, "job fluidity" — that is, the ability to change positions and firms — was one of the top three qualities new lawyers wanted in their first jobs.
To argue against the board's idea, you need to find reasons to show that the potential pool of applicants would not like having to sign a five-year contract. Choice (B) provides evidence that this would be disliked.

D. Poll data collected from current first-year associates about whether they would have taken the job if such a clause was included in their contracts.
The best answer here is Choice (D). First-year associates at the firm are in the best position to evaluate whether the contract — which they have recently signed themselves — would be as sought-after if they had to commit themselves to five years at the firm.

B. It's possible to correctly bake a cake at a higher temperature so long as the time the cake is in the oven is reduced.
The cake baker in the argument is making an (incorrect) assumption that baking a cake at a higher temperature will work out find so long as the time the cake is in the oven is reduced. That makes Choice (B) the best answer.

E. Baking is a chemical reaction dictated by the recipe that cannot be sped up by setting the oven temperature higher.
This is the kind of argument that is so clearly flawed that it can be difficult to figure out exactly what the flaw is. Choice (E), which points out that the argument has no scientific merit, is the best bet.

D. The majority of volunteers who staff the clinic are doctors and nurses with full-time jobs, and they are often scheduled for hospital rounds and surgery in the morning hours.
The argument here is not about whether the clinic is a good idea, or even if it is needed. Instead, the question is asking you why the supervisors would decline to open the clinic in the morning. Choice (D) provides the best answer. Choice (C) has some merit but is really making a separate argument for evening hours, not arguing against opening the clinic during morning hours.

C. Morning hours would allow the clinic to see, on average, 20 additional patients per day.
Don't get confused by the question. The Davis County supervisor wants to extend hours into the morning at the clinic. Choices (A), (B) and (D) support the existence of a clinic more broadly and do not offer any particular support for morning hours. Only Choice (C) does that, making it the correct answer.

E. CheapDeals won't build in a town where they have been clearly told they are not welcome.
The argument is to support the idea of protesting the arrival of CheapDeals. The assumption presented in Choice (E) — that CheapDeals won't build where they're not welcome — is the assumption behind the protest.

C. CheapDeals tries to keep a low-profile; the publicity from a protest has kept the company from setting up shop in other towns.
To support the argument that they should protest, the store owner needs to show that a protest could be effective. Choice (C) best shows how that could be true by offering evidence that protests against this company have worked before.

B. If the jewels were to be stolen, thieves might target the smaller items, which will be displayed less securely, rather than the larger items.
The director's argument is flawed, but the key to this question is figuring out where the greatest flaw is. Choice (B) points out one of the problems with his logic: He's assuming that thieves would choose to take the larger jewels, but there's actually no reason to think that is likely.

D. "I put on sunscreen before leaving the house, but I didn't bother with insect repellent. The sunblock should be strong enough to keep away any mosquitos that show up."
The best answer here is Choice (D). While the topic here is different from the original argument, the logic is the same. By buying one kind of protection, the speaker hopes that other protections will fall into place even though steps have not been taken to secure them.

E. "I put on sunscreen before leaving the house, but I didn't bother with insect repellent. The sunblock should be strong enough to keep away any mosquitos that show up."
Remember, the conclusion of an argument doesn't always have to arrive at the end of the passage. Here, Principal Lavine proposes his solution before presenting evidence that explains why the solution must be what it is. That's Choice (E).

B. The parking for visitors and parents is rarely used, so 30 empty spaces are often next to the school but forbidden to the students.
Choice (B) is best because it argues against the premise the principal puts forward in his argument: There is no alternative for expanding student parking except to convert a field into a parking lot. Choice (B) implies that, in fact, the visitor and parent parking could be converted without much difficulty.

D. A historical map showing the growth of neighborhoods in New Winchester.
It's probably possible to rank these from most to least helpful, but surely Choice (D) would prove to be of little help. It's not clear how understanding the past growth of neighborhoods in the city would shed any light on the paradox Julian has noted.

B. The grocery stores are located on the outskirts of town, whereas the corner stores are in residential areas.
The discrepancy must be addressed here: What would cause people to routinely pay more for an item that they could get less at a grocery store? Choice (B) provides the best answer: The corner stores are geographically more convenient than the grocery stores.

A. There must be something appealing about the corner stores that make people willing to spend slightly more money there than at the grocery store.
Choice (A) seems so simple as to be obvious, but it's really the only choice one can logically conclude from the passage. Notice that the question asks for a "logical conclusion" — that's the key that Choice (A) must be right.

B. How does lettuce production from Mapple's government-owned farmland compared to production from farmland owned by private industries?
In order to evaluate this argument, you must look for a question that gets to the heart of it: Why is private industry's farmland more productive than farmland owned by the government? Choice (B) is the best evaluation question here because it would allow for the collection of data comparing the two types of farmland.

C. There's no discernable difference in the amount of lettuce produced per acre by the government's farmland and by farmland owned by private industry.
The basic premise of the argument is that there is a significant difference between the amount of lettuce produced on government farmland and the amount produced on farmland owned by private industry. If this is not true, as in Choice (C), the argument is severely weakened.

B. The bridge is only open from 6:00 to 8:00 a.m. on weekdays.
If Choice (B) is true, it implies that the problem with the bridge is not that it should be closed down, but rather, that it is not open enough.
