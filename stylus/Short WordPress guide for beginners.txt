Unlike third-party services, you have the assurance that zou can access and modify everything in your weblog, if you need it. This also means that you can install WordPress on your computer at home or office or even on an Intranet.Portable core: You can choose to place the WordPress file tree that form the administration interface of your public weblog in the same folder as your weblog or all other directory. For example, if you want to place your weblog on http://teleactivities.com (public_html is the "root" of your public web server or web host) and you want to place the WordPress files in http://teleactivities.com/wordpress (public_html/wordpress) you can do it!UTC compatible: WordPress allows you to set your time as an offset to Universal Time (UTC), and all elements related to time are stored in the database in GMT, which is a universal standard. Among other things, this helps you display the correct time on your server, even if your hosting server is located in another time zone.Gzip
compression: You can save bandwidth by enabling gzip option in your WordPress installation. WordPress compresses the content when a visitor's browser supports this feature. This option requires that the mod_gzip module is available on your Apache web server hosting your WordPress.User management: WordPress uses a rights management system to allow users access to certain functions. You can restrict the ability to create and edit content for a user by changing its level.User profiles: Each user on your weblog can, if he wishes, define a profile by entering information such as their email address, alias for instant messaging, etc. Each user can choose the way this information is visible on the weblog.Easy installation and update: The installation system in 5 minutes WordPress is unbeatable at ease. Update your weblog to the latest version of WordPress is also easy and should use even less time!Dynamic generation of page: No need to rebuild all of the pages in each update of your weblog or anything like that. All pages are generated instantly for each query using the database and presentation templates. This means that posting an article or modify the presentation is as fast as possible and the necessary storage space is minimalInternationalization and localization: You can create a weblog localized and made available in the language of your choice. Gettext is used to translate and localize WordPress into every corner.WordPress installationBefore installing WordPress...... You need to check: That your host fulfills the necessary conditions (no panic, most of them meet it).That you have the skills (do not worry, it's not so difficult).These two conditions should not be a problem, but it is wise to check it before you start.Do you have the necessary tools?BrowsersThis seems obvious, but you need a browser to allows you to view your site and log into the Administrator interface.In general, we recommend instead the standards compliant browsers such as Firefox, Opera, Safari (Mac), Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, etc.Text editorsYou must know how to use a text editor to edit the main configuration files. If you are a Windows user, Notepad will be ok for the moment. Later you may want to change the page templates. You can do it from the WordPress admin interface, but it is strongly recommended to use a good text editor: Mac : TextWangler2, Smultron, SubEthaEdit, Taco HTML Edit, ...Windows: ConTEXT, TsWebEditor, Notepad++ ...Linux: Gedit, ...FTP clientsYou will need to use a FTP program for file transfer from your computer to the server and possibly change the permissions.

See the support pages of your provider or your control panel about whether or not you need to create one manually.If you consider that you need to create one manually, follow the instructions for accessing phpMyAdmin on many servers or to use your control panel or phpMyAdmin as below.If you installed WordPress on your own web server, follow the instructions on the use of phpMyAdmin or MySQL client below to create your database and your user name of WordPress.Using cPanelIf your host uses cPanel, you can follow these instructions to create your database and your user name of WordPress. Log in to your cPanelClick on MySQL DatabasesIf a user relating to WordPress does not already exist in the Current Users section, create one: Choose a username for WordPress ('wordpress' is quite suitable) and enter it in the Username fieldChoose a password difficult to guess (ideally containing a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols) and enter it in the Password and Password (Again) fieldsKeep this information in a safe placeClick Create User.If on WordPress database does not yet exist in the Current Databases section, create one: Choose a name for your WordPress database ('wordpress' or 'blog' are good choices), enter it in the field New Database and click Create Database.In Add User To Database, select your WordPress username from the dropdown User list and your database from the dropdown Database list. Click Add. Make sure that all boxes are checked in the ALL PRIVILEGES section, and then click Make Changes.Once back to the main screen of MySQL Databases

In the Privileges section specific to a database (Database-specific privileges), select the database you just created for WordPress in the combo. Add privileges on the database (Add privileges to the following database). The page will refresh the privileges for that database. Click Check all to select all privileges, and click Go.On the next page, identify the host name listed after Server: top (this will probably localhost).Using MySQL ClientIf you have shell access of your web server, and you master the use of the command line, and you have enough permissions to create databases and MySQL users, you can follow the example below to create your database and your user name of WordPress.$ mysql -u adminusername -p Enter password: Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g. Your MySQL connection id is 5340 to server version: 3.23.54
 Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.
 mysql> CREATE DATABASE databasename; Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
 mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON databasename.* TO "wordpressusername"@"host" -> IDENTIFIED BY "password"; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
 mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES; Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
 mysql> EXIT Bye $In the example above: adminusername should be root, unless you have other superior users.wordpress or blog are good values for databasename.wordpress is a good choice for wordpressusername.The host is usually localhost. If you do not know this value, consult your system administrator. If you are the system administrator, you must have this value in your possession.It is advised that password is a password difficult to guess, ideally containing a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.Keep in a safe place the values you used for databasename, wordpressusername, host and password.Configuring wp-config.phpThe file wp-config.php can be created manually, or automatically during the installation. Also, it can be edited when one or more data (especially database) are changed.Looking ahead, the code you want to change is the following:define('DB_NAME', 'database_name_here'); // The name of the database
 /** MySQL database username */ define('DB_USER', 'username_here'); // Your MySQL username
 /** MySQL database password */ define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here'); // ... And password
 /** MySQL hostname */ define('DB_HOST', 'localhost'); 99% probability you will not need to change this valueFor manually configuration, go back to where you extracted the archive WordPress, rename the wp-config-sample.php file to wp-config.php.Open the renamed file wp-config.php in your favorite text editor and fill in the following information, for the example above: DB_NAME: The name of the database you created.DB_USER: The user name you created for the database.DB_PASSWORD: The password that you chose for the above database username.DB_HOST: The host that you use for database (usually localhost, but not always).Save the file.Install WordPress ThemesYou have finished installing WordPress, and playing with its settings? Now you want to install a WordPress theme for your web site has the desired look. Good idea! Because it must be said, the theme provides by default by WordPress is not really sexy. Not to mention the fact that it is made just for blogging. Well, you tell me that the last point does not matter, because after all, WordPress is a blogging platform, right? ;)Installing a WordPress theme, it's really not difficult. I think if you ask yourself the question, then there is a good chance that a WordPress training is welcome ;)So, let's discover how to install a WordPress theme.A WordPress theme, what is it?Yes, before asking the question of how to install a WordPress theme, we should understand what a WordPress theme is, right? For simplicity, let's say a WordPress theme is a graphical skin, that plugs into the features offered by WordPress. But although this is not wrong, it is a mind shortcuts that might make you commit a fundamental error. Believe that a theme is only cosmetic. A theme may also be features. It is increasingly common to find themes that are not restricted to cosmetics, but that will come, for example, offer us a guestbook area, team, FAQ ... These new features make you dependent on your theme. Once you have used the new features offered by your WordPress theme, how are you going to move to another theme? So we must ban a theme that proposes this type of functionality? I would answer, yes and no :)Yes, we should ban this type of theme. But it is almost impossible, as the number of WordPress themes offering additional features starting to become the norm. So there is a way to avoid becoming completely dependent on a particular theme, do not use its CPT, and use plugins instead.Free or paid WordPress theme?If you are really a complete beginner in WordPress, you do have may not be aware, but there are two ways to get a theme. Either free or by paying it. Anyway, you have to understand that if someone offers you to give you a paid theme for free, the problem is to be sure that this theme has no code other than the theme in question, and that you're not about to install a beautiful back door on your website ...Installing a free WordPress themeIf you have already installed a plugin via the administration interface of your WordPress website, you will quickly realize that installing a WordPress theme is very similar, and frankly simple. Go to Appearance > Themes.To add a theme, you have two options: Click on Add New Theme Click Add NewBoth lead to the same screen.Search criteriaAs we can see from the following screenshot, five search criteria are available to us. Featured, Popular, Latest: Well, these filter are rather simple to understand I think ... But you will spend a lot of time this way.
Feature Filter: This part is already more interesting because you will be able to filter by colors, layout, features, or subject. Colors: You can filter based on the colors available in the theme. But if you're new, then you probably do not know that the majority of themes offer the ability to set the color that you want. I would not say that this filter is obsolete, because if you look for a particular color, this will help you.Layout: A filter whether you want one column, two columns ... The sidebar to the right, left, responsive or not, ...Features: While there, I find this filter already much more interesting than the first two. The list is slightly longer, so I leave you care to look at it to see them all. But the idea is that you'll be able to choose a theme that will support the right-to-left, the ability to customize your colors, compatible with BuddyPress ...Subject: We can say that there is not a lot of categories, three only, for the moment ... . Too bad.Search themes ...: Here again, I do not think I need to introduce you to the usefulness of this field of research. The field does not support search operators (such as *).Theme PreviewNow that we've seen how to find a free theme, available in the repository of WordPress.org themes, we'll see that you can preview it. For this, first let's look at what it's like our interface when a search returns results. Here, the search term blog.When we move the mouse over the thumbnail of a theme we like, the phrase Details & Preview appears, accompanied by two buttons, Install and Preview.For Preview mode just click on the thumbnail, or the button Preview. This gives us something that looks like the following screenshot for the selected theme.To see more clearly, we must understand that this screen is divided into three. The right part, the most important, is the preview strictly speaking of the selected theme. The left column is divided into two parts.I think this party speaks for itself. It includes the theme name, the name of the developer, an illustrative vignette, number of stars, version, and description of the theme, strictly speaking.The last part though perhaps more obscure because they are only icons without text.Well, in terms of the blue button, the question does not arise too much, it will allow us to install this WordPress theme. But what are the right and left arrows? They allow us to move to the preview of the previous and following themes, which were offered to us in the previous screen. It's more convenient, no need to exit preview mode to see other themes! Speaking of out of preview mode, this is what will make the icon on the left, in the form of X.InstallationYou have finally found the theme that will have the chance to be the one you will use for your WordPress site? Cool, you must install it now. Frankly, nothing complicated. You can install from two places. Either in the themes of search screen, by clicking Install, orFrom the preview mode, also clicking the Install button:Installing a WordPress theme does not mean it is activated. In other words, install a theme means it makes it available in the section Appearance > Themes.Well, I doubt that your goal is not just to make it available, but to have it enabled on your site.There are two possibilities for the theme you just installed to become the active theme: Either you activate it directly after installation, orFrom the management screen themes of your WordPress website (you must hover over the thumbnail of your theme)So, you just installed and activated a new theme for your WordPress site, now you still have to configure it. But as the configuration of your theme depend on  the theme you have chosen.Install a paid WordPress themeSo you've chosen the dark side of the force, and you want to install a paid WordPress theme. Ok, so discover it together :)The trick with pay issues is that they are all more or less different, and that's going to see the start. Indeed, most of the time, you're gonna buy your theme, and we will offer you to download an archive. This archive, or zip, can either contain only the theme or be a more comprehensive archive, where we will find the user guide, the license ... and an archive of strictly speaking theme. It will be up to you depending on the theme that you have purchased.To install the WordPress theme, you will see that there are two methods:Install by the administration interfaceThe most natural method when you want to install a WordPress theme is to go through the administrative interface. For this, go to the section Appearance > Themes. And yes, like installing a free WordPress theme. But here you click on the button Upload Theme.You click the button Browse to upload your theme archive. Warning, it must be in Zip format. Once selected, you click Install Now. Depending on the size of the file, and your bandwidth, you will have to wait longer or shorter time.Install using FTPIf you have already successfully installed WordPress, logically, if I speak FTP I not talking Chinese. You must already have your FTP client such as FileZilla, and your FTP codes.Before launching your FTP client and log on to your site, you first unpack your archive. Conversely an installation by the administration interface, here it requires the archive is decompressed.Now you can launch your FTP client. It is necessary that for the part Local Site you may be positioned up to the directory containing your theme, and for the Remote Site section you may be in the theme directory on your server, usually /wp-content/themes/.Whether you're installing your WordPress theme by the administration interface, or FTP, is the same result.Activate the themeHere you are in the final stage of the installation of you paid WordPress theme, making it no different from what we have seen for the free theme. Just make yourself part in the Appearance > Themes, moving your mouse over the theme ... and activate it.Install the faviconFavicon ("favorite icon") is a small icon symbolizing a website or blog. These icons are created by the site owners or can be found already created in some WordPress themes. It is sometimes forgotten, but it is importan in the graphical identity of the site.Web browsers use favicons in the address bar, title bar, bookmarks, tabs, and other shortcuts. When you have multiple tabs open in your browser, for ex., favicon helps you to identify the specific pages.How to create a faviconThe usual size of a favicon is 16x16 pixels. The formats used for a favicon are: ICO, PNG, GIF, animated GIF, JPEG, APNG. Internet Explorer and Safari browsers support the first three formats only.For Apple devices with the iOS (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad), and Android devices, it is possible to provide a custom icon using the Web Clip feature. The recommended basic size for this icon is 60×60 pixels. Best size for the higher-resolution iPhone 4 screen is 120×120 pixels. For iPad and iPad 2, the basic size is 76×76 pixels. For the third-generation iPad, best high-resolution size is 152×152 pixels. The Android tablets prefer a 192x192 pixels PNG icon.It is very easy to create your favicon. You can start from the existing logo of the website, or from another image (usually a simpler image) that symbolize the best the content of your website or the message you intend to deliver.ICO, PNG, and GIF files can handle transparency. This will be more attractive in the browser.After you decided what image will be used for the favicon of your blog, you can gnerate it online or using an image editor.For the online version, you can search an online service with Google, or use directly favicon-generator.org, for ex.If you want to edit it offline, you can use any image editor to resize the image and save it in the desired format, including the old Paint. For ICO format, you can use a specific add-on for Adobe Photoshop to enable it ro save the file as ICO.Install the favicon on a WordPress blogThe usual path for a favicon is in the root of the website.The installation of the favicon on your blog can be done in several ways. This depends on the theme you have installed.Use your theme options:Many themes offer advanced options to upload the favicon, including the web clip icons for Applte devices and tablets.. In this case, the set of a favicon is a formality. You simply go to theme options, usually in the Appearance menu, then go to Theme Options or Customize and upload the favicon (and web clip icon, where the theme allow it).Replace the old favicon:Some themes provide a favicon but does not offer the possibility to change it. The easiest way in this case is to replace it using a FTP program to upload the new favicon.Install a favicon using Media LibraryIf neither of these options is possible, you upload your favicon as image and edit the header of your theme to tell the new path of the favicon.For this, go to Appearance > Editor, and find the link for the file that includes the path to the favicon (usually Header (header.php), for the old simpler WordPress themes) in the right of the page. Click it.In the editor of the WordPress admin will open the file ready to edit it. Search for something like:<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico" />Change "favicon.ico" with the path of the image (for ex., "http://www.teleactivities.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/favicon.png").Updating WordPressFrom time to time, you will eventually want to update your WordPress installation to the latest version from the official site. You may want to do it because you have seen a message on top of your dashboard telling you that an update is available, because you have been informed of new features that will be useful, or because a hotfix security has been published.ATTENTION: The update process will affect all files and directories in the main WordPress installation. This includes all core files for operating WordPress, both extensions (Akismet and Hello Dolly) and the last default theme(s). If you have made changes to these files, your changes will be lost.Check prerequisites systemWhatever the reason for the update, before beginning, it is best to check the pages of the prerequisites to ensure that your hosting has the required versions of PHP and MySQL. (If you are not sure, your web host will be able to tell you).Make a backupThe next step is to make a backup of your database. All your articles and pages are stored in the database, so you will need to have a copy of it if for some reason you believe would change your mind after the update and that you have need to go back.Disable extensionsThe last step of this preparation is to disable extensions. Well, it is not a mandatory step, but from time to time an extension has not been updated to work with the latest version of WordPress, and can cause problems. So it is best to try to avoid that, isn't it?You can easily disable all of your extensions by visiting the Plugins section in the dashboard and by choosing "Deactivate" option individually or check the boxes then select from the dropdown list "Deactivate" and then clicking on " Apply."Ready to make the update!Now that you have verified that your hosting is ready for the update, disabled your extensions and have your backup, it's time to get started.There are two methods of updating; The simplest is the auto update, which works for most people. If that does not work, or prefer to manage everything yourself, you can follow the manual update process.Automatic updateSince version 2.7, WordPress has an internal tool for automatic updating. You can start the update by clicking on the link in the toolbar (if it is present) or by visiting the Tools > Update (pre-3.0 versions) or the Dashboard page > Updates (Version 3.0+). Once on this page, click on the automatic update to start the process. You have nothing else to do, and once the process is complete, your system will be updated.For automatic update to work, at least two criteria must be met:(A) The file property: All WordPress files must belong to the user under which your Web server runs. In other words, the owner of the Wordpress files must match the user under which the Web server runs. The user of the web server (named "apache", "web", "www", "nobody", or something similar) is not necessarily the owner of the WordPress files. Generally, WordPress files are the property of the FTP user who uploaded the original files. If there is no match between the owner of the WordPress files and the user under which the Web server is running, you will see a dialog box asking you login information and you find that whatever you enter you will not be able to update automatically.(B) The file permission: All files of your WordPress must also be writable by the owner, or belonging to a group writable by the user under which the Apache server is running.On shared hosting, the WordPress files MUST NOT be owned by the web server. If more than one user owns various files in the installation (because of changes made by deleting and reloading the files using different accounts, for example), the file permissions require write access for the group (for example, 775 and 664 rather than the default 755 and 644). The file permissions (in general) must be adjusted according to the server environment.Do not using PHP5 is a known cause of failure of the automatic update. If you see the message indicating that the update will download the zip file and nothing happens, it may be that you do not use PHP5. Many hosts offer both PHP4 and PHP5, and switching from one version to another is generally very easy, most often it is a simple entry in your .htaccess file. If you can not upgrade to PHP5, and you encounter this problem, use the manual update.If you have customized the core theme, you should not use automatic updating, that would crush your changes - you must make a manual update.If you see an obstinate message "failed update", delete the file .maintenance from your WordPress directory using FTP. This will remove the annoying message "failure of the update."If automatic upgrade does not work, do not panic! Just try a manual update.Manual updateDuring these steps, we assume that the address of your blog is http://example.com/wordpress/.Replace WordPress files Download the .zip file of the latest version.Unzip this archive to your computer.Disable your extensions.On the hosting server, delete the folders wp-includes and wp-admin through a FTP client or SSH access.Upload the entire contents of the archive (except wp-content), via a FTP client or SSH access, replacing the old files when it is needed.ATTENTION: you must replace all the old files with the new WordPress files, including those located in the root of your installation, as index.php, wp-login.php and so on. Normally, simply copy the files over old is enough to replace them, but sometimes it is necessary to delete old files before you upload the new ones. Be very careful in this case, and follow the instructions. Only should remain intact customized wp-config.php file and the content of wp-content.Be very careful with regard to the wp-content folder. Do not try to replace the files, just copy the new files, as this is the folder that stores your themes and extensions, you prefer certainly more keeping than losing it. Especially, if you changed the default themes without renaming it, make sure not to replace it - either by renaming or copying the file one by one.Finally, open the wp-config-sample.php to see if new settings have been introduced there in the latest version, you would have to copy settings manually in your own wp-config.phpDelete file .maintenanceIf you make a manual update after the failure of an automatic update, delete the file .maintenance from your WordPress directory using FTP. This will remove the impertinent message "failure of the update."Install your updateOnce all the files are online, visit your administration dashboard, at /wp-admin. Perhaps you need to reconnect. If a database upgrade is necessary, WordPress will detect it and prompt you to click a link in the form http://example.com/wordpress/wp-admin/upgrade.php. Click it, and follow the instructions. Your database will be updated to run with the latest version. Make sure you follow this step as soon as possible after completing previous step.Take a break!If you have a cache system in place, empty it so that the changes appear faster for your users. You can check the cache returns the correct version with the version number displayed at the bottom of page.It's over! Congratulations! No easier, except to put in place a process using Subversion.Write an article to announce your update, read a book or article that you keep for "when you have time," or, simply enjoy these few minutes of free time available to you.Final phaseThe update is complete, it's time to re-enable your extensions. If you are having problems connecting, try to remove cookies from your browser.TroubleshootingIf a problem occurs, the first thing to do is to restart the process by following the detailed instructions. They contain many tips and tricks to solve the most common problems.If problems occur after the update, you can try to restore your database from a backup, and replace the files with those of your previous version, recovering the previous version of the site.Moving WordPress to a new locationMoving your WordPress site is certainly not something that you are do it everyday, but it is better to know how this is done.Save your dataIf you really care about your WordPress site, I hope that this step will not be necessary for you, because of course, you save it regularly.If you do not frequently back up your WordPress website, remember that you must also back up your files, as well as data stored in your database.Recovering the WordPress filesNothing complicated. Use your favorite FTP client, FileZilla for ex. Log in, download all the directories needed for the proper functioning of your site. Watch in CGI BIN directory.Collect WordPress dataAgain, nothing too serious. Connect to the phpMyAdmin interface of your site. Go to Export tab of the database. As a precaution, always make two backups, one with Quick - display only the minimal options and a custom one, I usually use gzip archive for it.. One is never too careful.Transferring dataNow that you have all your data on your computer, you must do the reverse process; send the data to your new server.This time, you send your data to the FTP server, and you select the Import tab in the new phpMyAdmin.The longest stage being here, often wait for the FTP transfer to terminate.Small adjustmentsOnce your data transferred to the new server successfully, it could be that you are confronted with the obligation to make some small adjustments. It depends on the case.Changed databaseOf course, if you change the server, there is a very high probability that the connection to MySQL password is no longer good, see also that the user has changed, and the name of the table.One of the steps needed to be functional if the site is migrated is to edit the wp-config.php file.Replace the old data with those that are now good.Domain not changedIn that case ... your migration is complete. It is possible to sign on this website as you did on the previous one.Easy, isn't it?Changed domainIf your moving also involves a change of domain name, then you will have to tell WordPress. And to tell him, no secret, you will have to go through the database tables. Why? Because WordPress stock the domain name as a variable in the database. Otherwise, when you change the domain name, your old installation will not be directly accessible after copying the data.If your site has a certain size, you can quickly imagine that editing the base through phpMyAdmin is an art. But you can change it in two different way: open the database .sql file in a text editor, search for domain name in the wp_options table and replace it, than upload the changed database file through phpMyAdmin, orgo directly to phpMyAdmin clic the wp_options table, search in it for the domain name anmd replace it with the new domain name.Usually, there are two places where you have to replace the domain name.Test your WordPress website and, Oh, magic, your moving is perfectly functional.But one small detail until you have completely finished with your moving of the WordPress website, remember to remove the script from your web server. To avoid possible exploits.Working with WordPressGetting Started with WordPressWhat next?You have just completed the famous WordPress installation in 5 minutes, or with a click due to your web host option, without stress or hassle. WordPress comes with many amazing features. So now that you have installed, what to do?Let's go for a walk step by step through your WordPress site to discover how work different tools and how to make your new site becomes yours.During the first part of this tutorial, you have to keep unchanged the website settings, unless it is part of the tutorial. Just follow these simple steps and soon you will be able to change everything.LoginStart by connecting to the "administration area", or back end of your website. Go to your site's login page by adding "wp-admin" after your domain name (ex. http://www.teleactivities.com/wp-admin). Some themes also provide a link or a form of "connection" on the front end. Now log into WordPress using your user name and password.Let's start from the beginningOnce connected, you arrive on the Dashboard. The first thing you need to do is to access the Profile section to change your password in order to be the only one that knows it. Click on your name in top right corner > Edit My Profile, or Users > Your Profile in the left menu. Go to About Yourself section and write down the new password in the field New Password and Repeat New Password. Complete and update any other desired section in Profile, including Personal Options, Name, Contact Info and WordPress SEO settings. Click Update Profile.Now you may want to change the general configuration in Settings section: Site Title, Tagline, E-mail Address, Membership (if you accept new members, and their role), Timezone, Date Format, Time Format, Week Starts On, and Site Language. The newest versions of WordPress are translated into 44 languages, with an ongoing work to add new languages.Now is the time to add content or edit existing content.Add/edit pages: Select a page to edit from Pages > All Pages, or add a new one from Pages > Add New. The first field you need to fill is the title of the page. Then use the visual editor to enter the content of your page. All the other fields are optional but it is recommended to use it for a better navigation, interactivity and optimization for search engines. You can click the Preview Changes button in the top right corner to give you an overview of the scale appearance of your page on your website. Click Update or Publish if it was an update or a new page.Add/edit posts: Add or edit posts works the same way as for pages, but there has, however, some additional optional information you must enter. You can change the layout and format of your post. You must also assign at least a category of the post. On the right side under the Categories box, you can add tags to your posts. Your visitors will use these keywords in their search of posts.  You can preview and edit your posts in the same way you would for pages. Click Update or Publish if it was an update or a new post.WordPress contentA basic WordPress website allows you to post four types of content: Posts (dynamic content): Articles with a timeline displayed in chronological order. Posts are classified in at least one category, have one author and can have tags. Posts have always same level in a website.Pages (static content): This content of the site does not change over time, it usually includes the main points of a website (such as about the owner/company, online contact form, etc.). Pages have an in an hierarchy WordPress site (like the categories, every page can have sub/pages and the path takes into consideration this hierarchy).Media: files and documents, mainly images. It can be placed in a post or page, or have their own display.Links: display links in blogroll.Less used, due to the SEO rules imposed by Google for links.PostsThe are the main WordPress content. A post will always includes: title: the title of the postID: unique identifier of postpermalink: URL of the postcontent: the post itself, it can written online using a visual editor or text editor, or you can use copy/paste from a document or another online post.author: each post is assigned to a single authordate: the date and time of publication postcategory: post belongs to at least one category.There are also other optional information, such as excerpt (a personalized summary to be displayed as description of the post in homepage, category or archive pages), thumbnail (an image on the pages with excerpts from posts), tags (keywords attached to the post), slug: personalized URL of post), custom fields (metadata of post), etc.There are also may other information that can be added to the post (and some of it being editable) by the plugging added to the WordPress site.PagesPage is used to publish static content, that is to say, out of chronological flow of posts. Most frequently pages are About (the wuthor/owner/company...), Contact (online contact form), Terms of Services, etc.A page has the same options like a post, except excerpt, category and tags. But a page has several options not included in a post, such as: hierarchy (a page may be child/parent of another)ordering (for multiple page of the same level, the order of the pages can be personalized)templates (some pages can have a special design, depending on the theme of the website)Working with WordPressPublish your postsPassword protection: Do you want to share something with some people, but not anyone? Easy, protect the item with a password.Article's Permalink: If you want nice permalinks on your site, you can set the link for each article using the article's Permalink.Schedule your publications: You can write an article today and expect it to appear at a future date automatically.Multi-page article: If your article is too long, cut it into several pages so that the reader does not have to scroll the item indefinitely.Uploading files and images: You can upload files and images, then create links or display in your articles. You even have the choice to create thumbnails for your images while uploading.Categories: Organize items into categories, subcategories, sub-subcategories ...Emoticons: WordPress is smart enough to convert smileys, like ":)" in graphic equivalent.Saving drafts: Save your unfinished articles, complete them later and publish them when they are ready.Preview: Before pressing the "Publish" button, you can have a preview of the article you have just written to check that everything is as you wish. In fact, you can do so at any time since the preview is "live".Office tools: You are not required to use a browser to update your weblog, you can use blog tools that can manage MetaWeblog's or Blogger's API.Post by email: You can send your articles by email for publication on your blog.Bookmarklets: Add the shortcut "Press It!" that WordPress provides to your browser to create an article with a link to the current page!Side panel: If you do not like the bookmarklet, use the side panel in the same way.Formatting: Think of WordPress as something enjoyable making your words and your pages more attractive. WordPress comes with text formatting plugins that enrich your content and manages the typography of your articles.Archives and ResearchArchiving: After a long period of publication, it is important that your articles are well organized. WordPress offers many options to display the archive of your old articles. You can choose to present your archives by year, month, day, week, category or author, and easily post links to these archive pages from your home page (or any other page) of your weblog using models of tags to generate these links. Since WordPress generates pages dynamically, these archived pages will not take up more space on your server.Search: WordPress includes a search engine that allows your visitors to search your weblog according to their search criteria, and the search-hilite plugin that comes standard allows highlighting search terms to help your visitors find them. Moreover, the plugin works the same way when a visitor arrives from a search engine like Google result by highlighting search terms. Finally, research is fun, with WordPress.Discussion and commentsBuilding community: WordPress is not a hostel, but it helps to build a community around weblogs, through the use of comments, trackback and pingback, allowing you to stay in touch with the public and stimulate friendship.HTML tags allowed: The devil is not everywhere, but you can keep away malicious people deciding whether or not HTML tags are "parasites" on your weblog. All HTML tags allowed by default on WordPress is a reasonable choice to allow your visitors to use html in their comments, without compromising the safety of your data or your server.Moderation: To avoid paranoid, WordPress offers a variety of moderation options you can choose to moderate all comments before they are visiblecomments containing specific wordscomments posted from specific IP addressescomments containing more links than the limit that you authorize.All these moderation options allow you to keep an eye on spammers and vandals.Notification: WordPress can send you an email with each new comment or each moderation awaiting validation, as you stay "in the loop".Creating and Managing a BlogrollBlogroll: The blogroll is the space where you place links to blogs you read regularly - a nice way to display the blogs that you feel good. The WordPress Links manager allows you to create and manage these links effortlessly.Bookmarklet: Simplicity begins with a stylish bookmarklet (script launched from the Favorites or Links bar) that you can add to your favorite. Add a link to a blog or an interesting site is as simple as clicking the favorite to visit this site.Organize: Links can be sorted and neatly organized.Import: If you already have a link list in an OPML file, you can import it into your WordPress blog. For users of other blog engines, this means that you can import your blogroll from Blogrolling.com and not having to use a third party service to manage your blogroll.Export: You can export an OPML file with a list of your links.Viewing: You have at your disposal models of tags to display your blogroll to your taste - alphabetically, by evaluation, by update.Publish your workSyndication: RSS 1.0 (aka RDF), RSS 2.0 and ATOM specifications are fully supported by WordPress, and every page of your weblog may be associated with one of these streams to which your readers can subscribe:: there is one stream for the last posts, for categories, comments, short for anything you want. More options there for your readers to follow the various sections of your weblog, the easier it will be to spread your word in the world. WordPress also supports RSS 2.0 with attachments, you can add mp3 files (as in the podcast) to your feeds with a click.Cruft-free permalinks: The URLs of all the pages of your weblog may conform to a standard, the cruft-free system, and all links are structured and understandable by humans and machines, including search engines. Clean URLs are essential to optimize research with a search engine and improve user experience.Cross-blog communication: In a world increasingly inter-connected, WordPress comes with TrackBack and Pingback, two convenient methods for communicating to other weblogs and allow them to do the same.Customizable designDesign managed by templates: WordPress uses templates to dynamically generate pages. You can control the presentation of content by modifying the templates with the template editor and template tags.Template and file editor: WordPress comes with a file editor that you can use to edit templates and associated files directly in a browser without having to worry about uploading or downloading.Template tags: The template tags make it possible to easily publish in page the content and information displayed on your weblog. You do not need to be a PHP pro to format your weblog.Themes: You can customize your weblog with themes or styles ready for use. You can also create and share your own themes.Plugins: Plugins can extend the number of features on your weblog. A large number of plugins developed by users are already available and can be used for virtually anything you can imagine with your weblog.Screen OptionsYou can customize WordPress pages and posts through the administration interface using the Screen Options button at the top right of almost every page of the WordPress back office.By default, the management interface of WordPress pages and articles is enough to create a new post or a new page. But it is possible to push a little further the functionality of these interfaces by going to Screen Options.To see what the Screen Options menu can offer us, just click on it.This menu will not be the same for everyone, depending on the plugins you have installed.ExcerptExcerpt is an optional description of a post. By default, WordPress will come to use the first 55 words in excerpt. The automation is good, but come take care of it to have better results in hits.Most themes will manage the default display of the first words of your article .... if you do not use excerpt. We need only indicate an excerpt in our article and save it for the excerpt is taken into account on the category page. This way it becomes at once more engaging for your readers.I think that this option is one of the few that should not be hidden by default.Send TrackbacksTrackbacks are one way to tell a blog that there is a link to it. But you must have the trackback address for this post and not just the URL. Since pingbacks have appeared. It make a link in your article, and WordPress will forward the message to the interested ... if it supports this course protocol.Unless you think you need, this option can remain as it was previously, hidden.Custom FieldsView custom fields may be necessary or completely superfluous, everything depends on your WordPress installation, your themes and hacks.Custom fields have long been popular with creative themes before the arrival of customs post types.Refer to the documentation of your theme to see if this section is useful to you or not.SlugThis is a duplicate functionality  in the basic installation of WordPress. Slug helps to change the URL of the post, something that is quite possible to do by clicking Edit at the title of the post or page.DiscussionYou wondered how to close the comments on a WordPress post or page? No need for a plugin. Actually, simply activate it from the Screen Options menu.CommentsWhen a page has success, manage comments is sometimes difficult. So you can choose to respond to your comments directly from the front office of your site, as a classic surfer.You can also choose to manage them directly from the post in the back office. You can this way edit all comments and reply easily.AuthorDepending on requirements, it can be interesting to change the author of a post, that you are required to write content for a client, replacing a friend, etc. Anyway, here it is where it happens.We said in the introduction that the Screen Options menu will not be exactly the same for all, it depends on the installed plugins. However, we can use this menu differently. Rather than add elements to the environment, we will subtract.Indeed, when you install a plugin you will end up with new items to complete in the page creation or post interface. You can choose not to display these elements in your interface without uninstalling the plugin. Go to the Screen Options and disable it. The plugin section disappears from the WordPress post or page management screen.It must be said, though some of these options are hidden, it is not for nothing. With rare exceptions, such as for the excerpt and reviews, these options are used or not based on your needs.Installing PluginsWordPress offers a simple and easy way to add plugins to your blog. Access Dashboard, click Plugins link, Add New, and search for the plugin or upload it from Upload Plugin.Next, activate it from the Plugins page and sit back to observe the work in motion.Not all plugins are so easy to install, but authors and developers of WordPress make the process as easy as possible.Information to know before installingThere are some things you should know before you start to install WordPress plugins:Read the readme: Browse the readme files and web pages, as well as any comments on the plugins on the Web site of an author before you install. The more you know before you install, the easier the process.Download and update: You must be familiar with how to download and update files and how to use the FTP protocol, if required.Changing files and templates: Knowledge of PHP, HTML, CSS and CHMOD may be necessary.Recording of changes: If you make any changes to WordPress files and templates, make a note using the comments in the source code before. Make a backup of your website on your desktop to remind you of any additions or changes you made to the files. This will help you spot them in the future if problems arose.Make frequent backups: Some plugins work independently of the content of your blog, just adding something special to the page. Others require the modification of the contents of the files, including changes to your database. Before installing any plugin that will make dramatic changes, back up your database and files.There are several versions of WordPress currently available, and different plugins available for the different versions. Be sure and browse through the information carefully to determine if the plugin will work with your version.Post formatsAn WordPress article format is an optional information that will determine the graphical representation of your post (article) on your site based on the format you have chosen for your post. It is possible to use it only if your WordPress theme supports these option.This option enable the theme developers not to reinvent the wheel when, for example, want to display articles based on videos. In addition, it creates a commonality between all the themes.The article formats are debates within the community of developers of the WordPress core, because in time the list of article formats changes, so the article formats are not unanimously accepted.For the version 4.2 of WordPress and the theme I use, the article formats are: Standard, Aside, Image, Video, Quote, and Link. Standard: This is the default format. This simply means that here, the author of the post can put what everything he wants as content, from the standard blog post, to video, a gallery of images, sound, or short notes.  Aside : This post format allows an author to publish a short note, which would aim to provide additional information, or just make a short note alone.  Image : This format is used to highlight an image.  Video Article format to insert a video into the post. It is not the only format to support video, but it can be used for all kind of videos, including embedded code from YouTube, for ex., or video hosted on your site in a native way (since WordPress 3.6)  Quote : Article format that allows you to publish a quote.  Link: Article format designed primarily to allow you to quickly share a link with your visitors.Other possible article formats: Gallery: This article format is like Image article format, but it allows you to publish a picture gallery.  State: Quickly publish a statement in one of your WordPress post.  Sound : Article format like Video article format, but it is reserved for the publication of an audio type of post.  Discussion : Article format that aims to provide a transcript of a chat conversation type.Use of custom fieldsWordPress has a feature to allow users to assign custom fields in an article. These arbitrary additional information is also known as metadata. These metadata may contain information such as: Mood of the day: ...Current reading: ...I listen to: ...Weather: ...With some additional programming, it is possible to manage more complex actions, such as using a meta-data to keep in memory an expiration date of the article.These meta-data are managed with key/value pairs. The key is the name of the metadata. The value represents the information that must bear the metadata in the list of information associated with each item bringing this metadata.It is possible to associate the same key several times for the same item. For example, if you read two books at the same time (perhaps a technical book for your work and a novel at home), you can create a key "reading" that you use twice in the same article, one for each book.Here's an example of how this information can appear in your article:
Current reading: How to Translate - English Translation Guide in European Union Mood of the day: Content and happyUseBased on the example above, let's put it into practice. We will add two custom fields, the first is called "Readings" and the second "Mood of the day". The following instructions show you how to add this information to an article using custom fields. From the Post > Add New Post or editing a post (Edit Post), click the button Screen Options in the top right side of the page.Check the option Custom Fields.After writing your article, go to the bottom of the editing page and look for an area called Custom Fields.To create a new custom field called "Readings", click Enter new and type "Readings" key text in the Name text box.This new key must have an associated value, which in our case is the name of the book that we are reading: "How to Translate - English Translation Guide in European Union". Type "How to Translate - English Translation Guide in European Union" in the Value box.Click the Add Custom Field to save this information for this article.To add your "Mood of the day", repeat the process with "Mood of the day" in the key and description of your mood in the Value box and then click Save to save this information together with the article.On your next article, you can add a new book and your mood to your metadata. In the Custom Fields section, the key area now contains a combo with key entered on the previous articles. Choose "Readings" and enter the title of your new book in the Value box. Click Add Custom Field and repeat to add your "Mood of the day".Just create once a key, then you can assign a value to this key for all your items if you wish. You can also assign more than one value to a key for the same item. This is very useful for people who read more than one book at a time.ReferencesThe book includes texts translated from Wikipedia and WordPress.About the authorNicolae Sfetcuweb design, e-commerce and other web applications * internet marketing, SEO, online advertising, branding * software localization, English - Romanian - French translation * articles, desktop publishing, secretarial services * powerpoint, word and pdf presentation, image, audio and video editing * e-book conversion, editing and publishing , isbnEmail: nicolae@sfetcu.comMultiMedia SRL http://www.multimedia.com.ro/ Web services: http://www.teleactivities.com/ Book/e-book editing: http://www.setthings.com/ Translation http://www.translation2ro.com/ Personal: http://www.sfetcu.com/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/nicolae.sfetcu Twitter: http://twitter.com/nicolae LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolaesfetcu Google Plus: https://www.google.com/+NicolaeSfetcu
