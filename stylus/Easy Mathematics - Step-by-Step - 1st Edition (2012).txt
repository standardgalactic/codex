The anxiety you may feel while trying to succeed in math is a real-life phenomenon. Many people experience such a high level of tension when faced with a math problem that they simply cannot perform to the best of their abilities. It is possible to overcome this difficulty by building your confidence in your ability to do math and by minimizing your fear of making mistakes.
No matter how much it might seem to you that math is too hard to master, success will come. Learning math requires lots of practice. Most important, it requires a true confidence in yourself and in the fact that, with practice and persistence, you will be able to say, "I can do this!"
In addition to the many worked-out, step-by-step sample problems, this book presents a variety of exercises and levels of difficulty to provide reinforcement of math concepts and skills. After working a set of exercises, use the worked-out solutions to check your understanding of the concepts.
We sincerely hope Easy Mathematics Step-by-Step will help you acquire greater competence and confidence in using math in your future endeavors.







1Numbers and Operations
In this chapter, you learn about the various sets of numbers that make up the real numbers.
Natural Numbers and Whole Numbers
The natural numbers (or counting numbers) are the numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...

The three dots indicate that the pattern continues without end.

You can represent the natural numbers as equally spaced points on a number line, increasing endlessly in the direction of the arrow, as shown in Figure 1.1.

Figure 1.1 Natural numbers
When you include the number 0 with the set of natural numbers, you have the whole numbers:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...

The number 0 is a whole number, but not a natural number.

Like the natural numbers, you can represent the whole numbers as equally spaced points on a number line, increasing endlessly in the direction of the arrow, as shown in Figure 1.2.

Figure 1.2 Whole numbers
The graph of a number is the point on the number line that corresponds to the number, and the number is the coordinate of the point. You graph a set of numbers by marking a large dot at each point corresponding to one of the numbers. The graph of the numbers 2, 3, and 7 is shown in Figure 1.3.

Figure 1.3 Graph of 2, 3, and 7
Integers
On the number line shown in Figure 1.4, the point 1 unit to the left of 0 corresponds to the number -1 (read as "negative one"), the point 2 units to the left of 0 corresponds to the number -2, the point 3 units to the left of 0 corresponds to the number -3, and so on. The number -1 is the opposite of 1, -2 is the opposite of 2, -3 is the opposite of 3, and so on. The number 0 is its own opposite.

Figure 1.4 Whole numbers and their opposites
A number and its opposite are exactly the same distance from 0. For instance, 3 and -3 are opposites, and each is 3 units from 0.

The number 0 is neither positive nor negative.

The whole numbers and their opposites make up the integers:
..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
The integers are either positive (1, 2, 3, ...), negative (..., -3, -2, -1), or 0. Positive numbers are located to the right of 0 on the number line, and negative numbers are to the left of 0, as shown in Figure 1.5.

Figure 1.5 Integers

It is not necessary to write a + sign on positive numbers (although it's not wrong to do so). If no sign is written, then you know the number is positive.

Problem Find the opposite of the given number.
a. 8
b. -4
Solution
a. 8
 Step 1. Describe the location of 8 and its opposite on a number line.8 is 8 units to the right of 0. The opposite of 8 is 8 units to the left of 0.
Step 2. State the opposite of 8.The number that is 8 units to the left of 0 is -8.
b. -4
 Step 1. Describe the location of -4 and its opposite on a number line.-4 is 4 units to the left of 0. The opposite of -4 is 4 units to the right of 0.
Step 2. State the opposite of -4.The number that is 4 units to the right of 0 is 4.
Problem Graph the integers -5, -2, 3, and 7.
Solution
 Step 1. Draw a number line.

Step 2. Mark a large dot at each of the points corresponding to -5, -2, 3, and 7.

Rational, Irrational, and Real Numbers
The number  is an example of a rational number. A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a quotient of an integer divided by an integer other than 0. That is, the rational numbers are all the numbers that can be expressed as


The number 0 is excluded as a denominator for  because division by 0 is undefined, so  has no meaning no matter what number you put in the place of p.

Fractions, decimals, and percents are rational numbers. All of the natural numbers, whole numbers, and integers are rational numbers as well because you can express each of these numbers, as shown here.

The decimal representations of rational numbers terminate or repeat. For instance,  is a rational number whose decimal representation terminates, and  is a rational number whose decimal representation repeats. You can show a repeating decimal by placing a line over the block of digits that repeats, like this: . You also might find it convenient to round the repeating decimal to a certain number of decimal places. For instance, rounded to two decimal places, .

The symbol ≈ means "is approximately equal to."

Note: Fractions, decimals, and percents are discussed at length in Chapters 5-7.
The irrational numbers are the real numbers whose decimal representations neither terminate nor repeat. These numbers cannot be expressed as ratios of two integers. For instance, the positive number that multiplies by itself to give 2 is an irrational number called the positive square root of 2. You use the square root symbol  to show the positive square root of 2 like this: . Every positive number has two square roots: a positive square root and a negative square root. The other square root of 2 is . It also is an irrational number. (See Chapter 10 for an additional discussion of square roots.)
You cannot express  as the ratio of two integers, nor can you express it precisely in decimal form. Its decimal equivalent continues on and on without a pattern of any kind, so no matter how far you go with decimal places, you can only approximate . For instance, rounded to three decimal places, . Do not be misled, however, because even though you cannot determine an exact value for , it is a number that occurs frequently in the real world. For instance, designers and builders encounter  as the length of the diagonal of a square that has sides with length of 1 unit, as shown in Figure 1.6.

Figure 1.6 Diagonal of unit square

Not all roots are irrational. For instance, .

There are infinitely many square roots and other roots as well that are irrational.

Be careful: Square roots of negative numbers are not real numbers.

Two famous irrational numbers are π and e. The number π is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and the number e is used extensively in calculus. Most scientific and graphing calculators have π and e keys. To nine decimal place accuracy, π ≈ 3.141592654 and e ≈ 2.718281828.

Although, in the past, you might have used 3.14 or  for π, π does not equal either of these numbers. The numbers 3.14 and  are rational numbers, but π is irrational.

The real numbers are all the rational and irrational numbers put together. They are all the numbers on the number line (see Figure 1.7). Every point on the number line corresponds to a real number, and every real number corresponds to a point on the number line.

Figure 1.7 Real number line
The relationship among the various sets of numbers included in the real numbers is shown in Figure 1.8.

Figure 1.8 Real numbers
Note: Hereafter in this book, all numbers are understood to be real numbers.
Problem Categorize the given number according to the various sets of the real numbers to which it belongs. (State all that apply.)
a. 0
b. 0.75
c. -25
d. 36
e. -0.35



Solution
 Step 1. Recall the descriptions of the natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, irrational numbers, and real numbers.
Step 2. Categorize the number.
a. 0 is a whole number, an integer, a rational number, and a real number.
b. 0.75 is a rational number and a real number.
c. -25 is an integer, a rational number, and a real number.
d. 36 is a natural number, a whole number, an integer, a rational number, and a real number.
e. -0.35 is a rational number and a real number.



Problem Graph the numbers -4, -2.5, 0, , and 3.6.
Solution
 Step 1. Draw a number line.

Step 2. Mark a large dot at each of the points corresponding to -4, -2.5, 0, , and 3.6.

Terminology for the Four Basic Operations
For the math you do in your everyday world, you work with the real numbers. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are the four basic operations you use. Each of the operations has special symbolism and terminology associated with it. Table 1.1 shows the terminology and symbolism for the operations.
Table 1.1 The Four Basic Operations

As you can see from the examples in Table 1.1, addition and subtraction "undo" each other. Similarly, multiplication and division undo each other, as long as no division by 0 occurs.
Division Involving Zero
You must be very careful when you have zero in a division problem. The number 0 can be the dividend, provided the divisor is not 0—the quotient will be 0. But 0 can never be the divisor. The quotient of any number divided by 0 has no meaning; that is, division by 0 is undefined.
Problem State whether the quotient is 0 or undefined.





Solution

 Step 1. Recall that division by 0 is undefined, so state that the quotient is undefined.


 Step 1. Recall that the quotient is 0 when 0 is divided by a nonzero number, so state that the quotient is 0.


 Step 1. Recall that the quotient is 0 when 0 is divided by a nonzero number, so state that the quotient is 0.


 Step 1. Recall that division by 0 is undefined, so state that the quotient is undefined.


 Step 1. Recall that division by 0 is undefined, so state that the quotient is undefined.

Properties of Real Numbers
The real numbers have the following 11 properties under the operations of addition and multiplication.
For all real numbers a, b, and c, you have:
1. Closure Property of Addition.  is a real number. This property guarantees that the sum of any two real numbers is always a real number.
Examples

2. Closure Property of Multiplication.  is a real number. This property guarantees that the product of any two real numbers is always a real number.
Examples

3. Commutative Property of Addition. . This property allows you to reverse the order of the numbers when you add, without changing the sum.
Examples

4. Commutative Property of Multiplication. . This property allows you to reverse the order of the numbers when you multiply, without changing the product.
Examples

5. Associative Property of Addition. . This property says that when you have three numbers to add together, the final sum will be the same regardless of the way you group the numbers (two at a time in the same order) to perform the addition.
Example
Suppose you want to compute . In the order given, you have two ways to group the numbers for addition:

Either way, 16 is the final sum.
6. Associative Property of Multiplication. . This property says that when you have three numbers to multiply together, the final product will be the same regardless of the way you group the numbers (two at a time in the same order) to perform the multiplication.
Example
Suppose you want to compute . In the order given, you have two ways to group the numbers for multiplication:

Either way, 7 is the final product.

The associative property is needed when you have to add or multiply more than two numbers because you can do addition or multiplication on only two numbers at a time. Thus, when you have three numbers, you must decide which two numbers you want to start with—the first two or the last two (assuming you keep the same order). Either way, your final answer is the same.

7. Additive Identity Property. There is a real number 0, called the additive identity, such that  and . This property guarantees that you have the number 0 for which its sum with any real number is the number itself.
Examples

8. Multiplicative Identity Property. There is a real number 1, called the multiplicative identity, such that  and . This property guarantees that you have the number 1 for which its product with any real number is the number itself.
Examples

9. Additive Inverse Property. Every real number a has an additive inverse, -a (its opposite), such that  and . This property guarantees that every real number has an opposite whose sum with the number is 0.
Examples

10. Multiplicative Inverse Property. Every nonzero real number a has a multiplicative inverse,  (its reciprocal), such that  and . This property guarantees that every real number, except 0, has a reciprocal whose product with the number is 1.
Example

11. Distributive Property.  and . This property says that when you have a number times a sum, you can either add first and then multiply or multiply first and then add. Either way, the final answer is the same.
Example
 can be computed two ways:
add first to obtain  or multiply first to obtain 

The distributive property is the only property that involves both addition and multiplication at the same time. Another way to express the distributive property is to say that multiplication distributes over addition.

Either way, the answer is 45.
Subtraction and division are not mentioned in the properties listed because you can always turn subtraction into addition by "adding the opposite," and you can turn division into multiplication by "multiplying by the reciprocal." That is,


When you subtract a number, you get the same answer as you do when you add its opposite.


When you divide by a nonzero number, you get the same answer as you do when you multiply by its reciprocal.

Problem Identify the property illustrated.



Solution
 Step 1. Recall the 11 properties: closure property of addition, closure property of multiplication, commutative property of addition, commutative property of multiplication, associative property of addition, associative property of multiplication, additive identity property, multiplicative identity property, additive inverse property, multiplicative inverse property, and distributive property.

Step 2. Identify the property illustrated.
additive identity property

Step 2. Identify the property illustrated.
closure property of addition

Step 2. Identify the property illustrated.
commutative property of multiplication
Besides the 11 properties given, the number 0 has the following unique characteristic.

Zero Factor Property
If a real number is multiplied by 0, then the product is ; and if the product of two numbers is 0, then at least one of the numbers is 0.
Problem Find the product.
a. -9 · 0

Solution
a. -9·0
 Step 1. Given that 0 is a factor of the product, apply the zero factor property.


 Step 1. Given that 0 is a factor of the product, apply the zero factor property.


This property explains why 0 does not have a reciprocal. There is no number that multiplies by 0 to give 1—because any number multiplied by 0 is 0.

 Exercise 1
For 1-9, categorize the given number according to the various sets of the real numbers to which it belongs. (State all that apply.)
1. 10
2. -7.3
3. -74
4. -1000
5. 0.555 ...


8. 0

For 10-12, state whether the quotient is 0 or undefined.



For 13-15, identify the property illustrated.










2Integers
In this chapter, you learn about performing operations with integers. Before proceeding with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of integers, the discussion begins with comparing and finding the absolute value of numbers.
Comparing Integers
Recall that the integers are the numbers
..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...
Comparing numbers uses the inequality symbols shown in Table 2.1.
Table 2.1 Inequality Symbols

Graphing the numbers on a number line is helpful when you compare two numbers. The number that is farther to the right is the greater number. If the numbers coincide, then they are equal; otherwise, they are unequal.
Problem Which is greater -7 or -2?
Solution
 Step 1. Graph -7 and -2 on a number line.

Step 2. Identify the number that is farther to the right as the greater number.
-2 is to the right of -7, so .
Absolute Value
The concept of absolute value plays an important role in computations with signed numbers. The absolute value of an integer is its distance from 0 on the number line. For example, as shown in Figure 2.1, the absolute value of -8 is 8 because -8 is 8 units from 0.

Figure 2.1 Absolute value of -8

Absolute value is a distance, so it is never negative.

You indicate the absolute value of a number by placing the number between a pair of vertical bars like this:  (read as "the absolute value of negative eight"). Thus, .
Problem Find the indicated absolute value.



Solution

 Step 1. Recalling that the absolute value of an integer is its distance from 0 on the number line, determine the absolute value.
 because -30 is 30 units from 0 on the number line.

 Step 1. Recalling that the absolute value of an integer is its distance from 0 on the number line, determine the absolute value.
 because 4 is 4 units from 0 on the number line.

 Step 1. Recalling that the absolute value of an integer is its distance from 0 on the number line, determine the absolute value.
 because -2 is 2 units from 0 on the number line.

As you likely noticed, the absolute value of a number is the value of the number with no sign attached. This strategy works for a number whose value you know, but do not use it when you don't know the value of the number.

Problem Which number has the greater absolute value?
a. -35, 60
b. 35, -60
c. -7, 2
d. -21, 17
Solution
a. 35, 60
 Step 1. Determine the absolute values.

Step 2. Compare the absolute values.
60 has the greater absolute value because .
b. 35, -60
 Step 1. Determine the absolute values.

Step 2. Compare the absolute values.

c. -7, 2
 Step 1. Determine the absolute values.

Step 2. Compare the absolute values.

d. 21, 17
 Step 1. Determine the absolute values.

Step 2. Compare the absolute values.


Don't make the mistake of trying to compare the numbers without first finding the absolute values.

Integers are called signed numbers because these numbers may be positive, negative, or 0. From your knowledge of arithmetic, you already know how to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with positive numbers and 0. To do these operations with all signed numbers, you simply use the absolute values of the numbers and follow these eight rules.
Adding Signed Numbers

Addition of Signed Numbers
Rule 1. To add two numbers that have the same sign, add their absolute values and give the sum their common sign.
Rule 2. To add two numbers that have opposite signs, subtract the lesser absolute value from the greater absolute value and give the sum the sign of the number with the greater absolute value; if the two numbers have the same absolute value, their sum is 0.

These rules might sound complicated, but practice will make them your own. One helpful hint is that when you need the absolute value of a number, just use the value of the number with no sign attached.

Rule 3. The sum of 0 and any number is the number.
The number line is a good tool for illustrating the addition of signed numbers, as shown below.
Problem Add the two numbers. Illustrate the addition on a number line.
a. 4 and 7
b. -5 and 7
c. -3 and -4
Solution
a. 4 and -7
 Step 1. Begin at 0 and move 4 units in the positive direction to 4.

Step 2. From that point, move 7 units in the negative direction to -3.

Step 3. Express the result.

b. -5 and 7
 Step 1. Start at 0 and go 5 units in the negative direction to -5.

Step 2. From that point, go 7 units in the positive direction to 2.

Step 3. Express the result.

c. -3 and -4
 Step 1. Start at 0 and move 3 units in the negative direction to -3.

Step 2. From that point, move 4 units in the negative direction to -7.

Step 3. Express the result.

Problem Find the sum.



Draw number line illustrations for parts d and e.


Solution

 Step 1. Determine which addition rule applies.

The signs are the same (both negative), so use Rule 1.
Step 2. Add the absolute values, 35 and 60.

Step 3. Give the sum a negative sign (the common sign).


 Step 1. Determine which addition rule applies.

The signs are opposites (one positive and one negative), so use Rule 2.
Step 2. Subtract 35 from 60 because .

Step 3. Make the sum negative because -60 has the greater absolute value.


 Step 1. Determine which addition rule applies.

The signs are opposites (one negative and one positive), so use Rule 2.
Step 2. Subtract 35 from 60 because .

Step 3. Keep the sum positive because 60 has the greater absolute value.


 Step 1. Start at 0 and go 3 units in the positive direction to 3.

Step 2. From that point, go 3 units in the negative direction to 0.

Step 3. Express the result.


 Step 1. Start at 0 and go 5 units in the negative direction to -5.

Step 2. From that point, go 2 units in the positive direction to -3.

Step 3. Express the result.

Subtracting Signed Numbers
You subtract signed numbers by changing the subtraction problem in a special way to an addition problem, so that you can apply the rules for addition of signed numbers. Here is the rule.

Subtraction of Signed Numbers
Rule 4. To subtract two numbers, keep the first number and add the opposite of the second number.
To apply this rule, think of the minus sign, -, as "add the opposite of." In other words, "subtracting a number" and "adding the opposite of the number" give the same answer.
Problem Change the subtraction problem to an addition problem.






Solution

 Step 1. Keep -35.

Step 2. Add the opposite of 60.


 Step 1. Keep 35.

Step 2. Add the opposite of 60.


 Step 1. Keep 60.

Step 2. Add the opposite of 35.


 Step 1. Keep -35.

Step 2. Add the opposite of -60.


 Step 1. Keep 0.
0
Step 2. Add the opposite of 60.


 Step 1. Keep -60.

Step 2. Add the opposite of 0.


Remember that 0 is its own opposite.

Problem Compute as indicated.






Solution

 Step 1. Keep -35 and add the opposite of 60.

Step 2. The signs are the same (both negative), so use Rule 1 for addition.

Step 3. Review the main results.


Reviewing your work is a smart habit to cultivate. You will catch many careless errors with this strategy.


 Step 1. Keep 35 and add the opposite of 60.

Step 2. The signs are opposites (one positive and one negative), so use Rule 2 for addition.

Step 3. Review the main results.


 Step 1. Keep 60 and add the opposite of 35.

Step 2. The signs are opposites (one positive and one negative), so use Rule 2 for addition.

Step 3. Review the main results.


 Step 1. Keep -35 and add the opposite of -60.

Step 2. The signs are opposites (one positive and one negative), so use Rule 2 for addition.

Step 3. Review the main results.


 Step 1. Keep 0 and add the opposite of 60.

Step 2. 0 is added to a number, so the sum is the number (Rule 3 for addition).

Step 3. Review the main results.


 Step 1. Keep -60 and add the opposite of 0.

Step 2. 0 is added to a number, so the sum is the number (Rule 3 for addition).

Step 3. Review the main results.


Notice that subtraction is not commutative. That is, in general, for real numbers a and b, .

Use of the - Symbol
Before going on, it is important that you distinguish the various uses of the short horizontal - symbol. Thus far, this symbol has three uses: (1) as part of a number to show that the number is negative, (2) as an indicator to find the opposite of the number that follows, and (3) as the minus symbol indicating subtraction.
Problem 
a. Describe the use of the - symbols at (1), (2), (3), and (4).
b. Express the statement  in words.
Solution
a. Describe the use of the - symbols at (1), (2), (3), and (4).
 Step 1. Interpret each - symbol.
The - symbol at (1) is an indicator to find the opposite of -35.

Don't make the error of referring to negative numbers as "minus numbers."

The - symbol at (2) is part of the number -35 that shows -35 is negative.

The minus symbol always has a number to its immediate left.

 is read as "the opposite of negative thirty-five minus sixty is thirty-five plus negative sixty."
Multiplying Signed Numbers
For multiplication of signed numbers, use the following three rules.

Multiplication of Signed Numbers
Rule 5. To multiply two numbers that have the same sign, multiply their absolute values and keep the product positive.
Rule 6. To multiply two numbers that have opposite signs, multiply their absolute values and make the product negative.
Rule 7. The product of 0 and any number is 0.

Unlike in addition, when you multiply two positive or two negative numbers, the product is positive no matter what. Similarly, unlike in addition, when you multiply two numbers that have opposite signs, the product is negative—it doesn't matter which number has the greater absolute value.

Problem Find the product.





Solution

 Step 1. Determine which multiplication rule applies.

The signs are the same (both negative), so use Rule 5.
Step 2. Multiply the absolute values, 3 and 40.

Step 3. Keep the product positive.


 Step 1. Determine which multiplication rule applies.

The signs are the same (both positive), so use Rule 5.
Step 2. Multiply the absolute values, 3 and 40.

Step 3. Keep the product positive.


 Step 1. Determine which multiplication rule applies.

The signs are opposites (one negative and one positive), so use Rule 6.
Step 2. Multiply the absolute values, 3 and 40.

Step 3. Make the product negative.


 Step 1. Determine which multiplication rule applies.

The signs are opposites (one positive and one negative), so use Rule 6.
Step 2. Multiply the absolute values, 3 and 40.

Step 3. Make the product negative.


 Step 1. Determine which multiplication rule applies.

Step 2. Find the product.

Rules 5 and 6 tell you how to multiply two nonzero numbers, but often you will want to find the product of more than two numbers. To do this, multiply in pairs. You can keep track of the sign as you go along, or you simply can use the following guideline:
When 0 is one of the factors, the product is always 0; otherwise, products that have an even number of negative factors are positive, whereas, those that have an odd number of negative factors are negative.

Notice that if there is no zero factor, then the sign of the product is determined by how many negative factors you have.

Problem Find the product.



Solution

 Step 1. 0 is one of the factors, so the product is 0.


 Step 1. Find the product ignoring the signs.

Step 2. You have five negative factors, so make the product negative.


 Step 1. Find the product ignoring the signs.

Step 2. You have four negative factors, so leave the product positive.

Dividing Signed Numbers

Division of Signed Numbers
Rule 8. To divide two numbers, divide their absolute values (being careful to make sure you don't divide by 0) and then follow the rules for multiplication of signed numbers.

If 0 is the dividend, then the quotient is 0. For instance, . But, if 0 is the divisor, then the quotient is undefined. Thus,  and .  has no answer because division by 0 is undefined!

Problem Find the quotient.






Division is commonly indicated by the fraction bar.

Solution

 Step 1. Divide 120 by 3.

Step 2. The signs are the same (both negative), so keep the quotient positive.


 Step 1. Divide 120 by 3.

Step 2. The signs are opposites (one negative and one positive), so make the quotient negative.


 Step 1. Divide 120 by 3.

Step 2. The signs are opposites (one positive and one negative), so make the quotient negative.


 Step 1. The divisor (denominator) is 0, so the quotient is undefined.


 Step 1. The dividend (numerator) is 0, so the quotient is 0.

To be successful in arithmetical computation, you must memorize the rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing signed numbers. Of course, when you do a computation, you don't have to write out all the steps. For instance, you can mentally ignore the signs to obtain the absolute values, do the necessary computation or computations, and then make sure your result has the correct sign.

3Exponents
In this chapter, you learn about exponents and exponentiation.
Exponential Notation
An exponent is a small raised number written to the upper right of a quantity, which is called the base for the exponent. For example, consider the product , in which the same number is repeated as a factor multiple times. The exponential form for  is 35. The number 3 is the base, and the small 5 to the upper right of 3 is the exponent.

The exponential form of a product of repeated factors is a shortened notation for the product.

Most commonly, you read 35 as either "three to the fifth" or "three raised to the fifth power." When the exponent is 1, as in 71, you say, "seven to the first." When 2 is the exponent, as in 62, you say, "six squared," and when 3 is the exponent, as in 53, you say, "five cubed."

Usually the exponent 1 is not written for expressions to the first power; that is, 71 = 7.

The base is 10.
Step 2. Identify the exponent.
The exponent is 1.
Step 3. Express 101 in words.

Natural Number Exponents
When the exponent is a natural number, it tells you how many times to use the base as a factor.

Recall that the natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, and so on.

Problem Write the indicated product in exponential form.


Solution

 Step 1. Count how many times 2 is a factor.

Step 2. Write the indicated product as an exponential expression with 2 as the base and 7 as the exponent.


 Step 1. Count how many times -3 is a factor.

Step 2. Write the indicated product as an exponential expression with -3 as the base and 6 as the exponent.

In the above problem, you must enclose the -3 in parentheses to show that -3 is the number that is used as a factor six times. Only the 3 will be the base unless you use parentheses to indicate otherwise.
To evaluate the exponential form 35, you do to the base what the exponent tells you to do. The result you get is the fifth power of 3, as shown in Figure 3.1.

You likely are most familiar with natural number exponents, but natural numbers are not the only numbers you can use as exponents. Here are two other types of exponents.
Zero Exponents
A zero exponent on a nonzero number tells you to put 1 as the answer when you evaluate. Caution: It's important to remember that when you use 0 as an exponent, the base cannot be 0. The expression 00 has no meaning. You say, "zero to the zero power is undefined."

c. 00
 Step 1. The exponent is 0, but 00 has no meaning, so put undefined as the answer.

d. 1000
 Step 1. The exponent is 0, so put 1 as the answer.

e. 10
 Step 1. The exponent is 0, so put 1 as the answer.

Negative Exponents
A negative exponent on a nonzero number tells you to obtain the reciprocal of the corresponding expression that has a positive exponent. Caution: You cannot use 0 as a base for negative exponents. When you evaluate such expressions, you get 0 in the denominator, meaning that you have division by 0, which is undefined.

The reciprocal of a quantity is a fraction that has 1 in the numerator and the quantity in the denominator; for instance, the reciprocal of  is .

4Order of Operations
In this chapter, you apply your skills in computation to perform a series of indicated numerical operations. This chapter lays the foundation for numerical calculations by introducing you to the order of operations.
Grouping Symbols
Grouping symbols such as parentheses ( ), brackets [ ], and braces { } are used to keep things together that belong together. Fraction bars and absolute value bars are grouping symbols as well. When you do computations in numerical expressions, do operations in grouping symbols first. It is very important that you do so when you have addition or subtraction inside the grouping symbol.

Keep in mind, however, that parentheses also are used to indicate multiplication as in  or for clarity as in .


Fraction bars indicate division. For instance,  means .


Grouping symbols say "Do me first!"

PEMDAS
Mathematical expressions like  and  are numerical expressions. When you evaluate numerical expressions by doing the indicated math, you must follow the order of operations. Use the mnemonic "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"—abbreviated as PE(MD)(AS)—to help you remember the following order.

Order of Operations

5Fractions
In this chapter, you learn how to work with fractions.
Fraction Concepts
As greater precision in measurement was needed, the concept of fractions (rational numbers) was invented. If a unit is broken into equal parts, then a fraction represents one or more of those equal parts. For example, if an inch is broken into 10 equal parts, then  represents seven of those equal parts. When the unit (the distance between 0 and 1) is divided into 10 equal parts, the fraction  is a point on the number line, as shown in Figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1 The fraction 
The division line in a fraction is the fraction bar. The number above the fraction bar is the numerator, and the number below the fraction bar is the denominator. For example, in the fraction , 7 is the numerator, and 10 is the denominator.

The denominator of a fraction cannot be 0.

Reducing Fractions to Lowest Form
A fundamental principle of fractions is the cancellation law.

Cancellation Law
If both the numerator and the denominator of a fraction are multiplied by the same nonzero number, then the value of the fraction is unchanged. That is,  provided that  and/or .

The cancellation law is not valid if the operation is addition instead of multiplication. That is, . This is a common error observed in the arithmetic of fractions.

A fraction is in lowest form when all the common factors of the numerator and denominator have been cancelled. The process of cancelling the common factors is called reducing the fraction.
Problem Reduce  to lowest form.
Solution
 Step 1. Write the numerator and denominator in a factored form.

Step 2. Cancel the common factor.

Step 3. If possible, factor again.

Step 4. Cancel the common factor.

Step 5. If there are no more common factors, state the lowest form.

You can simplify the reduction process considerably if you factor by using the greatest common factor (GCF). As implied by its name, the GCF of two numbers is the largest factor that is common to the two numbers. For example, the GCF of 30 and 36 is 6. The factoring in the previous problem could have been , and then the 6 canceled to get the reduced form of  in just two steps. You can determine the GCF of two numbers by listing all the factors of the two numbers and selecting the largest factor that is common to both.
Problem Find the GCF of 30 and 36.
Solution
 Step 1. List all the factors of 30 and all the factors of 36.
The factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30, and the factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.
Step 2. Examine the two lists and select the greatest factor common to both.
6 is the greatest factor that is common to both lists. Thus, the GCF of 30 and 36 is 6.
Another way to accomplish the reduction process is to divide the numerator and denominator by the same number and write the resulting quotients as the equivalent fraction. The common way of writing the reduction is
, where you divide both the numerator and the denominator by 6.
Problem Write  in lowest form.
Solution
 Step 1. Divide the numerator and denominator by 22.

Step 2. If there are no more common factors, state the lowest form.

The process of reduction is very useful in operations involving fractions, especially in the area of algebra. Also,  is much easier to locate or visualize on the number line than is . Reduction is a simple way of writing a fraction in a more recognizable form to help determine its relative size.
Equivalent Fractions
Fractions are the only real numbers that use two numerical components (a numerator and a denominator) to express the number. Consequently, a concept known as equivalent fractions is peculiar to fractions. There are several ways to express this idea.

Equivalent Fractions
Two fractions,  and , are equivalent if and only if
(a) they locate the same point on the number line;
(b) one can be reduced to the other; or
(c) ad = bc.
Each of the ways of expressing equivalence has its use, but the method in (c) above is of special significance when doing arithmetic with fractions.
Adding and Subtracting Fractions

Addition and Subtraction of Fractions
Like denominators: If  and  are fractions with like denominators, then

Problem Perform the indicated operation.




Solution

 Step 1. The denominators are alike, so apply  and reduce, if needed.

 Step 1. The denominators are not alike, so apply  and reduce, if needed.


 Step 1. The denominators are not alike, so apply  and reduce, if needed.

Because adding or subtracting fractions is very simple when they have the same denominator, a third method of combining any two fractions is to write the two fractions as equivalent fractions with like denominators and then add (or subtract). This method, referred to as finding a common denominator, is used often.
For example,  and . Hence, the cancellation law ensures both can be written as equivalent fractions with the same denominator. This is not a unique process because  and . Again, both can be written as equivalent fractions with like denominators. However, 28 is the least common denominator and is preferred in most cases.
Here is an example of finding a common denominator to subtract two fractions.
Problem Compute as indicated: .
Solution
 Step 1. Find the common denominator.
The common denominator of 5 and 11 is 55.
Step 2. Write  and  as equivalent fractions that have the denominator 55.

Step 3. Subtract the equivalent fractions and reduce, if needed.


The method of combining fractions by finding a common denominator is used by many, but using  or  as shown above for combining two fractions can be faster; it also automatically produces a common denominator and transfers easily to algebra. Nevertheless, you should choose the method that works best for you.

To divide two fractions, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the divisor fraction.

Working with Mixed Numbers and Improper Fractions
A mixed number is a whole number in combination with a fraction such as  (read as "two and five-sevenths"). This mixed number is an alternate representation of the improper fraction . Any mixed number can be converted to its fractional form by the method . Also, the added form is .
One way to add or subtract with mixed numbers is to change the mixed number to an improper fraction before adding or subtracting, as shown in the following problem.

6Decimals
In this chapter, you learn how to work with decimals.
Decimal Concepts
Decimal fractions are fractions with a denominator that is some positive power of 10, such as , , , and so forth. To represent these numbers, you extend the place-value system of numbers and use a decimal point to separate whole numbers from decimal fractions. The number 428.36 is a mixed decimal and means . You read 428.36 as "Four hundred twenty-eight and thirty-six hundredths" or as "Four hundred twenty-eight point thirty-six."

Don't say "and" when reading whole numbers. For instance, 203 is "two hundred three," not "two hundred and three."

Hereinafter, mixed decimals and decimal fractions will be called simply decimals.
A place-value diagram for some of the positional values of the decimal system is shown in Figure 6.1.

Figure 6.1 Place values in the decimal system
The use of the decimal point is a very convenient way to represent decimal fractions. For instance, using the decimal point, you write  as 0.365.

The 0 in front of the decimal point is used as a way to make the decimal point noticeable for decimal fractions that are less than 1.

You deal with the decimal point in arithmetic calculations by following some simple "rules" that are just mathematical shortcuts to ensure accuracy of the calculations.

You read a decimal point as either "and" or "point." For example, 35.6 is read "Thirty-five and six-tenths" or as "Thirty-five point six."

Adding and Subtracting Decimals
Adding and subtracting are only done for like amounts. A statement such as "4 inches plus 7 inches" is meaningful, while "7 apples plus 5 inches" is meaningless. Similarly, with decimals, you combine tenths with tenths, hundredths with hundredths, and so on. Thus, when you add or subtract decimals, keep the decimal points lined up in the computation so that you are adding digits of like place values.
Problem Add 25.78, 241.342, and 12.5.
Solution
 Step 1. Write the numbers in an addition column, being sure to line up the decimal point.


Zeros are inserted where needed to make sure that all place values are in all the numbers.

Step 2. Add as with whole numbers.

Problem Subtract 168.274 from 6547.34.
Solution
 Step 1. Write the numbers in a subtraction column, being sure to line up the decimal point.


When adding or subtracting decimals, you should insert zeros for missing place values.

Step 2. Subtract as you would with whole numbers.


The carrying and borrowing procedure is the same as with whole numbers.

Multiplying Decimals
A simple rule for multiplying two decimals is to sum the number of decimal places in the multiplicand (first factor) and the multiplier (second factor) and put this number of places in the product.
Problem Multiply 47.63 by 32.57.
Solution
 Step 1. Write the numbers in a multiplication column.


You do not have to line up the decimal points for a multiplication problem.

Step 2. Perform the multiplication as you would with whole numbers.

Step 3. Sum the number of decimal places in both the multiplicand and the multiplier, which is four in this problem, and put that number of decimal places in the final product.

Dividing Decimals
To devise a rule for dividing decimals, you employ the use of the cancellation law of fractions. For example, . The technique, then, in dividing decimals, is to multiply both dividend (numerator) and divisor (denominator) by the appropriate power of 10 that will make the divisor a whole number. In practice, this strategy amounts to moving the decimal point to the right the appropriate number of places to make the divisor a whole number. Of course, the decimal point in the dividend must be moved in the same manner. Once this is done, the decimal point in the dividend and the quotient (answer) must be aligned.
Problem Divide 6.25 by 2.5.
Solution
 Step 1. Write as a long division problem.

Step 2. Move the decimal point one place to the right in both numbers to make the divisor a whole number.

Step 3. Divide as you would whole numbers, keeping the decimal points aligned but ignoring the decimal point in the intermediate multiplications.

Step 4. State the main result.

Step 5. Check the answer.


Calculators will automatically place the decimal point, but you should know these rules to check for errors that may occur in entering data into your calculator.

Rounding Decimals
Working with decimals can sometimes result in lengthy decimal expressions. In application, you may be interested in the decimal expression to only a few places. In this case, you use the technique of rounding to determine the final approximation. For example, if you want the decimal to only two places, you look at the digit in the third place to the right of the decimal point. If the third digit is 5 or greater, increase the digit in the second place by 1 and drop all digits past the second digit to the right of the decimal point. If the third digit is less than 5, leave the digit in the second place as is and drop all digits past the second digit to the right of the decimal point. For example, 45.57689 rounded to two places is 45.58. The process for all places is the same.
Problem Use a calculator to compute  and then round the answer to two decimal places.

. Recall from previous chapters that the fraction bar indicates division. It is important to recognize this use of the fraction bar.

Solution

7Percents
In this chapter, you learn about percents and their relationship to fractions and decimals.
Percent Concepts
A percent is a special type of fraction with a denominator of 100. There are three ways of writing a percent: as a fraction, as a decimal, or with the special percent (%) symbol. For example, . The word percent means "per hundred." The % symbol is a shorthand way of writing  or 0.01. You use the % symbol in writing, but calculations require percents to be in decimal or fraction form.

The word rate is sometimes used for percent.


To remember that % means , think of the slash in the % symbol as a fraction bar and the two zeros as part of the number 100.

Changing Percents to Decimal Form
You can change a percent to decimal form by substituting 0.01 for the % symbol and multiplying. For example, 25% = 25 (0.01) = 0.25. A shortcut for this process is as follows.

Changing a Percent to Decimal Form
To change a percent to decimal form, move the decimal point two places to the left and drop the percent symbol.

The decimal point in a whole number is to the immediate right of the rightmost digit.

Changing Decimals to Percent Form
You can reverse the process just presented to change decimals to percent form as follows.

Changing a Decimal to Percent Form
To change a decimal number to percent form, move the decimal point two places to the right and attach a % symbol.

8Units of Measurement
In use in the United States are two different measurement systems: the US customary system and the metric system. In this chapter, you learn how to work with both systems.

All other countries have adopted the metric system, although the imperial system—which is similar to the US customary system—is also used in the United Kingdom.

Metric System Prefixes
You are no doubt familiar with the US customary system. Table 8.1 contains the metric system prefixes you will find useful to know.
Table 8.1 Metric System Prefixes

US Customary and Metric Units
Table 8.2 contains a list of the US customary and metric units most commonly used in everyday activities.
Table 8.2 Units of Measurement




Denominate Numbers
You express measurements using denominate numbers. A denominate number is a number with units attached. Numbers without units attached are abstract numbers.
Problem Identify the denominate numbers in the following list: 1000, 1200 m, $400, , , 180d, 4840 yd2, 8 gal, 5 kg, 3.785
Solution
 Step 1. Recalling that denominate numbers have units attached, identify the denominate numbers in the list.
1200 m, $400,  yd, 180 d, 4840 yd2, 8 gal, and 5 kg
Converting Units of Denominate Numbers
You convert measurement units of denominate numbers to different measurement units by using "conversion fractions." You make conversion fractions from conversion facts given in tables like Table 8.2. You have two conversion fractions for each conversion fact. For example, for , you have  and . Each of these fractions is equivalent to the number 1 because the numerator and denominator are different names for the same length. Therefore, multiplying a quantity by either of these fractions, does not change the value of the quantity.
To change the units of a denominate number to different units, multiply by the conversion fraction whose denominator is the same as the units of the quantity to be converted. When you multiply, the units you started out with will divide ("cancel") out, and you will be left with the new units.

When you're converting from one measurement unit to another, if the original units don't cancel out when you multiply, then you picked the wrong conversion fraction. Go back and do the multiplication over again with the other conversion fraction.

You always should assess your result to see if it makes sense. Here is a helpful guideline.

When you convert from a larger unit to a smaller unit, it will take more of the smaller units to equal the same amount. When you convert from a smaller unit to a larger unit, it will take less of the larger units to equal the same amount.
Problem Change the given amount to the units indicated.

Shortcut for Converting Within the Metric System
If the base unit in the problem is the meter, liter, or gram, you have a shortcut to convert within the metric system. You use the mnemonic "King Henry Doesn't Usually Drink Chocolate Milk," which helps you remember the following metric prefixes:
kilo-, hecto-, deca-, (base) unit (no prefix), deci-, centi-, milli-
The metric system is a decimal-based system, so the prefixes are based on powers of 10. You convert from one unit to another by either multiplying or dividing by a power of 10. If you move from left to right on the above list, then you multiply by the power of 10 that corresponds to the number of times you moved. If you move from right to left, then you divide by the power of 10 that corresponds to the number of times you moved. Note: When you use this shortcut, don't carry the units along when you do the calculations.
Problem Change the given amount to the units indicated.

Rough Equivalencies for the Metric System
If you are not very familiar with the metric system, here are some "rough" equivalencies of the more common units for your general knowledge.

Determining Unit Price
Measurement skills include computing unit price. The unit price is the amount per unit. Unit price is used in many real-life situations.
Problem Which is a better buy for a certain cut of beef, 3 lb for $2.00 or 4 lb for $3.50?
Solution
 Step 1. Compute the unit price for 3 lb for $2.00.
The unit price for 3 lb for  (rounded to the nearest cent).
Step 2. Compute the unit price for 4 lb for $3.50.
The unit price for 4 lb for  (rounded to the nearest cent).
Step 3. Compare the unit prices and select the better buy.
$0.67 per pound is less than $0.88 per pound, so, assuming the quality is the same, the better buy is 3 lb for $2.00.
 Exercise 8

20. A large container holds 5 gal of water. How many cups of water does the container hold?







9Ratios and Proportions
In this chapter, you learn about ratios and proportions.
Ratio Concepts
A ratio is a comparison by division of two quantities having the same units. Suppose the lengths of the radii of two circles are in the ratio of 3 to 5. If the radius of the first circle is 3 in, then the radius of the second circle is 5 in. That is, the radius of the first circle is  as long as the radius of the second circle. Ratios can be expressed in several different forms: 3 to 5, 3:5, , , 0.6, or 60%. The context of the discussion at the time usually dictates the form preferred. A ratio is a pure number—it has no units. The units "cancel" out as in . Fractions, percents, and decimals are ratios. If the items compared have units that cannot be "canceled" such as , then the comparison is called a rate or a scale.

Be careful when writing ratios. For instance, the comparison of 3 in to 5 ft is not a ratio because both are not expressed in the same units.

Proportion Concepts
The mathematical statement that two ratios (or rates or scales) are equal is a proportion. The statement  is a proportion and is commonly read as "2 is to 3 as 4 is to 6." This can also be written as , although for computations the fractional form is necessary. The fundamental property of proportions is that  if and only if  The products ad and bc are the cross products.


In a proportion, the cross products are equal to each other.

Proportions and proportional thinking pervade such diverse topics as medicine dosage, application of fertilizer to a lawn, and oil additives in gasoline for outboard motors. Consequently, you should master the basics presented here to prepare for any real-world applications you might encounter.
Solving Proportions
If the values of three of the four terms of a proportion are known, then the value of the fourth term can be determined by using the fundamental property of proportions.
Problem Set up a proportion and solve for the unknown term.
a. A number n compared to 45 is the same as 7 compared to 15. Find n.
b. 38 is to 640 as 152 is to the number n. Find n.
Solution
a. A number n compared to 45 is the same as 7 compared to 15. Find n.
 Step 1. Write a proportion.

Step 2. Solve the proportion.
Find a cross product you can calculate.

Divide by the numerical term you didn't use.

Step 3. Check.

b. 38 is to 640 as 152 is to the number n. Find n.
 Step 1. Write a proportion.

Step 2. Solve the proportion.
Find a cross product you can calculate.

Divide by the numerical term you didn't use.

Step 3. Check.

Note: The fraction on the left initially could have been reduced.

It often simplifies the arithmetic in a problem to reduce as much as possible initially.

Solving Application Problems Involving Proportions
When you have an application problem involving proportions, look for a sentence or phrase in the problem that provides the information you need for the left portion of the proportion, and then look for another sentence or phrase that gives you the information you need for the right portion of the proportion.
Problem On a map, the distance between two cities is 13.5 in. On the map scale 0.5 in represents 20 mi. How far is it, in miles, between the two cities?
Solution This problem is a proportion problem involving a map scale. Information for the left portion of the proportion is in the first sentence of the problem, and information for the right portion of the proportion is in the second sentence.
 Step 1. Use the first sentence to write the left portion of the proportion.
Let d be the unknown distance. Then d corresponds to 13.5 in:

Step 2. Use the second sentence to write the right portion of the proportion.

Step 3. Write the proportion by setting the left portion equal to the right portion.

Notice that the units in the left portion match up with the units in the right portion.

Always check whether your units match up when you write a proportion. If you have miles in the numerator and inches in the denominator on the left, then you should have miles in the numerator and inches in the denominator on the right. If the units in the left and right portions don't match up, then your proportion is incorrect.

Step 4. Solve the proportion.
Find a cross product you can calculate.

Divide by the numerical term you didn't use.

Notice that the units work out to be miles, which is what you should expect because d is a distance.

In application problems, always check whether the units work out to be appropriate units for the unknown quantity.

Step 5. Check.


You should always mentally check whether the answer makes sense. For instance, if 0.5 in represents 20 mi, then 1 in represents 40 mi, so 10 in should be 400 mi. Thus, an answer of 540 mi for 13.5 in does make sense.

Problem If 25 ft of wire weighs 3 lb, what is the weight of 8 ft of this wire?
Solution This problem is a proportion problem involving lengths and weights. Information for the left portion of the proportion is in the first part of the problem question, and information for the right portion of the proportion is in the second part of the problem question.
 Step 1. Use the first part of the problem question to write the left portion of the proportion.

Step 2. Use the second part of the problem question to write the right portion of the proportion.

Step 3. Write the proportion by setting the left portion equal to the right portion.

Notice that the units in the left portion match up with the units in the right portion.
Step 4. Solve the proportion.
Find a cross product you can calculate.
(3 lb)(8 ft)
Divide by the numerical term you didn't use.

Notice that the units work out to be pounds, which is what you should expect because w is a weight.
Step 5. Check.

Problem The ratio of a propeller rate to that of the engine is 2:3. If the engine is turning at a rate of 4800 revolutions per minute (rpm), what is the propeller rate?
Solution This is a proportion problem involving two ratios. The first ratio is in the first sentence, and the second ratio is in the question. Let R be the unknown propeller rate and compare the ratios.
 Step 1. Write a proportion.

Step 2. Solve the proportion
Find a cross product you can calculate.

Divide by the numerical term you didn't use.

Step 3. Check.

Using Proportions to Solve Percent Problems
Percent problems can be solved using a "percent proportion," which has the following form:

where
      n = the number in front of the % sign
   part = the quantity that is near the word is (when the word is occurs in the problem)
whole = the quantity that immediately follows the word of
The relationship among the three elements n, part, and whole can be explained in a percent statement like this:
The part is n% of the whole.
The secret to solving percent problems is being able to identify the three elements correctly. Start with n and the whole because they are usually easier to find. The part will be the other amount in the problem. The value of two of the elements will be given in the problem, and you will be solving for the third element. After you identify the three elements, substitute the two you know into the percent proportion and solve for the one that you don't know.
Problem Use a percent proportion to solve the given percent problem.
a. You inherited 15% of $9000. How much money did you inherit?
b. A student scored 60 out of 80 questions. What is the student's percent grade?

d. What is 30% of 140?
e. Twenty-five is 40% of what number?
f. Twenty-seven out of 40 is what percent?
Solution
a. You inherited 15% of $9000. How much money did you inherit?
 Step 1. Write the percent proportion.

Step 2. Set up the percent proportion using $9000 as the whole and 15 as n. Let p be the part inherited.

Step 3. Solve the proportion.

Step 4. Check.

Step 5. Answer the question.
$1350 is the amount inherited.

10Roots and Radicals
In this chapter, you learn about roots and radicals.
Square Roots
You square a number by multiplying the number by itself. For instance, the square of 4 is . Also, the square of -4 is . Thus, 16 is the result of squaring 4 or -4. The reverse of squaring is finding the square root. The two square roots of 16 are 4 and -4. Every positive number has two square roots that are equal in absolute value, but opposite in sign. The number 0 has only one square root, namely, 0.

The product of two negative numbers is positive.


When you are working with real numbers (which are the numbers you work with in this book), don't try to find square roots of negative numbers because not one real number will multiply by itself to give a negative number.

Principal Square Roots and Radicals
You use the symbolism , read as "the square root of 16," to represent the positive square root of 16. Thus, . This number is the principal square root of 16. Thus, the principal square root of 16 is 4. The symbol  is the square root symbol. Using this notation, you indicate the negative square root of 16 as . Thus, . The expression  is a radical. The number under the  symbol is the radicand.

 is the square root of a negative number. No real number multiplies by itself to give -16.

As discussed earlier, every positive number has a positive and a negative square root. The positive square root is the principal square root of the number. The principal square root of 0 is 0. The  symbol always designates the principal square root. Thus, , not -4 or 

The principal square root is always one number and that number is either positive or 0.


The  symbol always gives one number as the answer and that number is either positive or 0.

Perfect Squares
A number that is an exact square of another number is a perfect square. For instance, 4, 9, 16, and 25 are perfect squares. Here is a helpful list of principal square roots of some perfect squares.


Working with square roots will be much easier for you if you memorize the list of square roots. Make flash cards to help you do this.

Also, fractions and decimals can be perfect squares. For instance, is a perfect square because  equals , and 0.36 is a perfect square because 0.36 equals (0.6)(0.6). If a number is not a perfect square, then you can indicate its square roots by using the square root symbol. For instance, the two square roots of 15 are  and 
Cube Roots
The product of a number used as a factor three times is the cube of that number. For instance, 64 is the cube of 4 because  and, similarly, -64 is the cube of -4 because -4 · -4 · -4 = -64. The reverse of cubing is finding the cube root. Every number has one cube root, called its principal cube root. For example, because , 4 is the principal cube root of 64. Likewise, because -4 · -4 · -4 = -64, -4 is the principal cube root of -64. As you can see, the principal cube root of a positive number is positive, and the principal cube root of a negative number is negative. You use the cube root symbol  (read as "the cube root of") to designate the principal cube root. The small number 3 in the symbol indicates that the cube root is desired. This number is the index of the radical. Thus,  and .

Notice that you can find cube roots of negative numbers; negative numbers have negative cube roots.

Here is a list of principal cube roots of some perfect cubes that are useful to know.


If no index is written on a radical as in , then the index is understood to be 2 and the radical indicates the principal square root.


You will find it worth your while to memorize the list of cube roots.

11Algebraic Expressions
This chapter presents a discussion of algebraic expressions. It begins with the basic terminology that is critical to your understanding of the concept of an algebraic expression.
Algebraic Terminology
A variable holds a place open for a number (or numbers, in some cases) whose value may vary. You usually express a variable as an upper- or lowercase letter (e.g., x, y, z, A, B, or C); for simplicity, the letter is the "name" of the variable. In problem situations, you use variables to represent unknown quantities. Although a variable may represent any number, in many problems, the variables represent specific numbers, but the values are unknown.

You can think of variables as numbers in disguise. Not recognizing that variables represent numbers is a common mistake.

A constant is a quantity that has a fixed, definite value that does not change in a problem situation. For example, all the real numbers are constants, including numbers whose units are units of measure such as 5 feet, 60 degrees, 100 pounds, and so forth. Also, the two special irrational numbers π and e are constants.

Recall that the real numbers are the natural numbers, the whole numbers, the integers, all positive and negative fractions and decimals, and all irrational numbers.


Even though the number π is represented by a Greek letter, π is not a variable. The number π is an irrational constant whose approximate value to two decimal places is 3.14. Similarly, the number e is an irrational constant whose approximate value to two decimal places is 2.72.

Problem Name the variable(s) and constant(s) in the given expression.
, where F is the number of degrees Fahrenheit
, where d is the measure of the diameter of a circle
Solution
, where F is the number of degrees Fahrenheit
 Step 1. Recall that a letter names a variable whose value may vary.
Step 2. Name the variable(s).
The letter F stands for the number of degrees Fahrenheit and can be any number, and so it is a variable.
Step 3. Recall that a constant has a fixed, definite value.
Step 4. Name the constant(s).
The numbers  and 32 have fixed, definite values that do not change, and so they are constants.
, where d is the measure of the diameter of a circle
 Step 1. Recall that a letter names a variable whose value may vary.
Step 2. Name the variable(s).
The letter d stands for the measure of the diameter of a circle and can be any nonnegative number, and so it is a variable.
Step 3. Recall that a constant has a fixed, definite value.
Step 4. Name the constant(s).
The number π has a fixed, definite value that does not change, and so it is a constant.
If there is a number immediately next to a variable (normally, preceding it), that number is the numerical coefficient of the variable. If there is no number written immediately next to a variable, it is understood that the numerical coefficient is 1.
Problem State the numerical coefficient of the variable.

b. x

Solution

 Step 1. Identify the numerical coefficient by observing that the number -5 immediately precedes the variable x.
-5 is the numerical coefficient of x.
b. x
 Step 1. Identify the numerical coefficient by observing that no number is written immediately next to the variable x, so the numerical coefficient is understood to be 1.
1 is the numerical coefficient of x.

The numerical coefficient of x is not 0. The numerical coefficient of x is understood to be 1.


 Step 1. Identify the numerical coefficient by observing that the number 20 immediately precedes the variable x.
20 is the numerical coefficient of x.
Writing variables and coefficients or two or more variables (with or without constants) side by side with no multiplication symbol in between is a way to show multiplication. Thus, -5x means -5 times x, and 2xyz means 2 times x times y times z. Also, a number or variable written immediately next to a grouping symbol indicates multiplication. For instance,  means 6 times the quantity ,  means 7 times , and -1|-8| means -1 times |-8|.
Evaluating Algebraic Expressions
An algebraic expression is a symbolic representation of a number. It can contain constants, variables, and computation symbols. Here are examples of algebraic expressions:

You don't know what number an algebraic expression represents because algebraic expressions always contain variables. However, if you are given numerical values for the variables, you can evaluate the algebraic expression by substituting the given numerical value for each variable and then performing the indicated operations, being sure to follow the order of operations as you proceed. (See Chapter 4 for a discussion of order of operations.)

Step 3. State the main result.

Dealing with Parentheses
Frequently, algebraic expressions are enclosed in parentheses. It is important that you deal with parentheses correctly.

If no symbol or if a + symbol immediately precedes parentheses that enclose an algebraic expression, remove the parentheses and rewrite the algebraic expression without changing any signs.
Problem Remove parentheses: .
Solution
 Step 1. Remove the parentheses without changing any signs.


If a - symbol immediately precedes parentheses that enclose an algebraic expression, remove the parentheses and the - symbol and rewrite the algebraic expression but with all the signs changed.
Problem Remove parentheses: .
Solution
 Step 1. Remove the parentheses and the - symbol and rewrite the expression, but change all the signs.

Problem Remove parentheses.


Solution

 Step 1. Remove the parentheses and rewrite the algebraic expression in parentheses without changing any signs.

A formula is a rule that shows the mathematical relationship that connects two or more variables. Formulas are used extensively in mathematics, the natural and social sciences, engineering, and numerous other areas in the real world. You use your skills in evaluating algebraic expressions to evaluate formulas.
Evaluating Formulas

If you are given numerical values for the variables, you evaluate the formula by substituting the given numerical value for each variable and then performing the indicated operations, being sure to follow the order of operations as you proceed.
If units are involved, carry the units term along in the computation, when it makes sense to do so. When you add or subtract units, the sum or difference has the same units. When you square a unit (i.e., unit × unit), you get unit2. When you cube a unit (i.e., unit × unit × unit), you get unit3.

Terms and Monomials
In an algebraic expression, terms are the parts of the expression that are connected to the other parts by plus or minus symbols. If the algebraic expression has no plus or minus symbols, then the algebraic expression itself is a term.
Problem Identify the terms in the given expression.
a.

Solution
a.
 Step 1. The expression contains plus and minus symbols, so identify the quantities between the plus and minus symbols.
The terms are , and 27.

 Step 1. There are no plus or minus symbols, so the expression is a term.
The term is 3x5.
A monomial is a special type of term that, when simplified, is a constant or a product of one or more variables raised to nonnegative integer powers, with or without an explicit coefficient.

In monomials, no variable divisors, negative exponents, or variables as radicands of simplified radicals are allowed.

Problem Specify whether the term is a monomial. Explain your answer.

 Step 1. Check whether 0 meets the criteria for a monomial.
0 is a constant, so it is a monomial.

 Step 1. Check whether 3x5 meets the criteria for a monomial.
3x5 is a term that is a variable raised to a positive integer power of 5, with an explicit coefficient of 3, so it is a monomial.

 Step 1. Check whether  meets the criteria for a monomial.

 Step 1. Check whether  meets the criteria for a monomial.
 contains a negative exponent, so it is not a monomial.

 Step 1. Check whether  meets the criteria for a monomial.
 is a term, but it contains a variable as the radicand of a simplified radical, so it is not a monomial.

The constants in monomials can be divisors, have negative exponents, or be radicands in a radical. For instance,  is a monomial.

Polynomials
A polynomial is a single monomial or a sum of monomials. A polynomial that has exactly one term is a monomial. A polynomial that has exactly two terms is a binomial. A polynomial that has exactly three terms is a trinomial. A polynomial that has more than three terms is just a general polynomial.

Like Terms
Monomials that are constants or monomials that have exactly the same variable factors (i.e., the same letters with the same corresponding exponents) are like terms. Like terms are the same except, perhaps, for their coefficients. Terms that are not like terms are unlike terms.
Problem State whether the given monomials are like terms. Explain your answer.


c. 100 and 45

100 and 45 are like terms because they are both constants.

 Step 1. Check whether 25 and 25x meet the criteria for like terms.
25 and 25x are not like terms because they do not contain the same variable factors.
Adding and Subtracting Monomials
Because variables are standing in for numbers, you rely on the properties of numbers to justify operations with polynomials. (See Chapter 1 for a discussion of the properties of numbers.)

Addition and Subtraction of Monomials
1. To add monomials that are like terms, add their numerical coefficients and use the sum as the coefficient of their common variable component.

Simplifying Polynomial Expressions
When you have an assortment of like terms in the same expression, systematically combine matching like terms in the expression. (For example, you might proceed from left to right.) You are simplifying the expression when you do this. To organize the process, use the properties of numbers to rearrange the expression so that matching like terms are together (later, you might choose do this step mentally). If the expression includes unlike terms, just indicate the sums or differences of such terms. To avoid sign errors as you work, keep a - symbol with the number that follows it.
Problem Simplify.


Solution

 Step 1. Check for like terms.
The like terms are  and ,  and , and 25 and 5.

When you are simplifying, rearranging so that like terms are together can be done mentally. However, actually writing out this step helps you avoid careless errors.

Step 2. Rearrange the expression so that like terms are together.


Remember, when rearranging, to keep a - symbol with the number that follows it.

Step 3. Systematically combine matching like terms and indicate addition or subtraction of unlike terms.


Because +- is equivalent to -, it is customary to change + - to simply - when you are simplifying expressions.

14Solving Equations
In this chapter, you learn about equations and how to solve them.
Equation Terminology
An equation is a statement of equality between two mathematical expressions. Equations may be true or false. For instance, the equation  is true, but the equation  is false. An equation has two sides. Whatever is on the left side of the equal sign is the left side (LS) of the equation, and whatever is on the right side of the equal sign is the right side (RS) of the equation.
A variable (or variables) might hold the place for numbers in an equation. For example, the equation

is an equation that has one variable, namely, x. Of course, you can have other letters (e.g., y, z, and A) that represent the variable in an equation.
Solving Equations
When you solve an equation, you proceed systematically to try to undo what has been done to the variable. In this discussion, for convenience, the variable is x.

The goal in solving an equation for the variable x is to get x by itself on only one side of the equation and with a coefficient of 1 (usually understood).

Getting x by itself on only one side of the equation and everything else on the other side is known as "isolating the variable."

You solve an equation using the properties of real numbers and simple algebraic tools. An equation is like a balance scale. To keep the equation in balance, when you do something to one side of the equation, you must do the same thing to the other side of the equation.

Tools for Solving Equations
• Add the same number to both sides.
• Subtract the same number from both sides.
• Multiply both sides by the same nonzero number.
• Divide both sides by the same nonzero number.

When you are solving an equation, it is important to remember that you must never multiply or divide both sides by 0!

You focus on the variable x while you work because what has been done to x determines the operation you choose to do. As you proceed step-by-step, you exploit the fact that addition and subtraction undo each other, and, similarly, multiplication and division undo one another. Here is a systematic approach.

Solving an Equation for the Variable x
1a. If fractions are involved, enclose numerators of more than one term in parentheses and then multiply each term on both sides of the equation by the least common multiple (LCM) of all the denominators.
1b. If the equation contains parentheses, remove them using the distributive property.
2. Combine like terms, if any, on each side of the equation.
3. If x terms appear on both sides of the equation, add or subtract an x term so that, after you simplify, the x appears on only one side of the equation.
4. Undo addition or subtraction and then simplify. If a number is added to the x term, subtract that number from both sides of the equation. If a number is subtracted from the x term, add that number to both sides of the equation.
5. Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x.
6. Check your work.
7. Check your answer.
Note: Steps 1a and 1b are labeled this way because these two steps are interchangeable, depending on your judgment of which needs to be done first.

Translating and Solving Verbal Equations
Sometimes equations are expressed in words, with the word is (or equivalent word) indicating equality. The first step in learning to translate a verbal equation into mathematical symbols is to understand how addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are expressed. Table 14.1 summarizes the most commonly used symbolism for the operations expressed as word phrases. The letter x is used in the table to represent an unknown number.
Table 14.1 Operational Symbolism Expressed as Word Phrases


Remember that, besides indicating multiplication, parentheses are used as grouping symbols. Similarly, a fraction bar can be a grouping symbol as well as indicating division.


For products like , it's important to use the phrase "the quantity " when referring to the expression inside the parentheses, so that it is clear that you mean the product of 10 and the entire expression.

Writing Equations to Solve Percent Problems
In Chapter 9, you solved percent problems using proportion concepts. You also can solve percent problems by writing and solving equations. The relationship among the elements of a percent problem is given by the formula

where R is the rate, B is the base, and P is the percentage. The secret to solving percent problems is being able to identify the three elements correctly. Start with R and B because they are usually easier to find. R is the percent in the problem and will have a % symbol or the word percent attached. B is the whole on which the rate is based and very often is the amount that immediately follows % of or percent of. The percentage is the portion of B that is determined by R. It is the other amount in the problem, and when the problem statement contains the word is, P is near is. The value of two elements will be given in the problem, and you will be solving for the third element. After you identify the three elements, write an equation using the formula P = RB and then solve it.

Angles
In geometry, point, line, and plane are basic terms. You might think of a point as a location in space, a line as a set of points that goes on and on in both directions, and a plane as set of points that form a flat infinite surface.
A ray is a line that extends from a point. Two rays that meet at a common point form an angle. The vertex of the angle is the point where the two rays meet, as shown in Figure 15.1.

Figure 15.1 Vertex of angle A
You use degrees (°) to measure angles. You classify angles by the number of degrees in their measurements. An acute angle measures between 0° and 90°. A right angle measures exactly 90°. An obtuse angle measures between 90° and 180°. A straight angle measures exactly 180°.

Polygons
A polygon is a simple, closed figure in a plane composed of sides that are straight line segments that meet only at their end points. Polygons are named by the number of sides they have. A triangle is a three-sided polygon. A quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon. A pentagon is a five-sided polygon. A hexagon is a six-sided polygon. A heptagon is a seven-sided polygon. An octagon is an eight-sided polygon. Other polygons with additional sides have special names as well. However, eventually, at a high number of sides, you simply speak of the polygon as an n-gon. If all the sides of a polygon are congruent, then the polygon is a regular polygon.
Problem Name the polygon shown.





Solution

 Step 1. Count the number of sides.

Step 2. Name the polygon.
The polygon has five sides, so it is a pentagon.

 Step 1. Count the number of sides.

Step 2. Name the polygon.

Step 2. Name the polygon.
The polygon has three sides, so it is a triangle.

 Step 1. Count the number of sides.

Step 2. Name the polygon.
The polygon has six sides, so it is a hexagon.
Triangles
Triangles can be classified in two different ways. You can classify triangles according to their sides as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. An equilateral triangle has three congruent sides. An isosceles triangle has at least two congruent sides. A scalene triangle has no congruent sides.

All equilateral triangles are isosceles triangles. However, not all isosceles triangles are equilateral triangles.

Problem State the most specific name of the triangle according to its sides. (Note: Sides labeled with the same letter are congruent.)

Another way to classify triangles is according to their interior angles. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°. An acute triangle has three acute angles. A right triangle has exactly one right angle. An obtuse triangle has exactly one obtuse angle.

Because the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°, the other two angles of an obtuse triangle are acute angles.

 Step 1. Describe the angles of the triangle.
There is one obtuse angle and two acute angles.
Step 2. Name the triangle according to its angles.
The triangle has exactly one obtuse angle, so the triangle is an obtuse triangle.
Quadrilaterals
You classify quadrilaterals as either trapezoids or parallelograms. A trapezoid has exactly one pair of parallel sides. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel and congruent. Note: Some texts define a trapezoid as a quadrilateral that has at least one pair of parallel sides. This situation is one of the few times that mathematicians do not agree on the definition of a term.
Some parallelograms have special names because of their special properties. A rhombus is a parallelogram that has four congruent sides. A rectangle is a parallelogram that has four interior right angles. A square is a parallelogram that has four interior right angles and four congruent sides. To be more specific, a square is a rectangle that has four congruent sides. You also can say that a square is a rhombus that has four interior right angles.

If a parallelogram has one interior right angle, then the other three interior angles also are right angles.


Do not make the mistake of thinking that squares are not rectangles. All squares are rectangles; however, not all rectangles are squares.

The parallelogram has four interior right angles, so it is a rectangle.
Parts of a Circle
A circle is a closed figure in a plane for which all points on the figure are the same distance from a point within, called the center. A radius of a circle is a line segment joining the center of the circle to any point on the circle. The diameter is a line segment through the center of the circle with endpoints on the circle. The diameter of a circle is twice the radius. Conversely, the radius of a circle is half the diameter. See Figure 15.2.

Solid Figures
Solid figures are three-dimensional figures that occupy space. The solid figures you should be able to recognize are prisms, pyramids, cylinders, cones, and spheres.
A prism is a solid with two congruent and parallel bases. The sides of a prism are rectangles. The bases of a prism can have the shape of any polygon. Prisms are named according to the shape of their bases. A cube is a special rectangular prism that has six congruent faces, all of which are squares.

A sphere is a three-dimensional figure that is shaped like a ball. Every point on the figure is the same distance from a point within, called the center of the sphere. The radius of the sphere is a line segment from the center of the sphere to any point on the sphere. The diameter of the sphere is a line segment joining two points of the sphere and passing through its center. The radius of the sphere is half the diameter. Conversely, the diameter is twice the radius. See Figure 15.3.

Figure 15.3 Sphere
Problem Determine whether the item shown is most like a cylinder, a cone, or a sphere.



Solution

 Step 1. Determine whether the can is most like a cylinder, a cone, or a sphere.
The can has two parallel bases, which are circles. It has one rectangular side that wraps around, so it is most like a cylinder.

 Step 1. Determine whether the snow cone cup is most like a cylinder, a cone, or a sphere.
The snow cone cup has one circular base (at the top) and a curved side that wraps around, so it is most like a cone.

 Step 1. Determine whether the solid is most like a cylinder, a cone, or a sphere.
The solid has the shape of a ball, so it is a sphere.

16Perimeter, Area, and Volume
In this chapter, you learn to find the perimeter, area, and volume of geometric figures.
Perimeter
The perimeter of a simple, closed plane figure is a one-dimensional concept and is the distance around the figure. The perimeter is always measured in units of length such as inches, feet, centimeters, or meters. What length of fence is needed to enclose a yard? What length of decorative border is needed for a mirror? Situations such as these call for measuring the perimeter.
As an example, find the perimeter of the following figure.

To find the perimeter, add the lengths of the four sides:

Problem Find the perimeter of the figure shown.


Solution The perimeter is the distance around the figure.
Step 1. Label the lengths of each side.

Step 2. Sum the lengths of the sides to get the perimeter.

Perimeter of Special Shapes
Some polygons have characteristics that enable you to deduce formulas for their perimeters.
A rectangle has opposite sides that are congruent. If the length is denoted by l and the width by w, then the formula for the perimeter P is .

A square has four congruent sides. If the side lengths are denoted by s, then the formula for the perimeter is .


The important thing to remember is not the formulas but that the perimeter is the distance around the figure. Formulas are simply shortcuts to use when applicable.

Several other figures often encountered in the study of geometry include the following.
Recall from Chapter 15 that a triangle is a simple, closed plane figure with three sides. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its sides; that is, .

The perimeter of an equilateral triangle with sides each of length a is 

The perimeter of an isosceles triangle with congruent sides of length a and third side of length b is .

A circle is a unique figure. The perimeter of a circle is given the special name of circumference, C. It has no straight sides. The formula for C was discovered long ago after much thought and experimentation. It is simply , where d is the length of the diameter of the circle and r is the length of its radius.


The usual approximation for π is 3.14, but if more accuracy is needed, you can use more decimal places. A calculator usually gives π to eight or ten decimal places.

Problem Find the indicated perimeter or circumference.
a. Find the perimeter of a square that measures 3.5 cm on each side.
b. Find the perimeter of an isosceles triangle whose congruent sides are each 10 ft and the other side 6 ft.
c. Find the circumference of a circle whose radius is 20 cm. Use 3.14 to approximate π.

 Step 1. Sketch the figure.

Step 2. Use the formula for the perimeter of a square.

Step 3. Apply the formula to the figure and compute the perimeter.

b. Find the perimeter of an isosceles triangle whose congruent sides are each10 ft and the other side 6 ft.

d. The circumference of the Earth is about 25000 mi. What is the approximate diameter of the Earth? Use .
 Step 1. Select the appropriate formula for the problem. The Earth is approximately a sphere, so the circumference is approximately that of a circle.

Step 2. Apply the formula to the problem.

Step 3. Solve for d.

Area
The area of a closed plane figure is a two-dimensional concept. It is the amount of surface enclosed by the boundary of the figure. For instance, in Figure 16.1, there are  of area enclosed by the rectangular figure shown.

Each unit figure is a square of side length 1 in
Figure 16.1 Area of a plane figure
Area is always measured in square units such as square inches , square feet , square miles , and square meters . Regardless of the shape of the figure, the area units are always square units.
As with perimeter, special figures have special formulas for finding the area enclosed by the figure. The formula for the area of a rectangle is , where A is the area and l and w are the length and width of the sides of the rectangle.

The area of a square is .

The area of a triangle is , where the base, b, can be any side of the triangle and the height, h, for that base is the perpendicular distance from the opposite vertex to that base (or an extension of it).

Like the circumference, the area of a circle involves the number π and is completely determined by the length of the radius. The formula for the area of a circle is , where r is the length of the radius.


The formula for the area of a circle is not . This mistake is the result of confusing the formula for the area of a circle, , with , the radius form of the formula for the circumference. Each of these formulas has only one "2" in it. In the area formula, the "2" is an exponent indicating that the radius, r, is squared (because area is measured in square units). In the circumference formula, the "2" is a coefficient.

Problem Find the indicated area.
a. Find the area of a rectangle whose length is 6 in and width 4 in.
b. Find the area of a circle whose diameter is 24 cm.
c. Find the area of a triangle whose base measures 8 ft and height (to that base) measures 7 ft.

Step 2. Choose the appropriate area formula.

Step 3. Apply the formula to the figure and compute the area.

b. Find the area of a circle whose diameter is 24 cm.
 Step 1. Sketch the figure.

Note: The diameter is 24 cm, so the .
Step 2. Choose the appropriate area formula.

Step 3. Apply the formula to the figure and compute the area.

 Step 1. Sketch the figure.

Step 2. Choose the appropriate area formula.

Step 3. Apply the formula to the figure and compute the area.

Surface Area
The surface area of a solid three-dimensional figure is the area of the outside surface of the figure. As such, the surface area is a two-dimensional measure and has square units. If the figure is a rectangular prism (a box), as shown in Figure 16.2, then the surface area is the sum of the areas of all the faces.

Figure 16.2 Rectangular prism
Problem Find the surface area of a box that has dimensions  in,  in, and in.
Solution
 Step 1. Sketch the figure.

Step 2. Use the length and height to find the area of the front and rear faces.

Step 3. Use the height and width to find the area of the two side faces.

Step 4. Use the length and width to find the area of the top and bottom faces.

Step 5. Add the areas to get the final surface area.

Volume
Volume is a three-dimensional concept and is measured in cubic units. It is a measure of the space or capacity inside a three-dimensional closed figure such as a can, a cereal box, a room of a house, or a soccer ball. These types of measurements are very important to manufacturers of goods.
As with perimeter and area, special figures have special volume formulas. A rectangular prism (box) is a three-dimensional figure all of whose faces are rectangles. It has three characteristic measurements: length l, width w, and height h. The volume formula is .

A cylinder, such as a can, has a circular base and top; consequently, the number π enters into the volume formula. The volume formula for a cylinder is , where r is the radius of the base circle and h is the height of the cylinder.

Notice that in both of the previous formulas,  and , the product in parentheses is the area of the base of the respective figures. If you let B = the area of the base, then both formulas are the same, . In fact, any prism or any cylinder has the same volume formula, , where B is the area of the base and h is the height. This is the preferred format of these particular formulas in most of the current textbooks.

In a cylinder or prism, the base and top are congruent figures in parallel planes, and they have the same area.

The following figures are triangular prisms, and the  formula applies to them also. In this instance, the base areas are the areas of triangles. Notice that a prism does not have to rest on its "base."


The volume, V, of a prism or cylinder that has a base of area B and height h is

A sphere has volume formula , where r is the radius of the sphere. This formula can be derived with the tools of calculus.

17Pythagorean Theorem
In this chapter, you learn about the Pythagorean theorem.
Right Triangle Concepts
A right triangle is a triangle with exactly one right (90°) angle. The longest side of the right triangle is opposite the 90° angle and is called the hypotenuse. The word hypotenuse derives from the Greek hypo-("under") and teinein ("to stretch"). This interpretation was probably derived from the fact that the Pythagoreans, followers of the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, and other early geometers drew most of their triangles with the hypotenuse down ("under") as in Figure 17.1.

Figure 17.1 Right triangle
Pythagorean Theorem
The three sides of a right triangle have a special relationship, named after Pythagoras.

Pythagorean Theorem
If a right triangle has legs of lengths a and b and hypotenuse of length c, then 

The Pythagorean theorem is also written . When using the theorem, choose whichever form is most convenient for the situation at hand.


This theorem is probably the most well-known theorem of mathematics and also one of the most used. Its discovery led not only to a great advance in geometry but also to the introduction of the completely unknown, at the time, set of irrational numbers.
The theorem was originally stated geometrically as the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the two legs, as depicted in Figure 17.2.

Figure 17.2 Depiction of the Pythagorean theorem
This formula is used so much today in algebra, calculus, physics, engineering, and many other disciplines that we tend to forget that it is a geometry theorem.
The example problems and the exercise problems are varied to illustrate the wide use of the theorem.
Problem Use the Pythagorean theorem to solve as indicated. Use your calculator and round answers, as needed.
a. Find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular garden that has dimensions of 30 ft by 40 ft.
b. Televisions are sized by the length of the diagonal of the face. Find the "size" of a portable TV whose rectangular face measures 27 in by 21 in.

d. Two people want to carry a tall mirror that is 9 by 9 ft square through a doorway that measures 3 ft by 8 ft. Will the mirror fit through the doorway?
e. Find the area of the triangle shown.
 
Solution
a. Find the length of the diagonal of a rectangular garden that has dimensions of 30 ft by 40 ft.
 Step 1. Sketch the figure.

Step 2. From the figure, you can see that the diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle having legs of 30 ft and 40 ft.
Step 3. Substitute the given values into the Pythagorean theorem, omitting the units for convenience.

Step 4. Solve for c.

Step 5. State the answer.

b. Televisions are sized by the length of the diagonal of the face. Find the "size" of a portable TV whose rectangular face measures 27 in by 21 in.
 Step 1. Sketch the figure.

Step 2. From the figure, you can see that the diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle having legs of 27 in and 21 in.
Step 3. Substitute these values into the Pythagorean theorem, omitting the units for convenience.

Step 4. Solve for c.

Step 5. State the answer.

c. A 25 ft ladder is placed against a wall with the base of the ladder 12 ft from the wall on level ground. How high up on the wall does the ladder reach?
 Step 1. Sketch the figure.

Step 2. The ladder, the ground, and the wall form a right triangle with the ladder as the hypotenuse.
Step 3. Let h = the distance up the wall the ladder reaches and substitute the numbers into the Pythagorean theorem.

Step 4. Solve for h.

Step 5. Answer the question.

d. Two people want to carry a tall mirror that is a 9 by 9 ft square through a doorway that measures 3 ft by 8 ft. Will the mirror fit through the doorway?
 Step 1. Let  length of the diagonal of the doorway. Sketch the figure.

Step 2. Analyze the problem.
Because the doorway is only 8 ft high, the only way to get the mirror through the doorway is on a slant. Therefore, determine whether the length of the diagonal m of the doorway is greater than 9 ft, the length of an edge of the mirror.
Step 3. A right triangle is formed with m as the hypotenuse. Substitute the numbers into the Pythagorean theorem.

Step 4. Solve for m.

Step 5. Answer the question.
The mirror will not fit through the doorway because the length of the diagonal of the doorway is about 8.54 ft, which is less than 9 ft, the length of an edge of the mirror.
e. Find the area of the triangle shown.

The height must be known in order to use the area formula for the triangle.
 Step 1. Sketch the figure. Let h be the measure of the height.

Step 2. Substitute into the Pythagorean theorem.

Step 3. Solve for h.

Step 4. Substitute the base and height into the area formula for the triangle.

Step 5. Answer the question.

Converse of the Pythagorean Theorem
Triangles whose sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem are right triangles.Thus, you have the following converse statement.

Converse of the Pythagorean Theorem
If a triangle has sides of lengths a, b, and , then the triangle is a right triangle and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
Problem Is the triangle with sides of 8, 14, and 17 units a right triangle?
Solution
Step 1. Because 17 is the longest side, check whether the numbers satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

18Counting and Probability
In this chapter, you learn about counting and probability.
Counting Methods
You have different methods to find the number of ways to arrange or combine things. The most efficient method is to use the counting principle. The counting principle says that if you can do a first task in any one of m different ways, and after that you can do a second task in any one of n different ways, then you can do the first task followed by the second task in  different ways.

When you use the counting principle, multiply, don't add.

Problem A young boy is selecting a cap and a pair of tennis shoes to wear. He has a choice of a blue, red, orange, or yellow cap. He may select a black, brown, or white pair of tennis shoes. How many different ways can the boy choose one cap and one pair of tennis shoes?
Solution
 Step 1. Determine how many tasks are involved.
Two tasks are involved: first, select a cap; next, select a pair of tennis shoes.
Step 2. Determine the number of ways to select a cap.
There are four colors to choose from, so the number of ways to select a cap is 4.
Step 3. Determine the number of ways to select a pair of tennis shoes.
There are three colors to choose from, so the number of ways to select a pair of tennis shoes is 3.
Step 4. Multiply the number of ways in step 2 by the number of ways in step 3.
(no. of ways to select a cap) × (no. of ways to select a pair of tennis shoes) 
Note: "no." is an abbreviation for "number."
Step 5. State the answer.
There are 12 possible ways to select one cap and one pair of tennis shoes.
One popular method that you might have seen for working this problem is to list every possibility in a tree diagram. Here are the steps.
 Step 1. List all the possibilities for the cap selection.

Step 2. Below each cap selection, draw three "branches," one for each tennis shoe selection, and list the tennis shoe selections.

Step 3. Count the "leaves" at the base of the diagram to determine the number of possible ways to select one cap and one pair of tennis shoes.

Step 4. State the answer.
There are 12 leaves, so there are 12 possible ways to select one cap and one pair of tennis shoes.
Notice in the tree diagram that each leaf represents a choice. For instance, the first leaf represents the choice of selecting a blue cap and black tennis shoes. This choice is different from the choice represented by the fourth leaf, which is selecting a red cap and black tennis shoes.
A third commonly used method is to list every possibility in an organized table. For the above problem, you proceed systematically in building the table, as shown here.
 Step 1. List a blue cap color with each of the tennis shoe colors that can be selected.

Step 2. List a red cap color with each of the tennis shoe colors that can be chosen.

Step 3. List an orange cap color with each of the tennis shoe colors that can be chosen.

Step 4. List a yellow cap color with each of the tennis shoe colors that can be chosen.

Step 5. Count the number of rows in the table.

There are 12 rows in the table.
Step 6. State the answer.
There are 12 possible ways to select one cap and one pair of tennis shoes.
Similar to the results of the tree diagram, each row in the table represents a choice. For instance, the 12th row represents the choice of selecting a yellow cap and white tennis shoes.

When you use a tree diagram or an organized table to count possibilities, be sure to proceed in a systematic manner, as illustrated in this chapter. Otherwise, you may overlook a possibility or count one more than once.

Tree diagrams and organized tables are useful counting methods when you have a limited number of choices, but they become increasingly unwieldy as the number of options increases. In contrast, the counting principle can be extended to accommodate any number of tasks, as shown in the following problem.
Problem How many different three-character codes consisting of one lowercase letter followed by two digits (0 to 9) are possible?
Solution
 Step 1. Determine how many tasks are involved.
Three tasks are involved: first, select a lowercase letter; second, select a first digit; and third, select a second digit.
Step 2. Determine the number of ways to select a lowercase letter.
There are 26 lowercase letters, so the number of ways to select a lowercase letter is 26.
Step 3. Determine the number of ways to select the first digit.
There are 10 digits from which to choose, so the number of ways to select the first digit is 10.
Step 4. Determine the number of ways to select the second digit.
There are 10 digits from which to choose, so the number of ways to select the second digit is 10.
Step 5. Multiply the number of ways in step 2 by the number of ways in step 3 by the number of ways in step 4.
(no. of ways to select a letter) × (no. of ways to select a digit) × (no. of ways to select a digit) 
Step 6. State the answer.
There are 2600 possible three-digit codes consisting of one lowercase letter followed by two digits.
Basic Probability Concepts
Probability is a measure of the chance that an event will happen. In simple words, an event is something that happens subject to chance, for instance, heads showing face up when you flip a coin. You use the notation P (E) as shorthand for "the probability that the event E will happen." If all possible outcomes are equally likely, then the probability that an event E will occur is determined this way:


In a probability problem, the number of possible outcomes is always greater than or equal to the number of outcomes favorable to the event. Always check to make sure that the denominator is larger than or equal to the numerator when you substitute values into the formula.


Do not use the formula
unless all possible outcomes are equally likely. Doing so is a common error.

"Equally likely" outcomes are outcomes that have the same chance of happening. "Favorable" outcomes are the outcomes that will result in the event E occurring. These are the outcomes you are looking for. Naturally, you can use other letters, such as A, B, and C, to represent events. It is customary to use uppercase letters for this purpose.
The following problem illustrates the important role that counting plays in computing probabilities.
Problem Find the indicated probability.
a. A fair coin is flipped one time, and the face-up side of the coin is observed. Find the probability that the up face is heads.
b. A bag contains five tiles, all identical in size and shape, that are numbered 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. If a person picks out a single tile from the bag without looking, what is the probability that the number on the tile will be divisible by 20?
c. Suppose a three-character digital code for a lock box consists of one lowercase letter followed by two digits (0 to 9). Find the probability that a person can randomly guess the correct code for the lock box.
Solution
a. A fair coin is flipped one time, and the face-up side of the coin is observed. Find the probability that the up face is heads.
 Step 1. Count the number of possible outcomes.
The possible outcomes of one flip of a coin are heads on the face up (H) or tails on the face up (T), so the number of possible outcomes is 2.
Step 2. Count the number of favorable outcomes.
There is one favorable outcome, H.
Step 3. Check whether all possible outcomes are equally likely.
The coin is a fair coin, so H and T are equally likely outcomes.
Step 4. Compute the probability.

Step 5. State the answer.
On one flip of a fair coin, the probability of getting heads on the face-up side is .
b. A bag contains five tiles, all identical in size and shape, that are numbered 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. If a person picks out a single tile from the bag without looking, what is the probability that the number on the tile will be divisible by 20?
 Step 1. Count the number of possible outcomes.
The possible outcomes are a 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 on the tile, so there are five possible outcomes.
Step 2. Count the number of favorable outcomes.
There are two favorable outcomes for this event: drawing a tile numbered 20 or drawing a tile numbered 40.
Step 3. Check whether all possible outcomes are equally likely.
Given that the tiles are identical in size and shape and that the person draws a tile without looking, all possible outcomes are equally likely.
Step 4. Compute the probability.

Step 5. State the answer.
The probability of drawing a tile whose number is divisible by 20 is .
c. Suppose a three-character digital code for a lock box consists of one lowercase letter followed by two digits (0 to 9). Find the probability that a person can randomly guess the correct code for the lock box.
 Step 1. Count the number of possible outcomes.
The number of possible codes (outcomes) = (no. of ways to select a letter)(no. of ways to select a digit)(no. of ways to select a digit) 
Step 2. Count the number of favorable outcomes.
There is only one favorable outcome, the correct three-character digital code.
Step 3. Check whether all possible outcomes are equally likely.
Given that the person is trying to randomly guess the code, all possible outcomes are equally likely.
Step 4. Compute the probability.

Step 5. State the answer.
The probability that a person can randomly guess the correct code for the lock box is .
Probabilities can be expressed as fractions, decimals, or percents. In problem b above, the probability of drawing an even-numbered tile can be expressed as , 0.4, or 40%.
The probability that an event is certain to happen is 1 or 100%. For instance, if you have a bag containing tiles numbered 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 only, the probability of drawing a tile that has a multiple of 10 on it from the bag is 1 (because the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 are all multiples of 10).
If an event cannot happen, then it has a probability of 0. For instance, the probability of drawing a tile with the number 60 on it from a bag containing tiles numbered 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 only is 0 (because none of the tiles has 60 on it). Thus, the lowest probability is 0, and the highest probability is 1. All other probabilities fall between 0 and 1. Therefore, if you work a probability problem, and your answer is greater than 1 or your answer is negative, you've made an error! Go back and check your work.
Always remember to check whether the outcomes are equally likely before using the formula for probability. This situation is illustrated in the following problem.
Problem Suppose you spin a spinner that is one-fourth red, one-fourth yellow, and one-half green, as shown below. Find the probability that the spinner lands on red or green.

Solution
 Step 1. Count the number of possible outcomes.
There are three possible outcomes because the spinner can land on red, yellow, or green.
Step 2. Count the number of favorable outcomes.
There are two favorable outcomes: landing on red or green.
Step 3. Check whether all possible outcomes are equally likely.
The three outcomes are not equally likely because the green section is larger than the other two sections.
Step 4. Compute the probability.
Given that the green and red sections occupy  of the spinner, then 
Step 5. State the answer.

Probability When Drawing with or Without Replacement
Sometimes a probability problem involves a two-step selection process. For instance, drawing a marble from a box of colored marbles, and then drawing a second marble from the same box. In this problem, it is important to consider whether the drawing is done "with replacement" or "without replacement." "With replacement" means that the first marble drawn is put back in the box before the second drawing takes place. "Without replacement" means that the first marble is not put back before the second drawing takes place. After accounting for "with replacement" or "without replacement," you multiply the probabilities of making each of the two selections, as illustrated in the following problem.
Problem Suppose a box contains 10 marbles: 3 red marbles, 5 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles, all identical except for color.
a. If you draw two marbles, one at a time, from the box without looking, what is the probability that you will draw two red marbles if your first draw is done without replacement?
b. If you draw two marbles, one at a time, from the box without looking, what is the probability that you will draw two red marbles if your first draw is done with replacement?
Solution
a. If you draw two marbles, one at a time, from the box without looking, what is the probability that you will draw two red marbles if your first draw is done without replacement?
 Step 1. Find the probability of drawing a red marble on the first draw.
Initially, there are 3 red marbles in the box of 10 marbles, so

Step 2. Find the probability of drawing a red marble on the second draw. After a red marble is drawn and not put back, there are 2 red marbles in a box of 9 marbles, so P(red on second draw after drawing red on the first draw 
Step 3. Multiply the probability from step 1 by the probability from step 2.

Step 4. State the answer.
The probability of drawing two red marbles if the first draw is done without replacement is .
b. If you draw two marbles, one at a time, from the box without looking, what is the probability that you will draw two red marbles if your first draw is done with replacement?
 Step 1. Find the probability of drawing a red marble on the first draw.
Initially, there are 3 red marbles in the box of 10 marbles, so

Step 2. Find the probability of drawing a red marble on the second draw.
After a red marble is drawn and put back, you again have 3 red marbles in a box of 10 marbles, so P (red on second draw after drawing red on the first draw with replacement)
Step 3. Multiply the probability from step 1 by the probability from step 2.

Step 4. State the answer.
The probability of drawing two red marbles if the first draw is done with replacement is .
This process of computing the probability of a sequence of events can be extended to any number of events. You should always consider whether "with replacement" or "without replacement" is a concern as you go from one event to the next.
Probability for Independent Events
Of course, when you are flipping coins or tossing numbered cubes, replacement is not a concern. Each flip of the coin or toss of the numbered cube is independent of the other flips or tosses. Independent events do not affect the probabilities of one another, so you simply multiply the probabilities in these cases. There are numerous other situations that involve independent events as well. In most cases, you can use your judgment to decide whether the events are independent.

Coins (and other physical objects used in games of chance) do not have "memories," so do not make the mistake of thinking that a certain outcome is "due."

Problem Find the indicated probability.
a. A fair coin is flipped three times. Find the probability of getting three heads in a row.
b. A young boy wears a cap and a pair of tennis shoes to school every day. Suppose he randomly picks a blue, red, orange, or yellow cap, then randomly picks a black, brown, or white pair of tennis shoes. Find the probability that the boy will pick a red cap and black tennis shoes.
Solution
a. A fair coin is flipped three times. Find the probability of getting three heads in a row.
 Step 1. Find the probability of obtaining heads on the first flip.

Step 2. Find the probability of obtaining heads on the second flip.

Step 3. Find the probability of obtaining heads on the third flip.

Step 4. The events are independent, so multiply the probability from step 1 by the probability from step 2 by the probability from step 3.

Step 5. State the answer.
When a fair coin is flipped three times, the probability of getting three heads in a row is .
b. A young boy wears a cap and a pair of tennis shoes to school every day. Suppose he randomly picks a blue, red, orange, or yellow cap, then randomly picks a black, brown, or white pair of tennis shoes. Find the probability that the boy will pick a red cap and black tennis shoes.
 Step 1. Find the probability of picking a red cap.

Step 2. Find the probability of picking black tennis shoes.

Step 3. Because the boy is picking randomly and because the hat selection and shoe selection probabilities do not affect each other, the events are independent, so multiply the probability from step 1 by the probability from step 2.

Step 4. State the answer.
The probability the boy will pick a red cap and black tennis shoes is .
Notice that the answer to problem b above is consistent with what you previously found; that is, that there are 12 possible ways for the boy to select one cap and one pair of tennis shoes. In only one of those 12 ways would the boy select a red cap and black tennis shoes. Thus, using the probability formula, you have

19Mean, Median, Mode, and Range
In this chapter, you learn how to calculate the mean, median, mode, and range for a set of numbers. The mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency. A measure of central tendency is a numerical value that describes a set of numbers (such as students' scores on a test) by attempting to provide a "central" or "typical" value of the numbers. The range is a measure of variability. It gives you an idea of the spread of a set of numbers.
Mean
The mean of a set of numbers is another name for the arithmetic average of the numbers in the set. To calculate the mean: first, sum the numbers; then, divide by how many numbers are in the set. Thus, you have the following formula:


Remember that the fraction bar indicates division.


The braces around a list of numbers mean that the numbers belong together as a set. You read {1,3,5} as "the set consisting of the numbers 1, 3, and 5."

Problem Find the mean for the given set of numbers.






Solution

 Step 1. Sum the numbers.

Step 2. Divide by 5.


When computing a mean, don't forget to divide by how many numbers you have.


If all the numbers are positive, then the mean of the numbers is also positive.

 Step 1. Sum the numbers.

Step 2. Divide by 6.

Step 3. State the answer.


If all the numbers are negative, then the mean of the numbers is also negative.

Weighted Average
A weighted average (or weighted mean) is an average computed by assigning weights to the numbers (e.g., test scores).
Problem A student scores 50, 40, and 96 on three exams. Find the weighted average of the student's three scores, where the score of 50 counts 20%, the score of 40 counts 30%, and the score of 96 counts 50%.
Solution
 Step 1. Multiply each score by its corresponding "weight" and then add.

Step 2. Sum the weights.

Step 3. Divide the sum in step 1 by the sum in step 2.

Step 4. State the answer.
The student's weighted average is 70.
Median
The median is the middle value or the arithmetic average of the two middle values in an ordered set of numbers. To find the median, do the following:
1. Put the numbers in order from least to greatest (or greatest to least).
2. Locate the middle number. If there is no single middle number, compute the arithmetic average of the two middle numbers.
Problem Find the median.






Solution

 Step 1. Put the numbers in order from least to greatest.

Step 2. Locate the middle number.

Step 3. State the answer.

Step 3. State the answer.


 Step 1. Put the numbers in order from least to greatest.

Step 2. Locate the middle number.

Step 3. State the answer.


As with the mean, if all the numbers are the same, the median of the numbers is the common number.


 Step 1. Put the numbers in order from least to greatest.

Step 2. Locate the middle number.
There is no single middle number, so compute the arithmetic average of the two middle numbers, -50 and -50.


If the two middle numbers are the same, then the arithmetic average is the common number.

Step 3. State the answer.


As with the mean, if all the numbers are negative, then the median of the numbers is also negative.

Mode
In a set of numbers, the mode is the number (or numbers) that occurs most often. A set of numbers in which each number occurs the same number of times has no mode. If only one number occurs most often, then the set is unimodal. If exactly two numbers occur with the same frequency that is more often than any of the other numbers, then the set is bimodal. If three or more numbers occur with the same frequency that is more often than any of the other numbers, then the set is multimodal.
Problem Find the mode, if any. For number sets that have modes, state whether the data set is unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal.






Solution

 Step 1. For each number, determine how often it occurs.

Step 2. State the mode, if any.
