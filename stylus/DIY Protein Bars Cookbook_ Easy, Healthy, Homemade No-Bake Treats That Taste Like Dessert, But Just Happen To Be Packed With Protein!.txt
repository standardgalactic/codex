About The Author
Jessica Stier is the author, photographer and recipe developer behind the DIY Protein Bars Cookbook, which was inspired by her healthy dessert recipe blog, Desserts with Benefits™ (www.DessertsWithBenefits.com).  Jessica is a healthy dessert expert with an interest and a strong scholarly background in the fields of Nutrition and Dietetics (thanks, university!), but before college she was the complete opposite...
I guess we should start from the beginning, shall we?
I was born and raised in a quiet, homey neighborhood in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  And, like most kids, I ate whatever (and whenever) I pleased.  I plowed my way through boxes of candy bars, jumbo-sized bags of chocolatey goodies, and enough candy to fill dozens of those Halloween trick-or-treat pumpkin baskets (aka, enough sugar to make even the most seasoned sugar fiend sick with a stomachache and candy hangover).
When my family and I moved to the United States, so did my sugar addiction.  All the way up to age eighteen, I was eating poorly (ehem, understatement of the year, ehem) and I wasn't exercising.  At all.  I ate chocolate bars for breakfast (yes, I'm serious), a bag of chips, "fruit" snacks, and a carton of sugary chocolate milk for lunch (are you getting a sugar rush just by reading this?), and something totally useless for dinner, like nachos or instant noodles.  I brought so much candy to school that I was known as "Hershey Girl," "Sourpatch Girl," and even just the plain old, "girl with candy" (I went through a few candy phases).  I needed $20 per week to support my daily vending machine visits and another $20 on top of that to pay for my hefty lunches.  After every meal, I felt gross and nauseous with a foggy brain, but I kept on eating the unhealthy foods I had always eaten.  I mean, a diet like that was normal to me.  My entire family ate like that, the kids at school ate like that, it all tasted good...  so, what's the problem?  Why change?
When I turned sixteen and got my first job at a pretzel joint in the local shopping mall, I gained a little bit of weight.  And by "a little" I mean "a lot."  Like, twelve pounds in three months.  This was a huge shock to me.  I never gained weight like that before despite my inadequate diet and sedentary lifestyle.  I may have been on the thin side my entire life, but I was always "skinny-fat."  A lot of jiggle on bones with no muscle whatsoever.
My solution?  Oh, just buy those 100-calorie snack packs and (attempt to) stop eating a bajillion pretzels dunked in butter every time they began to look dry.  Yeah, that didn't fly.  The excess salt, the dangerous trans fats, the highly refined sugar, the artificial sweeteners...  it just made me want more.  A lot more.  And I paid the price for it - I was an emotional roller coaster with crazy cravings, either trapped in a steady state of lethargy or stuck in an unstoppable yo-yoing between sugar rush and sugar crash.
I just wanted to be better...  healthier.
With perfect timing, I graduated high school and was about to enter university - a brand new stage in life where I decided to start over.  Completely.  I chose to major in Nutritional Sciences, and this was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life.  I learned everything under the sun about food, nutrition, and the human body.  I finally came to terms with my own body, the reasons why I ate the way I did, and how I should be eating.  Now, just a few years later, I have finally found the solution to achieving consistent energy levels, and I am satiated for a long period of time (no more of those "I-must-eat-that-entire-tray-of-brownies-ASAP" feelings).  I have boosted my metabolism (by ~800 calories per day), I have put on lean muscle (~15 pounds) and have lost some fat (~10 pounds).
I lived for chocolate.  I live for chocolate.
Don't get me wrong, I still indulge.  I have (and will always have) a serious passion for sweets!  I have just learned how to make those sweets (secretly) healthy.
Enter, Desserts with Benefits™
My blog was born late at night on April 20th, 2011 as a serious procrastination technique to avoid studying for finals.  I didn't post a recipe, but rather, a list of desserts that were on my "Baking Wishlist," along with dishes that I've made but had turned out unsuccessful.  Healthy baking is a difficult thing to do!  I don't use sugar (white granulated sugar, brown sugar, high fructose corn syrup, etc.), artificial sweeteners (aspartame, sucralose, etc.), white flour (all purpose flour, cake flour, pastry flour, bread flour, bleached flours, etc.), or unhealthy fats (hydrogenated shortening, margarine, genetically modified oils).  I mean, anything can be made to taste good using all the wrong ingredients, but is it what your body wants?  I don't want my desserts to give off the same repercussions that typical unhealthy desserts do (aka, bloating, headache, stomachache, nausea).
When I started blogging, I hoped to show people that healthy ingredients can indeed make a delicious cake, muffin, pastry, cookie, and so on.  I am happy to say that, with the hundreds of testimonials I've received, with the loyal Desserts with Benefits™ fans who comment regularly, and with the thousands upon thousands of people around the world who have tried (and loved!) my recipes...
I have met that goal.










About The Cookbook
DIY Protein Bars is a collection of 48 easy, healthy, homemade, no-bake treats that taste like dessert, but just happen to be packed with protein!  And there are options for everyone.  The recipes are (or can be easily made) gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, soy-free and vegan...  but you'd never know it.  One bite of any protein bar in this cookbook and you'll be screaming, "OH-MY-GOSH-this-is-so-freakin'-good-how-can-this-be-good-for-me?!?"
*runs around in circles with joy*
(Yes, that will happen.)
These protein bars are so tasty and addicting you'll never buy store-bought again!
Every protein bar recipe contains complete proteins (they contain all the essential amino acids).  Protein is essential for muscle growth, repair and maintenance, and it is also necessary for maintaining blood pressure, fluid balance, pH balance and electrolyte levels within the body.  The amount of protein you need is unique to you, but for the average person, it is recommended that you consume .8-2 grams of protein per kg of body weight.  Personally, though, I think this puts too much of an emphasis on getting enough protein rather than eating a balanced diet, so I like to go by this:
10-35% of calorie intake from protein
20-35% of calorie intake from fat
45-65% of calorie intake from carbohydrates
I like to have my protein bar recipes fall somewhere within these ranges, but we don't need to go all "Anal Retentive Chef" here (thanks, Saturday Night Live)!  These recommended percentages have a pretty wide range, and depending on what stage you are in your life - whether you're an athlete or a vegan, whether you're a growing teen or a pregnant woman, etc. - you can modify these numbers to suit your needs.  I always recommend meeting with a registered dietician if you need some help (they don't bite, I swear)!
Each recipe in this cookbook includes a nutrition label so you can see how many calories, grams of fat, carbohydrates, protein and fiber are in each serving.  No matter what, though, there are options for everyone's nutritional preferences: sugar-free, refined sugar-free, cholesterol-free, low-calorie, low-sodium, high fiber and high protein.  These recipes might be "free" of some stuff, but they sure aren't free of flavor!
Oh, and don't you worry, the fun doesn't stop there.  Every recipe in this cookbook is all natural - no artificial sweeteners, no synthetic food dyes, no artificial food flavorings, no hydrogenated oils and no preservatives whatsoever.  That list right there is unheard of when it comes to store-bought protein bars.  Let's all make the same, scratch that, better versions of store-bought protein bars right at home.
These protein bars are perfect for both pro and novice athletes.  After an intense workout, they're the best reward for sweating like an animal, dealing with your exhausted muscles, and trying to control those damn uncontrollable jelly legs.
But that's not all.  Protein bars aren't only for the workoutaholics.
Do you have a sweet tooth?
Did you just raise your hand?  Then these protein bars are for you too.  They taste like candy bars (seriously, just check out the Candy Bar Protein Bar section) but without all the excess calories, fat and sugar.  These recipes are a total godsend for the health conscious dessert lovers out there (aka, YOU).  If you occasionally crave (and when I say "occasionally," I really mean "incessantly") a big hunk of - for lack of a better word - sugar in a wrapper, make a batch of protein bars instead and you'll be happy as can be...  no guilt involved.
In all seriousness though, I wrote this cookbook because of all the Desserts with Benefits™ fans who have asked me to write one throughout the years.  This is my very first cookbook, so it's obvious to say that I was beyond nervous at first.  But with the heaping amount of support I've received along the way, the publishing experience can only be described as extraordinary.
With every comment, I am thankful.
With every email, I am touched.
With every shout-out, I am over the moon.
With every testimonial, I am eternally grateful.
With all the encouragement, my nerves POOF into thin air.
The super friendly online community that I am in inspires me more than words can ever describe.
So THANK YOU!










Pantry Staples
Nut and Seed Butters:  Nut and seed butters are used in every single recipe.  Both are full of healthy fats, fiber and essential nutrients.  While they are high in protein, they are incomplete proteins (lack essential amino acids) so they need to be paired with something else to create a complete protein, such as oats, rice, beans, etc.  Always use natural nut/seed butters without added sugar, salt and oil - the ingredient list should contain only one ingredient:  the nut/seed itself!  Slightly runny nut/seed butters are ideal for these recipes.  If you can, also buy organic and non-GMO.  If you want to make nut/seed butters at home, see Getting Started.
Nut Butters

Roasted Almond Butter
Raw Almond Butter
Roasted Cashew Butter
Raw Coconut Butter
Roasted Hazelnut Butter
Roasted Macadamia Butter
Natural Roasted Peanut Butter
Roasted Pecan Butter
Roasted Walnut Butter

Seed Butters

Toasted Pumpkin Seed Butter
Toasted Sunflower Seed Butter













The Protein Powders:
Organic Brown Rice Protein Powder
Nearly all of the recipes in this cookbook use brown rice protein powder because it is hypoallergenic (gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free), vegan, and a complete protein.  I use SunWarrior® Classic Protein (in both Vanilla and Chocolate).  I like this protein powder because it gives the protein bars a smooth and fudgy texture and provides a really good flavor, all while being non-GMO and sugar-free.
Brown rice protein powder is often the main dry ingredient and cannot be omitted.  It might be possible to substitute it with other vegan protein powders (such as hemp, pea or soy), but every brand is different so I can't vouch for any other powders.  All I know is that whey, casein, and egg white protein powder will not work in place of the brown rice protein.  You will get a sticky, gooey mess on your hands.  Delicious sticky gooeyness, but difficult to make and impossible to slice.
Organic Grass-Fed Whey Protein Powder
One recipe in this cookbook uses whey protein powder because it is widely available and it is perfect for people who aren't vegan or allergic to dairy.  I use Reserveage® (in vanilla) because it is organic, non-GMO and sugar-free.












The Flours:
Almond Flour
Almond flour is just ground up unblanched almonds.  I use Now Foods® almond flour.
Coconut Flour
Coconut flour is ground up dried coconut.  I use Nutiva® because it's gluten-free, organic, non-GMO and inexpensive (from Costco!).  It has a mild sweet, coconut flavor.  Coconut flour is difficult to replace because it provides a specific texture and absorbs so much liquid.
Oat Flour
Oat flour is simply ground up oats.  I use Bob's Red Mill® certified gluten-free oat flour because it's whole grain, finely ground, easy to use, has a great flavor and is safe for people with celiac disease.  Oat flour is difficult to replace in these protein bars recipes because it absorbs moisture and binds the mixture, allowing the protein bars to firm up nicely in the fridge and not fall apart when you slice and hold them.
Peanut Flour
Peanut flour is a defatted flour made from ground peanuts.  I use Protein Plus® roasted all-natural peanut flour, which is high-protein, reduced-fat and gluten-free.  Peanut flour is difficult to replace because it absorbs moisture, binds the mixture, provides extra peanut flavor and a punch of protein.
¼ cup of peanut flour has 110 calories, 4g fat, 8g carbs, 4g fiber and 16g protein.
¼ cup of peanuts has 170 calories, 14g fat, 5g carbs, 2g fiber and 7g protein.












Chocolate:  Chocolate...  CHOCOLATE...  CHOOOOCCCOLLAAATTEEE!!  Yes.  You will need chocolate to make some (ehem, a lot) of the recipes.  This is what you'll need:

Organic Milk Chocolate (I use Green & Black's®)
Organic Milk Chocolate with Salted Almonds (I use Theo®)
Organic White Chocolate (I use Green & Black's®)
Bittersweet Chocolate (70% cacao, I use Guittard®)
Dark Chocolate with Almonds (73% cacao, I use Trader Joe's®)
Mini Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips (I use Enjoy Life®)
Cacao Nibs
Unsweetened Natural Cocoa Powder
Unsweetened Dutch Processed Cocoa Powder

Do you want to use sugar-free chocolate instead?
I like Lily's® and Coco Polo® sugar-free chocolate because they are both all-natural and non-GMO.  Lily's® is fair-trade too!
  












Flavorings:  Always use natural flavors.  If available, use organic too!
Natural Flavors

Almond Extract (I use Simply Organic®)
Banana Flavor (I use Bakto Flavors®)
Blueberry Flavor (I use Bakto Flavors®)
Butter Flavor (I use LorAnn Oils® or Silver Cloud Estates®...  I buy whichever is cheapest)

Note:  LorAnn Oils® sells a similar flavoring, the Butter Vanilla Bakery Emulsion, which contains hydrogenated oils!  Only buy the Butter Emulsion, which is all-natural, trans fat-free, sugar-free, gluten-free and vegan

Butterscotch Flavor (I use Frontier Co-Op®)
Cherry Flavor (I use Bakto Flavors®)
Mint Flavor (I use Frontier Co-Op®)
Raspberry Flavor (I use Bakto Flavors®)
Strawberry Flavor (I use Bakto Flavors®)
Vanilla Extract, Pure (I use homemade but you can use Nielsen Massey® too)
Vanilla Bean Paste (I use homemade but you can use Nielsen Massey® too)

Spices and Other Strong Flavors

Ground Cinnamon and Ground Nutmeg
Instant Coffee Granules (you can use decaf if you want)
Brewed Espresso (you can use decaf if you want)
Salt (sometimes I use Pink Himalayan Salt instead)
Flaked Sea Salt
Rum (yes, rum)
Alcohol-Free Liquid Chlorophyll Concentrate (I use ChlorOxygen®)
Matcha Green Tea Powder
Original Amazing Grass® Amazing Meal® Powder













Ingredients for Frostings, Coatings, Toppings and Bases:  Protein bars are great and all, but they're so much better with some fun little extras.  Like a nice chocolate shell.  Or maybe even a chocolate Greek yogurt frosting.  Oh, and some sprinkles too!
Plain, Nonfat Greek Yogurt
Always buy plain, unsweetened yogurt to avoid the added sugar, food dyes and other additives.  Get organic to avoid the added hormones, antibiotics, steroids, etc.  You'll need this for the Death By Chocolate Protein Bars.
Organic Neufchâtel Cream Cheese
If you can't find Neufchâtel, just use ⅓ Less Fat Cream Cheese (they're basically the same thing).  You'll need this for the Birthday Cake Protein Bars and the Cinnamon Roll Protein Squares.
Mascarpone
I haven't been able to find organic Mascarpone, but I buy mine from Whole Foods Market® because I trust their products more than the typical grocery store products.  You'll need this for the Tiramisù Protein Bars.
Organic Coconut Oil
Unrefined coconut oil has a strong coconut flavor while refined coconut oil is neutral.  Choose whichever kind you want, just make sure it's non-hydrogenated!
Roasted Almonds, Peanuts, Pecans, Pumpkin Seeds and Hulled Sunflower Seeds
Organic Caramel Sauce
I use Date Lady® Organic Caramel Sauce because it contains no added sugar (it's made from dates)!  Another brand I like is Hot Cakes®.  You can also make Caramel Sauce at home!
100% Fruit Spread (no sugar added)
I use St. Dalfour® or Nature's Hollow in strawberry, but you can use whatever flavor you want!  You'll need this for the Peanut Butter & Jelly Protein Bars.
Natural Red Food Coloring
I use Natures Flavors®/Seelect Tea®.  A more widely available (yet more expensive) brand you could use is India Tree®.
Psyllium Husk Powder
I use Now Foods® psyllium husk powder.  Be sure to use the powder and not the whole psyllium husks.
Organic Ground Flaxseed Meal
I use Bob's Red Mill® whole ground flaxseed meal.  You'll need this for the Protein Powder-Free Protein Bars.
Natural Rainbow Sprinkles
I use India Tree® natural rainbow sprinkles.  You'll need this for the Birthday Cake Protein Bars.
Reduced Fat Unsweetened Shredded Coconut
I use Let's Do...Organic® shredded coconut because it's organic and contains no added sugar.
Fully Cooked, All-Natural Bacon Bits
I buy bacon bits from Whole Foods Market® because I haven't been able to find a natural version at regular grocery stores.  If you don't eat meat, you can try Frontier Co-Op® Bac'Uns® (bacon-less bits) instead!  You'll need this for The Elvis Protein Bars.
Graham Crackers
I use S'moreables® (gluten-free) in these recipes because one of my taste testers has celiac disease.  For a non-gluten-free option, use Back To Nature® Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers because they're whole grain.
Pretzel Sticks
I use Mary's Gone Crackers® sea-salt pretzel sticks (gluten-free) because they're organic and whole grain.  You'll need this for the Healthy Chubby Hubby Protein Bars and the Let's Race Protein Bars.
All-Natural Vanilla Marshmallows
I use Elyon® natural vanilla marshmallows.  For vegan marshmallows, use Dandies®.  You'll need this for the S'mores Protein Bars.
Garbanzo Beans/Chickpeas
I use canned chickpeas because, to be honest, cooking them takes way too long.  Use unsalted chickpeas if you can find it!  You'll need this for the Protein Powder-Free Protein Bars.
Organic Crispy Brown Rice Cereal
I use Erewhon® because it's organic, gluten-free and whole-grain.  You'll need this for the Scotcheroo Protein Bars.
Quick-Cooking Oats
I use Bob's Red Mill® certified gluten-free quick-cooking oats.  You'll need this for the Protein Powder-Free Protein Bars and the Blueberry Muffin Protein Bars.
Quinoa Flakes
I use Ancient Harvest® quinoa flakes.  You'll need this for the Orange Cranberry Quinoa Protein Bars and the Caramel Apple Protein Bars.












Fruits and Vegetables:  Fruits and vegetables are used in quite a few recipes.  They provide natural sweetness (without having to add sugar), along with some fiber, vitamins and minerals. Always seek organic and non-GMO fruits and veggies with no added sugar.
Fresh

Beets
Carrots
Lemons
Oranges
Baby Spinach

Dried

Dried Unsweetened Blueberries
Dried Unsweetened Cranberries
Unsweetened Raisins

Freeze-Dried

Freeze-Dried Bananas
Freeze-Dried Cherries
Freeze-Dried Raspberries
Freeze-Dried Strawberries













Non-Dairy Milks:  I have nothing against dairy milk as long as it's organic, but I prefer to use non-dairy milks in these protein bar recipes because they have a longer shelf-life and won't spoil at room temperature.
Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk
I use Silk® unsweetened vanilla almond milk (30 calories per cup).  You can find it in the refrigerated section.  I find that it has the best taste and creamiest texture, and I also like how it's non-GMO.
Unsweetened Vanilla Coconut Milk
I'm not a huge fan of coconut milk as I prefer the flavor of almond milk, although I must admit it's suuuper creamy.  Hence, I don't have a favorite brand.  My sister buys coconut milk all the time from Trader Joe's® so I just stole a few cartons from her apartment to make these recipes...  I have a feeling she won't be reading this (she's the kind of person who skips right to the recipe without reading the instructions) so please don't tell her...  shhhh!
Unsweetened Vanilla Soy, Cashew, Hemp and Rice Milk should work just fine too!
If using soymilk, always buy organic and non-GMO.  Never conventional...  ever.












Sweeteners:
Liquid Stevia Extract
Stevia is an all-natural, calorie-free, sugar-free sweetener (derived from the Stevia rebaudiana herb) that does not affect blood glucose levels.  It's 300x sweeter than sugar, so it's really easy to use too much, causing the dish you're making to taste bitter.  I use SweetLeaf® because it tastes great and it's organic.  In this book, I use the following flavors:

Stevia Clear/Plain
Vanilla Crème
Coconut
English Toffee

Another brand I sometimes use is NuNaturals®.  Always use alcohol-free stevia.
Pure Maple Syrup
Never use the artificial stuff - it's just high-fructose corn syrup blended with artificial flavors, dyes, preservatives, and all that sorta crappy crap crapola!  Pure maple syrup is smooth, luxurious and packed with flavor (and nutrients)!










Essential Kitchen Tools
Kitchen Weigh Scale (a must must must!)
I make every single recipe using a kitchen scale.  In my kitchen, a scale is more important than measuring cups.  In the recipes, I start off each ingredient by weight, and then in parentheses, the estimated equivalent in volume.  Weighing your ingredients is much more accurate than measuring ingredients with measuring cups.  1 cup of Oat Flour will weigh about 120g sifted, or 180g packed...  that is a huge difference that will lead to an even bigger difference in taste, texture and appearance.  So stick with the scale!
I use my Escali® Arti Glass Kitchen Scale.
Electric Stand Mixer with Beater Attachment (or super buff biceps)
Nearly every recipe in this cookbook uses an electric stand mixer.  It mixes the dough thoroughly, quickly and easily.  You can certainly do without the stand mixer and mix everything by hand, but just know that going that route will take 5x as long (and about 10x more patience).
I use my KitchenAid® Artisan® Series 5-Quart Tilt-Head Stand Mixer.
Small Food Processor
You'll need this to blend certain ingredients (like freeze-dried fruit), and if you make your own oat flour from rolled oats (certified gluten-free if necessary).  I just buy my oat flour because it's finely ground, it's easy to use, it has great flavor and it is safe for people with celiac disease.
I use my Cuisinart® Mini-Prep® Plus Food Processor.
Mixing Bowls
Have small-, medium- and large-sized bowls.
Measuring Spoons
Have ⅛ tsp, ¼ tsp, ½ tsp, ¾ tsp, 1 tsp and 1 tbs.
Measuring Cups
Have ¼ cup, ⅓ cup, ½ cup and 1 cup.
Spoons, Forks and a Sharp 9-10" Knife
2½" or 2¾" Circle Cookie Cutter
You'll need cookie cutters for the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Protein Cookies and the White Chocolate Macadamia Cookie Protein Cookies.
Fine-Mesh Sieve
Wire Whisks and Silicone Spatulas 
8x8" and 9x9" Square Brownie Pans
Jelly Roll Pan with a Fitting Silicone Baking Mat
I use a 13x18" jelly roll pan and 11⅝"x16½" Silpat®.
Pastry Roller
This flattens the protein bars very evenly.  I use a double-sided marble pastry roller.
Microplane and Grater
To zest oranges and lemons and to grate carrots.
Piping Bag with Round Tip (#804)
Cake Pedestal and Cake Dome
You'll need this to store protein bars with frostings since you can't wrap those in sandwich baggies.
Plastic Wrap and Plastic Sandwich Baggies
Double Boiler
You'll need this to melt chocolate...  lots and lots of lovely chocolate!  I use my Farberware® 2-Quart Covered Double Boiler.  It's perfect for all types of chocolate - white chocolate, milk chocolate and dark chocolate!
Pre-Cut Parchment Baking Sheets (12½x16")
I use If You Care® compostable, unbleached, chlorine-free parchment baking paper.










Getting Started
Ingredient Cost
Are you ready for a surprise?  Seriously, you ready?
Okay, I'll shut up.  Despite the (seemingly) expensive ingredients used throughout this cookbook, homemade protein bars are actually less expensive than store-bought protein bars.  All you need to do is shop around (most often online) for the best prices, find some coupons, use a discount code, and then say "KA-CHING!"  It also helps to make your nut and seed butters at home.  Just go to www.DessertsWithBenefits.com and find the "Pecan Butter" recipe - the process of making your own nut/seed butter is really the same for all nuts/seeds.  Just swap the pecans in the recipe with whatever nut/seed you need!

Time-Saving Tip
Use a kitchen scale!  In the Essential Kitchen Tools section, I talk about how I use a kitchen scale to make all of my recipes.  A scale helps you measure the ingredients properly so you get the same final product every time you make a recipe.  Although, accuracy isn't a scale's only purpose.  Using a scale allows you to make accurate nutrition labels (or simply calculate the correct number of calories, fat, carbs, protein, etc.).  You also use less cooking materials, from mixing bowls to utensils to measuring cups to measuring spoons.  Less dishes to wash?  Yes, please.  Because that gives us more time to eat.












How To Melt Chocolate and Coat Your Protein Bars With It:
1.  Fill the bottom portion of the double boiler with 2-3" of water.  Make sure the water doesn't touch the bottom of the double boiler insert!  Place the double boiler over medium heat.
2.  While the water is heating up, break the chocolate into chunks and place inside the double boiler insert.  When the water starts to simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low.
3.  Stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted and completely smooth.
  
4.  Place a silicone baking mat on top of a jelly roll pan and line the protein bars on top.
  
5.  With a large spoon (I use a tablespoon measuring spoon), ladle the chocolate over the protein bars.  Try to encase the entire protein bar with chocolate, but it doesn't have to be perfect.
  
6.  Refrigerate until firm (~1 hour).  Individually wrap the protein bars in plastic sandwich baggies and refrigerate to store.
Buuut they're really good right now.  So you should totally snack on them.  Right now.  Ehem...












How To Line Your Brownie Pan:
1.  Cut your parchment paper into long strips so that it fits nicely inside your pan.  The majority of the recipes in this cookbook call for an 8x8" brownie pan, so you'll need to cut the parchment paper into strips slightly thinner than the size of the pan - about 7½" (if you are using the same pre-cut sheets that I use, simply fold the paper in half widthwise and cut about 1" off the creased side.
  
2.  Place the paper inside the pan, leaving the overhang for easy removal later on.  Feel free to use mini binder clips on the sides of the pan to keep the paper in place.  This makes it easier to spread and flatten the protein dough inside the pan.
  












How To Make Picture-Perfect Protein Bars:
Complete steps 1 and 2 on the previous page, then proceed with the following steps:
3.  Make the protein bar recipe and scoop the mixture into the pan.
  
4.  Use a silicone spatula to press down on the mixture and spread it to the edges of the pan (pictured on the left).  If you want perfectly even protein bars, use a pastry roller after the spatula (pictured on the right).
  
5.  Fold one side of the parchment paper overhang over the flattened protein bars and use your finger to round out the edges.  Run your finger along the edge until it's smooth.  Do this on all four sides.
  
6.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
7.  The next day, remove the protein bars from the pan.  Using a sharp 9-10" knife, slice the mixture down the center and rotate.  To slice into 10 bars, each protein bar should be around 1½".  To slice into 12 bars, slice the mixture down the center again to make a "+" sign, then slice each square into three long, thin bars.
  












Protein Bar Storage Tips
All protein bars keep for ~1 week in the fridge and can also be frozen for up to 3-4 months.  To freeze, place the protein bars in plastic sandwich baggies, seal tightly, and place in the freezer door.  If you want to freeze bars that have frosting, like the Birthday Cake Protein Bars, put the bars on a sheet of parchment paper on top of a plate, then place in the freezer uncovered for 2 hours.  Place the frozen solid bars in sandwich baggies.  To thaw, simply leave the frozen protein bars in the fridge overnight, or, leave at room temperature for ~2 hours.












You're Finally About to Make a Recipe!  But Before You Do, Read This:
Just as a precaution, always read through the entire recipe once or twice from start to finish before diving in and making some protein bars.  Cooking on the fly can lead to some serious kitchen fails (trust me, I've come across every hitch imaginable by cooking without reading the instructions first).
*rolls eyes*
But I've learned my lesson.  I've learned to avoid substituting and omitting ingredients because 99% of the time, it will not work.  You will be sad.  So sad.  The recipes here are tried and true so we can love them the way they are.
Brown rice protein powder is the main dry ingredient and cannot be omitted.  It might be possible to substitute it with other vegan protein powders (such as hemp, pea or soy), but every brand is different so I can't vouch for any other types of powders.  All I know is that whey protein powder, casein protein powder and egg white protein powder will not replace the brown rice protein powder.
Good news!  There is one exception to this rule.  The liquid stevia extract used in these recipes can be replaced with all-natural packeted sweeteners, such as organic stevia, Truvia®, Stevia in the Raw®, etc.  Check out the www.DessertsWithBenefits.com FAQ page for a Sweetener Conversion Chart!

*Using canned or prepackaged cooked beets will not provide the same vibrant red color as using freshly roasted beets...  the bars will turn out brown (yes, I tried it).  For the best results, use freshly roasted beet puree!
For the Roasted Beet Puree:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Rinse and gently scrub two fist-sized beets, then wrap them completely in foil.  Place the beets in a 9x9" brownie pan and bake for ~1½ hours, or until a fork pierces through the beets with ease.
Remove the beets from the oven, carefully unwrap the foil and let sit until it's cool enough to handle.  Use a knife to scrape off the beet skins (they will fall off easily).
Chop the beets into chunks and place in a food processor.  Puree until completely smooth.
For the Protein Bars:
Line an 8x8" brownie pan with parchment paper.  Set aside.
In an electric stand mixer bowl fitted with a beater attachment, add the beet puree, almond butter, almond milk, butter flavor and stevia extract.  Mix on low speed while you prepare the dry ingredients.
In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the protein powder, oat flour and salt.  Turn off the stand mixer and dump in the dry ingredients.  Return mixer to low speed and mix until the dry ingredients are fully incorporated.  Scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary.  Mixture should be thick and fudgy, like cookie dough.
Scoop the mixture into the prepared brownie pan and flatten it out.  Tightly cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
Lift the mixture out of the pan.  Slice into 10 bars.
Place a silicone baking mat on top of a jelly roll pan and line the protein bars on top.
For the Chocolate Coating:
With a large spoon, ladle the melted chocolate over the protein bars.  Try to encase the entire protein bar with chocolate, but it doesn't have to be perfect.
Refrigerate until firm (~1 hour).  Individually wrap the protein bars in plastic sandwich baggies and refrigerate to store (keeps for ~1 week).
Yield:  10 Protein Bars

So, What is German Chocolate Cake Anyways?
German Chocolate Cake is a chocolate layer cake with a caramel-coconut-pecan filling and topping.  It's a super sweet, rich, decadent, and heavy cake.
I'm sure you guessed it - it's packed with cups and cups of sugar, (a little too many) sticks of butter, and thousands of calories.  PER slice.
Quite the opposite of these DIY protein bars!  These (healthified) German Chocolate Cake Protein Bars are full of healthy fats, complex carbohydrates, a kick of fiber and a punch of protein.  These bars surely won't weigh you down!

Fun Protein Fact:  Peanut butter, almond butter, oats, garbanzo beans!
They are all high in protein, but they are incomplete proteins.  This means that they don't contain all the essential amino acids necessary for muscle growth, repair and maintenance.  These foods need to be paired with complementary proteins - proteins that contain those missing amino acids.
For example, in this Birthday Cake Protein Bar recipe, you will get a complete, high-quality protein because the almond butter and oat flour "complement" each other.  Together, they contain the essential amino acids you need!
(Go ahead, pile on those sprinkles...  hehe)
