Abstract
The prolific growth of sensors and sensor technologies has an increasingly dramatic impact in our daily life. Portable microsensors and wireless links have brought security, reliability, and even harmony with our environment. The emerging field of smart sensors and wireless sensor networks is the best example for wide popularity of sensors in the recent years.




1.1 Sensor Basics
The prolific growth of sensors and sensor technologies has an increasingly dramatic impact in our daily life. Portable microsensors and wireless links have brought security, reliability, and even harmony with our environment. The emerging field of smart sensors and wireless sensor networks is the best example for wide popularity of sensors in the recent years.
A sensor is basically a device that receives a signal or stimulus and responds to it in a distinctive manner, thus converting any physical or biological quantity into any measurable output signal. In our physical world, there are mainly six kinds of signals, which are of interest to the sensor community: electrical, mechanical, thermal, chemical, magnetic, and radiation. If the sensor output signal is electrical in nature, it can be further processed by signal processing electronics for various applications. Any device that can convert one kind of signal to another is called a transducer. Hence, in a common sense, it comes to our mind that sensor is basically a transducer, although it may not be always true. Typically, a transducer implies that the input and the output are not the same type of signals. On the other hand, a sensor may acquire signals that are not perceivable by human senses, or the input and the output signals of the sensor may be of the same kind. The desirable features of any generic sensors are
(a)Sensitivity, (b)Selectivity, (c)Response time, and (d)Operating life. 


Sensitivity - this represents the detection capability with respect to the sample concentration or amount. A highly sensitive sensor means it can sense the very low level of changes. Sensitivity is related with the noise performance of the sensors to and the inherent noise floor sets the theoretical limit beyond which the sensing element cannot recognize any more appreciable changes.

Selectivity - this is the ability of any sensor to detect any desirable physical quantity among a variety of other nondesirable quantities. Most physical and chemical sensors operate in complex environments, where various parameters change simultaneously. Some sensors may have very high sensitivity in a pure sample environment but may work poorly with other samples.

Response Time - this feature indicates how fast a sensor can react to the changes and generate electrical quantity depending upon the environmental changes.

Operating Life - this is total lifetime of the sensor as measured by the repeatability of the measurement data within a specific threshold set by the application.


1.2 Sensor Types
There are a variety of classifications in the sensor world. A sensor may be classified depending upon the power supply requirement and types of output signals.

1.2.1 Power Supply Requirement
Depending on the power supply requirement, a sensor may be classified as - an active sensor or a passive sensor.

Active Sensor - if a sensor needs external power supply to generate the output signal, it is called an active sensor. An active sensor has a big advantage that the sensitivity of the device can be modified by controlling the power supply voltage, obviously at the expense of additional power dissipation.

Passive Sensor - if the sensor output signal is generated from the sensor input signal or because of the changes of the sensing element, it is called a passive sensor. Thermocouple is an example of a passive sensor.


1.2.2 Types of Output Signal
A sensor output signal type may be analog or digital. Therefore, based on the type of the output signal, sensors can be classified as - an analog sensor or a digital sensor.

Analog Sensor - the output changes in a continuous way, and the information is usually embedded in the amplitude of the output signal. This type of sensor requires analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to process the signal in digital domain either for transmission or for display.

Digital Sensor - the output changes in discrete steps. The digital sensors are more accurate and reliable than the analog sensor. However, they are not capable of measuring any physical quantity directly.



1.3 Measurement Systems
Most of the measuring equipments in our everyday life depend upon electrical signal, and hence rely on sensors. Electronic measurement systems provide greater flexibility and ease of operation. This is due to the fact that
(a)Sensors can be designed for any physical or biological entity, (b)Sensor performance can be enhanced by the incorporation of electronic signal processing, (c)A variety of microelectronic circuits are available for signal conditioning, (d)Various display options exist for electronic signals, and (e)Wireless communication is a versatile means of communication for electrical signals. 

A simple functional block diagram of a sensor network is shown in Fig. 1.1. The sensor unit manifests various types of sensors (i.e., pressure, temperature, humidity, air flow, etc.) to monitor various parameters of the environment or of our household appliances. The sensor unit then sends the signal to a signal conditioning block, where any changes of sensor signals is processed and manipulated to make it displayable in the monitoring unit. Sometimes, the signal conditioning unit maintains a temporary data storage or RAM to process the signal. The monitoring unit displays the pattern of changes and occasionally stores the data in a permanent database for future purpose. For routine check or for any abnormality sensed in the monitoring unit, communication is established between the monitoring unit and the application area, and alarm signal is deployed.Fig. 1.1Functional block diagram of sensor network



1.4 Applications

1.4.1 Health Care
Wearable sensors and health monitoring units allow huge volume of data to be collected and monitored in real time for next generation healthcare facilities. Data collected from various sensor units are further processed and diagnosed to reduce the inconvenience of regular visits to the heathcare provider [1]. This leads to the development of smart home care system facilitating both elderly and distant patients.
In smart home care system, various types of sensors can be implanted or placed within the vicinity of a human body. These sensor units can closely monitor various physiological changes and send the data to a nearby hub station such as "cell phone" or "PDA." Then, using existing communication technologies, these data can be sent to a physician, nurse, or healthcare provider. The physicians can diagnose the data and initiate the necessary actions such as sending control signal for artificial dose control unit implanted into the body of the patient. This can facilitate the patients with telecare, which is a real-time inspection and removal of cognitive burden from some of the age-related memory declined issues. Smart home care can also facilitate other everyday activities, for example, control of medical devices, medicine reminder, object location, or emergency communication [2]. In this system, patient's privacy and convenience can be greatly supported and enhanced because of the serving of the patient in his/her own home.


1.4.2 Environmental Monitoring
Various types of pathogens and contaminants are being released every day from different sources, such as vehicle emissions, power plants, refineries, industrial and laboratory processes, which need to be monitored to protect the public health as well as the environment from unwanted contamination. Incidental releases of other contaminants can originate from spills, leaking pipes, or from underground storage tanks. Some of these contaminants migrate through large regions of soil until they reach water resources and may eventually cause a potential threat to human health [3]. In the following paragraphs, some of the sensors used for environmental monitoring are discussed.

1.4.2.1 Nanoelectrode Array
Nanoelectrode arrays are used to detect dissolved metals [4, 5]. One of the exciting features of these nanoelectrode arrays is that extreme miniaturization is possible (Approximately 1 million individual electrodes on a 1 sq in. substrate). Upon application of an electric potential, the nanoelectrodes generate current or voltage signals depending upon the target analyte. Incorporation of a reference electrode with the sensing electrode provides stability and reliable operation of the nanoelectrode based sensors.


1.4.2.2 Thermoluminescent Dosimeter
A thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) is a crystal that absorbs energy from radiological exposure. Commonly used crystals are calcium fluoridemanganese, and lithium fluoride [6, 7]. The absorbed energy in the crystal is released in the form of light. Therefore, a TLD reader usually incorporates a photodetector for the radiation dose reading.


1.4.2.3 Chemical Flow Probe Sensor
Spectrally distinct products are generated whenever certain analytes react with a reagent. Using this phenomenon, the chemical flow probe is designed to detect organic analytes diffused through a semi-permeable membrane [8]. This sensor is used to measure volatile organic compounds, such as chlorinated halocarbons or dissolved metals (copper).


1.4.2.4 SAW Chemical Sensor Arrays
Surface acoustic wave sensor works is based on the resonant condition that is related to trace mass loading on the active surface [9]. Often, special coatings or polymers are used to enhance mass absorption/adsorption, and they provide a greater degree of chemical class selectivity.


1.4.2.5 Chemiresistor Array
The chemically sensitive resistor or chemresistor consists of a conductive polymer film deposited on a micro-fabricated circuit [10]. When chemical vapors come into contact with the polymers, the electrical property (e.g., resistance) of the polymer changes which can be monitored using a simple circuitry such as an ohmmeter for resistance measurement.


1.4.2.6 Bio-SAW Sensor
Bio-SAW sensor is basically a surface acoustic wave sensor, wherein biological detection is accomplished by applying specific antibody coatings to the active surface. Different coatings on different active surfaces provide versatility of detecting a wide range of biological threats [11].




1.5 Emerging Sensors and Sensor Technologies
The widespread applications of sensors in various fields have expedited research and development of various sensors and sensor technologies. Sensors usually operate in an environment where multiple parameters change simultaneously. Therefore selectivity, sensitivity, and degree of linearity are the desirable features of any sensor. Advanced sensors require ultra-pure materials and ultra clean manufacturing combined with integrated electronic devices. Sometimes, the sensor unit incorporates artificial intelligence, and they greatly impact manufacturing, avionics, optics, space satellites, biotechnology, and more. There are numerous types of advanced sensors. Here, only three types of sensors that are widely used for environmental, industrial, and healthcare monitoring applications will be discussed.

1.5.1 Electrochemical Sensors
The oldest electrochemical sensors date back to 1950s and were used for oxygen monitoring. The physical size, geometry, selection of various components, and the construction of an electrochemical sensor usually depend on its intended use [12].
Electrochemical sensors operate by reacting with the liquid or gas of interest and producing an electrical signal proportional to the sample concentration. A typical electrochemical sensor manifests three parts:
(a)Sensing electrode or working electrode (b)Counter electrode, and (c)Reference electrode 

Figure 1.2 shows the setup of a typical electrochemical gas sensor. Gas that comes in contact with the sensor first passes through a small capillary-type opening and then diffuses through a hydrophobic membrane, and eventually reaches the electrode surface. This approach is adopted to allow proper amount of gas to react at the sensing electrode to produce an appreciable electrical signal, while preventing the electrolyte from leaking out of the sensor.Fig. 1.2Typical electrochemical gas sensor

The gas that diffuses through the barrier reacts at the surface of the sensing electrode involving either an oxidation or a reduction mechanism. These reactions are catalyzed by materials specifically developed for the gas of interest. With a resistor connected across the electrodes, a current proportional to the gas concentration flows between the anode and the cathode. The current can be measured to determine the gas concentration. Because of the current generation from this type of sensor, the electrochemical sensor is often described as an amperometric sensor or a micro fuel cell.
Table 1.1 shows the specifications of a typical toxic gas sensor [12]. Electrochemical sensors typically consist of three electrodes. For a 3-electrode sensor, an external driving voltage is required, whereas a 2-electrode sensor can generate a current without the need of any external voltage. But, it must be emphasized that the 3-electrode sensor has better sensitivity compared to its 2-electrode counterpart.Table 1.1Specifications of typical toxic gas sensorSensor type2 or 3 electrodes; mostly 3 electrodesRange2-10 times permissible exposure limitTemperature range−40 to 45°CRelative humidity15-95% noncondensingResponse timeT
80
<50 sLife expectancy12-24 months normalLong term driftDrift down 2% per month

For sensing requirement, the potential at the sensing electrode needs to be maintained at a constant level. But in practice, this potential varies because of the continual reaction taking place at the surface of the sensing electrode and, as a consequence, degrades the sensor performance. To improve the sensor performance, usually a reference electrode is placed in between the sensing electrode and the collection electrode. A stable fixed voltage is applied to both the sensing and the reference electrodes, and the potential between the electrodes is carefully maintained. The gas molecules only react at the sensing electrode and a current flow in between the sensing and the collection electrodes. No external current is associated with the reference electrode. The sensor current is extracted from the collection electrode and is interpreted as the current changes with sample concentration. Table 1.2 depicts the typical gases and the ranges of measurement of an electrochemical sensor.Table 1.2Typical gases and range of measurementGas namePPM rangeAmmonia, NH3

There is another type of electrochemical gas sensor that uses solid-state galvanic cells to monitor partial pressure of gases such as CO2, NOx, SOx, and hydrocarbons in gas mixture. This type of sensor generates an electromotive force (EMF) as a function of chemical modifications of the cathode in the presence of the gas. Figure 1.3 shows the block diagram of a solid-state galvanic cell-based electrochemical sensor.Fig. 1.3Block diagram of Galvanic cell-based electrochemical sensor

A galvanic cell-based sensor as shown in Fig. 1.3 usually has the following electrode arrangement [13].
At the top of the sensor, chemically inert platinum (Pt) conducting probe is used to measure the potential at the surface of the sensing electrode (Na) because of the interaction of gas molecules with the sensing conductor. Beneath the sensing electrode, there is a solid-state ionic or fast ionic conductor (Nasicon) that generates another potential at the interface of fast ionic conductor and the reference electrode (NaNO3). The difference of these two potentials gives a measure of detected gas molecules. The structure of a solid electrolyte-based sensor can be expressed in the following way, in which the material names separated by solid bar (|) represents different layers of the sensor.
Pt | gas sensitive film | ionic conductor | reference electrode | Pt electrode

To measure the EMF and the partial pressure of NO2, a galvanic cell of following type is used.


The associated reaction and the relation between the EMF and the partial pressure of NO2 are given by the following equations,
(1.1)
(1.2)
where G is the Gibbs energy, P is the partial pressure, k is the Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature.


1.5.2 Electromechanical Sensors
The microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have been explored extensively during the past three decades. Since the early days of microelectronics, silicon technology has been extensively studied to transduce mechanical, chemical, optical, and thermal events into electronic signals. Figure 1.4 summarizes one view of this evolution in the United States [14]; the reader is also referred to the excellent history of sensor evolution written by Middelhoek [15]. During the 1950s and early 1960s, Westinghouse, Honeywell, and Bell Telephone Laboratories performed the pioneering roles to study the piezoresistive and etching properties of silicon. Based on this, the emergence of planar integrated circuits along with the first selectively etched silicon sensors was possible in 1960s. By the end of the 1960s, diaphragms, cantilevers, valves, heaters, fluidic channels, and other structures were being developed in silicon technology. In 1970s the sensor-specific technology was further evolved, and the first attempts at using these technologies in high-volume applications began. In the 1980s, surface micromachining was developed, where silicon dioxide is used as a sacrificial layer material [16]. Using this process, several devices were fabricated such as electrostatically actuated motors [17, 18], interdigitated capacitive sensors, and resonators [19]. By the end of 1990s, many commercially successful MEMS products such as digital light processor (DLP) from Texas Instruments, ink jet printer nozzles from Hewlett Packard, and solid-state accelerometers for air bag deployment from Analog Devices and Motorola (now Freescale) were available in the market.Fig. 1.4Evolution of sensor technologies in United States [14]

Fabrication of MEMS devices is strongly related to the semiconductor device industry. Polycrystalline silicon is the predominant substrate for the MEMS devices realized in silicon. Therefore, often MEMS devices are made in cleanrooms similar to the ones used for fabrication of microelectronic devices. Photolithography is used to define both the transistors and the MEMS devices. To necessitate of functional behavior of MEMS devices and to incorporate three-dimensional features, such as cavities through wafer holes, flaps, suspended beams and membranes, new ideas of microfabrication are evolving in MEMS industry, such as deep reactive ion etching, photodefinable SU-8 epoxy [20], and self-assembly [21]. In recent years, compound semiconductors such as diamond and ceramics are investigated to their potential applications in MEMS devices.
In the twenty-first century, the integration of sensors with micropower integrated circuits and wireless telemetry has become one of the main focuses in microelectronics industry. Implantable medical devices and integrated microsystems for healthcare applications have generated tremendous interest among the scientists and researchers. An advanced cochlear prosthesis has been developed as shown in Fig. 1.5 [22]. It consists of 32 stimulating sites with sensors for wall contact and bending shape. Hybrid integration of circuitry on the rear of the array interfaces the electrodes with a hermetically sealed electronics package over an eight-lead polymeric cable. The embedded microprocessor in the package generates a pulse pattern and uses wireless telemetry to transmit the recorded information to the outside world. An inductive link is used to send both power and the data to the microsystem [23]. It is expected that this type of cochlear implants will push the limit to their highest potential.Fig. 1.5A high-density cochlear microsystem for the hearing impaired. The lower picture shows the tip of one of the electrode arrays containing piezoresistive sensors for wall contact and probe position [22]

Figure 1.6 shows a cortical prosthesis for possible use in patients with paralysis [24]. This system manifests an electrode array, a polymeric cable, and a sealed subcutaneous electronics package. Here, the electrodes enter into the motor cortex of the brain to capture neural activity and send the functional neuromuscular stimulation. This kind of external stimulation may eventually restore at least limited mobility of the paralyzed patients. The signal processing unit incorporated in the system detects the neural spikes generated from the neural activity and performs noise filtering. The signal processing unit also conserves the overall system bandwidth.Fig. 1.6View of a wireless integrated cortical recording system on a U.S. penny [24]. Below photographs of the cortical implant configuration and a 16-site penetrating electrode array

In recent years, there has been a substantial improvement in the development of capacitive pressure sensors in terms of high pressure sensitivity, low temperature sensitivity, lower cost, broader dynamic range, and lower power.
The recent development of capacitive pressure sensors has led up to the 15 lb of resolution [25] and accuracy [26] and can be vacuum sealed at wafer level. Pressure sensors have long been used for cardiovascular measurements [27-30], and recently, a microsystem has been reported with capacitive pressure sensors integrated with wireless technology to allow wireless monitoring of pressure/flow sensing inside the carotid arteries (Fig. 1.7) [29]. With the development of neural probes, pressure sensors have evolved significantly and are being coupled with embedded electronics to form complete microsystems for use in healthcare, transportation, and other related applications.Fig. 1.7A wireless capacitive sensor for sensing pressure and flow in the carotid arteries [29]

The most recent improvement of MEMS technology includes the incorporation of polymer materials in device fabrication. Polymer materials, including elastomers, plastics and fibers, are being actively used for MEMS sensors and actuators. Polymer materials provide many advantages in terms of cost, mechanical properties, and ease of processing. Table 1.3 shows some of the representative polymer MEMS materials and their respective area of applications [30].Table 1.3Polymer MEMS materials and applications [30]MaterialRepresentative processing methodsApplicationsParyleneChemical vapor depositionMicro pumps and valves; pressure and shear stress sensors; micro air vehicle wings; microfluidicsPolyimideSpin coating, extrusionSensor substrates; microfluidicsAcrylicsMoldingMicrofluidics channelsPDMSMoldingMicrofluidics channels, pumps and valvesLiquid crystal polymerChemical etchingFlow sensorBiodegradable polymerMoldingDrug delivery devicesSU-8 epoxyPhoto pattering, spin castingArtificial hair cell sensorPolyurethaneMoldingStructuresNanocomposite elastomersScreen printing, moldingConductors; sensors; actuators

Polymer materials are now being widely used in several sectors of MEMS fabrication, including substrates, structural thin films, functional thin films, adhesion and packaging, coating, and surface chemical functionalization. The following are the list of polymer materials frequently used in MEMS industry:
(a)Parylene (b)Polyimide (c)Acrylics (PMMA), (d)Photopatternable epoxy, and (e)Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer 

In addition, a number of other materials are also being used, including liquid crystal polymer (LCP), liquid crystal elastomer (LCE), biodegradable polymers, functional hydrogels, paraffin, piezoelectric polymers, fluorocarbon thin films, and conductive polymers.
Biological microfluidics devices are now being extensively studied for automated lab-on-a-chip biochemical analysis [31, 32] and drug screening [33]. PDMS is widely used in the microfluidics area, where it provides optical transparency, gas permeability simple processing, elasticity, and low cost. A PDMS microfluid chip for protein analysis is shown in Fig. 1.8 [34].Fig. 1.8A microfluidic lab-on-a-chip device for protein detection [34]

Tactile sensors are immensely important for future applications in robotics, interactive electronics, telemedicine, and healthcare. Silicon has been used in tactile sensors because of its high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and ease of direct integration to signal-processing electronics, but the brittleness of silicon material still poses a potential threat to long-term mechanical reliability. Silicon material is not flexible; prohibits its usage in sensors on robotic hands or manipulators with curved surfaces. On the other hand, polymer materials are flexible, mechanically robust, and chemically resistant.
Recently, a multimodal tactile sensor using flexible polyimide substrate has been developed [35]. The sensors are capable of sensing the hardness, roughness, temperature, and thermal conductivity of the object in contact. The sensor unit consists of four elements: a thermal conductivity measurement unit, a temperature measurement unit, and two membranes with metal strain gauges for measuring surface roughness and contact force. Figure 1.9 shows the finished sensor that is able to identify objects by imitating the behavior of human sensing skin.Fig. 1.9Optical micrograph of a patch of polyimide multimodal tactile sensing skin [35]




1.6 Summary
In this chapter, the sensor fundamentals and emerging sensor technologies have been discussed. Tremendous developments in the design and fabrication of microsensors have opened up new and innovative applications of sensors in our daily lives. Nowadays sensors are used not only for industrial applications but also for environmental and healthcare applications. Incorporation of polymer materials in sensors, especially MEMS fabrication, is a giant step toward the development of biocompatible flexible sensors. It is expected that polymer material-based sensors will dominate the future sensor market. In the subsequent chapters an in-depth discussion of specific sensor technologies along with their applications will be presented.

Abstract
The introduction of the concept of integrated circuits in 1958 by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce enabled the electronics industry to achieve a phenomenal growth over the past several decades. The dimensions of semiconductor devices have been continuously shrinking to meet the needed requirements of high speed and low power as demanded by the circuit designers. Moore's law is a well-established rule of thumb for scaling device dimensions. Minimum feature sizes of MOSFET devices have shrunk considerably since 1970, thereby increasing the number of transistors in a single integrated circuit as illustrated in Fig. 2.1



The introduction of the concept of integrated circuits in 1958 by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce enabled the electronics industry to achieve a phenomenal growth over the past several decades. The dimensions of semiconductor devices have been continuously shrinking to meet the needed requirements of high speed and low power as demanded by the circuit designers. Moore's law is a well-established rule of thumb for scaling device dimensions. Minimum feature sizes of MOSFET devices have shrunk considerably since 1970, thereby increasing the number of transistors in a single integrated circuit as illustrated in Fig. 2.1.Fig. 2.1Exponential increases in the number of transistors integrated into Intel processors and other leading platform ingredients validating Moore's law [1]

The minimum features of an integrated circuit and its devices have been scaled down by a factor of 0.7 per technology node every 3 years since 1975 [2]. The rapid scaling of transistors has resulted in increased functionality per single chip, improvement in processing speed and memory capacity, and decrease in cost and power consumption per function.
Figure 2.2 shows the evolution of Intel microprocessor computing power in million instructions per second (MIPS) [3]. The downsides of the increased computing power and increased number of transistors per chip are the increased internal capacitances, higher number of switching events, and higher power dissipation per chip. The power dissipation of a CMOS circuit can be expressed as [4],
(2.1)
where f
clk is the clock frequency, a is the average switching activity, C
tot is the total capacitance, I
SC is the short circuit current between the rail-to-rail supply voltage, V
DD is the supply voltage, and I
leakage is the leakage current. The dynamic power is proportional to the square of the supply voltage, and the power dissipation due to the short circuit current is directly proportional to the supply voltage. In addition, the leakage current has an exponential dependence on the supply voltage. Thus, supply voltage scaling is an effective strategy for low-power circuit design. However, scaling of the supply voltage is associated with the scaling of the threshold voltage. Since the subthreshold current of a deep submicron MOS transistor depends exponentially on the threshold voltage, the leakage current increases drastically for threshold voltage below 300 mV, which effectively diminishes the benefit of device scaling. Thus, in addition to the choice of a high-end CMOS technology node, a circuit designer also needs to develop strategy for low-power circuit design techniques.Fig. 2.2Evolution of performance of Intel Microprocessors [3]

This chapter addresses silicon technology, device scaling, and future trends in device technology for low-power circuit applications, whereas various low-power circuit design techniques will be discussed in subsequent chapters.

2.1 Device Scaling
The evolution of CMOS fabrication technology MOSFETs is miniaturized to account for increased speed and circuit complexity as required by CMOS VLSI technology. The 2008 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) lists the principal categories of improvement trends in semiconductor industry as shown in Table 2.1. These trends reflect the ability of the semiconductor industry to continuously decrease the minimum feature sizes of the MOS transistors following Moore's law. But it is the rapidly decreasing cost-per-function that has led to the realization of highly complex circuits, which are the building blocks of computers, cellular phones, and others consumer and industrial electronics. Figure 2.3 shows the 2007 ITRS product technology trend (updated in 2008), which depicts the need for increasing number of transistors per chip. Table 2.2 summarizes technology nodes and intermediate year minimum feature sizes in nm according to 2007 ITRS.Table 2.1Improvement trends for ICs enabled by feature scalingTrendExampleIntegration levelComponents/chip, Moore's LawCostCost per functionSpeedMicroprocessor throughputPowerLaptop or cell phone battery lifeCompactnessSmall-and light-weight productsFunctionalityNonvolatile memory, imager

The term scaling is referred to as the reduction of the dimensions of MOSFETs in an integrated circuit. With the reduction of the device dimensions, the operational characteristics of the device change. There are two basic types of scaling strategies: constant field and constant voltage scaling. Figure 2.4 illustrates the reduction of the key dimensions of a MOSFET wherein all the dimensions are scaled down by the same scaling factor, S.Fig. 2.4Scaling of a MOSFET by the scaling parameter S > 1


2.1.1 Constant Field Scaling
This scaling strategy, also known as full scaling, preserves the same internal electric fields while all dimensions are scaled down by a factor of S. In order to achieve this, all potentials must be scaled down by the same scaling factor. The doping densities are increased by a factor of S to accommodate the relationship between the charge densities and electric field as dictated by Poisson's equation. The net result of the scaling is that the oxide capacitance is increased by the factor S, while the drain current and power dissipation are reduced by the factor S and S
2, respectively.
Constant field scaling yields a net reduction in the power-delay product of a single transistor. However, it requires a reduction in the power supply voltage with the reduction in the minimum feature sizes, which is not practical for most cases.


2.1.2 Constant Voltage Scaling
Constant voltage scaling is generally preferred over the full scaling since it provides voltage compatibility with older circuit technologies. It is particularly suitable for the high end CMOS processes with multiple power supply voltages. In constant voltage scaling method, all MOSFET dimensions are reduced by a factor of S, while the power supply and all the terminal voltages are kept unchanged. However, in order to preserve the charge-field relation, the doping densities need to be increased by a factor of S
2. The net result of the scaling is that the oxide capacitance is increased by the factor S, while the drain current and power dissipation are both reduced by the factor S.
The disadvantage of constant voltage scaling is that the electric field increases as the minimum feature length is reduced. The power density increases by a factor of S
3, while in full scaling case, it remains virtually unchanged. The large increase in current and power densities may lead to velocity saturation, electromigration, hot carrier degradation, mobility degradation, increased leakage currents, and lower breakdown voltages. Table 2.3 compares the constant field and constant voltage scaling of MOSFET device parameters.Table 2.3Comparison of the effect of scaling on MOSFET device parametersParameterSymbolConstant field scalingConstant voltage scalingGate length

As the device dimensions are reduced, various physical limitations, such as internal electric field, become very prominent which restricts further scaling. Although constant electric field scaling is more practical, the idea of reducing voltage in proportion to reduced dimensions has not been popular due to the substantial increase in electric field. A generalized scaling law has been reported where the electric field patterns within a scaled device are still preserved, but the intensity of the electric field can be changed everywhere within the device by a multiplicative factor ε [5]. One common technique for reducing power is to reduce the supply voltage. However, in CMOS circuits, lower supply voltage results in inferior performance. Scaling the threshold voltage can limit this performance loss somewhat. But scaling the threshold voltage of the devices down along with the applied voltage increases the standby leakage current, which limits how far it is practical to scale the power supply voltage.



2.2 Silicon-on-Insulator CMOS
Moore's law has been the primary driving factor for over the last 40 years for the enhancement of device performances by continuously scaling down the feature sizes of the devices. The competitive drive for improved performance and cost reduction has resulted in the scaling of circuit elements to smaller dimensions [3].
With the maturation of silicon technology, bulk-Si devices have emerged as the active element for very large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits. However, a number of fundamental limits, such as decreasing carrier mobility due to impurity scattering and increasing gate tunneling current as the junction becomes shallower, have slowed down the growth of performance of the bulk-Si devices. These trends make conventional scaling less feasible. Since scaling of the power supply voltage degrades performance, the operating voltage tends to be set higher than that needed by a scaled down device in order to achieve the desired speed performance [7].
In bulk-Si technology, multiple transistors are isolated from each other by reverse biased p-n junctions. However, the junction isolation is not always the best approach for integrated circuits since these junctions introduce additional capacitances and reduce the density of the transistors in the circuits. At high ambient temperatures, the leakage currents diminish the isolation among the various circuit components.
Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) wafers have been used commercially for decades as substrates in discrete and integrated circuits. The initial applications of SOI were mainly in extreme operating temperature for military and space applications. The key advantages of the SOI wafers are low junction capacitance, low leakage current, high breakdown voltage, resistance to ionization radiation, and robust voltage isolation in integrated circuits. In 1970s and 1980s, the radiation hardness of SOI circuits was the primary motivator for choosing these substrates as the thin, active Si films minimized the impact of ionizing radiation on device performance. Currently, the performance enhancement needs to motivate many integrated circuit companies to use SOI wafers. For the same supply voltage, digital logic circuits, such as microprocessors, run faster in SOI than in the bulk-Si. It is also possible to reduce power consumption of the SOI circuits by lowering the operating voltages, while still keeping the clock rate and their performance the same as in more power-hungry bulk-Si circuits. Since their introduction, commercial applications of SOI have grown exponentially, and entered the mainstream of ultra large-scale integration (ULSI) electronic circuits. Figure 2.5 illustrates the growth of market share of SOI technology in the twenty-first century.Fig. 2.5History and forecast of market share of SOI

SOI technology enables high-speed operation because of the inherently low capacitance. In addition to its advantages of speed and power, SOI technology provides good radiation hardness, ability to withstand high temperatures, ability to handle high voltage, a steep subthreshold characteristics, and improved short-channel effects compared to its bulk-Si counterpart[8]. In addition, the SOI devices are virtually free from latch-up and can be implemented with a smaller layout area as compared to the Bulk-Si devices.
The SOI technology opens up the possibility of having more than one gate for each transistor due to the presence of two oxide layers. Double Gate MOSFET (DGMOSFET) has been realized in SOI technology, which utilizes the two oxide layers as independent gates to control conduction. This offers more control over the channel and completely or partially eliminates the drawbacks of the bulk-Si technology. However, the maximum number of gates in a transistor is not limited to just two [8]. The number of gates can be extended to four for SOI technology includes two junction gates in addition to the two oxide gates. The transistor with four gates is called a Four Gate Field Effect Transistor (G4FET) [9]. The G4FET offers all features of the SOI technology. The independent action of the four gates broadens the horizons for mixed-signal applications, quantum wire effects, and quaternary logic schemes.


2.3 Silicon-on-Insulator
In its simplest form, SOI structure uses a layered silicon-insulator-silicon substrate in place of the conventional silicon substrates in semiconductor manufacturing to reduce parasitic device capacitance and thereby improves performance [10]. SOI-based devices differ from the conventional bulk-Si devices in that the silicon junctions are formed in the active layer and a buried oxide (BOX) layer is sandwiched in between the active layer and the substrate, which is also known as handle or base wafer. Figure 2.6 shows the SOI wafer and the cross-section of SOI structure. As a result, the conduction is confined in a thin layer of Si, thereby reducing the loss due to bulk conduction.Fig. 2.6SOI wafer and the cross-section of SOI structure

Because of isolation from the bulk Si, the SOI technology provides a lower parasitic capacitance compared to the conventional bulk-Si process. This improves power consumption at matched performance and provides resistance to latch-up because of the complete isolation of the n- and p- well structures.
From a manufacturing perspective, the SOI-based process may be implemented without special equipment or significant retooling of an existing factory. However, one of the challenges associated with SOI is stringent metrology requirements to account for the buried oxide layer and concerns about differential stress in the topmost silicon layer. The primary barrier to the commercialization of SOI is the higher substrate cost, which contributes an estimated 10-15% increase to total manufacturing costs [11].
The physics of SOI devices is highly dependent on the thickness and doping concentration of the silicon film on which they are constructed. Figure 2.7 shows the cross-section of a MOSFET realized in SOI. Depending on the thickness of the depletion charge in the top silicon epi-layer, the SOI devices can be classified as fully depleted (FD) and partially depleted (PD) SOI.Fig. 2.7Cross-section of a MOSFET on SOI

Figure 2.8 shows the cross-section of (a) FDSOI and (b) PDSOI wafers. It is clear from the figure that the active silicon layer of FDSOI is thinner than that of the PDSOI. It also shows that the channel of the FDSOI is fully depleted, whereas the channel of the PDSOI is partially depleted. Moreover, a PDSOI can be converted to an FDSOI with appropriate bias gate conditions.Fig. 2.8Cross-section, showing depletion of channel, of (a) FDSOI and (b) PDSOI

The local substrate terminal of the SOI MOSFET floats electrically, and thus the substrate-source voltage is not fixed. This has an adverse effect on the device performance as the change in the substrate-source bias changes the threshold voltage. The floating body effect is minimized by the use of fully depleted SOI. The thickness and doping density of the Si film of the FDSOI is less than that of the PDSOI, which facilitates easy depletion of the Si epi-layer in FDSOI compared to the PDSOI at thermal equilibrium. Initially, FDSOI demonstrated improved short-channel effects [12]. However, as the SOI devices scale down, FDSOI begins to exhibit increased short-channel effects compared to PDSOI unless silicon epi thickness becomes much smaller than the depletion width [13]. On the other hand, in PDSOI, short-channel effects decrease even in comparison with bulk-Si technology with identical doping [14]. Moreover, it is difficult to design a device in FDSOI with reasonable off-state current. Table 2.4 summarizes the comparison between the FDSOI and the PDSOI. In order to take full advantages of SOI technology, it is preferable to have a device with a PDSOI.Table 2.4Comparison between FDSOI and PDSOI [14] Partially depletedFully depletedManufacturability+ Design point (highV

2.4 High-k Dielectric and Metal Gate Technology
Traditional MOSFETs are formed with an insulating layer of silicon dioxide and a polysilicon gate. The rapid scaling of the devices in accordance with Moore's law has shrunk the gate oxide layer to merely five atoms in thickness. The reduction of the thickness of the gate dielectric is necessary for increased gate capacitance. Leakage current due to tunneling increases dramatically as the thickness of the gate dielectric scales down below 2 nm, which leads to reduced reliability and increased power dissipation.
If the standard silicon dioxide gate dielectric is replaced with a material with higher dielectric constant than that of the silicon dioxide, it will provide the required high gate capacitance value with larger thickness of the gate oxide, thus leaving room for further scaling. Oxides and silicates of hafnium (Hf) and zirconium (Zr) as well as aluminum oxides (Al2O3), titanium dioxide (TiO2), tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5), and lanthanum oxide (La2O3) have received a lot of attention as a possible replacement of silicon dioxide. The dielectric constant of silicon dioxide is about 3.9. The dielectric constant for pure hafnium silicates has been observed in a range between 15 and 25, while that of pure hafnium oxides has been observed at 40. However, for the sake of structural integrity, the manufacturing process used "impure" compounds of HfO2, which demonstrates a dielectric constant of over 16. CMOS fabrication industry has settled with hafnium oxide (HfO2) as the high-k dielectric material due to its ease of integration with the standard CMOS manufacturing process. Figure 2.9 illustrates how the oxide layer thickness and the choice of materials affect the transistor's gate leakage power [15]. The gate leakage current due to tunneling through the oxide layer has increased 100-fold in last three generations of transistors. The replacement of the gate dielectric by a high-k material has reversed the trend.Fig. 2.9Effect of gate oxide thickness and material on the leakage power of transistors as a function of the technology generation [15]

In the earlier days of MOS transistors, metal has been used as gate electrode materials. But the manufacturing process necessitated the use of polysilicon as a gate material replacing the metals. For the new generation of CMOS process using high-k gate dielectric, polysilicon has been initially used, but the device performance was poor compared to traditional low-k dielectric devices. This was due to the reduced mobility in the channel caused by phonon scattering. The particular density of electrons in the polysilicon gate allows inherent vibrations or phonons which move into the transistor channel, thereby disrupting the flow of current. On the other hand, higher density of electrons in the metal screens out vibrations allowing a smooth flow of current.
In addition, the combination of high-k dielectric and polysilicon gate increased the threshold voltage because of Fermi-level pinning caused by defects in the polysilicon high-k interface. As a result, the process engineers resorted to metal gate electrodes, which solved the issue of phonon scattering as well as Fermi-level pinning.


2.5 Summary
The rapid scaling of the CMOS process along with the development of silicon-on-insulator technology has facilitated the circuit designers to develop low-power circuits for sensor electronics. The recent development of CMOS processes incorporating high-k dielectric has led to further development of the highly complex integrated circuits with significantly reduced power dissipation. Combining the CMOS process enhancement with low-power circuit design strategies has launched a revolution in low-power sensor technologies and proliferation of various sensors in our everyday lives.

Abstract
Low-voltage (LV), low-power (LP) circuit design requires special attention on device behavior, and the best circuit topology needs to be chosen to meet the design challenges. With the scaling of MOS devices, supply voltage is reduced with each technological leap, but the threshold voltage and the drain-to-source saturation voltage are not scaling at the same rate because of the subthreshold current consideration in mixed-signal environment. Therefore, conventional circuit design topologies are not best suited for deep submicron (DSM) CMOS design. This chapter is a brief overview of the scaling concept of MOS devices and low-power circuit design topologies using deep submicron CMOS process.



Low-voltage (LV), low-power (LP) circuit design requires special attention on device behavior, and the best circuit topology needs to be chosen to meet the design challenges. With the scaling of MOS devices, supply voltage is reduced with each technological leap, but the threshold voltage and the drain-to-source saturation voltage are not scaling at the same rate because of the subthreshold current consideration in mixed-signal environment. Therefore, conventional circuit design topologies are not best suited for deep submicron (DSM) CMOS design. This chapter is a brief overview of the scaling concept of MOS devices and low-power circuit design topologies using deep submicron CMOS process.

3.1 Scaling Concept for Low-Power Analog Circuit Design
The generalized scaling concept has been illustrated in Table 3.1 [1]. It comes from the original idea wherein the electric field is assumed to be constant, and the devices and wires are scaled together. In this approach, the electric field is multiplied by a factor ε, and all the device physical dimensions are divided by a factor of α
D [2]. The wiring dimensions and the device width are divided by a factor α
W [3]. The generalized scaling relationships as shown in Table 3.1 did not consider device leakage as a significant contributing part in the device power consumption. However, in the 90 nm CMOS design, the gate length reduces in the range of 50-70 nm, and the device leakage contributes a major portion of the total device power consumption for a supply voltage of 1 V-1.2 V. With the increase of electric field factor ε, the circuit speed is also increased by a factor α
D. While operating at that speed, the active power of the circuit scales as ε

Because of the increased leakage in high-performance CMOS processes such as 90 nm and beyond, the threshold voltage V
T has reached its optimal limit. Any further reduction of the supply voltage and the device threshold voltage V
T can result in higher total power dissipation for a given performance compared to the earlier generation processes with the same supply and threshold voltages. In fact, if the power supply voltage is reduced, the optimum V
T for operation at that voltage can actually be higher [4]and the optimum performance for operation at that voltage level can deteriorate accordingly [1].


3.2 Analog Circuit Design Principles
Wouter A. Serdijn et al. [5] have identified the following design aspects with significant influences on the overall transfer quality for low-power system design:
1.Requirements of the system 2.Signal processing 3.Indirect feedback 4.Choice of information-carrying signal, and 5.Parasitics 

It has been shown that the current becomes more favorable than the voltage as the information-carrying quantity in a low-voltage, low-power environment [5].

3.2.1 Requirements of the System
The design process should start with the consideration of the communication of the system with the external world. This usually means identifying what should be the input or source and what should be the output or load of the system. Source and load are generally formed by other electronic systems or transducers. For the input and output of the system, the best representative signal, such as the voltage or the current or the flux of the external physical quantity, must be chosen so that there is almost a linear relationship between the electrical signal and the physical quantity [6].


3.2.2 Signal Processing
The next step in the design process is to decide which electrical quantities are best suited for a particular signal-processing scheme. Whenever the system handles the information coming from several sensors or transducers, the current is a better choice as the information-carrying quantity than the voltage. This is because the information coming from various transducers in the form of current signals can be easily added by connecting the output terminals of all the transducers in parallel. However, if a signal needs to be transmitted to different circuit blocks of the system, then the voltage is a better option. Voltage signals can be easily distributed among different blocks by simply connecting the input terminals of all the blocks in parallel.


3.2.3 Indirect Feedback
It is well known that negative feedback helps to reduce systematic errors of the system. Figure 3.1 shows the four feedback topologies derived by means of two two-port configurations. In an ideal case, wherein the gain of the feed-forward network (H) approaches infinity, the transfer function of the entire system is defined by the inverse of the feedback network, T
f. However, in low-voltage circuits, due to limited voltage swing, it is not preferable to connect the feedback network in series to sense the output current or to compare the input voltage of a circuit directly. This occurs in configurations "a" (at the input), "b" (at the output), and "c" (at both input and output). Hence, all direct feedback configurations, except the transimpedance amplifier (configuration "d"), are less suited for low-voltage applications.Fig. 3.1Feedback amplifiers topologies: (a) voltage-voltage feedback, (b) current-voltage feedback, (c) current-current feedback, (d) voltage-current feedback

To better understand the disadvantage of direct feedback, let us consider the current-voltage [configuration 1(b)] feedback circuit as shown in Fig. 3.2. Here, the two cascaded transistors, Ml and M2, perform the forward amplifier function, while the feedback network is implemented by the resistive divider (R
1 and R
2). Clearly, the maximum output voltage swing, and therefore the maximum output current swing is limited by the supply voltage V
DD, the voltage across the output port of M2, and the voltage across the input port of the feedback network (R
1). There are similar problems related to the low supply voltage for the configurations shown in Fig. 3.1a and c.Fig. 3.2Direct feedback current amplifier. R
1 and R
2 form the feedback network

In order to overcome the limitation of negative feedback network, an alternate approach is proposed which is called indirect negative-feedback network. In an indirect negative-feedback circuit, instead of using the direct output or input signal, a replica of the output or input signal is used as a feedback signal. A voltage amplifier, a current amplifier, and a transconductance amplifier, all using the indirect negative-feedback principle, are depicted in Figs. 3.3-3.5, respectively. If the replica of the signal does not introduce any error, then it is possible to obtain a circuit response, which is determined by the feedback network only. Again, if the feed-forward network T
ff approaches infinity and T
2 = T
1, T
4 = T
3, the transfer function of the entire system can be represented as the inverse transfer function of the feedback network T
f.Fig. 3.3Voltage amplifier with negative feedback and indirect voltage comparison

Fig. 3.5Transconductance amplifier with negative feedback and indirect current sensing and indirect voltage comparison



3.2.4 Choice of the Information-Carrying Signal
From the previous discussion, it is known that the indirect feedback can be a good alternative to the direct feedback topology. However, which electrical quantity should be used in the system in order to apply indirect negative feedback will be discussed in this section. In electronic circuit design, indirect voltage feedback results in a doubled power density spectrum of the equivalent noise voltage at the input, whereas indirect current sensing results in a doubled power density spectrum of the noise current at the output. Most often noise at the input is most critical than the noise at the output. On that basis, it is a better choice to do current sensing and consider current as the information-carrying quantity. In addition, in "voltage-driven" circuit, the equivalent input noise voltage is inversely proportional to the bias current. Therefore, in order to reduce the input noise voltage, one has to increase the bias current, which is in direct contrary to the low-power circuit design. Another disadvantage of indirect voltage comparison is that, in order to compensate each other, the nonlinearities of the two input stages must be symmetrical or opposite. This requires either two balanced input stages at the cost of double equivalent input noise voltage power density spectrum or two complementary stages in a complementary IC process. However, exact complement can never be accomplished.
However, in "current-driven" circuit, the equivalent input noise current is mainly determined by the input noise current of the input stage. In case of bipolar transistors and CMOS transistors in weak inversion, the input noise current is proportional to the bias current that can be made as small as possible. Again, indirect feedback at the output requires two identical output stages to compensate for the nonlinearities. This can be easily accomplished in any ordinary IC process. Therefore, the choice of current as the information-carrying quantity is a better option for low-power circuit design.


3.2.5 Parasitics
The final step in the low-power circuit design approach is the consideration of parasitic admittances or impedances. The influence of parasitic admittances can be minimized by terminating the signal path with a low impedance, whereas the influence of parasitic impedances can be minimized by terminating the signal path with a high impedance. In low-power integrated circuit design, the parasitic admittances (node capacitances) are often more influential on the signal behavior than the parasitic impedances. As a result, terminating the signal path with a low impedance results in better minimization of parasitic components of the circuit. "Current-mode", "switched-current", and "switched transconductance" techniques [7-9] support this argument with their inherent ability to exhibit good high-frequency properties.



3.3 Challenges of Low-Voltage Analog Circuit Design
The major challenge that the low-voltage analog designer may face is that the threshold voltage and the drain-source saturation voltage do not scale down at the same rate as the supply voltage. In a typical 5-V CMOS process, cascode and regulated cascode structures are ubiquitously used in analog circuit design because of their high output impedance and hence high voltage gain [10]. However, the cascode structures are no longer suitable for less than 2-V CMOS process because of their limited voltage headroom. Therefore, the normal trend is toward the development of the circuit in horizontal, i.e., cascade fashion instead of stacking transistors vertically.
A simple comparison of the low-voltage performance of the cascode and the noncascode structures has been shown in Fig. 3.6. It has been assumed that both M

s are carrying the same amount of current I
L, and are in strong inversion modes. Obviously, the cascode structure in Fig. 3.6a will require higher supply voltage to operate all the devices, especially the M1 in saturation.Fig. 3.6Cascode and noncascode structures, (a) a cascade gain stage plus output stage, (b) a simple gain stage plus output stage, (c) normalized transistor size and normalized GBW (at node V
x) vs. power supply [21]

In addition, due to the limited voltage swing in the cascode structure, the W/L ratio of M
c must be several times higher than that of M
s to meet the equal current carrying capability. Owing to large W/L ratio, the parasitic capacitance of the cascode structure will degrade the gain-bandwidth (GBW) of the circuit. The normalized minimum W/L ratios of M
c and M
s and GBW of both the structures have been depicted in Fig. 3.6c for different power supply voltages. However, the cascode structure provides higher gain due to higher output impedance. To achieve higher gain from the noncascode structure, the cascade structure can be used, i.e., develop the circuit in horizontal fashion.
However, the cascade structures do not resolve the design challenges of low-voltage, low-power circuit design. Each stage can be considered as a parallel block, and there is a potential chance to increase the power consumption even with the low supply voltage. Most importantly, each stage contributes one pole, and there is a potential chance of system instability if frequency compensation techniques are not used [11-13].
In switched capacitor (SC) circuits, low-voltage supply introduces some difficulties in driving some critical switches in the signal path [14, 15]. To overcome this problem, several techniques have been reported in the literature, such as those listed below:
1.Low threshold MOS devices 2.Clock boosting techniques [16] 3.Switched Op Amps [15, 17, 18]. 

Among the three techniques, the first one is expensive. The second one is used in industry, but it requires device with high breakdown voltage, which may not be supported in future generation CMOS technologies. The third one is only suitable for low-speed circuit applications.


3.4 Low-Power Circuit Techniques
The threshold voltage V
T of an MOSFET does not scale down at the same rate as scaling of power supply voltage because of the subthreshold current consideration in mixed signal environment [19] and the wide spread of V
T value for submicron technologies [20]. To overcome this relatively high threshold voltage, V
T and to reduce the overall power consumption, several low-power circuit design techniques have been reported [21, 22]:
1.Subthreshold operation 2.Supply voltage reduction 3.Bulk-driven MOSFETs 4.Floating-gate MOSFETs 5.Self-cascode MOSFET 


3.4.1 Subthreshold Operation
MOSFET operating in subthreshold region offers extremely low-power operation. In subthreshold region, MOSFET shows exponential behavior of drain current variation with the gate bias voltage and offers higher transconductance efficiency (g
m/I
d). A higher g
m/I
d allows the circuit to achieve desired performance at low power. Typically, when an MOSFET is operated in weak inversion or in subthreshold region, its unity current gain cut-off frequency (f
T) deteriorates, thus making the device unsuitable for high frequency applications. However, with the blessing of the technology scaling, modern deep submicron CMOS devices have achieved f
T values greater than 100 GHz, which has made them suitable for analog/RF circuit design even in subthreshold region.


3.4.2 Supply Voltage Reduction
Since the power consumption in analog/RF circuit is proportional to the supply voltage, reducing the power supply can reduce the power consumption of the circuit. Lower supply voltage also reduces the electric field and improves the long-term device reliability. However, lower supply voltage limits the dynamic range in analog circuit and offers reduced voltage headroom for the cascode structures.


3.4.3 Bulk-Driven MOSFETs
The bulk-driven MOS transistor concept was introduced by A. Guzinski et al. in 1987 [23], where bulk terminals of the MOSFETs were used in the design of the differential input stage of an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). It was later used in the design of a 1 V opamp utilizing the depletion characteristic of the bulk-driven MOS transistors. The reported opamp showed excellent rail-to-rail common-mode input range with a lower power supply voltage [24].
The original purpose of the bulk-driven differential amplifier was to yield a small g

m
 and to improve linearity. The cross-section of an N-channel MOSFET structure is shown in Fig. 3.7a. In a conventional MOSFET configuration, the gate-source voltage V
GS is used to control the drain current I
D through the channel, whereas the bulk and the source terminals are shorted. Bulk-source voltage V
BS can also be used to modulate the drain current I
D, which is represented by g

mb
 in the MOSFET equivalent circuit. For a constant V
GS
, the bulk-driven MOSFET acts like a JFET (Fig. 3.7b), where g

mb
 represents the effective transconductance of the signal. The input capacitance is (C

b, sub + C

bs
) instead of (C

gs
 + C

gb
).Fig. 3.7Bulk-driven MOS transistor, (a) cross-section and symbol of an N-channel MOSFET in P-well technology, (b) bulk-driven MOSFET is similar to a JFET transistor [21]

Bulk-driven MOSFETs offer both advantages and disadvantages. Depletion characteristics of bulk-driven MOSFET help to avoid V
T requirement in the signal path and provide increased voltage swing for lower supply voltage. However, bulk-driven MOSFETs suffer from lower transconductance, resulting in lower gain-bandwidth (GBW) and poor frequency response. Due to the lower transconductance, amplifier designed with bulk-driven MOSFETs has larger equivalent input referred noise compared to that of the gate-driven MOSFET [25].


3.4.4 Floating-Gate MOSFET
Floating-gate technique is another low-voltage analog circuit design technique to reduce supply voltage requirement. This technique has been widely used in a number of low-power analog circuit applications such as CMOS analog trimming circuit [26], multipliers in neural network [27], digital-to-analog converters, [28] and amplifiers [29-31].
Unlike conventional MOSFETs, the floating-gate voltage V
FG in a floating-gate MOSFET is controlled by the control gates through capacitive coupling. Figure 3.8 shows a simple layout and circuit symbol of a multi-input floating-gate MOSFET. The floating-gate voltage can be expressed as
(1) where Q
FG is the static charge on the floating-gate, and
(2)
C
Gi is the total capacitance seen at the floating-gate.
Fig. 3.8Multiple input floating-gate MOSFET: (a) layout, (b) schematic symbol

One of the excellent properties of floating-gate MOSFET is that the electric charge in floating-gate terminal can stay for several years with a variation of less than 2% at room temperature. As a result, this type of device has been widely used for EPROM applications. The static charge Q
FG in the floating-gate terminal can be changed in three different ways:
1.Illumination under ultra-violet light, 2.Hot electron injection, and 3.Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling. 



3.4.5 Self-Cascode Structure
Self-cascode structure uses two MOSFETs connected in series, and their gate terminals are shorted as shown in Fig. 3.9. Self-cascode configuration [32] usually provides high output impedance with larger voltage headroom than the conventional cascode structures. The output resistance is approximately equal to g
m2
r
o2
r
o1 and V
DS(sat) is equal to the gate over-drive voltage of a single MOSFET. For (W/L)2
< < (W/L)1, the circuit behaves like a single transistor (M1) operating in saturation region, where the top (M2) MOSFET operates in the moderate inversion or weak inversion region. Although not necessary, multi-threshold voltages (V
T1
< V
T2) help to improve the output impedance [33, 34].Fig. 3.9Self-cascode MOSFET




3.5 Summary
In this chapter, an overview of low-power circuit design techniques, device scaling, and the challenges associated with the circuit design with reduced power supply voltage has been presented. Some of the state-of-art circuit design techniques to work with the limited voltage headroom have also been discussed here. It is expected that this chapter will give the reader at least a fundamental understanding of the challenge associated with of low-voltage, low-power circuit design in this deep sub-micron CMOS era.

Abstract
Wireless integrated sensors are becoming popular in recent years because of their broad spectrum of applications including biomedical, environmental, security, industrial, and so on. Integrating the wireless technology with sensors require sound knowledge of communication system, including various parameters, such as communication standards suitable for sensor applications, modulation schemes and low-power transmitter architectures to reduce the overall power consumption of each sensor node in a sensor network. A review of the recent work in this area suggests that the conventional transmitter architectures used for cellular communication are not suitable for low-power sensor networks. Considering the communication standards and power consumptions of each sensor node, different modulation schemes and low-power transmitter architectures have been discussed in this chapter.




4.1 Introduction
With the recent technological improvements, wireless communication is becoming an integral part of the integrated sensor systems. The dependence upon network technologies in wireless sensor systems, healthcare monitoring, or in clinical environment has promoted the development of universal wireless networks to provide reliable connectivity and remote access to the information. Wireless communication provides greater flexibility, lower maintenance, and less routing complexity in the physical layer of a network system. Designing a low-power wireless communication system for the integrated sensor system is a huge challenge in today's world. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the discussion of basic communication system, wireless technology standards, different modulation schemes, and, finally, a short review on low-power transmitter architectures.


4.2 Communication System
The term "communication" usually refers to the transfer of information from one place to another. This communication can be in between two living beings or two instruments. In electrical systems, communication usually refers to the transfer of electrical signals in between two devices.
Communication between instruments takes place via a transmission media such as wired, wireless, optical, etc. A communication system can be simply represented using a block diagram as shown in Fig. 4.1. It consists of a source, a sink, a transmitter, a receiver, and a communication channel. Noise blocks are used in the block diagram to indicate the external noise in the communication system. The source block generates the main message signal, which is then processed and made suitable for transmission using the transmitter block. The transmitter block then sends the processed signal through the communication media to the receiver block. The receiver block retrieves the message from the received signal and forwards it to the sink block, which is the final destination of the message.Fig. 4.1A simple wireless communication model



4.3 Wireless Communication
In wireless communication system, information is transmitted through free space using electromagnetic waves (EM) or radio waves. The transmitting antenna at the transmitter transforms the electrical energy into electromagnetic energy, while the receiving antenna does the opposite. The EM wave propagates through the media as transverse electromagnetic wave (TEM) that has a transverse electric field (E) and a transverse magnetic field (H) in the direction of propagation. The electric and the magnetic fields also stay at right angle to each other. The power density of a TEM wave at a point in free space can be stated as follows,
(4.1)
where P is the power density (W/m2), E is the electric field strength (V/m), and Z
o is the characteristic impedance. The value of Z
o in free space is equal to 120 πΩ.
The Friis free space equation is frequently used to model the propagation of radio waves in free space if the transmitter and receiver have a clear and unobtrusive line of sight in between them. The free space equation is described as [1],
(4.2)
where P
T is the transmitted power, P
r(d) is the received power at a distance d from the transmitter, d is the distance between the transmitter and receiver, L is the loss factor, λ is the wavelength in meters, and G
T and G
R are the transmitter and receiver gains, respectively.

4.3.1 Radio Wave Propagation in Free Space
The transmission of radio wave from the source to the destination, i.e., from transmitter to receiver can be classified into four categories [2]. They are
(a)Ground Wave (b)Sky Wave (c)Free Space Wave (d)Open Field Wave 

Vertical polarization of electric field creates ground wave signal that induces current in the earth's surface and propagates through it. Ground wave propagation is particularly important on the low frequency and mid frequency portion of the radio spectrum. Ground wave signal has a number of constituents - direct wave, reflected wave, and surface wave. Because of the combined effects of these constituents, ground wave can travel beyond the horizon. However, this effect is dominant only for low frequency, up to a few MHz (less than 3 MHz).
Skywave is the propagation of radio wave reflected back by the ionosphere. The ionosphere is a region of upper atmosphere (about 50 km above the earth's surface), where rarified air is ionized by solar photons and cosmic rays. Solar radiation creates different distinct layers such as D layer, E layer, and F layer of the ionosphere depending upon the height from the earth surface. During daytime, D and E layers are present, and the F layer is subdivided into F1 and F2 layers, whereas at night, only E and F (no subdivision) layers exist. Skywave propagation helps to achieve long distance communication for a frequency range from 3 to 30 MHz. Signals above 30 MHz penetrates the ionosphere and never comes back to earth. Figure 4.2 shows the atmospheric transmittance or opacity of different EM waves, including radio waves. The radio wave reflected by the ionosphere comes back to the earth's surface and is again reflected by the earth's surface toward the ionosphere. As a result, the wave may bounce back and forth by two or three times before reaching the destination. Because of this nature of multihopping, skywave can travel many thousands of miles with only a few watts of power.Fig. 4.2Atmospheric transmittance of different electromagnetic signals [Wikipedia]

Free space wave is defined whenever there is no reflection or refraction and wave propagation in between the transmitter and receiver is only by line of sight. The governing equations for free space wave have already been defined in (4.1) and (4.2). Finally, the most important type of radio wave propagation for short distance communication is what occurs in open field. In this case, the radio wave propagation is not only the line-of-sight propagation, but also the wave reflected off the earth's surface. The vector sum of these two components gives the resultant signal transmission. Table 4.1 shows a short summary of different radio frequency bands and their mode of propagation in free space.Table 4.1Different radio frequency bands and their primary mode of propagation (Wikipedia)BandFrequencyWavelengthPropagation viaVLFVery low frequency3-30 kHz100-10 kmGuided between the earth and the ionosphere.LFLow frequency30-300 kHz10-1 kmGuided between the earth and the D layer of the ionosphere.

4.3.2 Loss Mechanisms in Radio Wave Propagation
During propagation in free space, radio waves or EM waves suffer from various kinds of loss mechanisms such as attenuation, reflections, or refractions. Some of the features or losses associated with wireless communication media are
(1)Free space path loss (2)Atmospheric attenuation (3)Reflection of EM waves (4)Indoor propagation of EM wave 

A short discussion on these topics is given in the following paragraphs.

4.3.2.1 Free Space Path Loss
If there are no obstacles to create any types of reflections or diffractions, the free space path loss is the loss in signal strength for a line-of-sight path through free space. Free space path loss is proportional to the square of the distance between the transmitter and receiver, and also proportional to the square of the frequency of the radio signal. The free space path loss can be expressed as,
(4.3)
where λ is the wavelength in meter, f is the frequency, d is the transmission distance, and c is the speed of light. This equation takes into consideration only the far field radiation of the antenna. For a typical radio application wherein f measured in MHz and d in km, the free space path loss equation becomes,
(4.4)

The above expression indicates two important effects. The first one is the spreading out of the EM energy, which is defined by,
(4.4)
where S is the power per unit area at a distance d and P
t is the total transmitted power in watts.
The second effect addresses the capability of a receiving antenna to capture the incoming electromagnetic wave. For an isotropic antenna, this is given by,
(4.5)
where P
r is the received power and S is the power of the incoming EM wave in watts. The total free space path loss is then defined by the ratio of P
t and P
r as shown in the following equation,
(4.6)



4.3.2.2 Atmospheric Attenuation
Atmospheric attenuation is related to the reduction of signal strength because of the presence of moisture, water vapor, fog, dust particles, etc. This phenomenon occurs for a frequency range of 5 GHz or above. This type of attenuation also varies with location, altitude, path elevation angle, etc. The net effect is the inclusion of a noise in the radio signal as well as reduction of the signal strength.


4.3.2.3 Reflection of EM Waves
The electromagnetic signal is reflected back whenever it experiences any conducting media or obstacles in its path. These obstacles could be the earth's surface, hills, buildings, etc. The reflected signal is vectorially added with the direct signal and results in either a constructive or a destructive interference. This multipath communication is usually not desirable, but clever use of this scheme makes it a useful one, especially for indoor wireless communication wherein more than one path exists between the transmitter and the receiver.


4.3.2.4 Indoor Propagation of EM Waves
In indoor environment, the transmitted signal form a fixed base station and reaches the receiver via direct line-of-sight path as well as multiple reflected paths. These reflections could be from the outer walls, columns, indoor objects, machineries inside a plant, etc. The reflected signals are simply the delayed version of the direct signal. This kind of multipath fading can create severe problems of performance degradation in indoor environment, but the effect can be minimized by proper designing of the transmitter and receiver and by carefully selecting their locations. A detailed characterization of the spatial properties of signal propagation is highly important for successful operation of an indoor radio communication system.




4.4 Wireless Technologies
The design requirements for wireless sensor system vary drastically depending upon wireless communication technologies. The communication system for wireless sensor network can be broadly classified into two categories [3]:
(1)Single-carrier narrow band (2)Spread spectrum 


4.4.1 Single-Carrier Narrowband Communication
Narrowband communication refers to the system, where channel bandwidth, W, is approximately equal to the data rate, R. The channel capacity, C, of a system is defined by the well known Shannon theorem,
(4.7)
where S/N is the signal-to-noise ratio of the system. In conventional wireless application, the main focus is to maximize the bandwidth efficiency characterized by R/W. In the past few years, different types of high performance modulation schemes have been adopted to enhance the throughput of the total system, but these can only be achieved at the expense of power dissipation. It has been reported that high-level modulation shows lower energy efficiency when operating with short packet communication and with low operating duty cycle [4]. Unlike high performance and complex modulation schemes, simpler schemes such as ASK and FSK show promising future in the field of short distance communication and low data rate.


4.4.2 Spread Spectrum Communication
Spread spectrum techniques achieve higher effective signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) at the expense of signal bandwidth. Commonly used spread spectrum techniques are the following:
(1)Direct sequence spread spectrum technique (DSSS) (2)Frequency hopping spread spectrum technique (FHSS) 

In spread spectrum technique, the original narrow band signal is multiplied by a pseudo-random (PN) chip code that results in a noise like output signal extending to the entire bandwidth (see Fig. 4.3). For multiplexing, different orthogonal PN codes are used for different users, and they share the same bandwidth at a time. Due to orthogonal properties of the PN codes, there is no interference among different channels or users. Spread spectrum is a highly bandwidth efficient technique in the case of multiple users and high data rate. The major disadvantage of this technique is that, even at low data rate the digital signal processing unit must operate at high speed to achieve high operating gain.Fig. 4.3Block diagram of DSSS system transmitter


4.4.2.1 Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum Technique
In DSSS, the narrowband signal is processed at chip rate (1/RC). Timing and synchronization must be established within a fraction of chip interval (1/RC). It uses a signal structure in which the sequence of chips produced by the transmitter is known a priori by the receiver. The receiver can then use the same PN code to counteract the effect of the PN sequence on the received signal in order to reconstruct the information signal.


4.4.2.2 Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum Technique
In FHSS, as shown in Fig. 4.4, carrier is pseudo-randomly returned instead of adding pseudo-random noise to the data. It generates a uniform frequency distribution width determined by the output range of the pseudo-random number generator. Thus, FHSS system can provide much better multipath performance by selecting interference free channels in its hopping sequence.Fig. 4.4Block diagram of FHSS system transmitter





4.5 Modulation Schemes
Low power consumption is the inherent requirement for choosing any modulation scheme and its final deployment in wireless sensor system. To reduce the peak current consumption in power amplifier (PA), constant envelop modulation schemes are preferred to incorporate high efficiency nonlinear PAs. One of the well known constant envelope modulation schemes is frequency-shift keying (FSK). FSK has simpler modulation and demodulation circuitry, and it also provides low-power operation.
In wireless sensor system, radiated power is usually in the range of 0 dBm (1 mW). To utilize this fact, linear PAs are used in wireless system. In this case, simpler but variable amplitude modulation scheme such as amplitude-shift keying (ASK) can be used. Both ASK and FSK schemes provide simpler circuitry and low power operation, which indicate their potential use in low-power wireless sensor system.
In the following sections, these two modulation schemes will be briefly described.

4.5.1 Amplitude-Shift Keying
ASK is a simple digital modulation scheme, wherein the high frequency carrier signal is turned "on" and "off" to represent binary 1 and 0 as shown in Fig. 4.5. ASK signal can be generated by multiplying the data signal with a carrier signal and the resultant signal can be expressed as,
(4.8)
where, Y
ASK(t) is the ASK modulated signal, X(t) is the digital data signal, and cos(ω
carrier
t) is the carrier signal with angular frequency ω
carrier. The multiplication operation shifts the frequency of the data signal to that of the carrier. The required bandwidth of the ASK modulated signal is twice the bandwidth of the data signal.Fig. 4.5Binary Data Signal and ASK signal

ASK scheme is best suited for binary data signal. Relatively simple architecture of ASK scheme offers low-power and cost-effective circuit solutions, particularly attractive for wireless sensor networks. However, the amplitude of the ASK signal is easily corrupted by the noisy signal, and therefore this scheme is not suitable in noisy environment.


4.5.2 Frequency-Shift Keying
In FSK scheme, the amplitude of the carrier remains fixed, but two different frequencies are used to represent binary 0 and 1 as shown in Fig. 4.6. In practice, the frequency shift between these two frequencies is only a few KHz. To modulate the frequency of the carrier, usually a varactor is used to change the capacitance of a tank circuit based on the binary data signal. FSK signal can also be generated by the sum of two ASK signals of two different carrier frequencies. In this case, the first one will be the ASK signal of a nominal data signal and the second one will be the ASK signal of the inverted data signal. Obviously, the carrier frequencies of these ASK signals must be different. Finally, summation of these two ASK signals will generate the FSK signal with two different frequencies for binary 1 and 0 signal.Fig. 4.6Binary Data Signal and FSK signal

Standard FSK uses two separate carriers to switch "on" and "off" the high frequency or low frequency carrier based on the data signal. In order to produce lowest probability error, two frequencies are made orthogonal. Again, in order to maintain minimum bandwidth, minimum frequency separation is used to produce the orthogonal signal.
FSK scheme exhibit excellent noise immunity compared to the ASK scheme. Due to constant envelop, FSK signal does not introduce any kind of nonlinearity to the power amplifier of the transmitter.



4.6 Low-Power Transmitter in Integrated Sensor System
Power consumption needed for communication typically dominates the power consumption of the sensor nodes. Therefore, to overcome this problem, one has to reduce the power consumption of the transmitter.
Figure 4.7 shows the block diagram of a typical wireless transmitter model. In this model, data signal is usually incorporated into the pre-power amplifier (Pre-PA) block, which consists of mixers, frequency synthesizers, low-pass filters, digital-to-analog converters, etc. The modulated data signal from the Pre-PA block is then fed into the power amplifier (PA) block that is coupled to an antenna through a matching network (MN).Fig. 4.7Wireless transmitter model

The efficiency of this transmitter can be expressed as,
(4.9)
where P
Radiated = Radiated power from the antenna, P
LO = Power loss due to local oscillator, P
Mixer = Power loss due to mixer, P
PA,loss = Power loss due to power amplifier, P
MN,loss = Power loss due to matching network, P
Ant,loss = Power loss occurred in the antenna.
The typical approaches used for minimization of the transmitter total energy consumption are as follows:
(1)Minimize overhead power. (2)Minimize losses in the power amplifier and pre-power amplifier. (3)Radiate minimum power required for the transmission. (4)Minimize duration to which PA is active. 

Although these requirements are quite universal, their relative importance in the case of sensor node transmitter is different compared to cellular/WLAN transmitters. In cellular/WLAN, the radiated power is much higher than the power consumption of the Pre-PA block, and the efficiency of the PA dominates the efficiency of the entire transmitter. Therefore, the main focus goes to the improvement of efficiency and power consumption of the power amplifier only, which ultimately improves the performance of the entire transmitter.
In case of WBAN, the radiated power is much smaller than that of the PA and Pre-PA due to the requirement of shorter communication distance, low data rate, and low-power operation of the entire transmitter block. If radiated power is much higher than that of the Pre-PA, transmitter efficiency will mainly depend on the efficiency of the PA. However, in WBAN, radiated power is much smaller in the range of 0 dBm (1 mW). In addition, the power consumption of the Pre-PA block is usually independent of the communication distance, and as a consequence, the Pre-PA power becomes comparable or even larger than the radiated power. Therefore, simply reducing the radiated power or improving the efficiency of the PA does not give significant power savings.
If somehow the Pre-PA power can be made lower than the radiated power, then by improving the efficiency of the PA and by decreasing the radiated power, the overall transmitter average power consumption can be reduced. However, highly efficient PA requires a higher drive, which ultimately increases the power consumption of the Pre-PA block. As such, it requires design optimization of PA and Pre-PA blocks altogether rather than the PA block alone.
In the following sections, conventional transmitter architecture will be discussed first, and then some of the existing low-power transmitter architectures will be presented.


4.7 Conventional or Direct Conversion Transmitter
Figure 4.8 shows the block diagram of a conventional direct conversion transmitter. It consists of two up-conversion mixer to up-convert the baseband signal to the RF band, a frequency synthesizer with quadrature output options and a low-power amplifier. This architecture is very versatile, and it can support any modulation scheme with higher data rate. Due to the frequency synthesizer and mixers, the power consumption of this type of architecture is extremely high, which ultimately results in poor transmitter efficiency for short range wireless communication. The reported transmitter efficiency of this architecture is in the range of 3.3% [5].Fig. 4.8Block diagram of a direct conversion transmitter


4.7.1 Direct Modulation Transmitter
Because of the low data rate operation in WBAN, relatively simpler modulation schemes, such as on-off keying (OOK) and FSK can be employed. This leads to the deployment of less complex transmitter architecture, namely, direct modulation transmitter as shown in Fig. 4.9. In direct modulation architecture, the baseband data directly modulates the local oscillator. Thus, this architecture eliminates the requirements of power hungry digital modulator, DACs, and I/Q mixers. OOK can be achieved by power cycling the transmitter, while FSK can be achieved by varactor modulation of the local oscillator [6].Fig. 4.9Direct modulation transmitter



4.7.2 Injection-Locked Transmitter
High efficiency PA needs higher drive requirements, which increases the power consumption of the Pre-PA. To optimize the design requirements, injection-locked transmitter architecture can be used as shown in Fig. 4.10.Fig. 4.10Injection-locked transmitter

Injection-locked transmitter consists of two oscillators - one is the reference oscillator, and the other one is the main oscillator or power oscillator. Reference oscillator generates a spectrally pure reference carrier frequency, which is then injected to the main or power oscillator to achieve injection locking [7]. Power oscillator then feeds the signal to the antenna through the matching network, or the antenna could be directly integrated with the oscillator to further reduce the loss in the matching network. Injection-locked oscillator works as a first order PLL, and, therefore, it minimizes any load changes of oscillator due to environmental variations. In injection-locked transmitter, power oscillator works as a substitute for the power amplifier, and drive requirement of power oscillator can be greatly reduced because of injection-locking process. As a result, the power consumption of the pre-power amplifier block can be reduced, which facilitates with higher overall transmitter efficiency.


4.7.3 Active Antenna Transmitter
Matching network in transmitter architecture incurs a substantial amount of power loss and reduces the transmitter efficiency. The main purpose of matching network is to optimize the antenna impedance (∼50 Ω) to achieve optimal PA efficiency. In active antenna architecture, the antenna is directly coupled to the power amplifier (Fig. 4.11) to provide the optimal impedance, and the loss associated with the matching network can be eliminated [8]. As a result, it is expected to achieve high PA efficiency from active antenna transmitter architecture.Fig. 4.11Active antenna transmitter




4.8 Conclusion
This Chapter deals with the low-power wireless telemetry suitable for sensor applications. Starting with a simple communication model, this chapter has discussed different RF propagation methods in free space, different types of modulation schemes taking care of low-power consumption, and less complexity and finally low-power transmitter architectures, especially suited for short range wireless communication. Unlike conventional transmitter architectures used for cellular communication, the innovative short range transmitter architectures discussed here can provide both low-power consumption and high efficiency.

5.1 Introduction
Intelligent sensors are extensively contributing to a broad range of our day-to-day life activities. Safeguarding human and environmental resources against harmful agents requires the development of new in situ, real-time monitoring devices that can be deployed in multiple strategic locations. The ideal sensor system should be compact, cost-effective, and capable of detecting low concentrations of pollutants, toxic chemicals, and warfare agents. The emergence of the telemedicine concept coupled with the tremendous growth of wireless sensor networks has opened up a new and innovative application of wireless sensor technology in medical as well as in healthcare field. The broad range of sensor applications is quite difficult to cover in such a short extent. Here, in this chapter, mainly three areas will be covered where sensors applications are creating the most impact.


5.2 Environmental Monitoring
Environmental monitoring approaches are generally based upon discrete sampling of the analytes of interest followed by laboratory analysis typically using computers. These discrete sampling methods and analyses are expensive and time-consuming and are not typically suitable for acquisition of high resolution data. In recent years, real-time and continuous analytical methods of specific detection and identification of organic and inorganic chemicals as well as bioagents are becoming popular due to the advancement of miniaturization and microfabrication processes. Continuous monitoring of environmental pollution in the field requires robust, portable, field-deployable and fast-response sensors with sufficient sensitivity and long-term stability. Typical in situ field-deployable environmental monitoring involves electrochemical sensors and biophotonic biosensors.
For continuous monitoring of the data, these sensors require wireless telemetry features. In addition, these sensors can be integrated in a sensor web configuration for smart sensing. The sensor web approach employs a data acquisition strategy in which intelligence is pushed toward the edge monitoring system where higher quality data can be captured at a lower cost. The smart sensing capability can also be advanced through reconfiguration at different levels of the sensor web for coordinated, content-aware, and on-demand data acquisition with effective usage of the sensor and sensor web assets.
A number of different types of sensors are used for environmental monitoring purpose. The most common example is an electrochemical sensor. Lately, biosensors are also becoming popular choices for environmental monitoring applications. Biosensors are hybrid devices combining a biological sensing component with an analytical measuring element. The biological component typically reacts and/or interacts with an analyte of interest to produce a response that can be quantified by an electronic, optical, or mechanical transducer. Description of these two types of sensors is provided in the following sections.

5.2.1 Electrochemical Sensors
An Electrochemical sensor is basically a subclass of chemical sensors in which an electrode is used as the transduction element [1]. This type of sensor operates on the principle of electrochemistry and relates measured electrical quantities, such as current, voltages, etc., to target chemical parameters. The desirable characteristics of the electrochemical sensing systems are (1) high sensitivity and selectivity, (2) wide linear range, (3) low-power requirements, and (4) low-cost and miniaturized instrumentation.
The electrochemical sensors can be classified as follows [1, 2]:
(a)Amperometric and voltammetric 

In these types of sensors, a potential applied between a reference and working electrodes results in oxidation or reduction of an electroactive process. The applied potential serves as the driving force of the electron-transfer reaction and the current is registered as a function of the applied potential. The resulting current provides a direct measure of the electron transfer reaction and is proportional to the concentration of the target analyte. These sensors combined with state-of-the-art precision instrumentation are capable of very low-level detection down to the picomolar levels. Typical examples of these types of sensors include blood glucose monitors, oxygen detectors in water, etc.
(b)Potentiometric 

In potentiometric sensors, the analytical information is obtained by converting an ion-recognition event into a potential signal. The equilibrium potential of an indicator electrode is measured against a selected reference electrode, typically using a high-impedance voltmeter that operates effectively at zero current. A local equilibrium is established across the recognition membrane, leading to a change in the membrane potential. The potential difference between the ion-selective electrode and a reference electrode provides the analytical information as a function of species activity, not concentration. Typical examples are potentiometric devices for in situ monitoring of pH, pCO2, or pS22.
(c)Conductimetric 

In these types of sensors, the concentration of charge is obtained through measurement of solution resistance which is not species-selective. Conductimetric detectors are the simplest of the electrochemical family, but are useful in situations where it is necessary to determine whether the total ion concentration in an electroremediation process is below a certain permissible maximum level. The other uses of this type of sensor include on-line detection after separation of a mixture of ions by ion chromatography.
Electrochemical sensors demonstrate a number of potential benefits in environmental monitoring applications. Since each chemical species has an associated potential for oxidation and reduction, the voltammetric sensing technique can provide a high degree of selectivity and specificity unlike other common analytical techniques. The choice of the electrode materials can also lead to selectivity, particularly in ion-selective electrodes. In voltammetric sensors, certain species do not react when certain electrode materials are used. Thus, it may lead to a resolution of the interference problems. Electrochemical sensors can be made portable with adequate instrumentation and miniaturization techniques. These sensor instruments can be battery-powered and are capable of interfacing with computers for real-time online monitoring of the environmental data.


5.2.2 Biophotonic Biosensors
The microelectronic-based bioluminescent biosensor technology has been developed at the University of Tennessee, which is capable of specific detection and identification of organic and inorganic chemicals as well as bioagents. The biologically inspired sensing mechanism, represented by the biophotonic biosensors, produces a biologically inspired sensing mechanism that takes advantage of self-generated lux-based bioluminescence [3] for rapid, early warning monitoring of target compounds within complex environmental matrices. Within the microelectronic platform [4, 5], these sensors have been demonstrated to operate as functioning autonomous detectors for continuous online, real-time monitoring in a low-power, low-mass, low-maintenance, and redundant framework. The individual sensors can be deployed in a toxic or hazardous environment as a network of sensors that is compatible with any local area network communications protocol, either through cable connections (e.g., USB) or on-chip wireless transmitters. Biophotonic biosensor technology can provide rapid, inexpensive, sensitive and selective analysis of environmental samples while circumventing most of the problems associated with conventional analytical technologies (e.g., spectrometry) [6].

Bioluminescent bioreporter integrated circuit (BBIC) [4] is a biosensor technology that uses certain types of bacteria genetically engineered to detect and quantify specific chemical agents in air, soil, or water by producing a measurable bioluminescent signal proportional to the agent concentration [5]. Bioreporters contain two essential genetic elements, a promoter gene and a reporter gene as shown in Fig. 5.1 [7]. The promoter gene is turned on (transcribed) when the target agent is present in the environment within the cell boundary. The promoter gene in a normal bacterial cell is linked to other genes that are then likewise transcribed and then translated into proteins that help the cell in either combating or adapting to the agent to which it has been exposed. In the case of a bioreporter, these genes, or portions thereof, have been removed and replaced with a reporter gene. Consequently, turning on the promoter gene now causes the reporter gene to be turned on. The promoter/reporter gene complex is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translated into a reporter protein that is ultimately responsible for generating a detectable signal. Therefore, the presence of a signal indicates that the bioreporter has sensed a particular target agent in its environment. Originally developed for fundamental analysis of factors affecting gene expression, bioreporters were early on applied for the detection of environmental contaminants [8-10], and have since evolved into fields as diverse as medical diagnostics, precision agriculture, food safety assurance, process monitoring and control, and biomicroelectronic computing.Fig. 5.1Schematic of the anatomy of a bioreporter organism


5.2.2.1 Bioreporter Systems
A number of different types of reporter genes are available for use in the construction of bioreporter organisms. The signals generated by these bioreporters can be categorized as colorimetric, fluorescent, luminescent, chemiluminescent or electrochemical. Although each bioreporter functions differently from the other, each produces a measurable signal that is proportional to the concentration of the specific chemical or physical agent that it has been exposed to. In some cases, a secondary substrate needs to be added to the bioassay to generate the signal, while for others, the signal must be activated by an external light source. In addition, for a select few bioreporters, the signal is completely self-induced without the need for any exogenous substrate or external activation. The following sections outline in brief some of the reporter gene systems available and their existing applications.

Bacterial luciferase (Lux): Luciferase is a generic name for an enzyme that catalyzes a light-emitting reaction. Luciferases can be found in bacteria, algae, fungi, jellyfish, insects, shrimp, and squid, and the resulting light that these organisms produce is termed bioluminescence. In bacteria, the genes responsible for the light-emitting reaction (the lux genes) have been isolated [11] and used extensively in the construction of bioreporters that emit a blue-green light with a maximum intensity at 490 nm, as shown in Fig. 5.2. Three variants of lux are available, one that functions at <30°C, another at <37°C, and a third at <45°C. The lux genetic system consists of five genes, luxA, luxB, luxC, luxD, and luxE. Depending on the combination of these genes used, several different types of bioluminescent bioreporters can be constructed.Fig. 5.2Bioluminescence emitted from individual colonies of microbial cells containing the genes for bacterial luciferase (Courtesy: Center for Environmental Biotechnology, The University of Tennessee, www.ceb.utk.edu)


luxAB bioreporters: luxAB bioreporters contain only the luxA and luxB genes, which together are responsible for generating the light signal. However, in order to fully complete the light-emitting reaction, a substrate must be supplied to the cell. This typically occurs through the addition of the chemical decanal at some point during the bioassay procedure. Numerous luxAB bioreporters have been reported which have been constructed within bacterial, yeast, insect, nematode, plant, and mammalian cell systems. A number of chemical and biological agents can be detected by luxAB-based bioreporters as listed in Table 5.1. [12].Table 5.1Chemical and biological agents detectable by luxAB-based bioreportersAntibiotic effectivenessGene expression/regulationAntimicrobial agentsGrowth phase regulationBacterial biofilmsImmunoassaysBacterial biomassIn vivo expression technology (IVET)Bacterial stress responseIndustrial waste runoffBacterial transport mechanismsMetabolic regulationBioremediation process monitoringMutagenicity testsCell viable countsPlant pathogensCircadian rhythmsToxicity assaysDNA damaging agentsTumor burdenEnvironmental contaminantsViral infectionFoodborne pathogensXenobiotic detection


luxCDABE bioreporters: Instead of containing only the luxA and luxB genes, bioreporters can contain all five genes of the lux cassette. These bioreporters allow for a completely independent light-generating system that requires neither extraneous additions of substrate nor any excitation by an external light source. The bioreporter in this bioassay is thus simply exposed to a target analyte, resulting in a quantitative increase in bioluminescence usually within less than 1 h. luxCDABE bioreporters are extremely attractive due to their rapidity and ease-of-use, and the ability to perform the bioassay repetitively in real-time and online. As a result, these bioreporters have been incorporated into a diverse array of detection methodologies ranging from the sensing of environmental contaminants to the real-time monitoring of pathogen infections in living mice. Table 5.2 illustrates the widespread application of luxCDABE bioreporters.Table 5.2The luxCDABE-based bioreportersAnalyteReporterTime for inductionConcentration2,3-dichlorophenol

Nonspecific lux bioreporters: Nonspecific lux bioreporters are usually designed to continuously bioluminesce, and are typically used for the detection of chemical toxins. As a result of the exposure to a chemical toxin, the cell either dies or its metabolic activity slows down resulting in a reduction in bioluminescent light levels. One example of the application of the nonspecific lux bioreporters is in the Microtox® assay where a short exposure to several concentrations of the sample is followed by the decreased bioluminescence that can be correlated to relative levels of toxicity [13].

Firefly luciferase (Luc): For bioreporter applications, primarily two types of luc-based luciferases are available. The luciferase known as Firefly luciferase can produce visible light in the 550-575 nm range. The other type known as click-beetle luciferase produces light at a peak closer to 595 nm. An addition of an exogenous substrate, known as luciferin, is required for both luciferases to initiate the light reaction. A number of luc-based bioreporters have been reported for the detection of various inorganic and organic compounds for environmental monitoring. However, the most promising application of these bioreporters is in the field of medical diagnostics such as medical imaging detection of cervical cancer [14], detection of estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities [15], etc.

Aequorin: Aequorin is a type of photoprotein isolated from the bioluminescent jellyfish Aequorea victoria. By adding calcium ions (Ca2+) and coelenterazine to this photoprotein, a reaction can be initiated resulting in the generation of blue light in the 460-470 nm range. Rider et al have incorporated Aequorin into genetically engineered human B cell lines which produce light upon exposure to antigens of different pathogens, and are used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria and viruses [16].

Green fluorescent protein (GFP): GFP is a photoprotein which is typically isolated and cloned from the jellyfish Aequorea Victoria [17]. The other variants have also been isolated from the sea pansy Renilla reniformis. Similar to aequorin, GFP produces a blue fluorescent signal, but unlike aequorin it does not require any addition of an exogenous substrate. Only an ultraviolet light source is required to activate the fluorescent properties of the photoprotein. This ability to autofluoresce makes GFP highly desirable in biosensing assays and is used on-line and in real-time to monitor intact, living cells. In addition, GFP can be altered to produce light emissions besides blue (i.e., cyan, red, and yellow), which allows it to be used as a multi-analyte detector. GFP has been used extensively in the construction of bioreporter within bacterial, yeast, nematode, plant, and mammalian hosts.

Uroporphyrinogen (Urogen) III Methyltransferase (UMT): UMT catalyzes a reaction that results in two fluorescent products producing a red-orange fluorescence in the 590-770 nm range when illuminated with ultraviolet light [18]. Similar to aequorin or GFP, UMT does not require an addition of exogenous substrates. UMT has been widely used as a bioreporter for the selection of recombinant plasmids, as a marker for gene transcription in bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells, and for the detection of toxic salts such as arsenite and antimonite.


5.2.2.2 Bioluminescent Bioreporters
The integration of reporter gene fusions into living cells has produced an extensive array of bioreporter organisms capable of specifically detecting and quantifying numerous chemical, biological, and physical agents [19]. Interaction of a bioreporter with its unique target results in a transcriptional reporter gene response that manifests as an easily discernible phenotypic signal. In the bacterial lux reporter gene system, all the components necessary for expression of its bioluminescent signal are present within the cell and thus no external manipulation is necessary. The University of Tennessee Center for Environmental Biotechnology (UT-CEB) research group had demonstrated, as early as in 1990, that bioluminescent bioreporters represent a rapid, selective, and highly functional approach for chemical agent detection in complex environmental matrices [20]. Bioreporters have been used to screen for single or multiple chemically related compounds, simultaneously. Several bioluminescent bioreporters have been constructed at UT-CEB for the detection of naphthalene and salicylate [20, 21] BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene) [22], polychlorinated biphenyls [23], and dinitrotoluene, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and dichlorophenol.



5.2.3 Bioluminescent Bioreporter Integrated Circuits
The University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory have collaboratively developed single microchip optical application-specific integrated circuit (OASIC) transducers that couple directly to bioreporter matrices to provide a complete, standalone detection system as shown in Fig. 5.3. [4, 5, 8]. In a single, small footprint, low-power package, the BBIC provides for the detection of the bioreporter optical signal, the distinguishing of this signal from noise, digital processing of the signal, and local communication of the result. In its most basic form, the BBIC measures the amount of light emitted by the bioreporter, digitizes this value and transmits the results to a data receiver. It is fabricated in standard 0.35 μm standard CMOS and thus features an extremely small footprint (2.25 mm2) and associated low-power requirements (<100 μW).Fig. 5.3A bioluminescent bioreporter integrated circuit (BBIC)

The proof-of-concept for using BBICs for bioluminescence measurement has been reported [4, 5, 7, 8]. For initial testing purposes, the chip was mounted in a 40-pin ceramic dual inline package (DIP). Bioluminescence was determined for cultures containing different concentrations of the bioluminescent bioreporter P. fluorescens 5RL, growing in the presence of the inducer molecule salicylate at 10 ppm [24]. Bioluminescence was determined using the integrated circuit microluminometer and a light-tight enclosure mounted above the chip. Linear regression analysis showed that the data fit a linear model, indicating that bioluminescence per cell remains constant for cell concentrations ranging from 4 × 105 to 2 × 108 CFU/mL and for detector responses ranging from 0.05 to 20 pA. Using a linear model, the limit of detection (2 sigma) for this experimental geometry was estimated to be 4 × 105 cells/mL.
BBIC has been implemented for the detection of microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs). MVOCs are produced as metabolic by-products of bacteria and fungi. Since they are detectable before any visible signs of microbial growth appear, they serve as very early indicators of potential biocontamination problems. Using p-cymene as a model MVOC, a bioluminescent bioreporter (Pseudomonas putida UT93) was constructed and used in a first generation BBIC platform for remote detection of Penicillium growth. Upon exposure to a single growth plate of Penicillium (∼0.012-0.025 ppm p-cymene), a significant bioluminescent signal was produced within 3.5 h. Using highly sensitive non-chip-based photodetectors (i.e., photomultiplier tubes) reduced detection times by almost 60%. It is, therefore, imperative that chip sensitivity be increased in order to establish optimal response times.


5.2.4 Environmental Sensing Using BBIC Platform
The University of Tennessee pioneered the use of bioluminescence in environmental chemical sensing through development of bioreporter bacterial strains harboring bioluminescent (bacterial) lux gene fusions with promoters specific for detection of aromatic hydrocarbons. Several bioluminescent bioreporters have been constructed at UT-CEB as summarized below:

5.2.4.1 Soil-Based Sensors
Bioreporter sensing systems have been developed and demonstrated for a number of environmental detection and remediation applications with soil. For example, The University of Tennessee Center for Environmental Biotechnology has engineered organisms to help with the detection of various analytes, such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenol using Ralstonia eutropha [25] and phenol using Acinetobacter [26]. These types of biosensors for monitoring analytes in soil samples are relevant to defense, homeland security, and environmental applications.


5.2.4.2 Gas-Based "Air Breathing" Sensors
Researchers have explored sensors for detecting analytes in air for environmental applications pertaining to "sick building syndrome" [9]. In particular, building ventilation systems can prove quite effective in the dissemination of fungal and bacterial spores, allergens, or biological and chemical weapons. For environmental applications, the detection of microbial contamination comes through microbially generated volatile organic compounds [9, 27]. Figure 5.4 shows a photograph of the air-breathing BBIC test apparatus. For this particular system, a vapor-phase test for p-cymene was successful in detecting concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 850 ppm of p-cymene. This allowed the sensor to detect the fungal presence of Penicillium roqueforti in experiments. In addition to p-cymene, the bioreporter responded to other volatile organic compounds (m and p-xylene and styrene) occurred, but at half the bioluminescence levels.Fig. 5.4(a) Diagram of the remote BBIC test system used for sensing fungal growth with encapsulated P. putida UT93 bioreporter cells. (b) Photograph of the BBIC sensor probe and remote frequency unit

This approach for "air-breathing" analyte biosensors seems particularly promising for future development. The BBIC system used for "air breathing" applications includes the bioreporter cells captured in an encapsulation matrix along with their necessary nutrients. The encapsulation matrix must be engineered to enable the bioreporters to live and to allow the analyte to diffuse into the material, enough to interact with the bioreporters.
The BBIC system has been used to detect bioluminescence from bioreporters exposed to gaseous phase analyte [7]. Pseudomonas fluorescens 5RL, a naphthalene bioreporter, was used to detect the presence of naphthalene in air. P. fluorescens 5RL was created by fusing the luxCDABE gene cassette from Vibrio fischeri to the knar regulatory gene for naphthalene metabolism [20]. This fusion also allows for sensing of salicylate, as it is an intermediate in the nah metabolic pathway. A light-tight enclosure shown in Fig. 5.5 was used to house the electronics and allow exposure to gases. The enclosure has an inlet, which was baffled to allow for indirect flow of gases, an outlet, and ports for electronic connections. Air was passed over naphthalene crystals and the vapor was bubbled through water to maintain a humid environment.Fig. 5.5Air testing chamber: (a) side view with air tight lid sealed on chamber and (b) top view of chamber without lid


P. fluorescens 5RL was grown to an OD546 of 0.08 (∼1 × 108 cfu/mL) in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 14 mg tetracycline/mL. A 1 mL aliquot was mixed with 1 mL liquefied LB agar, deposited on a glass microscope slide, and allowed to solidify. The slide was then placed over the BBIC chip and uninduced background light measurements were taken for 2 h. Naphthalene saturated air was then continuously flowed through the chamber at a rate of 200 mL/min. Figure 5.9 shows a 100% increase in bioluminescence 40 min after induction. The time scale has been normalized to display induction of the cells at time 0 h. The increase in signal prior to induction is due to basal (noninduced) lux expression by the bioreporter population. After induction, the signal continues to increase for 4-5 h. At this point, the bioreporters become oxygen limited in the agar and reach their peak population [6]. From here, the population begins to fall and bioluminescence decreases, as seen on the latter portion of the plot in Fig. 5.6.Fig. 5.6Bioluminescence of Pseudomonas fluorescens 5RL vs. time with exposure to naphthalene saturated air in the enclosed chamber. Time points to the left of 0 correspond to data collected prior to the start of naphthalene exposure. Time 0 indicates time at which naphthalene addition began



5.2.4.3 Liquid-(Water) Based Sensors

P. fluorescens 5RL was once again used as the bioreporter with salicylate acting as the inducible liquid phase analyte. Figure 5.7 shows a second light-tight enclosure that was created to accommodate the microluminometer and other fixtures necessary for liquid phase testing. The 5RL bioreporters were grown at room temperature to 1 × 108 cfu/mL in 1 L of minimal media (0.07 g KH2PO4, 0.17 g K2HPO4, 0.01 g MgSO4 · 7H2O, 0.1 g NH4NO3). Salicylate was then added at final concentrations ranging from 100 to 0.05 ppm. Slow shaking of the flask (∼150 rpm) created uniform bioreporter distribution throughout the solution. This solution was then circulated at a constant rate (∼300 mL/min) through 3 mm diameter viton tubing through the enclosure to the clear glass flow cell. The flow cell is situated directly over the photodiode and the bioreporters are exposed as they flow through. At this point, salicylate was injected into the reservoir at time 0 h and the bioreporter response was recorded over a 3 h period.Fig. 5.7Liquid testing chamber: (a) side view of open chamber with flow cell covering microluminometer and (b) full liquid test system

Figure 5.8 shows the system detection for salicylate exposure. In this figure, the response curves for each concentration grade were normalized to bioreporter population at the point of sample induction. The cultures began to exhibit increased bioluminescence after approximately 40 min. This was detected from samples that were drawn from the LB media and measured by spectrophotometer (λ = 546 nm). The system reached its detection limit at 0.1 ppm salicylate. The procedure used in [7, 12] was used to measure the bioluminescence here.Fig. 5.8Bioluminescence of P. fluorescens 5RL vs. time with exposure to salicylate in enclosed liquid based test chamber. Curves display detection response for varying concentrations of salicylate





5.3 Applications of Sensors Array for Environmental Monitoring
Use of sensor array is extremely popular for the inspection and monitoring of several environmental parameters. Continuous in situ monitoring of the environmental parameters by means of low-cost and noninvasive sensor arrays is becoming more important with the ever increasing demand for environmental cleanup and strict monitoring of environmental pollutants.

5.3.1 Single Substance Detection
Detection of specific types of substances has been long studied for various applications. Early works show the investigation and monitoring of fuel mixtures [29] and oil leaks [30]. Several other reported studies indicate the recent progress of the detection of low-level of hydrocarbons using quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) based devices [31, 32]. Volatile organic air compounds such as ethanol, propanol, butanol, acetone, toluene, benzene, xylene, n-octane, methane, cyclohexane, and trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, tetrachloroethylene, have also been successfully investigated using tin oxide-based sensor arrays [33-36] as well as conductive polymers (CP's) [37] and Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) resonators [38]. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds have long been considered as a class of contaminants for humans and other organisms [39]. They are widely detected in highly variable concentrations in air, water, sediment and biota. Recent works show the detection of PAH using surface enhanced Raman Spectroscopy [40] and fluorescence and mass spectrometry [39]. Other environmentally relevant studies include the detection of insecticides [41], nerve and blister agents [42], refrigerant gases [43], and pollen [44]. However, most of these works have been done in laboratory setup in controlled environment. In a real-time environment, sensor performances are affected by different factors such as temperature, humidity, flow rate, etc. Even though new materials and design techniques are being introduced in sensor development, these limitations remained almost the same. To deal with these problems, two possible solutions have been reported. The first one is the work under fixed experimental conditions [32, 45, 46]. Careful system design and sample preconditioning can help to reduce the relative change of other controlling parameters of the sensor. However, this approach can make the overall instrument more complex and expensive and can also affect its portability or limit sample throughput. The second approach is a parametric compensation approach that has been used as an input to artificial neural network [38]. In this approach, the sensors are calibrated under varying controlling parameters and data is updated in subsequent analysis. The relative success of these laboratory based approaches is not good enough to mimic the real environment where analytes must be detected under varying background conditions and in the midst of interfering compounds.


5.3.2 Odor Monitoring
Odor monitoring is usually associated with the assessment of the quality of food, drink or perfume. Portable and laboratory gas monitoring sometimes lead to identifying an odorous source because of the chemical differences between the emissions. However, because of the many potential odorous sources and their chemical similarities or complexities, odor measurement is the direct way to compare and quantify the various source contributions. Cross-reactive sensor arrays show distinctive response patterns for different odors without breaking the compounds in individual components [47]. A quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) based electronic nose (e-nose) comprised of six channels with molecularly imprinted polymer has been reported for monitoring terpene emissions from odoriferous plants [48]. Various pattern recognition analyses have also been used to control bad odor in landfill sites [49]. Recently, Leilei Pan and Simon X. Yang have shown an e-nose network system for online monitoring of livestock farm odors [50]. They used tin dioxide and tungsten oxide for detecting ethanol, ammonia, propionic acid, 2-butanol, H2S, trimethylamine, acetic acid, benzyl alcohol and amino compounds. The integration of e-nose, network architecture, and data analysis software gives the feature of remote monitoring of livestock odor in real time. Table 5.3 provides a list of sensor array applications to odor problems [51].Table 5.3Sensor array applications to odor problems [51]ReferencesSystem architectureApplications[52]20 element conductive polymer arrayOdors from livestock wastes[53]20 element conductive polymer arrayOdor components of pig slurry[54]20 and 32 element conductive polymer arrayCattle slurry related odors[55, 56]12 element conductive polymer arraySewage treatment works

With the continuous growth of human population in urban regions, landfill sites and wastewater treatment plants near the urban life are becoming a common issue. Generation of malodor creates public nuisance and hamper daily lives. Inspection of malodors from waste management plants or landfill sites are usually required for compliance monitoring, planning, site expansion and review of operational practices. Usual methods of odor sensing, such as dilution-to-threshold and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, are not suited for continuous and real-time operation on site. A. C. Romain et al. have reported a five malodor detection scheme using tin oxide, which is based on the previously reported recognition of synthetic single-component odors [57]. Recent works by a number of groups indicate the potential applications of e-nose for future air quality monitoring [58-65]. Use of nonspecific sensor array and development of odor footprint and classification will help to resolve any odor nuisance problem. However, successful applications of e-nose require the need for calibration against olfactometric measurements [66, 67]. In addition, it needs to address the relationship between sensor output and odor intensity [68-71].


5.3.3 Continuous Monitoring of the Environment
Continuous and real-time environmental monitoring poses several challenges unlike the detection of target analytes under laboratory-controlled conditions. In an ever-changing environmental condition, the composition and concentration of the sample varies as a result of cyclic variation of the process or emission rate of the substances. The frequency of sampling and detection has become increasingly important which require faster response time of the sensors. This is really important in industrial applications where a controlled environment with fixed temperature and moisture level are required for the manufacturing process. The recent developments of air and water quality monitoring systems have been described in the following two sections.


5.3.4 Air Quality Monitoring
Detection of vapors or gaseous compounds in air has become increasingly important in the context of environmental monitoring and control. A smart gas sensor system for monitoring environmental changes in a closed system has been reported by Persaud [72]. A hybrid sensor array combining conducting polymer gas and quartz microbalance sensors, has been developed for continuous monitoring of the environment in the MIR space station during the MIR-95 and DARA MIR-97 missions over a 6-month period. The study shows that the system is capable of monitoring the changes in air quality in real-time as the cosmonauts carried out their daily routines, and is able to monitor simulated pollution as well as accidental leakage, spillage, and fire events. The reported smart gas system is capable of sensing complex mixtures of volatile substances and, for over a year, the system shows little degradation or drift in its performance. H. Nanto et al. have demonstrated synthetic polymer-film-coated quartz resonators as potential gas sensors for smart e-nose applications [73]. As selective sensing membranes, the quartz resonators are coated with propylene-butyl, polycarbonate and acrylic-resin, and the sensors exhibit high selectivity for harmful gases such as toluene, acetaldehyde and ammonia. Recently, efforts have been made for the development of low-cost, compact, and portable sensor system for the detection of chemical compounds and pollutants [28, 74]. Figure 5.9 shows the gas sensor and micromachined wafer [28]. Integration of microsensor and integrated circuit systems, pattern recognition software and networking facilities provide a truly compact portable system. Even though some practical limitations hamper the system performance, continuous research in this field is necessary to achieve maturity.Fig. 5.9Gas sensor and micromachined wafer [28]



5.3.5 Water Quality Monitoring
Water quality monitoring is extremely important for household and industrial applications. Even though antipollution measures have taken over the past half-century to reduce the water pollution, the amount of potentially hazardous chemical substances is still very large and new types of pollutants are continuously being developed and released. Several works have been reported for the detection of hydrophobic and highly volatile organic compounds (VOC's) in water. Advances in sensor technology as well as computing and pattern recognition facility have lead to the development of on-line detection of oils and petroleum hydrocarbons [32, 45]. An e-nose with 12-element sensor array using specific conductive polymer or a combination of a range of materials, such as metal oxide, conductive polymer, surface acoustic wave devices and metal with catalytic activity, has been reported for the detection of VOC's and organic pollution in waste water in process treatment plants [75, 76]. In this process, the wastewater sample is subjected to a 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) test and the dissolved oxygen concentration is measured using Winkler titration method. This data is then correlated with the responses of e-nose to reduce the dimensionality of the sensor response. Recently, a study has been conducted using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) for the detection of priority pollutants in personal care products ingredients (PCPI) and other emerging contaminants in wastewater and surface water samples [77]. The emerging contaminants include a wide-range of chemicals in our daily lives, such as synthetic fragrance, U-V filters, antiseptics, antioxidants, insect repellents, etc. Using selective ion monitoring (SIM) or tandem-mass-spectrometry and analyzing the scanned data with deconvolution reporting software (DRS), it is possible to identify a target contaminant from a list of 934 organic contaminants. The most prominent feature of this approach is that it can be used to analyze a large number of contaminants instead of a subset of target contaminants. J. Regueiro et al. have presented a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method with GC-MS for the detection and analysis of chlorinated toluenes in water samples [78]. Chlorotoluene isomer mixtures with a high amount of o-chlorotoluene are widely used for industry applications such as for the purpose of metal-cleaning formulations, railroad industrial cleaners, diesel fuel additives, carbon removal procedures, etc. Incorporation of SPME with GC-MS gives a fast and simple method for the detection of volatile organic compounds. Based on the specific reaction of silver (Ag) nanoparticles and cyanide (CN-), a novel electrochemical sensor has been reported for the detection of cyanide in water [79]. In this work, the silver nanoparticles doped porous silica composites are self-assembled onto a gold electrode and the resultant electrode is used for cyclic voltammetry. Figure 5.10 shows the cyclic voltammetric experimental results in the presence and absence of cyanide molecules. Although the above cited works show better sensitivity for detecting the target molecules in water sample, most of these works indicate laboratory-based setup with prolonged response time. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of microsensor with higher sensitivity, selectivity, and faster response time for real-time operation. In addition, incorporation of early warning devices with sensors for the recognition of abrupt changes and sending alarm signals will be of particular interests for industry applications.Fig. 5.10Cyclic voltammograms of Ag nanoparticles in 0.01 molL−1 of KNO3 at pH 9. (a) absence of cyanide (b) presence of cyanide (1.5 × 10−5 molL−1) [79]




5.4 Security Applications
The detection of explosive compounds in various environmental conditions is a challenging task for counter-terrorism efforts including real-time detection of explosives in the passenger baggage-screening as well as detection of mines and other explosives in war fields [80-84]. Canines have been traditionally the best natural detectors for explosives, but they have very limited attention span measured in tens of minutes and are not cost-effective as a dog handler team is typically very expensive. However, it is still the most widely used method and is highly effective. Since the trace explosive detection based on canines is neither cost-effective nor suitable for mass deployment [85, 86], various electronic devices or instruments based on ion mobility spectroscopy, nuclear quadrupole resonance, IR spectroscopy, etc. have been developed [87, 88], and some of them have even been commercialized. However, each approach has inherent advantages and disadvantages, and a common property associated with each is the high complexity that limits its miniaturization. In addition, recent bioterrorism activities have triggered advanced research in the field of biological and chemical sensors. Safeguarding human and environmental resources against harmful agents requires the development of new in situ, real time monitoring devices that can be deployed in multiple strategic locations. The ideal sensor system should be compact, cost-effective and capable of detecting low concentrations of pollutants, toxic chemicals and warfare agents.
Even though homeland security applications demands real-time, miniature sensors, high sensitivity detection of explosives still remains as a crucial challenge[80-89]. Micro-electromechanical systems [MEMS] have shown potential to satisfy many of the requirements for an ideal compact chemical sensor, such as low-power consumption, real-time operation, and high sensitivity [90-93]. However, the suitability of MEMS as practical sensors for vapor detection has been limited by lack of chemical selectivity [92]. Efforts have been made to achieve selectivity by using sensor arrays modified with partially selective, reversible interfaces, and pattern recognition work [94-98].
Explosive detection can be classified as: (a) point sensing, (b) remote detection, and (c) standoff detection.
(a)Point sensing: In this approach, explosive trace detection involves collecting and characterizing trace levels of explosives either as residues or vapors released from bulk material by using point sensors [12]. (b)Remote detection: The remote detection is carried out at a distance with the equipment remaining at close proximity to the explosive and only the operators remain at safe distances [99]. (c)Standoff detection is carried out at a distance similar to the remote detection technique, but in this case, both the operators/screener and the equipment remain at a safe distance away from the object. 

Although a number of different approaches have been developed for explosive detection, microcantilever sensors offer many orders of magnitude better sensitivity compared to other sensor topologies. In addition, microcantilevers have smaller surface areas (∼10−5 cm2) compared to other devices, can be used in a number of modes, can be mass produced and can detect a large number of chemical and biological substances.
The concept of detecting explosives with MEMS technology has been reported as early as in 1995. A silicon microcantilever resonator was developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) [100], which functioned as a vapor sensor. The microcantilver when coated with specific organic film can detect gaseous chemicals with high degree of sensitivity. In 1997, a group at Duke University reported a method of detecting explosive particles by remotely stimulating the target area with high-intensity a focused ultrasonic beam, which loosens the explosive particles for sampling [101]. The particles are then placed on bimetallic cantilever beams of aluminum/poly-silicon and irradiated with infrared light (λ ∼ 3-5 μm). The particles selectively absorb the energy of the infrared light and decompose, thereby releasing heat, which is detected by the cantilever beam. The beam bending, detected by optical method involving laser and position sensitive device gives a measure of the quantity of the explosives in the vapor system. The same group reported detection of nanograms of TNT, DNT and RDX particles using the method [101, 102]. Measurement of the displacement of the cantilever is schematically shown in Fig. 5.11 [91].Fig. 5.11Test setup showing measurement of the displacement of the cantilevers

A number of other methods for detection of explosives have been reported. In one of these methods, known as infrared microcalorimetric spectroscopy, a scanning monochrometer and a thermal detector are used to obtain infrared microcalorimetric spectra of TNT [103]. Another explosive detection technique based on deflagration, which is the characteristic property of a substance, has been reported [104]. A piezoelectric/piezoresistive cantilever was used in this scheme and is operated in self-sensing mode by means of an AC bridge circuit, as shown in Fig. 5.12. A voltage pulse was applied to the integrated piezoresistor which raised the cantilever temperature beyond the deflagration point of TNT. TNT particles are then gradually loaded onto the cantilever. This resulted in a miniature deflagration, and the corresponding resonance frequency shift of the cantilever is measured to detect very small amount of TNT (∼70 pg).Fig. 5.12Deflagration and detection of trinitrotoluene TNT. (a) Sensor output as function of time, (b) diagram of the microcantilever, showing the integrated piezoelectric sensor, piezoresistive heater, and TNT loaded on the cantilever

A hand held explosive detection sensor system based on piezoresistive microcantilevers has been reported [105], as shown if Fig. 5.13. The two gold-coated microcantilevers have been used for the sensor; one of these was coated with a self-assembled monolayer of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid that binds the explosive molecules and the uncoated microcantilever was used as a reference. The signal from the Wheatstone bridge circuit was amplified, converted to a digital signal, and sent to a laptop computer for analysis. The sensor has been called "SniffEx" because it was developed for the detection of explosive vapors. The pump was used only for "sniffing" experiments. Detection of PETN and RDX vapors with sensitivity at parts-per-trillion levels has been reported by this group.Fig. 5.13Schematic diagram of the SniffEx sensor [105]

Figure 5.14 shows the photograph of the "SniffEx" hand held detection system. The flow cell is located at the top of the figure. A small pump used to extract vapor is shown on the top left-hand side, and the battery powering the pump is on the top right-hand side. The battery located at the bottom is used to power the sensor electronics when the system is used to interface with a PDA. A standoff explosive detection technique using photothermal cantilevers has been reported by the same group [106].Fig. 5.14Photograph of the "SniffEx" hand held detection system [105]



5.5 Healthcare Applications
Recent technological improvements of healthcare monitoring equipments, micro- and nano-fabrication processes and wireless communication technologies have led to the development of miniature, light-weight, and energy-efficient circuit solutions for biomedical sensor applications. The silicon-based microfabrication and microelectromechanical (MEMS) techniques have been successfully applied for the fabrication of a large range of miniature biomedical sensors. Ubiquitous growth of wireless sensor networks has opened up a new and innovative application of wireless technology in medical as well as in healthcare field. This trend has just been started and it is expected that wireless networks are going to become an integral part of medical solutions due to their benefits in reducing healthcare costs and increasing accessibility for the patients as well as the healthcare professionals. This perspective has given birth to a new sensor network called Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) or Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). In near future, this WBAN will coexist with the installed infrastructure, help augment the data collection and provide real-time response among the patients and the healthcare providers. Examples of areas in which future medical systems can be benefited the most from wireless sensor networks are in-home assistance, smart homecare, and patient monitoring in emergency unit after physical rehabilitation.
Figure 5.15 shows a broad range of applications of wireless networks in medical field [107]. Wireless technology provides an efficient tool for providing instant access to patient data, lab results, clinical histories, insurance information, etc., so that immediate healthcare is ensured in case of emergency, eliminating the dependence on the sketchy clinical decision or wasteful medical duplications. Wireless technology can also improve the efficiency of the hospital staffs in different sectors ranging from patient database monitoring to hospital inventory management. A hospital staff can monitor the patient database in the hospital or manage the hospital inventory within a very short time by using radio frequency identification (RFID) network. RFID network can also help to identify the location of a physician or a patient within the hospital premises in case of special need or situation. A surgeon or a physician can inspect the status of a telesurgery, or monitor the vital signs of patients using wireless personal area network (WPAN), respectively, and can provide valuable feedback in case of emergency situation. Nurses in a hospital can take care of a patient efficiently and in a real-time manner by observing vital signs of the patients through WBAN and WPAN. Moreover, in case of any unknown abnormal symptoms patient data could be sent to a specialist for diagnosis and future medical treatments. This is not the end. Wireless technology helps in extending healthcare up to a patient's home by using the concept of telemedicine or smart-home-care.Fig. 5.15Applications of wireless networks in medical field

Telemedicine is a new concept where a patient staying in home can even be monitored by using smart medical devices and WBAN. In this case, various types of implantable or transdermal sensors are placed within the vicinity of the human body to continuously monitor various physiological parameters and send the signal to a nearby hub station (see Fig. 5.16). This hub could be either a cell phone or personal digital assistant (PDA). Then, using the existing secure communication technologies, the sensor signals are transmitted to doctors, nurses or healthcare providers. Based on the sensor signals coming from the patient, the physician or healthcare provider can initiate necessary action, for instance, artificial dose control in emergency situation. This WBAN and telemedicine platform could also be configured for object location, medicine reminder or emergency alert in case of any sign of fatal disease.Fig. 5.16Conceptual block diagram of WBAN and Telemedicine

Telesurgery is another promising concept of combining existing medical and communication technologies on the same platform. Here, a patient stays far away from an expert surgeon and the surgeon's activities are impersonated by robot manipulators. The surgeon controls the robot manipulators from a remote location and the link between the surgeon and the robot manipulators is maintained by the existing matured communication technology. As reported in Nature Science Journal, the first telesurgery was performed on September 19, 2001 when the surgeons from New York, USA, accomplished a gallbladder surgery in Strasbourg, France, using a three-arm robot manipulator as shown in Fig. 5.17. The trans-Atlantic fiber-optic link was used to maintain the reliable communication between New York, USA and Strasbourg, France. There was a time delay between the initiation of an action and the real operation, but the operation was successful.Fig. 5.17First telesurgery using trans-Atlantic fiber-optic link


5.5.1 Sensor Networks for Medical Applications
Various types of wireless networks have been investigated in the past and in the recent years for health care applications. In this section, a short description of different wireless networks used for medical applications will be discussed.

5.5.1.1 Wireless Body Area Network
Prolific growths of microsensors, integrated circuit technologies and wireless networks have introduced the necessity of low-power sensor platforms that can be integrated in wireless body area network (WBAN). The low-power requirement of these networks has made them best suited for integration into wearable health monitoring units (WHMU) [108]. WHMU are usually incorporated with various types of implantable or transdermal sensors to measure various physiological parameters such as ECG, blood pressure, blood glucose level, motion/tilt, etc. [109]. WBAN can be used inside a hospital to monitor patients in critical conditions. This can also be used in "smart homecare" for data augmentation and transmission over the Internet to doctors, nurses or healthcare providers in real time.


5.5.1.2 Radio Frequency Identification
Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has a wide variety of applications such as goods logistics, pet and human identification, healthcare and others. [110]. Hospital staffs can efficiently monitor the hospital inventory with the help of RFID tags. These tags can also be used to identify the location of a patient or a physician within the hospital premises and they can be recalled in emergency situation.


5.5.1.3 Wireless Personal Area Network
Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) [111-113] using IEEE 802.15.4 or Bluetooth have potential uses in the medical fields. WPAN is used for short distance communication and hence these networks can be used to monitor patients in real-time by a nurse without frequent visits to patient's room. This certainly helps to improve the monitoring performance and work efficiency of hospital staffs. WPAN can also be used for transferring data among multiple expensive and large devices within the hospital with minimum time overhead.


5.5.1.4 Sensor Networks
Unobtrusive access to health information is made possible by combining sensor network technologies such as Zigbee [111] with WBAN [114]. This combination forms smaller scale networks that can be easily placed on human clothing. A good example of an application of sensor networks in the medical field is the CodeBlue project [108] being developed at Harvard University. Other experimental applications include forest fire detection and path tracking using ad hoc sensor networks [115]. Due to the low-cost and low-power consumption of the sensor network devices, they can be easily deployed ubiquitously. Some of the wireless sensor network devices use their own operating system called the TinyOS. Therefore, they can be programmed over the air, making their management very easy.


5.5.1.5 GPRS/UMTS
GPRS and UMTS wireless technologies have also found their uses in the area of medical applications. An application called "MobiHealth" has been designed by using WBAN with GPRS/UMTS for Internet connectivity.


5.5.1.6 Wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11)
Nowadays, wireless local area network (WLAN) access is available in most of the hospitals, universities and corporate offices. Some of the benefits of this technology are used for medical applications. In "Telemedicine," WLAN, in association with WBAN, is used to monitor the vital signs of a remote patient. Patient's data transfer within the hospital or communication among different medical devices is also made possible using this wireless network.




5.6 Conclusions
This chapter provides a discussion on sensor prototypes for environmental monitoring, explosive detection and healthcare applications. It is becoming increasingly important to have intelligent sensors to safeguard our environment against harmful agents, to protect our citizens from explosive-based terrorism and to protect our soldiers from IEDs and land mines in the battlefields. In addition, smart healthcare and telemedicine are becoming parts of our healthcare system, and require smart, low-cost sensors to monitor medical data.

6.1 Introduction
Technological improvements in fabrication of sensors and microfabrication processes have resulted in the development of high-resolution, high-sensitivity, inexpensive, and low-power microsensors for industrial, medical, security, and environmental applications. Ongoing research reveals the achievement of different sensor prototypes and smart electronics for monitoring or inspection of various physical, biomedical, or chemical substances. Design and development of a smart sensor system necessitate considerations of several parameters for reliable operation of the system. This chapter addresses two important design parameters such as power management and temperature compensation of the integrated electronic system. This will be followed by a discussion on a sensor system developed in the recent years.


6.2 Power Management
The continuous trends of integrating several components (analog and digital blocks) to implement a smart system are complicating the system design. The difficulties are arising from not only the diverging technology requirements of analog and digital blocks, but also the cross-talk in between these two types of blocks. To resolve this problem, several design methodologies have been adopted such as: [1]
1.Noise reduction of digital integrated circuits 2.Design of low-noise analog blocks 3.Reduce the cross-coupling in between the digital and analog blocks 

In addition to this noise reduction of digital and analog blocks, the power supplies to the integrated circuits need to be stable, constant, and accurate for reliable operation of analog, digital, and mixed-signal blocks. Supply voltages of microsensor instrumentations usually come from battery, solar power, vibration, inductive power link, etc. These sources are noisy, and their supply voltages fluctuate with temperature and age. Therefore, a power management block with sensor instrumentation is essential to regulate or control the supply voltages. For an inductively powered implant system, RF power is supplied using a carrier signal, which needs to be converted to a DC voltage using a rectifier and regulate the DC voltage employing a low-dropout (LDO) voltage regulator.
Figure 6.1 shows the block diagram of a typical power management block that manifests a rectifier and an LDO. As mentioned earlier, a rectifier circuit is needed to convert any alternating signal to a pure DC signal. For an inductive power link system, a rectifier is an indispensable element to rectify or convert the power carried by an RF carrier to a DC signal. In case of a battery-driven system, the rectifier block is replaced with a filter block to filter out any unwanted signal from the supply line. The next block of the power management unit is LDO. In reality, in a low-power system wherein there is a little room to control the raw supply voltage, an LDO is the most crucial element to control or to regulate the supply voltage with minimum dropout. In the following sections, the basic principles of an LDO have been covered.Fig. 6.1Typical power management unit of an integrated system



6.3 Energy Sources
Replacement of batteries for portable device or sensor applications is not being considered a user-friendly approach for a long time. Energy harvesting from the environment is a well-known alternative to battery source. The basic idea is to convert the energy available around the environment of a device by using a transducer into electrical energy and use the energy for device operation. Various types of schemes have been proposed to replace the batteries [2], the most familiar being the solar power, which is often used in electronic calculators, wrist watches, and similar portable electronic devices. There are plenty of other energy sources available such as electromagnetic fields (used in RFID tags, smart card reader, noninvasive pacemaker battery recharging), thermal gradients, fluid flow, and mechanical vibration, energy produced by the human body [3] or the action of gravitational fields [4].
A short list of energy sources and their corresponding power output has been depicted in Table 6.1 [5]. By using a piezoelectric transducer in the heel of a shoe, the harnessed energy from footsteps has been reported to be 5 W [3]. This is based on a direct conversion technique, but the usable energy, however, will be significantly lower. The advancement in photovoltaic cell technology has resulted in a conversion efficiency of more than 40% [6]. A typical incident power density of 100 mW/cm2 yields 40 mW for 1 cm2 array. Coupled magnetic field using on-chip inductor can generate 1.5 mW of power [7]. A macroscopic generator converting the vibrations of human walking can generate a power output of 400 μW. The energy produced in this way is much smaller than that of the direct conversion approach, but is still adequate to drive a large variety of electronic devices. An MEMS transducer coupled to a much higher frequency vibration source has also been reported to generate 100 μW of power [5].Table 6.1Different energy sourcesEnergy sourceTransducerPowerWalking (direct conversion)Piezoelectric5 WSolarPhotovoltaic cell40 mWMagnetic fieldCoil1.5 mWWalking (vibration)Discrete moving coil400 μWHigh frequency vibrationMEMS moving coil100 μWRF fieldAntenna5 μW



6.4 Low-Dropout Voltage Regulator
An LDO regulator is a DC linear voltage regulator that offers a much lower minimum required voltage (the dropout voltage) between its input and output voltage levels than other types of regulators. Ideally, the dropout voltage should be as small as possible to minimize the power consumption and maximize the efficiency. Because of the low dropout voltage, LDO can provide a stable DC output with a raw supply voltage of only a few hundred millivolts above the desired voltage level.
An LDO offers a lot more advantages compared to a switch-mode regulator, which operates with a switching frequency ranging from 50 KHz to 1 MHz. This high-frequency switching creates electromagnetic interference (EMI) that affects analog and RF circuits inside the chip. On the other hand, the low "quiescent" current and the low dropout voltage of an LDO make it a suitable candidate for low-power analog and RF applications. The lowest usable supply voltage of a regulator is determined by the dropout voltage and the desired output voltage. As for example, if the dropout voltage of an LDO regulator is 700 mV and an output voltage of 3.3 V is required, then the minimum supply voltage has got to be 4 V. Figure 6.2 shows the transfer characteristics of an LDO with different regions of operation. The dropout voltage of LDO is defined by the resistance of a pass element and the current flowing through it. It is evident that the higher the dropout voltage, the higher is the minimum supply requirement.Fig. 6.2Transfer characteristics of an LDO with different regions of operation

There are mainly two types of LDO regulators:
1.Series Regulator 2.Shunt Regulator 

In case of a series regulator, the output voltage is controlled by a series element, whereas in case of a shunt regulator, a shunt element is used to control the output.


6.5 Series Regulator
A series regulator is usually composed of four elements as depicted in Fig. 6.3. They are
1.Voltage Reference 2.Pass Element 3.Sampling Resistors 4.Error Amplifier 
Fig. 6.3Schematic of an LDO

One input of the error amplifier is connected to stable reference voltage coming from a bandgap voltage reference block. The second input of the error amplifier monitors the changes of the output voltage sampled by the resistor network. If the output of the LDO regulator changes to too high or too low relative to the reference voltage, the error amplifier generates a drive voltage for the pass element to allow less or more current, respectively, to stabilize the output. The complete schematic of LDO with circuit load has been shown in Fig. 6.4 [8].Fig. 6.4Schematic of a series LDO regulator with load [2]

The following paragraphs provide a short description of different blocks of a series regulator.

6.5.1 Sampling Resistors
The sampling resistors, R1 and R2, sample the output voltage to an appropriate level to compare it with the reference voltage at the input of the error amplifier. Since almost zero current flows at the input terminals of the operational amplifier (opamp) or error amplifier and the input terminals are virtually shorted (due to negative feedback), this circuit configuration provides high input impedance to the voltage reference. In addition, very low output impedance exits at the output terminal, which is the requirement of a good voltage source [9]. If the output voltage is V
out, the sampling resistors produce sampled output voltage expressed as,
(6.1)



6.5.2 Error Amplifier
The error amplifier is basically an operational amplifier. The error amplifier compares the sampled output with a reference voltage V
REF, usually generated by a bandgap reference generator and adjusts the output to reduce the error. For a relatively large loop gain, the sampled voltage, V
sample becomes equal to V
REF and the error is driven to zero. In this condition, the output voltage can be expressed as,
(6.2)

This relationship holds as long as the supply voltage is large enough to keep the error amplifier and the pass element away from saturation. The minimum voltage difference in between the supply and the output voltage to maintain the loop control is defined as the dropout voltage. This can be expressed as,
(6.3)

The dropout voltage is an intrinsic factor in determining the efficiency of a regulator [2] irrespective of the load condition. The efficiency of an LDO is depicted as,
(6.4)

From (6.4), it is obvious that the dropout voltage should be as small as possible to improve the efficiency of LDO.

Cadence spectre™ simulation results reveal the performance of the designed circuit. Table 6.1 depicts the performance summary of the designed circuitFig. 6.5Circuit schematic of a CMOS operational amplifier



6.5.3 Pass Element
Pass element is used to boost up the output driving current capabilities of the error amplifier. The error amplifier generates the driving voltage of the pass element under varying load conditions. Depending upon the relative change of the output voltage from the specified level, the error amplifier produces either high or low driving voltage to control the current flow through the pass element and stabilizes the output. Based on the type of pass element, the sampled output voltage is connected either to the positive or to the negative terminal of the error amplifier. If the pass element is p-type (PMOS or PNP), the sampled output voltage is connected to the positive input of the error amplifier. On the other hand, for n-type pass element (NMOS or NPN), the sampled output is connected to the negative input of the error amplifier.
The four basic types of the pass element are shown in Fig. 6.6. A comparative study of the performance of different types of pass elements is shown in Table 6.3 [10]. The lowest dropout voltage can be achieved by using PNP or PMOS type pass element, which is one source-drain saturation voltage, VSD,SAT, and one emitter-collector saturation voltage, VEC,SAT, respectively [8]. Furthermore, the n-type pass element requires a positive drive voltage higher than the output voltage, which becomes difficult to generate at low supply voltage. Therefore, the p-type pass elements are more attractive.Fig. 6.6Different types of pass element: (a) NPN, (b) PNP, (c) NMOS, (d) PMOS [8]

Unlike PNP, PMOS type pass element offers lower ground current and lower dropout voltage, which are highly desirable for low-voltage operation. In the dropout region, PMOS pass element behaves as a linear resistor, and the resistance is referred to as drain-to-source resistance, R
SD,ON. The value of this resistor depends upon the physical layout and the drive voltage of the pass element. The product of R
SD,ON and the output current determines the source-drain saturation voltage of the PMOS, which is also the dropout voltage of the regulator. In case of a PNP type pass element, the dropout voltage is set by the emitter-collector saturation voltage, V
EC,SAT, which is usually higher than the source-drain saturation voltage, V
SD,SAT of the PMOS type pass element. Therefore, the PMOS type pass element is an excellent choice for the design of an LDO regulator [11].


6.5.4 Voltage Reference
The voltage reference sets the output voltage. The accuracy of the output voltage depends on the accuracy and stable operation of the voltage reference. However, temperature variation and aging drift the output voltage of the reference generator. Therefore, bandgap reference generator is widely used to produce a high-precision, low-drift reference voltage.



6.6 Temperature Compensation
Bandgap voltage reference combines the positive temperature coefficient (TC) of the thermal voltage with the negative TC of the forward biased diode voltage. The perfect balance of positive and negative TCs gives a temperature independent reference voltage. Once a voltage reference with zero TC is achieved, it can be used to generate multiples of the reference voltage using an opamp just like an LDO regulator circuit.
Usually, the parasitic vertical pnp BJT is used in a standard CMOS process to implement negative TC of a diode. However, a weak inversion MOSFET also behaves as a BJT and shows negative TC. In Fig. 6.7, a simple bandgap reference circuit has been shown using PMOS transistors in weak inversion regime. In fact, the bandgap reference circuit is composed of a proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) block and a constant to absolute temperature block (CTAT). The PTAT block is implemented by utilizing the positive and negative TCs of the thermal voltage and the weak inversion PMOS, respectively. The current generated by the PTAT block is then passed through a CTAT block, wherein the negative TC of a BJT and the positive TC of a resistor are used to generate a stable reference voltage. Figure 6.8 shows the generated reference voltage with varying temperature for different process corners.Fig. 6.7Circuit schematic of a bandgap circuit using weak inversion PMOS

6.7 ASIC Design Board-Level Implementation, and Monolithic Integration
In this section, the design and implementation of a low-power application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) have been discussed. The system has been implemented using 0.35-μm standard CMOS process and the fabricated chip consumes only 100-μW of power while occupies an area of 0.66 mm2. The circuit is capable of converting any generic biosensor's current signal into an amplitude shift keying (ASK) signal. A programmable frequency divider is incorporated to fix the ASK envelope frequency to be in between 100 Hz and 2 KHz, which is within the audible range of human ears. The entire system can operate with a supply voltage as low as 1.5 V, and it can be easily powered up by an external RF source. Test results corroborate the efficacy of the designed system.

6.7.1 Literature Review
Continuous health monitoring is an important issue in the process of maintaining a digital health record. Continuous health monitoring systems are now becoming a reality with the integration of microelectronic systems with implantable biosensors. Recent advancement of microfabrication technology is making it feasible to build inexpensive, accurate, and reliable implantable biomedical sensors with integrated microelectronic circuits for sensor signal processing and transmission of the processed signal outside of the human body. Significant research has been done to investigate the possibility for continuous in vivo measurement and monitoring of various physiological variables by means of an implantable sensor, for instance, the blood glucose level [12-16], lactate in the bloodstream or tissues [17], pressure in blood vessels or intracranial compartments [18]. In most cases, the sensor output is an analog current signal, which needs to be further processed and transmitted out of the organic environment (i.e., human body) so that the signal can be detected externally for analysis and initiation of necessary actions.
In order to monitor the senor signal remotely, the implantable sensor unit needs to include a transmitter. Transmission of sensor signals is becoming an essential part for the development of implanted unit. Signal telemetry provides the elimination of electrical artifacts due to the movements of cables in tethered measurements, and the reduction of the risk of skin irritation or infection caused by precutaneous leads in bioimplantable microsystems. Eichenbaum et al. [19] and Pinkwart et al. [20] have reported pioneering telemetry systems for single-neuron recording and wireless brain stimulation. A miniature radio transmitter has been reported for simultaneous recording of multiple single-neuron signals in behaving owls [21]. This discrete two channel system weighs 3.1 gm (without batteries), and measures 2.5 × 1 × 0.5 cm3. Obeid et al. have reported a 16-channel wearable telemetry system for single-unit neural recording that measures 5.1 × 8.1 × 12.4 cm3, weighs 235 gm, and dissipates 4 watts of power from rechargeable lithium-ion batteries [22]. Clearly all of these discrete board-level designs with commercially available electrical components have either prohibitively large dimensions and weight or high power consumption that makes them impractical for general-purpose, low-power applications. Parramon et al. have reported an implantable inductively powered two-channel recording microsystem fabricated in a 2.5-μm BiCMOS process with a current consumption of 4.5 mA at 5 V [23]. Johannessen et al. have reported a microelectronic pill utilizing system-level integration of microsensors and integrated circuits in a four-channel recording device fabricated in a 0.6 μm CMOS process that consumes 12.1 mW of power, measures 5.5 × 1.6 cm2, and weighs 13.5 gm including two silver-oxide batteries [24]. Recently, Mohseni et al. have developed a miniature single-channel and multichannel wireless frequency-modulated systems for biopotential recording applications with substantially lower power dissipation per number of recording channels [25]. Most of these approaches are complex and consume large area, and only a few of them have on-chip biasing options of the corresponding sensors.
In this work, an effective and reliable integrated circuit solution has been proposed for processing a sensor signal with relatively simpler circuitry, on-chip sensor biasing facility, small area consumption, and especially for very low power consumption.


6.7.2 System Architecture
The block diagram of the proposed design is shown in Fig. 6.9. The proposed circuit consists of mainly two fundamental blocks - Signal Processing Block and Potentiostat as shown in Figs. 6.10 and 6.11, respectively. The sensor current is first processed by the signal processing unit to produce ASK signal. To provide enough frequency separation between the data signal and the carrier signal, a programmable divider is used to reduce the data frequency at least ten times less than the carrier frequency. Finally, the potentiostat produces a fixed volatge for proper operation of the sensor part. The detail descriptions of the blocks are as follows.Fig. 6.9Block diagram of the proposed system
Fig. 6.10Block diagram of signal processing unit
Fig. 6.11Block diagram for the potentiostat circuit


6.7.2.1 Signal Processing Block
The schematic of the signal processing unit is shown in Fig. 6.10. The circuit produces ASK signal, which can be received and demodulated by a commercial radio. Sensor current from any implantable sensor is input to the signal processing unit. The diode connected NMOS (N1) in the current mirror (N1, N2) stabilizes the voltage connected to the terminal of the potentiostat to the threshold voltage of an NMOS, which is around 0.5 V. The mirror current, which is proportional to the sensor current, charges the capacitor to supply voltage, which decreases the voltage at the input of the Schmitt trigger. When this voltage goes below the threshold voltage of the Schmitt trigger, the inverter output causes the PMOS to turn on resulting in discharging of the capacitor to start a new cycle. The charging rate of the capacitor is directly proportional to the mirror current. Thus, the frequency of the resulting signal is proportional to the sensor current level. For successful modulation, data signal frequency needs to be much lower than the carrier frequency. Thus, a frequency divider is used to limit the data frequency. The entire circuit consumes very small amount of power and is capable of working at a very low voltage supply. The voltage regulator is added in the circuit to provide a stable supply voltage (V
DD) (approximately 1.25 V) to the signal processing block.


6.7.2.2 Potentiostat
Figure 6.11 shows the circuit schematic of the potentiostat. It maintains a fixed voltage difference of 0.7 V between Work Electrode (Work_el) and Reference Electrode (Ref_el) for proper operation of the sensor. This voltage creates positive and negative charges in the chemical solution. The Collect Electrode (Collect_el) collects the separated charges and finally injects the chemical sensor current to the signal processing circuit.
The working principle of the potentiostat can be explained as follows. U1 and U2 work as buffers, U3 works as a unity gain differential amplifier and finally U4 works as an error amplifier. The voltage regulator maintains a stable 0.7 V reference voltage at the noninverting terminal of the error amplifier. The output of the error amplifier is fed back to the Work_el to compensate any deviation from 0.7 V voltage difference between the Work_el and Ref_el. By applying the KCL at the inverting terminal of U3 (assuming ideal Op-Amp), we can get the following equation,
(6.5)

where V
ref and V
work_el are the potential of Reference Electrode and Work Electrode, respectively.



6.7.3 Test Results
The chip was fabricated using 0.35-μm 2-poly 4-metal CMOS process. Figure 6.12 shows the micrograph of our fabricated chip.Fig. 6.12Microphotograph of the fabricated chip

Figure 6.13 shows the simulation results for the different stages of the circuit using 2.5 V unregulated power supply. The results with a capacitive load of 100 pF show that the on-chip voltage regulator circuit generates about 1.25 V of regulated voltage with the final output to be an ASK signal of 1 MHz carrier frequency.Fig. 6.13(a) Simulation results for the signal processing circuit (b) Closer look to ASK output

From the test results as shown in Fig. 6.14, we found that with a 1.5 V unregulated supply voltage, the power consumption is 100-μW on average. The oscillation frequency is around 924.3 KHz, which is within the AM frequency range. The voltage regulator output is around 1.266 V, which differs from the designed value of 1.25 V by only 1.28%. To synthesize the actual chemical sensor, two equal value resistors are connected in between the Work Electrode and Reference Electrode and in between the Reference Electrode and Collect Electrode. By connecting in this way, a current is generated in the Collect_el, which resembles the sensor current. The idea of using resistors between the electrodes is based on the assumption that there would be certain resistance of chemical solution between any two electrodes. Now, the current flown through the resistors are given by,Fig. 6.14Measurement output of the ASK carrier signal (top trace) and voltage regulator output (bottom trace)
(6.6)

Again, the relationship between the sensed current and the integration time (τ), or the envelope period, is given by,
(6.7)
(6.8)

Figure 6.15 shows the ASK signal for a sensor current level of 2.59 μA. For Fig. 6.15, the resistor value between work electrode and reference electrode is 270 KΩ that produces 2.59 μA of sensor current and the corresponding envelope period becomes 835 μs. The dividing-ratio of the on-chip programmable frequency divider is set to 32, which effectively reduces the frequency of the data signal generated by the sensor current. The carrier frequency of the ASK signal is kept about 0.9 MHz. Figure 6.16 shows the ASK signal for a sensor current of 5.34 μA that corresponds to an envelope period of 400 μs. From measurement results, we can formulate that,Fig. 6.15Measurement output of the ASK signal for sensor current of 2.59 μA
Fig. 6.16Measurement output of the ASK signal for sensor current of 5.34 μA
(6.9)

So, the experimental results agree with the linear relationship given in (6.9). This implies that the envelope frequency of the ASK signal is proportional to the sensor's output current. Figure 6.17 illustrates these findings in terms of ASK signals envelope period vs. sensor equivalent resistance plot for three different chips with corresponding R-squared data. For all of the three fabricated chips, the standard R-squared value is very close to unity, which reveals the linear performance of the system with the variation of sensor signal. Table 6.4 shows the comparison of design specifications between the required, simulated, and measured data.Fig. 6.17Relationship between envelope period and sensor equivalent resistance

6.7.4 Conclusion and Future Works
A low-power sensor signal read-out circuit with on-chip sensor biasing facility has been developed using standard CMOS process. The proposed scheme consumes very small power and generates an ASK signal, which can be received and detected by a commercial radio receiver. The on-chip sensor biasing facilitates the area efficient realization of the biosensors. This low power circuit topology offers the feasibility of designing a sensor chip powered by inductive link for long-term stability of monitoring various physiological parameters from an implanted unit. Future work will include an integrated electrochemical sensor with a miniature on-chip antenna to increase the transmit range within an appreciable limit.



6.8 Summary
Evolution of smart sensor system has made it possible the widespread usage of sensors in environmental, security, military, or healthcare applications. Development of smart sensor system necessitates considerations of several design parameters. This chapter has discussed such three design parameters - energy source, power management, and temperature compensation. Detail description has been provided for the development of a low-dropout series voltage regulator, which is an integral part of power management unit. At the end of the chapter, the design and monolithic integration of a sensor signal processing system prototype has been discussed.

For monolithic integration and low-power sensor signal processing, device concept is an important issue. Device dynamics, especially the leakage current, is a dominant factor of power consumption for low-power low-current integrated circuits. In Chap. 2, device physics of the bulk CMOS and the SOI CMOS processes has been covered, and the leakage current reduction schemes have been addressed.

In Chap. 3, an overview of low-power circuit design techniques, device scaling, and the challenges associated with the circuit design with reduced power supply voltage has been presented. With the trend of device scaling, supply voltage is scaling down more rapidly than the threshold voltage. As such, cascode circuit topologies are no longer feasible for low supply voltage headroom, and there is an urgent need to develop new circuit topologies for low-power circuit applications. A discussion on the state-of-art circuit design techniques to work with the limited voltage headroom has been included in this chapter.
Integration of wireless technology with the sensor front end gives a new dimension in low-power sensor world. Short distance wireless telemetry is always an attractive solution for tetherless continuous monitoring of sensor data. In Chap. 4, a short discussion of some of the simple wireless telemetry schemes, which are best suited for low-power sensor applications and short distance telemetry, has been provided.
In Chaps. 5 and 6, a number of sensor prototypes with applications in the areas as diverse as environmental monitoring, counter terrorism, and smart health care have been presented. Issues related to the development of sensor prototypes and associated electronics to achieve high signal-to-noise ratio have also been discussed in these chapters. One topic, which has not been included in these chapters, is the emerging technology of nanostructured sensors as it is beyond the scope of this book. A number of different nanostructured sensors using vertically aligned carbon nanofibers, single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes have been reported. The nanostructured sensors have demonstrated their capabilities to provide a basis for small volume electroanalyses in probing regions typically above planar substrates in silicon compatible technology and are well suited to characterize electrochemical phenomena with an unprecedented degree of spatial resolution. The probe arrays are limited only by the fabrication interconnect density, which will enable the development of massively parallel electrochemical sensing devices for various applications such as environmental sensing, space exploration, agriculture, and smart health care.

Preface

Low-power smart sensor technology has been receiving greater interests among scientists, physicians and engineers in the recent years as new and promising developments have been made in both sensor fabrication and wireless telemetry. The realization of complex analytical systems including sensors is now feasible because of the high degree of miniaturization of many classic measurement techniques. The recent advancements in CMOS technology have led to further development of the highly complex integrated circuits with significantly reduced power dissipation. This has made possible the realization of intelligent sensors with wireless transmission capabilities. This new class of sensors is extensively contributing to a broad range of activities with applications in environmental monitoring, agriculture, food safety, space applications as well as in counter terrorism. The emergence of the telemedicine concept coupled with tremendous growth of the wireless sensor networks has opened up a new and innovative application of wireless sensor technology in medical as well as in healthcare field. This effort attempted to cover the broad range of topics related to sensors and sensor electronics.
The book is aimed at the sensor research community as well as a text book for advanced graduate level courses in sensor technology. It is also intended to be a reference book for practicing engineers in industry and should assist them in the development of new products with improved features. The book includes: a cohesive treatment of the general concept of the working principle of a sensor and its applications, an extensive discussion on the fundamentals of the emerging sensor technologies, a discussion on device physics of bulk CMOS and SOI CMOS processes with respect to monolithic sensor integration and low-power sensor signal processing. In addition, the book provides an insight into the design challenges associated with low-power analog circuits, and the schemes to overcome them, and wireless telemetry schemes for low-power and short distance communications. This is followed by a compressive discussion on various sensor prototypes with applications in the areas as diverse as environmental monitoring, counter terrorism, and health care with emphasis on design of low-power sensor electronics.
We are grateful to a number of colleagues who have assisted us in various ways during the preparation of the manuscript. We particularly like to thank Dr. Steve Ripp for sharing his insight and understanding of the biosensor technology, and Dr. Paul Crilly for his advice and encouragement throughout the course of this venture. Special thank goes to Dr. Sazia Afeen Eliza for her help with the research related to the materials for this book.
