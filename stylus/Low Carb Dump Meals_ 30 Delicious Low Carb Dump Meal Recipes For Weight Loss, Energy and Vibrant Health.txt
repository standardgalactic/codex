Introduction
 
Low carbohydrate
diets have become a mainstream way of eating for many people. What was
initially popular as a fad diet has evolved to become
a lifestyle that provides a solid foundation for good health, energy and
longevity. Regardless if you are new to low carb eating, or if this has been
your dietary lifestyle for years, you are reading this because you know that
when done properly, a low carb diet will help you lose weight, improve your
overall health and instill a sense of enthusiasm and vibrancy in your everyday
life. What this book will do for you is take all of the benefits of low
carbohydrate eating and make them more accessible through simple, easy and
healthy "Dump" meals that take minimum time and effort on your part. Gone are
the days of lengthy preparations of your favorite low carb meals that seemed
restrictive in terms of healthy ingredients. Here they are replaced with
simpler versions that highlight fresh and healthy flavors and ingredients.
 
Dump meals is a
method of preparation in which all of the ingredients are added to the cooking
vessel at once and then require little to no attention during the cooking
process. There are essentially "dump and go" in concept. Dump meals have gained
popularity in recent years because of their simplicity and the way that you can
still have a healthy, flavorful prepare from scratch meal without spending too
much time in the kitchen. With today's lifestyles the truth is that no matter
how much you may love to cook, the time to do so is a luxury that many do not
have. The solution to this in most cases lies with your crock
pot or slow cooker. Ten minutes spent earlier in the day can result in a
beautiful dish that tastes like it took hours to prepare. This collection of
recipes is meant to inspire and refresh your interest in preparing healthy, low
carbohydrate meals at home, even for those with the busiest of schedules. 
 
Low Carb and Healthy
 
For years, low
carbohydrate diets had the reputation of being heavy on meats, including rich
and fatty red meats and pork products, such as bacon. In the early stages of
its popularity, the low carb lifestyle came with an image of each meal
consisting of half dozen eggs, ample cheese or a triple stacked 'bun-less'
cheeseburger.  This type of eating
did show some immediate benefits such as rapid weight loss and improvement in
general health on some levels, at least initially. As decadent as that type of
style of eating may sound, many found it undesirable and eventually unhealthy
to maintain that type of diet on a daily basis. Thus, low carbohydrate eating
began taking on a transformation towards a diet that also consisted of ample
fresh produce and healthy dairy that focused more reducing the bad
carbohydrates, rather than eliminating all of them.
 
This brings us to
where we are today and the recipes included in this book. Each dump recipe is
an entire meal in itself that consists of fifteen or less grams of net
carbohydrates per serving. Each meal focuses on the flavor of fresh
ingredients, including proteins, vegetables and legumes. These are meals that
you can prepare for your friends and family, even the ones that are hesitant of
the low carb lifestyle, and feel confident that you are providing healthy and
wholesome meals with minimal effort and time. 
 
Dump Meal Success
 
Preparing dump
meals is an incredibly easy process. However, there are several things that you
can do to make your dump cooking easier, more efficient and more flavorful.
 
Freeze with Ease:
For many people, dump cooking goes hand in hand with freezer cooking, where all
of the ingredients are prepared in advanced and then frozen for a later dump
and go meal. Instructions for preparing freezer dump meals has not been
included with each individual recipe, however, every dish in this book can
easily be frozen ahead of time for future use. To do so, simple prepare all of
the ingredients and place them all together, including any sauces or broths, in
a large freezer bag or other airtight freezer storage container. Remember to
label and date the contents, along with cooking temperatures and time, and then
use within two months of preparation. For serving, simply either thaw over
night in the refrigerator or for several minutes using the thaw setting on your
microwave and them dump the contents into your crock pot and carry on with your
day.
 
Think Outside of
the Crock Pot: For ease of preparation, each recipe in this book uses a crock pot method of cooking. This is because you can dump
the meal in the morning and come back to a steamy, homemade meal hours later
with no fuss and minimal clean up. However, you are not limited to the use of a
crock pot for any of these recipes. Each recipe can be
cooked in either a baking dish or skillet depending on the
nature of the ingredients, with the same dump and go philosophy, the
only difference being that you may have to check in occasionally to stir or
toss the ingredients. 
 
Hold Out On the
Dairy: You will notice that many recipes that have any type of cream or cheese
base to them require one simple extra step, and that is adding the dairy
towards the end of the cooking time. This is because some dairy does not hold
up well to long, slow methods of cooking and the result can be either curdled
or broken. To avoid this, add any cream bases or cheeses towards the end of the
cooking time. Thirty minutes before you plan to serve is typically a good point
to add these ingredients. Just add and stir a little before covering and
letting the slow cooker finish the magic.
 
Do What You Can
Ahead of Time: If you really want the true dump and go experience, then devote
thirty minutes to an hour once a week preparing your ingredients ahead of time.
This can be done on a free afternoon or immediately after a grocery store trip.
Wash and cut produce, portion meats and precook any ingredients that may need
it, such as roasting spaghetti squash and scooping out the insides for later
use, or baking a whole chicken and then shredding and portioning the meat. This
time spent doing these things will save you major time later in the week.
 
Keep Quality in
Mind While Shopping: It is true that many of these recipes could be prepared
with canned ingredients that require even less on your time budget, however
there are no words to describe the difference between fresh, quality
ingredients and those that have been preserved and sitting on a shelf for
months. Choose fresh produce whenever possible, and using frozen as an
alternative when fresh is not an option. Fresh herbs have a brightness to them
that outshines dried herbs. It may not always be possible to use fresh herbs,
but if it is, take advantage of the flavor burst that they provide. Most of all, enjoy the process of preparing these low carbohydrate
dump meals and savor the flavors of eating healthy and low carb.











Soups and Stews
There are times when the perfect meal comes in a steamy
bowl, bursting with flavor and warmth. For those times, you don't need to spend
hours in front of the stove, carefully simmering the perfect soup. These soup
recipes are quick dump and go, and then requiring nothing more than possibly a
few rich additions at the end. Perfect for those busy days when your spirit
needs a comforting pick me up. Eat alone or with a fresh garden salad.
