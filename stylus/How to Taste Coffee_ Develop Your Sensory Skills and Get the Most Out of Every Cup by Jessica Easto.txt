INTRODUCTION

WHY DO WE ENJOY COFFEE? It's a mild stimulant, sure. It's inspired the thoughts of Great Minds over the centuries, fueled hard work and innovation, lubricated the exchange of ideas and culture, and played wingperson for countless first dates around the globe. But its unique, complex flavor is also a symphony for our senses, an opportunity to be surprised, to remember, and to savor.
Modern growing, processing, and roasting techniques—which tend to celebrate the character of the coffee bean itself, in all its raucous variety—have provided coffee lovers a world of multilayered flavor to explore and appreciate. Perhaps you, like me, took the stepping-stone path from diner coffee ("first wave") to big specialty chains ("second wave") to small independent purveyors (still "specialty") of what I call craft coffee ("third wave," "fourth wave," who knows anymore) and, in doing so, discovered delightful notes of fruit, nuts, or cocoa in your cup.
Birders often talk about their "spark bird," the bird that ignited their interest in bird watching. Coffee enthusiasts tend to have a similar experience, a spark brew, if you'll allow me, that hits us over the head and shows us that coffee can taste like more than, well, coffee—something distinct and different from every other cup we've had before. Maybe it was a coffee so well balanced, there was no characteristic bitter bite. Maybe it was a cup that was so complex, it tasted like three different cups, all delicious, as it cooled. Or maybe a naturally processed Ethiopia walloped you with an unmistakable note of blueberry. Does this coffee have additives? No. It was a mind-blowing moment, and you now search for the sublime in every cup.
In the introduction to Coffee Sensory and Cupping Handbook, authors Mario Roberto Fernández-Alduenda and Peter Giuliano write, "It is no exaggeration to say the specialty coffee industry is founded on the concept of flavor."1 The specialty coffee industry distinguishes itself from commodity coffee by quality—and flavor is quality. Over the past several decades, the industry has worked to help producers cultivate and sell flavor, and it has developed and standardized ways to evaluate quality and train professionals to recognize and articulate it. In recent years, the industry has partnered with sensory science researchers to bring academic rigor to this growing body of knowledge, data, and protocol. The goal, as Fernández-Alduenda and Giuliano put it, is to "reach valid interpretations about how a product is perceived through human senses" by reducing the bias and error that come with using human beings as instruments of evaluation.2 In other words, the industry is codifying the wondrous experience of drinking coffee and substantiating it with science.
The handbook, published in 2021 by the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA), is a product of this collaboration, as are other industry standard resources, such as the World Coffee Research Sensory Lexicon and Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel, both of which revolve around sensory attributes, the words we use to describe the sensation of tasting coffee. A more consumer-oriented term is flavor notes.
Ah, flavor notes. I'm sure you've seen them in the craft coffee shops you frequent and on the bags of coffee you buy—chocolate, walnut, strawberry. They hope to describe the indelible flavor experience we're often chasing in our high-quality brews, and they frequently play into our purchasing decisions. That being said, I'm fairly certain that you, coffee lover, have been at times misled by flavor notes, if not disappointed, if not utterly betrayed. Perhaps you've given up on them completely. Perhaps, already understanding coffee's fickleness, you dismissed them from the start.
Many of you have read the words toasted marshmallow and thought that sounded swell, only to taste none of it in your cup. Perhaps your first reaction was to blame yourself. You wouldn't be the first person. Your palate simply isn't refined enough, you thought, or you or the barista brewed the coffee poorly. Has a flavor note ever tarnished your experience of enjoying coffee by not delivering on its promise? Are we doomed to quest for the sublime without the benefit of reliable signposts? If all of this research has been done to codify the experience of drinking high-quality coffee, why is it so dang hard to spell it out on the packaging?
I've become convinced that "what we've got here is failure to communicate."* Yes, the industry has done an immense amount of work to understand coffee sensory science and train professionals to evaluate and recognize high-quality coffee. The Coffee Sensory and Cupping Handbook's primary goal is to help sensory scientists and professional coffee tasters communicate effectively among themselves. The Sensory Lexicon, which includes both sensory references and vocabulary, standardizes coffee's professional trade language. However, I'm not so sure this information is trickling down to us—coffee consumers who appreciate the high quality the industry peddles—in a way that helps us purchase and appreciate coffee to the fullest extent possible. Too much of the time, all we get are flavor notes, the crumbs of sensory science, or other scraps of information that don't quite have enough context to make sense.
I wish more of the industry would use the lexicon and flavor wheel to educate and communicate with consumers, which would strengthen our appreciation of the product, invite us to explore the diversity coffee offers, and help us make purchasing decisions. In reality, standardized consumer education and communication currently aren't happening in any consistent, widespread way. Casually, I have observed a couple of possible reasons for this.
First, while the aforementioned tools do seem to be used widely by scientists, producers, green buyers, quality assessors, and roasters, many baristas—the faces (and thus mouthpieces) of craft coffee for most consumers—do not receive sensory training or even customer-service training, so they don't know the standardized language. US baristas, like many in the food service industry, are often underpaid and under-supported for the services they perform already, so this is understandable in that regard.
Second, even some roasters and coffee shops that do have well-trained folks on staff simply do not use the standardized language. Some places have developed their own language, and more still take a decidedly poetic, subjective approach that does not appear—to me, someone who has studied language and written her fair share of marketing copy—to be based in consumer research or industry standard marketing strategies. In other words, it does not educate or appeal to consumers. This is not surprising. The craft coffee world is primarily a vast network of small independent coffee shops that have neither the time nor the resources to hire marketing professionals.
The result is inconsistent, subjective flavor language that, from a consumer perspective, is at best unhelpful and at worst actively confusing. If we are all using different language, and we don't agree on what the language means, we simply cannot effectively communicate. That is the reason the SCA teamed up with scientists to create a standardized coffee language that includes vocabulary tied to references (things you taste and smell). Flavor is experiential. We can't communicate effectively about coffee unless we have shared experience (the references) and a common tongue (the lexicon).

Flavor is experiential. We can't communicate effectively about coffee unless we have shared experience and a common tongue.

I'm not saying that no one is effectively communicating with consumers. Some people and organizations are, and some researchers specialize in this. But we consumers simply do not yet have a widespread shared understanding when it comes to coffee flavor. We don't understand how it works, and we don't know how to talk about it. To my knowledge, the SCA does not offer marketing resources to help coffee shops with its consumer-facing language, nor does it offer many resources to consumers who are interested in self-educating.
That, in a nutshell, is why I wrote this book. I firmly believe that a solid foundation of knowledge stokes the fires of appreciation and enjoyment, particularly when it comes to coffee. When you understand the number of people and amount of work it takes to craft your cup, coffee becomes miraculous. When you understand the basic science of how coffee extraction works, delicious coffee starts to seem improbable, rare. And like any interest or hobby, it takes effort to learn this stuff. For those who want to take it on, I attempted to help you start your home coffee-making journey in my first book, Craft Coffee: A Manual. In addition to information about extraction and brew methods, it provides a basic overview of coffee flavor but without a ton of emphasis on it because "you don't need to know why you like it to enjoy it."
That's still true. But lately, I've been thinking of coffee flavor as the final frontier—and maybe some of you would like a roadmap. Maybe you would like to know why you like or don't like your coffee and how you can taste it with more thought and intention. Maybe you would like to understand where flavor notes come from and why they so often seem to fall short. Maybe you would like to know a little of the science behind coffee flavor. Maybe you would like to develop your palate and find joy in that journey. And maybe you would like to develop a sensory attribute vocabulary so you can talk the talk.

My mission is to make craft coffee accessible to more people by collecting everything in one place and translating barista-speak into everyday language.

As with my first book, my mission is to make craft coffee accessible to more people by collecting everything in one place and translating barista-speak into everyday language. Language is frequently the barrier between coffee consumers and professionals—even when professionals attempt to speak directly to us. If you've spent any amount of time around specialty coffee, you know that bags of coffee and café menus are often strewn with words, presumably to set our expectations about what the coffee is and how we will experience it. In the beginning, it feels like you need a dictionary to place an order: "Ethiopia. Natural. V60." "Gesha. Panama. Filter." "Santafé. Colombia. Washed. Chemex."
In the most general terms, information about coffee variety, origin, and processing are signs of quality simply because they say, "I am a roaster who cares about how coffee is grown and processed, and I am being transparent with you." That's important. But at the end of the day, many of us want to experience delicious coffee, and we want to be able to discuss it with other people. Some information about flavor can be gleaned from the language of origin, processing, and so on, but it's complicated. Nothing seems consistent, there don't appear to be hard and fast rules, and there are so many unknowns left to explore. Where does that leave us? With many people taking their cues from those dang flavor notes. They are supposedly telling us what the coffee tastes like, after all.
This book is my attempt to bridge the language and knowledge gap between coffee professionals and coffee enthusiasts. It explains the science behind our sensory systems, provides a "state of the union" on coffee sensory science, and teaches you how to develop your palate with exercises that help you (1) gain sensory experiences and (2) name them using the vocabulary of the industry. In the process, it demystifies flavor notes and provides the tools you need to navigate the system, explore new coffee, and identify the coffee you like to drink. The book also spends a good bit of time marveling at the mystery that is flavor. I hope the information and insight I include here inspire you to taste widely and sip consciously, with more appreciation and a greater sense of wonder.
As part of my research for this book, I attended the Specialty Coffee Association's Sensory Summit and took coffee sensory courses. But I should be very clear about one thing: I am neither a scientist nor a professional coffee taster, and this book will not teach you how to become a professional coffee taster. As you'll soon find out, professional coffee tasting has very specific goals related to buying and selling green coffee, product development, quality control, and scientific research. Our goal here is very different. Our goal is to have fun. That being said, this book does rely on some tools of the industry—the World Coffee Research Sensory Lexicon and the Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel—and some of the exercises are the same as or similar to what you'd find in a professional sensory class.
This book is your introduction to the coffee sensory experience and palate development. Get ready for a weird, winding, wonderful ride.

BEFORE YOU READ
ONE OF THE REASONS I WROTE THIS BOOK is that, in general, it seems easier these days to choose craft beer or wine from a menu and know you're likely going to enjoy it than it is to do the same with craft coffee. If you're into fine food and drink, you probably know, for example, whether you prefer red or white wine, dry or sweet. You probably also know that IPAs are generally associated with a hoppy bitterness—and whether you like that or not. In other words, we have a general knowledge about certain terms and what they mean, and we can rely on those terms to mean those things no matter where we are.
But many of my friends and readers have told me that they often don't know what they're getting when they choose coffee. When they select coffee based on a description of flavor (or other attributes), there is little guarantee that it will match expectations. In response, some simply find a blend they know they like and buy that all the time. Others say "que sera, sera" and cheerfully let come what may.
When I set out to write this book, I wanted to unequivocally solve that problem. I wanted to give readers the tools they need to order from a coffee menu, confident in their choices, the way many of us are confident that we prefer Belgian-style beers to IPAs. My research has humbled me. While I know this book will help you become a better coffee taster, learn how to be a better communicator about what you're tasting, and deepen your appreciation for our beloved bitter brew, I don't think it's possible for me—or any person—to single-handedly solve the "problem." As it turns out, coffee sensory science is an extremely complex and evolving space, and there are lots of reasons why choosing a bag of coffee might be a little more difficult than choosing a glass of wine or beer. Coffee flavor is simply not so cut and dried—and it helps to understand why.
First, most (though not all!) flavor notes in coffee are subtle—there's no getting around that. They rarely hit you over the head the way the woody note of an oaked Chardonnay or the banana note of a Belgian-style beer does. You'll likely be able to identify some flavors in coffee, especially those you are most familiar with, without much of a concerted effort. But it takes practice to become a thoughtful taster. It's a skill you develop. The good news is that anyone can become a better taster, and the exercises and tips in this book help you do just that.
But there is an even bigger difference between coffee and wine or beer that complicates matters: coffee must always be brewed in the moment. It's made of only two ingredients—coffee and water—and both are fickle as hell. Basically, anything and everything affects the way coffee tastes, from where it was grown and how it was processed to how it was roasted to how old it is to how it was brewed. The flavor notes on café menus and coffee bags describe a moment in time. Whoever made those notes tasted the coffee brewed a specific way, for a specific amount of time, with a specific type of water. Even if there was a way to control for all other factors, it is still impractical to control for water. Different regions have different water, with different concentrations of minerals that affect how coffee is extracted and thus how it tastes. In other words, coffee flavor is a moving target, and it's difficult to label something that is constantly shifting in subtle ways.
The other point to keep in mind is that our ability to explore the expanded spectrum of coffee flavor that we discuss in this book is a relatively new opportunity, and not everyone has easy brick-and-mortar access to this coffee. Most people don't try their first cup of black coffee and think, "Hoo-ha! This is delicious." This is partly because many of us try low-quality coffee before we try high-quality coffee (remember, flavor is quality). We are simply inundated with low-quality coffee, and often it's the only thing available to us. It's also partly because coffee is by nature a bitter brew. Food and drink that people say are "acquired tastes," as they tend to do with coffee, beer, and wine, usually have some kind of characteristic—like bitterness—that tells our primitive brain, "Hey! This is poison! This is dangerous! Stop!" When we don't keel over, we "acquire" alarming tastes by desensitizing our palates to them. You, my friend, have already acquired the taste for coffee. You've jumped the first hurdle!
But before you go too far into this book, I want to make sure we're on the same page about the kind of coffee I'm going to be talking about and recommending you try. For the most part, that is high-quality coffee that has been roasted with what I'm calling modern roasting techniques. This coffee is roasted to emphasize the unique characteristics of the bean itself. Coffee is full of compounds that contribute to a wide range of flavor attributes, including those that are fruity, floral, nutty, cocoa, and more. Coffee has the potential to be complex in the way fine wine, beer, tea, cheese, and chocolate are complex. The processing and roasting can bring out coffee's inherent flavors as well as impart new ones. The result is "a product that is both diverse and variable."3 I am generalizing a bit here, but this kind of roasting is largely happening at what I call craft coffee roasters. It's one of the traits that separates craft coffee from the rest of specialty coffee.
Traditional roasting methods, the kind most people are familiar with, emphasize roast characteristics—flavor imparted by the roasting process itself—which by nature are dominated by dark, roasted, and bitter notes. These notes are traditionally associated with coffee. They are potent and tend to overwhelm the other flavors present in a cup. Don't get me wrong: there are many traditional roasters who can craft a well-balanced bean, especially in countries—such as Italy—that perfected the art of coffee roasting long ago. However, they showcase only a portion of the coffee flavor wheel. If you choose this coffee as you exercise your palate in this book, you likely won't taste many of the flavors we discuss. They simply will not be there for you to find. Coffee roasted with modern techniques still tastes of coffee, of course, but there is more there to taste. And that's what this book celebrates.

Coffee has the potential to be complex in the way fine wine, beer, tea, cheese, and chocolate are complex.

Keep in mind, too, that coffee has long been enjoyed with dairy. In fact, lots of coffee is roasted specifically so that it pairs well with the fat and sugar of steamed milk—that's where your café au lait, latte, cortado, and so on come in. In this book, we are primarily concerned with the coffee itself, and we will be drinking it black, without additives.
There are other reasons for choosing high-quality coffee, even if you must seek it out.* The lower-quality coffee that dominates grocery store shelves in the United States may use coffee varieties that are more bitter by nature. To make matters worse, roasting coffee within an inch of its life has long been a quality control measure. Common wisdom dictates that most consumers want a product that tastes reliably the same no matter when or where they buy it. The easiest, most efficient (read: cost-effective) way to do this with coffee is to obliterate any unique attributes in the roaster. Some large US specialty coffee chains do this, too. The result is oily, extremely bitter, charred coffee. This kind of coffee—which is largely unrecognizable from the traditional Italian coffee that supposedly inspired it—has become ubiquitous in the United States and many other parts of the world. It has warped our thinking about coffee flavor, and in some ways, craft coffee must fight to reverse that expectation. As a result of all this, the potential of coffee flavor is largely misunderstood. I hope to rectify this misunderstanding.
Okay. Enough disclaimers. You can start reading chapter 1 now.





*Yes, I'm quoting Captain from Stuart Rosenberg's 1967 film Cool Hand Luke.
*Besides flavor, roasters who prioritize flavor often prioritize transparency and equity, which means they pay producers a fairer wage (often higher than so-called fair trade prices). Coffee producers have been historically exploited, so this is important. Get to know your roasters!











CHAPTER 1Coffee Flavor:A Multimodal Mystery


COFFEE IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX PRODUCT. Science has pinpointed about twelve thousand compounds that contribute to our sensory experience of it.1 And input from all five of our senses—taste, smell, touch, sight, and sound—contribute to that experience. Coffee flavor is a multimodal experience, as the scientists say. In this book, we focus on the first three senses: taste, smell, and touch (which we experience as mouthfeel when we drink coffee). Together, these three create the perception we call flavor.*
You will soon explore these three senses individually, but in practice, when you eat or drink something, it's difficult to separate the senses from one another. They all influence each other, for one thing.** Additionally, they are all processed and synthesized simultaneously in the brain and limbic system (our so-called primitive brain), and the result is "an instantaneous sensation of flavor" that science has not yet completely explained. We humans are very good at this. At the time of this writing, not even computers can replicate the human body's ability to analyze and identify flavor in such a speedy and precise fashion.2
Coffee sensory science, in general, has only relatively recently been studied with academic rigor, so there is still a lot we don't know about coffee flavor specifically. Science has shown that—no matter the bean, roast, and preparation—people can easily identify coffee as coffee.3 It has a distinctive (though hard to describe) quality. And although it is making progress, science can't definitively tell us how coffee's twelve thousand compounds contribute to that distinct coffee quality—or why coffee can taste like so many other things at the same time.
What's more, our perception of flavor cannot be predicted by measuring chemical compounds with scientific instruments, or at least not the ones currently available.4 The only way to measure flavor is through us—human beings! The field of sensory science uses human beings as instruments to study flavor perception, and some scientists, such as those at the UC Davis Coffee Center, are currently researching the coffee sensory experience specifically.
For now, let's break down the multimodal experience of drinking coffee into steps, using the terms coffee professionals use to articulate the journey. You can use this same tasting process when completing and thinking about the exercises in this book, as well as when you want to consciously sip your coffee. This will also serve as an introduction to the concepts that we explore in more detail later.


Fragrance
WHAT YOU DO: Take a good long sniff of freshly ground coffee.
Food and beverage experiences involve all five of our senses—in a restaurant, you might hear the tinkling of other diners' silverware on their plates, feel the cool heft of your water glass, taste the salty, umami qualities of your burrata appetizer. But whether you are brewing at home or walking into a coffee shop, the first thing that envelops you—before you ever bring the cup to your lips—is the distinct fragrance of coffee. And that's a bit unique. When you walk into a wine bar, you aren't hit over the head with the fragrance of wine. But when you walk into a café, that familiar, enticing coffee smell greets you every time. The smell is potent, it hangs in the air, it lingers. It's something we must experience while we stand there, waiting for our coffee to brew.
The proper name for our sense of smell is olfaction. And the type of smelling we do through our nose—you might think of this as sniffing—is orthonasal olfaction. Professional tasters call this first part of the coffee experience "fragrance." It specifically refers to the orthonasal olfaction of freshly ground coffee beans before they make contact with water. This is an industry-specific distinction (scientists usually call smells "odor," regardless of how, when, or why they happen), but for clarity's sake and because this is a book about coffee, I'll use this terminology, too.
If you've ever taken a deep whiff of a bag of coffee, you know that fresh whole beans are fragrant as they are, but grinding them up releases even more volatile compounds into the air because of increased surface area. In chemistry, something that is volatile is prone to vaporize—that is, change from a liquid or solid phase into a gas phase. Volatile compounds can be readily smelled (if they have odor) because they mix with air and travel inside our noses.
The most volatile compounds have the smallest molecular weight, which means they can easily become airborne and find their way to our nasal passages. These are the compounds we perceive when we experience coffee fragrance. They tend to be "the most delicate odor notes—buttery, honey, floral, fruity."5 They are also the reason a coffee's fragrance is different from its aroma.


Aroma
WHAT YOU DO: Take a good long sniff of freshly brewed coffee.
For coffee tasters, coffee "aroma" is the orthonasal olfaction that happens when you smell brewed coffee. (Again, this distinction is unique to the coffee tasting experience; scientists would likely still use the word odor here.) The act of brewing—pouring hot water over ground coffee—releases heavier volatile compounds into the air through energy transfer, making the once inaccessible now accessible to our noses. This is why the aroma of brewed coffee is usually different from the fragrance of ground coffee—there are simply more volatile compounds at the party.
The new heavier compounds blend with the lighter compounds from the fragrance stage, sometimes overpowering them entirely. The compounds we tend to smell most intensely at this stage of the experience can be traced back to the Maillard reactions that happen during roasting. Maillard reactions are the series of chemical reactions that take place when food browns, such as when toasting bread, searing steak, or roasting coffee. It's no surprise, then, that the notes here tend to be "caramelly, nutty, or chocolatey in character."6


Flavor
WHAT YOU DO: Take a sip of brewed coffee, slurping (if desired) to spread coffee across your whole palate.
When we take a sip of coffee, several sensory perceptions combine into what we call flavor. Our sense of taste (gustation), working primarily through taste buds, detects the five basic tastes—sour, bitter, sweet, salty, and umami—among the coffee compounds that have dissolved into water during brewing. At the same time, we switch to a different kind of smelling, one that happens from within our oral cavity: retronasal olfaction. As we sip and swallow our coffee, volatile compounds become airborne and travel via the pharynx (where our mouth, nose, windpipe, and esophagus connect) into the nasal cavity as we breathe. This is why some people like to slurp while they sip. It spreads the coffee across the palate and helps vaporize volatile compounds, which are then free to travel up to the nose, where they can be identified.
Our sense of touch (somatosensation) is also working, detecting compounds that contribute to the weight and texture (known as body) and the temperature of the coffee. Depending on the coffee, we may also experience chemesthesis, an "irritation" caused by a chemical stimulus (as opposed to a physical one, such as heat). In coffee, this is most commonly the drying sensation we know as astringency. The heat sensation caused by capsaicin in chiles is another example of chemesthesis.
World Coffee Research, in partnership with the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA), has identified and codified 110 flavor attributes found in coffee, which are organized into nine broad categories: roasted, spices, nutty/cocoa, sweet, floral, fruity, sour/fermented, green/vegetative, and other (chemical and papery/musty). We'll explore some of these attributes in more detail in chapter 4.
As brewed coffee cools, its flavor changes. If you've ever set a cup of hot coffee down and forgotten about it for a while before sipping again, you likely already know this. Part of this is because our perception of taste, as we'll see, is impacted by temperature.7 Additionally, the heat that energized the volatile compounds enough to become airborne in the first place starts to dissipate, so the mix of compounds detected retronasally changes, and thus our perception of flavor also changes.8 And if you wait long enough, the compounds in coffee start changing on a chemical level, often due to oxidation (exposure to air), which further changes the taste—often for the worse.


Aftertaste
WHAT YOU DO: Pay attention to the flavor that remains after you swallow brewed coffee.
Coffee tasters call the final segment of the coffee experience the aftertaste: it's the flavor that lingers when you no longer have coffee in your mouth. This flavor perception comes from the residue on and around our tongues. In coffee, insoluble solids, including lipids, are often responsible for aftertaste, and the most common notes associated with these are nutty/cocoa, roasted, and chemical.9 This makes sense, as soluble compounds—those that are easily dissolved in water—are more likely to be washed away in the swallow. The insoluble lingerers contain compounds that not only interact with taste and touch receptors in the mouth but also travel up into our noses to interact with smell receptors—the three sensations that are responsible for flavor. And since it's not the same mix of compounds as was experienced when the coffee was in your mouth, the aftertaste is distinct from the other segments of the coffee tasting experience.



Every time we brew and drink a cup of coffee, it takes us on a journey. Coffee flavor is constantly shifting and evolving, which means it can ensnare our senses in a way that not many other foods or beverages can. You can see why coffee tasters like to honor the coffee experience by breaking it into separate observational stages. There are new sensory attributes to discover at every stop on the journey, which is one of the reasons sipping and savoring a cup of coffee can be so pleasurable.




*Some scientists don't include the sense of touch in flavor.
**This is why other scientists do include touch in flavor. There is some interesting science about crossmodal influence, or how sensory inputs impact our perception of coffee. Neuroscientist Fabiana Carvalho is a leader in specialty coffee sensory science. Her research, including looking at how sight impacts taste perception in coffee, is extremely cool. Look her up!











CHAPTER 2Coffee and the Basic Tastes


I DRANK MY FIRST CUP OF COFFEE ONE AFTERNOON after high school in a local diner that was primarily populated with retirees at that hour. The boy I was with ordered coffee, and not wanting to look unworldly, I followed suit. When the server asked if I wanted cream and sugar, I said no. My parents didn't drink coffee, so we never had it in the house. I knew nothing about it except that my grandpa took his black, so I figured that was the preferred way to drink it.
Both the boy and the server asked me whether I was sure. I sensed I had overplayed my hand, but there was no turning back now. "Yes," I said. "I always drink it black." When the steaming mug came, I took a sip, hopefully looking as if I had done this hundreds of times before. It was intensely bitter and watery, what I now know to be classic diner coffee: weak and overextracted at the same time. I suddenly understood why the boy across the table was, without a thought, stirring creamer into his.
But now I was a black coffee drinker. It was my "thing." And I never did use additives, which came in handy when I had my first cup of high-quality coffee. The difference was stark. Where diner coffee tasted harsh, this other coffee tasted smooth. And where diner coffee tasted bitter, sometimes burnt, this tasted different, delicious even—it was hard to describe how or why. But I was hooked.
The words taste and flavor are often used interchangeably, but scientifically speaking, there is a difference. For the purposes of this book, we are going to observe that distinction because it adds a layer of nuance and appreciation to the coffee tasting experience. Taste (gustation) is one of our five senses. Flavor (which we will examine in chapter 3) is a combination of primarily three senses: taste, smell, and touch.
Taste is a chemical sense, meaning it responds to chemical stimuli—called tastants1—as opposed to physical stimuli. In contrast, our senses of sight, hearing, and touch all respond to physical stimuli (light, sound, and pressure, for example). Tastants correspond to the five basic tastes: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and umami.

How Does Our Sense of Taste Work?
At the most rudimentary level, taste happens when specific tastants associated with the basic tastes interact with corresponding taste receptors. The tongue (and a few other places) is home to tons of taste receptors, located within taste cells. The tiny bumps that you can see on your tongue are called papillae, structures that house taste buds. Taste buds are bulb-like structures chock-full of taste cells, fifty to one hundred each.
Chemical compounds in food must be dissolved in water before they can interact with taste receptors—our saliva helps with this when there isn't already a liquid medium at play (as there is in coffee!). Once taste receptors are stimulated by chemicals in food, they communicate with sensory neurons, which in turn communicate with the brain, which then analyzes the information and prompts a response. This whole network is called the gustatory system.
For a long time, scientists didn't quite understand how the mechanism of taste worked. They're still fleshing out the details, actually. Aristotle first wrote about the basic tastes sweet, bitter, salty, and sour in 350 BC, but umami didn't hit the scene until 1908, when Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda described it (and it would take about another hundred years for Western science to accept umami). It wasn't until 2002 that the first receptor (bitter) was discovered; discoveries of receptors for each of the other basic tastes followed over the next decade.2 There may be other basic tastes, but it's not considered a done deal until scientists identify the corresponding receptor and describe how it works. As of this writing, scientists are debating about whether fatty ("oleogustus," if you're fancy) should be considered the sixth basic taste.
The taste mechanism is pretty complicated, so here is a very basic explanation of how we detect taste. Sweet, bitter, and umami work in a similar way, through what scientists call the "lock and key" principle. The sweet, bitter, and umami taste receptors each have their own locks—and they can't be unlocked until the right key (chemical compound) comes along and unlocks it.
Taste receptors detect salty and sour via ion channels. When dissolved, salty and sour tastants separate into positive and negative ions. (Remember from high school science: an ion is an atom or molecule that has gained or lost one of its electrons, resulting in a net positive or net negative charge.) Ion channels allow charged ions in and out of cells and are sensitive to changes in electrical activity. The ion channels that detect salt, for example, are sensitive to the concentration of positive ions. A low concentration reads as "yum" and a high concentration reads as "yuck." Scientists are still figuring out the mechanism behind sour—another taste that can be either yum or yuck—but believe it's similar.3


Dear Brain: Messages from the Gustatory System
As we've seen, the gustatory system detects information via taste cells in the mouth and transmits information through a neural network to the brain. The first bit of information is what is called the quality of the taste—are we dealing with sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and/or umami? But the brain is interested in two other types of information: the intensity of the quality and its hedonic value. The intensity describes the magnitude of the taste sensation—just how sweet, salty, sour, bitter, or umami is it? The hedonic value describes how pleasant or unpleasant the taste sensation is.
Like all our senses, the gustatory system is designed to keep us alive. Our brain synthesizes information about quality, intensity, and hedonic value and decides whether what we're eating or drinking has nutritional value and whether it is toxic. Based on the brain's assessment of taste, we want to either keep eating or stop. If the brain determines something is very toxic, it may make us involuntarily reject it or initiate some other protective response. This all happens instantaneously and, often, unconsciously. But we're trying to consume consciously here, so let's unpack some of the messages flying around the gustatory system and learn how we can intercept and observe them with intent.
First, if you pay attention to what you're eating and drinking, you can assess all three types of information separately (practice this with the exercises starting on page 29). At the same time, none of them exists in a vacuum. For example, different qualities can change based on how much stimulus is present in food, and one taste can influence our response to another.
Second, in general, humans (like many omnivores) tend to gravitate toward sweet and umami things and show aversion toward bitter things. Salty and sour can go either way, depending on intensity. Scientists generally believe that these responses are linked to "evolutionary pressures."4 In other words, sweet and umami things have a tendency to give us the nutrition we need to survive, while bitter things tend to be toxic. Pleasantly salty and sour things tend to indicate nutrition, while overly salty and sour things tend to be spoiled or toxic. Information about the basic tastes can trigger automatic behaviors, such as gagging or licking, that appear to be hardwired in the "ancient" part of the brain—lingering evidence that our sense of taste plays a critical role in our species' survival.5
In sum, how much we like a taste often depends on both its quality and intensity. This is at the heart of why we perceive one cup of coffee as "good" and another cup of coffee as "bad." For example, an underextracted coffee has an overabundance of molecules that contribute to perceived acidity, which makes the cup unpleasantly sour, while overextracted coffee has too many bitter-contributing molecules, making the cup unpleasantly bitter. A well-extracted cup has a pleasant balance of acidity and bitterness.
Last, and perhaps most importantly, our perception of taste is influenced by our genetics and life experience. This ultimately means that taste is not inherently objective. On a physiological level, we may physically sense taste—and thus experience taste—differently from our neighbor. In fact, our perception of and sensitivity to the five basic tastes can vary widely. At the same time, we can actively shape our gustatory system through experience, which is often a product of our environment, and through mindful observation. (So, yes, that means that what I described in the previous paragraph about over- and underextracted coffee is a generalization from a Western, specifically US, perspective.) We can become better tasters! And what we perceive as pleasant or unpleasant can change naturally over time—or by sheer force of will.

FUN FACT

The tongue map is a myth! Many of us grew up with textbooks that featured a tongue map that explained how taste is perceived on different regions of the tongue—sweet on the tip, for example. As it turns out, that map was just based on some misinterpreted data. In reality, we can detect all five tastes on all areas of our tongues.




The Basic Tastes in Coffee
Bitter and sour are the primary basic tastes found in coffee, but let's take a closer look at the biology and chemistry behind all the basic tastes and how they might express themselves in coffee. For each one, I identify a common reference—something you can consume that represents the taste attribute. You'll use these to practice identifying basic tastes in the exercises found in this section. I recommend preparing each of the five basic taste references and conducting a blinded tasting (see page 142) until you can distinguish each easily. This is the same exercise that coffee professionals use to pass introductory sensory courses.

BITTER
Common bitter references: caffeine, Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate), Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powder
Primary bitter compounds in coffee: chlorogenic acid lactones, phenylindanes, caffeine, unidentified compounds
The bitter taste may be the most complex of the five tastes,6 and there's still a lot science doesn't know about it. The chemical structure of bitter tastants can vary widely, and scientists have so far identified about twenty-five bitter taste receptors in humans.7 These receptors can detect hundreds of different bitter tastants with wide-ranging structures, from tiny ions to relatively heavy peptides.8
You can think of bitter as essentially the opposite of sweet. Whereas sweet is innately pleasant, bitter is innately unpleasant, even to infants and other animals. Our brains read it as "poison," "toxic," or "dangerous." As such, many of the purest taste references, such as quinine, are not easily obtainable because they are toxic at certain quantities, and certainly too dangerous for me to recommend you consume for this book. The SCA recommends pure caffeine powder as a training reference for bitterness. Pure caffeine powder is difficult to come by, unless you are a business or institution, because it is dangerous to consume at higher quantities. Caffeine pills are widely available, but they usually contain additives to make them less bitter. You can also use magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt), a bitter-tasting salt that scientists discovered in 2019 was perceived by a receptor called TAS2R7.9 Another alternative is Goody's powder, which is an over-the-counter medication that contains pain relievers and caffeine. Epsom salt and Goody's powder are widely available and useful around the house beyond sensory training, but they may not have as much of a "pure" bitter taste as pure caffeine. There really isn't a perfect reference for bitter.*
It likely comes as no surprise that of the basic tastes, bitter is the most present in coffee. And no wonder: there are seventy to two hundred bitter tastants found in coffee.10 Caffeine is one of them, but it doesn't contribute as much (10 to 20 percent) to coffee's bitterness as other compounds. Recent research suggests that 50 to 70 percent of coffee's bitterness comes from chlorogenic acid lactones and up to 30 percent comes from phenylindanes, both of which form during the roasting process. Scientists believe that up to 20 percent of coffee's bitterness comes from unknown tastants.11
Oddly, you won't find bitterness on a coffee professional's evaluation sheet, and in my experience, coffee professionals tend to avoid discussing "bitterness" in coffee at all. Sometimes, it seems like it's regarded as a negative attribute, even though it is ever present—to one degree or another—in coffee. You can't have coffee without bitterness, and understanding your threshold for bitterness is important information when discovering what kind of coffee you enjoy.
According to the SCA, there is a level of nuance to how bitterness presents itself in coffee. Caffeine bitterness is "clean" or "unidimensional"; chlorogenic acid lactones are "round," "velvety," or "smooth"; and phenylindanes are "harsh"12 and appear to contribute to astringency, a separate sensation that is often associated with but distinct from bitterness (see page 65).



PALATE EXERCISE

Fundamental Taste: Bitter
Use this exercise to practice identifying the bitter quality on its own. Once it's in your memory bank, it will be easier to identify qualities of bitterness in coffee and other food and drink.
What you'll need

■digital scale (0.1 gram precision)
■Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powder, powdered caffeine, or Epsom salt
■1 liter hot filtered or spring water (no additives), plus room temperature water for tasting plain
■two equal-size (4- to 8-ounce) drinking glasses with lids (such as coasters)

Create a 0.05% caffeine solution by dissolving 0.5 grams of caffeine/1.5 grams of Goody's Powder/5 grams of Epsom salt in 1 liter of hot water, stirring or shaking until completely dissolved (none of these references dissolve well unless you use hot water). Cover the bottle and let the solution cool to room temperature.
Pour the bitter solution into one glass and cover to keep the aromatics in. Pour plain water into the other glass. Taste each and compare. What does the taste feel like? What does the taste remind you of? Describe it as best you can and/ or connect it to a memory.



Tips

■For all basic taste exercises, try using 1-liter plastic or glass bottles. That way, you can easily store your samples for comparison and blinded tasting to test your identification skills. Once each reference is made, store them in the refrigerator and use within a couple of days. Let them come to room temperature before tasting.
■I conducted this exercise with the powder from inside caffeine capsules and with Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powder. Although both contain additives, I think the Goody's powder makes the better reference. Keep in mind that I created the Epsom salt ratio myself, and I could not scientifically confirm it is the same intensity as the other references. Epsom salt also has complex basic taste qualities, so it isn't the purest reference, but it's better than nothing.




Whether bitter tastants provide additional distinct sensory qualities or subqualities (as sour and sweet tastants do) has yet to be fully demonstrated and articulated from a scientific perspective. Research from 2019 found that some bitter tastants significantly affect how tasters perceived retronasal coffee aroma, suggesting that specific bitter tastants do possess distinct sensory qualities. However, this may not be due to a specific difference with the bitter modality itself but rather the effect of the bitter tastant's combination of subqualities (salty, astringent, and metallic, for example).13
As a coffee lover, you well know that, over time, our natural aversion to bitterness can morph into an affinity for it. Coffee is a classic example. So are beer and dark chocolate. Scientists think this transformation is more likely to occur when bitterness is paired with something enjoyable. Keep in mind, too, that humans' sensitivity to bitterness can vary widely, and genetics, as we'll see later, is partly responsible. Culture also plays a role, and this is evident in the different coffee cultures around the world. Some cultures prefer intensely bitter coffee, while others do not.14
The quality and intensity of bitterness depend on both the concentration of compounds found in the green (unroasted) beans and their roast level. Some types of coffee, such as C. canephora, have more naturally occurring bitter compounds than other types of coffee, such as C. arabica. But even C. arabica, when heavily roasted, will be more bitter than less roasted coffees, due to the concentration of phenylindanes. Recent studies have also found that perceived bitterness in coffee is linked to its total dissolved solids (TDS), which is a measure of strength. High-TDS coffee is perceived to have more intense bitterness.15


SOUR
Common sour reference: citric acid
Primary sour compounds in coffee: chlorogenic acids, carboxylic acids, phosphoric acid
The sour taste is a bit of an oddball, as we humans can find it either highly appealing or highly unappealing—it can add a pleasant, tangy dimension to food and drink or it can revolt us, especially in high quantities. Our draw or aversion to it can change throughout our lives: infants tend to reject sour while children often gravitate toward it (did any of my fellow millennials have a Warheads phase in elementary school?). Although the mechanism is still being worked out, scientists have long known that acids are associated with the sour taste. They believe that sourness helps us detect acids and avoid ingesting too many of them, which can disrupt our bodies' pH balance. The sour taste is also associated with electrolytes, minerals that are essential to nutrition.16
Along with bitter, sour is an important basic taste in coffee. Coffee tasters use the word acidity to describe it, and it's a prized quality, especially in light and medium roasted coffees, so much so that it has its own section on professional evaluation sheets.
Sour tastants are always acids, and in coffee this includes three major types: chlorogenic acids, carboxylic acids, and phosphoric acid. Acids make their way into coffee in all sorts of ways. This includes during growing (absorbed through the soil, produced during photosynthesis), processing (formed during fermentation), roasting, and brewing.17
Sour tastants tend to have distinct sensory attributes and can thus present in many ways in coffee, in terms of both quality and intensity. You are likely already familiar with the carboxylic acids that serve as references in the Sensory Lexicon: citric acid (associated with lemons), acetic acid (associated with vinegar and ferments), butyric acid (associated with aged cheeses, such as Parmesan), malic acid (associated with apples), and isovaleric acid (associated with foot odor and cheeses such as Romano.)
Some sour acids provide additional sensory attributes because they are also volatile, which means that your retronasal olfaction gets involved. Acetic and formic acids, for example, are thought to be responsible for a "winey" character in coffee.18 In contrast, studies have found that, in general, citric acid provides a "burst of tartness," and malic acid provides a "smooth tartness," both distinct qualities from the "tart and sour" character of acetic acid.19 Additionally, you know from the bitter discussion that compounds formed from chlorogenic acids have a bitter dimension. Caffeic and quinic acids, also formed from chlorogenic acids, have a similarly bitter, dry quality.

"SOURNESS" VERSUS "ACIDITY"

The scientific definition of terms is often different from how we use them in everyday speech, when we are not so technically precise. From a chemistry perspective (and in the simplest terms) an acid is a molecule that donates protons (usually a positively charged hydrogen ion) in a solution. Strong acids (low number on the pH scale) donate lots of protons, and weak acids (high number on the pH scale) donate fewer. Many acids are sour tastants, but not all.
In coffee world parlance, these terms are used to communicate a quality judgment. Acidity is used to describe a pleasant, sought-after quality ("tanginess," "brightness," and other euphemisms are often used to describe sour qualities) in coffee, while sourness is used to describe an unpleasant sensation. Both acidity and sourness are references to the basic taste called sour. In the former, the perceived sour taste is in balance with the rest of the cup; in the latter, the sour taste is too intense for the drinker's palate.





PALATE EXERCISE

Fundamental Taste: Sour
Use this exercise to practice identifying the sour quality on its own. Once it's in your memory bank, it will be easier to identify qualities of sour in coffee and other food and drink.
What you'll need

■digital scale (0.1 gram precision)
■food-grade citric acid
■1 liter filtered or spring water (no additives), plus more for tasting plain
■two equal-size (4- to 8-ounce) drinking glasses with lids (such as coasters)

Create a 0.05% citric acid solution by dissolving 0.5 grams of citric acid in 1 liter of water, stirring or shaking until the citric acid is completely dissolved.
Pour the citric acid solution into one glass and cover to keep the aromatics in. Pour plain water into the other glass. Taste each and compare. What does the taste feel like? What does the taste remind you of? Describe it as best you can and/or connect it to a memory.



Tips

■Citric acid is sold at some grocery stores and online.
■Keep your solution, as it plays a role in other flavor attributes (see page 114). Store in the refrigerator and use within a couple of days. Let it come to room temperature before tasting.




You might think that the intensity of the sour taste would correlate with the pH of coffee. After all, green (unroasted) coffee is about 10 percent acid by weight, including citric, malic, and acetic acids.20 However, a recent study found that wasn't the case. Recall that not all acids produce a sour taste: chlorogenic acids in coffee, for example, tend to produce a bitter taste. Likewise, not all strong acids (low pH) have a high intensity of sour taste. Sometimes, weak acids (high pH) have a greater sour intensity than strong acids. This led researchers to believe that something else might be at play.21
The resulting study found that perceived acidity did correlate with titratable acidity, the measure of the total acid concentration in food. (pH, on the other hand, measures only the concentration of dissociated acids, those that have released their hydrogen ions.)22 Moreover, the perception of sourness changed the most based on the way the coffee was brewed—not on its roast level or anything else. The highest perceived sour intensity was found in coffee with a high concentration of TDS and low percent extraction (PE)—the brew with the lowest pH—and the coffee that lacked in perceived acidity had low TDS and high PE.23

TDS AND PE

Total dissolved solids (TDS) measures the strength of coffee. Strong coffee has more dissolved coffee compounds in it than weak coffee does. Percent extraction (PE)—also called extraction yield or extraction—refers to how much material from your coffee dose (the grounds you started with) made it into your cup. It has to do, primarily, with how long water was in contact with the coffee, as water is what extracts compounds from the grounds. Not enough time and you have underextracted coffee. Too much time and you have overextracted coffee. See page 86 for a summary of how brewing affects flavor.


That being said, during roasting, some acids are broken into other acids and carbohydrates—in general, the darker the roast, the lower the acid content of the coffee, but it's still there.24 Still, roast does affect the perception of acidity in coffee. The sour tastants that remain after high levels of roasting are easily overwhelmed by bitter tastants, which increase as coffee is roasted.25 This is why sour can shine in light roasted coffee and be completely obscured in dark roasted coffee.


SWEET
Common sweet reference: table sugar (sucrose)
Primary sweet compounds in coffee: probably none, since sweetness in coffee is a perception
The sweet taste is almost universally appealing to humans (even babies) and most other mammals, as sweet is associated with carbohydrates, which are a necessary part of our nutrition. It is perceived as pleasant at even very low concentrations (but very high concentrations can turn us off).26 Interestingly, studies have shown that animals that eat strictly meat-based diets with no need for carbs, like big cats and house kitties, are categorically indifferent to the sweet taste.27 Coincidence? Science doesn't think so.
Sweet tastants are detected with the help of two receptors. (Cats don't have the gene for one of these, by the way.) Mounting evidence suggests that we have sweet taste receptors throughout our body, including the gastrointestinal tract, nose, and respiratory system.28
Unlike some of the basic tastes, many different tastants can activate sweet taste receptors.29 Of course, there are tastants like sugars (sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose) but also sweet amino acids and sweet proteins. Scientists have also cracked the code on how to design certain molecule structures that activate our sweet taste receptors—enter artificial sweeteners such as saccharin and aspartame.
Sweet can reduce the perception of some bitter tastants,30 which is perhaps why sweetners are so often added to coffee.
However, in specialty coffee, natural sweetness—not the added kind—is a highly valued attribute and an important part of a well-balanced cup. Professional coffee tasters often seek sweetness in a cup, and it has its own section on the cupping score sheet. But this is primarily perceived sweetness. In other words, the sensory perception of sweet in coffee is not strongly correlated with known sweet tastants, such as sugar.
As far as we know, there are very few naturally occurring sweet tastants in coffee by the time we are sipping it from our cups. There are sugars in green coffee (as much as 10 percent sucrose, according to the SCA), but they are degraded nearly to the point of absence during the roasting process. Recent research done by the UC Davis Coffee Center has found that the sweet tastants—such as sucrose and the simple sugars that form as the roasting process breaks down complex carbohydrates—are well below the human threshold for perception, confirming that natural sugars have little to do with sweetness in coffee.31
So, what are we tasting? Part of it is likely to do with compounds that contribute to aroma and/or other flavor attributes that "trick" our brains, giving us the sensory impression of sweetness.32 These include compounds with sensory qualities reminiscent of caramel, nuts, chocolate, and fruit, which are common in coffee.33 These qualities are actually aromas, perceived through retronasal olfaction. A true sweet taste would be perceived through taste receptors on the tongue.
Another theory is that some compounds in coffee may enhance sweetness, even when true sweet tastants are at a very low concentration. These enhancing compounds may give our taste buds the boost they need to detect sweetness in coffee.34 During the writing of this book, the Specialty Coffee Association announced that its Coffee Science Foundation (CSF) had partnered with the Ohio State University to conduct new "sweetness in coffee" research, the results of which are still forthcoming at publication.35



PALATE EXERCISE

Use this exercise to practice identifying the sweet quality on its own. Once it's in your memory bank, it will be easier to identify qualities of perceived sweetness in coffee and qualities of actual sweetness in other food and drink.
What you'll need

■digital scale
■granulated white sugar
■1 liter filtered or spring water (no additives), plus more for tasting plain
■two equal-size (4- to 8-ounce) drinking glasses with lids (such as coasters)

Create a 1.0% sucrose solution by dissolving 10 grams of sugar in 1 liter of water, stirring or shaking until the sugar is completely dissolved.
Pour the sucrose solution into one glass and cover to keep the aromatics in. Pour plain water into the other glass. Taste each and compare. What does the taste feel like? What does the taste remind you of? Describe it as best you can and/or connect it to a memory.



Tip

■Store in the refrigerator and use within a couple of days. Let it come to room temperature before tasting.






SALTY
Common salty reference: table salt (sodium chloride)
Primary salty compounds in coffee: potassium, sodium
Salt—sodium chloride—is an important part of our nutrition. Sodium helps our bodies perform vital functions, such as conducting nerve impulses and maintaining the right balance of water and minerals. Like sweetness, saltiness is perceived as pleasant, even at low concentrations.36 Humans and other mammals tend to gravitate toward salty food even when we already have enough sodium in our diets (hello, high blood pressure), which suggests to scientists that the salty taste is innately preferred by our gustatory system and not learned. (High concentrations of salt are generally off-putting, however.)
Infants don't immediately prefer salt the way they do sugar, but studies have found the preference starts developing around four to six months old. We can take action to moderate our sodium preferences by eating less salt, but as the innate allure of salt is so strong, it can be rather difficult for many people to do. Salt has more pleasing effects than just the salty taste.37 It can affect texture, such as contributing to a sense of thickness in soup. In can enhance sweetness, sourness, and umami; neutralize some bitter tastants; reduce off-flavors; improve flavor balance; and boost flavor intensity. No wonder we crave it!
The salty taste is caused by a simple tastant: ions, and the sodium ion in particular (though potassium and magnesium salts can also taste salty).38 Scientists would love to replicate salty in the lab, as they have with sweet—there is financial incentive to figure out a way to get us to eat less salt and thus reduce the health problems associated with high-salt diets. But so far? No dice.
Some outlets recommend adding salt to coffee, due to its neutralizing effects on some bitter compounds. In general, though, the salty taste in coffee is considered an off-flavor. Coffee does contain some sodium, a common salty tastant, about 5 milligrams per 8-ounce (237-gram) cup, but that is generally below our threshold to taste salty. In order for us to detect salty in our brew, everything would have to go right (or wrong, depending on how you look at it): there'd have to be enough salty tastants in the brew and other tastes could not cover it up.



PALATE EXERCISE

Fundamental Taste: Salty
Use this exercise to practice identifying the salty quality on its own. Once it's in your memory bank, it will be easier to identify qualities of saltiness in coffee (should you be unlucky enough to come across it) and other food and drink.
What you'll need

■digital scale (0.1 gram precision)
■noniodized salt
■1 liter filtered or spring water (no additives), plus more for tasting plain
■two equal-size (4- to 8-ounce) drinking glasses with lids (such as coasters)

Create a 0.15% salt solution by dissolving 1.5 grams of salt in 1 liter of water, stirring or shaking until the salt is completely dissolved.
Pour the salt solution into one glass and cover to keep the aromatics in. Pour plain water into the other glass. Taste each and compare. What does the taste feel like? What does the taste remind you of? Describe it as best you can and/ or connect it to a memory.



Tip

■Store in the refrigerator and use within a couple of days. Let it come to room temperature before tasting.




However, if the water you are using to brew coffee has high levels of sodium or potassium, it might cause your coffee to taste salty. Some claim that saltiness is a sign of underextraction.39


UMAMI
Common umami reference: MSG (monosodium glutamate)
Primary umami compounds in coffee: unknown, but maybe the amino acid l-glutamate
Umami is often described as "rich," "savory," and "mouth-filling"—the kind of sensations associated with foods like meat, seafood, seaweed, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Like sweet and salty, umami is generally perceived by humans as pleasant, even at low concentrations, and is associated with proteins, which are essential to our life functions.40 Proteins contain amino acids, some of which are umami tastants along with many short peptides and some organic acids.41 One amino acid that really sets off umami taste receptors is l-glutamate, which is close to its pure form in monosodium glutamate, or MSG. Another is aspartic acid.
L-glutamate is present in coffee—and the lexicon does include the attribute "meaty/brothy"—but there hasn't been much research related to umami and coffee. That's not surprising, since Western science rejected umami as a basic taste for a long time and has had to play catch-up in recent years. So far, science has identified two receptors for umami, although there may be more. One interesting feature of umami is that it seems we can detect subtle differences in umami, suggesting there are several types of umami taste. Umami also has the remarkable ability to make food taste better—period.42



PALATE EXERCISE

Fundamental Taste: Umami
Use this exercise to practice identifying the umami quality on its own. Once it's in your memory bank, it will be easier to identify qualities of umami in coffee and other food and drink.
What you'll need

■digital scale (0.1 gram precision)
■monosodium glutamate (MSG)
■1 liter filtered or spring water (no additives), plus more for tasting plain
■two equal-size (4- to 8-ounce) drinking glasses with lids (such as coasters)

Create a 0.06% MSG solution by dissolving 0.6 grams of MSG in 1 liter of water, stirring or shaking until the MSG is completely dissolved.
Pour the MSG solution into one glass and cover to keep the aromatics in. Pour plain water into the other glass. Taste each and compare. What does the taste feel like? What does the taste remind you of? Describe it as best you can and/ or connect it to a memory.



Tips

■MSG is sold at most grocery stores, often in the spice section as "flavor enhancer" or "accent salt"; just check the ingredients to make sure it's pure MSG.
■Store the solution in the refrigerator and use within a couple of days. Let it come to room temperature before tasting.




As of this writing, umami in coffee is a relatively rare profile but not unheard-of. In 2013, World Barista Champion Hidenori Izaki competed at the championships with a program that highlighted the umami profile in coffee. He took great care in explaining the concept to the judges, not taking for granted that they were already familiar with this coffee profile.43 Still, the coffee-specific research related to umami is far less than that of sweet, bitter, and sour. Anecdotally, one of the best coffees I've ever tasted was a cold-brewed Kenyan coffee that had a distinct sweet, savory tomato note, which may sound strange but was delicious—I've never tasted anything like it before or since.



What Impacts Our Perception of Taste?
Earlier, I mentioned that individuals experience taste in fundamentally different ways. For example, two people can be drinking the exact same cup of coffee, and one might find its bitterness pleasant while the other might find that the bitterness is too intense, and thus unpleasant. How can that be? Well, genetics and culture both play a role. Understanding these differences is helpful when you are navigating the world of specialty coffee, developing your palate, and identifying your preferences. Sometimes, a kind of groupthink can happen in which certain flavor profiles are labeled objectively "bad" and others are labeled objectively "good." A lot of the time, that isn't true. A basic understanding of how genes and culture affect taste and preference will also prime you to appreciate coffee culture beyond your own, if you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to explore.

GENES
Genetics can affect our perception of and sensitivity to the five basic tastes. Remember how scientists believe that specific taste receptors detect specific corresponding tastes? Well, these taste receptors are influenced by our genes. As with eye color, hair color, height, and any number of physical traits that are inherited from our ancestors, taste receptors are controlled by our DNA—and there is quite a bit of natural genetic variation afoot. Just as one sibling's hair might be one shade of brown and the other sibling's another, your taste receptors may also be genetically coded to express differently. For example, you may have more taste buds than other people, which may make you more sensitive to sweetness (studies have shown that genetics account for up to one-third of the variation in sweet taste perception).44 In other words, how we detect and perceive taste—our taste physiology—is inherited, and researchers tend to believe that taste physiology influences our personal taste preferences and behavior.
Let's spend a moment with bitterness, the perception of which is quite variable among us humans. We have twenty-five known receptors for bitterness, but not all of us are able to detect all known bitter tastants.45 Two tastants are often used as a measuring stick for so-called supertasters, or individuals who perceive the basic tastes with greater intensity than others in the population. One tastant is called phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and the other is 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP).
Supertasters can detect PTC and/or PROP as bitter while others cannot taste them at all, and studies have isolated the genes that control the perception of these chemicals (though this doesn't offer a complete explanation of supertasters).46 Studies have also shown that the ability to perceive PTC and/or PROP often correlates to eating preferences and behaviors, such as picky eating. Supertasters tend to find certain foods, such as broccoli, spinach, and Brussels sprouts, unpleasantly bitter, and they often dislike dark chocolate and chiles. PROP tasters tend to drink less alcohol and—perhaps you know where I'm going with this—avoid black coffee and caffeine in general.47



PALATE EXERCISE

Are You a Supertaster?
Use this exercise to see whether you are a supertaster based on the number of taste buds you have.
What you'll need

■food coloring
■cotton swab
■strip of paper with standard hole punch in it
■camera (the one on your phone will do)

If you don't have access to PTC or PROP you can see if you're a supertaster by counting your taste buds. Squeeze a drop or two of food coloring on the cotton swab, then color a portion of your tongue with the colored swab. Place the strip of paper on your tongue, with the punched hole over the colored portion. Take a photo. Zoom in and count the papillae on your tongue. If you have more than thirty-five, you are a supertaster! If you have around thirty-five, you are a typical taster.48




COFFEE TOO BITTER? IT MAY BE IN YOUR GENES.

Researchers have specifically looked into genetics and how they relate to a person's proclivities toward sweetened or unsweetened coffee beverages. In a 2022 study of Italian coffee drinkers, researchers found that participants who were genetically predisposed to be sensitive to caffeine bitterness tended to prefer sweetened coffee beverages. Those who were genetically predisposed to be sensitive to sweetness tended to prefer unsweetened coffee beverages.49


About 25 percent of people are ultrasensitive to PROP and another 45 to 50 percent can moderately taste it, while about 70 percent of people can taste PTC. However, certain populations have a higher percentage of tasters than others. For example, one study found that the group with the lowest number of PROP or PTC tasters were Indigenous peoples of New Guinea and Australia, while the group with the highest were Indigenous peoples of the Americas. But there are supertasters and typical tasters in every community.50
There are simple kits you can purchase online to determine whether you are a supertaster—and if so, which kind. The kits contain paper strips with PTC, sodium benzoate, thiourea, and a control paper. You may be able to taste one or all three chemicals—or none at all. You can also find PROP test kits online, which scientists often use to distinguish super-tasters and characterize taste sensitivity in studies. Personally, I am able to taste thiourea, PROP, and sodium benzoate—though I didn't have a strong reaction to any of them—but not PTC. Locate a reputable manufacturer of these kits, try them out for yourself at home, and draw your own conclusions about your taste preferences. This is more of an interesting and fun activity to do with your friends than something that has practical applications. Although, if you tend not to like bitter food and drink, perhaps you'll have a better clue as to why after taking a test like this.


CULTURE
Although some of the studies I referenced earlier focused on how genetics influence taste in different communities, there is also evidence that the culture we live in affects our perception of and sensitivity to taste, separate from genetics. However, the research around culture and taste is still in relatively early stages—the connection seems apparent, but the how and why of it all is still fuzzy. I'll highlight a few studies I found interesting when researching for this book.
Our cultures are intertwined with social, geographical, economic, environmental, and other factors, all of which influence (1) what type of food is around and (2) what our caregivers and other community members encourage us to eat. Yes, there are certain tastes—sweet, salty—that our primitive brains inherently prefer, but according to biopsychologist Julie Mennella, "You learn to like what you eat."51 Mennella believes that this often starts before we are even born. Her work suggests that taste molecules find us first in the womb and then via breast milk. What our mothers are eating—which is presumably linked to what is available and what they enjoy—imprints on us. As we move through the world, we continue to gather taste experiences that are inherently shaped by the people and food around us, and that influences our aesthetic judgments of the things we eat and drink. In other words, if pineapple is all around us and everyone we know is eating pineapple and loving it, there's a good chance we're going to love it, too.
Different cultures also value different aspects of food, something that is likely taught—consciously or unconsciously—to children through various food traditions. Think about it: almost every culture has a delicacy that another culture generally finds revolting—or even taboo. I live in the United States, where many people grew up eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Elsewhere in the world, PB&J makes no sense and may sound quite unappetizing, often because there is no tradition of peanut butter or because there is no tradition of combining sweet and salty together in such a fashion.
A 2018 article in the journal Chemical Senses compared the taste perception and sensitivity of two distinct food cultures: Thai and Japanese.52 Thai cuisine is known for its use of hot chiles and how it blends three or even all five of the basic tastes in a single dish or meal. In contrast, Japanese cuisine rarely uses hot chiles, rarely allows different-tasting dishes to touch on a single plate, and often uses naturally umami ingredients, such as kombu.
The studies showed that Thai tasters had a stronger preference for heat than Japanese tasters, and Thai tasters had a higher threshold for taste recognition than Japanese tasters, meaning Japanese tasters could identify the five basic tastes at lower concentrations than Thai tasters. Interestingly, 20 percent of the Thai participants could not identify umami at all—even at the highest concentration tested—but all Japanese participants could identify all tastes within the bounds of the study.
Because the study controlled for other factors, researchers were comfortable saying that the differences were due to cultural or ethnic factors, but they stopped short of drawing definitive conclusions about how and why the relationship exists. Perhaps the results can be accounted for by differences in learned values, differences in food preparation and presentation, or even the preference for chile heat (and then there is the question of why there is the preference for chile heat in the first place)—but the point is that there were measurable distinctions between the two groups in terms of preference and sensitivity.
Coffee culture varies widely around the world, and even within cultures in the same country. In the United States, for example, the craft coffee industry tends to prize coffee that is complex (meaning you can taste multiple things at once) and that has noticeable acidity that is perceived to be balanced with the other basic tastes. In order to achieve this, lighter roasted beans are used and special attention is paid to the grind size of the beans, the temperature of the water, the ratio of beans to water, and the contact time of the beans and water in an attempt to extract flavor from coffee in such a way that highlights this balance. The presence of acidity in this coffee is often a turnoff to people who have mostly experienced the mainstream coffee culture that exists in the United States, which prizes darker roasted coffee with very low acidity and distinct roast characteristics, such as bitterness. I'd also go so far as to say that filtered coffee preparations—which remove fine sediment and oils from the brew, producing a so-called light body—tend to be preferred in professional coffee circles over preparations that leave those elements in.
People in other parts of the world prepare their coffee very differently. Different roast profiles and brewing methods are preferred, which result in coffee with different characteristics than are popular in the coffee culture that I, for example, move around in. For example, traditional Turkish coffee is brewed using extremely fine grounds in a (usually) copper pot designed specifically for the purpose. The way the coffee is brewed produces an intense, heavy-bodied coffee with a characteristic foam. Other coffee cultures primarily consume their coffee with milk or other additives. The list goes on.



Why You Can (and Should) Develop Your Sense of Taste
Some studies suggest that taste preferences are learned through social practice and that the related judgments and behaviors become habitual to the point that most of us perform them unconsciously.53 This idea has stuck with me as I've written this book, likely because it confirms my own experience.
Most of us don't often have to think about our sense of taste beyond our immediate taste preferences and judgments ("this food is delicious" or "I really don't like this drink"). We often don't have reason to reflect on how our tastes have or haven't changed over the years—or how we got them in the first place. Aside from occasional congestion from colds and flus that temporarily decreases our ability to taste, our gustatory system is usually there for us. Until the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been very few reported cases of long-term damage to this system, aside from the decreased sensitivity that comes with age or through smoking.
I never thought about my palate until I started drinking coffee, evaluating extraction in pursuit of the perfect cup, and finding joy in discovering new flavor notes in my brew. But I quickly realized two important lessons: (1) my palate was limited by my own experience and (2) I could change my palate by intentionally gathering new points of reference.
It seems fairly obvious that we can intentionally train (or retrain) our palates. Although there are very few studies on the effect of sensory training on taste acuity, the ones that exist seem to suggest that training does increase your ability to perceive and recognize tastes, but exposure and habituation alone can increase your recognition capabilities—no complicated training required.54 With training, though, it appears you can actually increase your sensitivity to tastes, meaning you can train yourself to detect tastes at lower concentrations. You already have the tools to do this with the basic taste exercises in this chapter. Create solutions of higher and lower concentration to test your ability to detect changes to intensity, and to see how low your threshold can go.
You can also reduce your intake of salty and sweet foods to increase your sensitivity to these tastes. Our taste buds can develop something of a tolerance to salty and sweet tastes, requiring higher doses to reach what researchers call the "bliss point," or optimal level of pleasantness.55 For example, salt preference can be malleable, and we can learn to appreciate lower levels of salt. Anecdotally, I experienced this when I reduced my intake of processed foods—which tend to have high levels of salt. After making my own tomato sauce for a year, a sudden return to my favorite jarred variety was shockingly salty—almost unpalatable.
Another factor is repeated exposure.56 Studies suggest that the more you are exposed to a taste, the more you tolerate it. This seems notably true for bitter tastes, and out in the world, this perhaps explains why so many of us enjoy quite bitter beverages, such as coffee and beer. That being said, if you are particularly sensitive to a taste that you do not enjoy, it may not be easy to overcome an aversion. I myself am particularly sensitive to the acidity of vinegars and other ferments, which I find quite annoying, as it limits my experience of many cuisines. Every once in a while, I try them again to see if anything has changed. As of this writing, unfortunately, nothing has.




*Choose a caffeine pill that is powder enclosed in a plastic capsule, as opposed to a compressed tablet. I found that the latter often has some kind of flavoring added, which throws off the reference. The capsules have filler, usually something like rice flour that dilutes the bitterness, so you many need to increase the amount you use, but be warned: caffeine pills are hard to dissolve in water, likely because of the filler. Goody's powder dissolves much more easily and contains three bitter components: caffeine, acetaminophen, and aspirin. At higher concentrations when dissolved in water, it can have a strange acidic taste.












CHAPTER 3Coffee and Flavor


WE'VE COVERED TASTE IN THE TECHNICAL SENSE, but we all know that the act of partaking of food and drink imparts other sensations beyond the basic tastes. Our four other senses (smell, touch, sight, and hearing) also contribute. The sum of these sensory inputs is what we call flavor. This is the magical, mysterious part. When it comes to coffee, flavor—as you'll recall—is quality. And flavor is what brings us joy and wonder when we sip our cups. Flavor is what makes coffee taste like coffee—but also cocoa or fruit. How is that possible? Honestly, I'm not entirely sure and neither, apparently, is anyone else. But I promise that taking a close look at each component of flavor will make your morning cup seem even more remarkable and help you savor it on a deeper level.
In this chapter, we focus on smell (olfaction) and touch (somatosensation), as well as chemesthesis, sometimes called our trigeminal sense, which is related to our sense of touch. By the end, we'll have reviewed the primary sensory inputs that contribute to coffee flavor.
At base, flavor is the combination of sensory inputs that enable us to distinguish one item from another when we put them in our mouths. An apple may impart sweet and sour, but these qualities combined with its floral aroma, crisp texture, and more are what allow us to identify "Honeycrisp apple" and not, for example, "Bosc pear."
Flavor is not stagnant. As we saw in the previous chapter, coffee is a prime example of how flavor can change as we consume. Or as the writers of the excellent book Chemesthesis put it, flavor is "not a 'snapshot' in time, but more of a movie that unfolds while we eat."1 Let's never forget to enjoy the show!

Our Sense of Smell and Coffee
Recall that our sense of smell is called olfaction. Like our sense of taste, our sense of smell helps us detect and identify chemicals in our environment, which from an evolutionary perspective has kept our species alive. Historically, our sense of smell has been discounted as not as important as our other senses. But one in fifty genes in humans is devoted to the sense of smell, and as we'll see, it plays an important role in many aspects of our lives—not least of all because our lives are often driven by flavor.2
Mammals tend to have well-developed olfaction systems, particularly when it comes to discriminating different smells. We humans can discriminate—that is, detect differences between—at least one trillion odor stimuli. That means we can discriminate more odors than colors (2.3 to 7.5 million) and sound tones (340,000).3 People used to think that humans' sense of smell was inferior to that of other mammals, such as dogs and mice, since we have relatively few olfactory receptors in comparison. New research has shown that we have quite an advanced olfaction system and outperform many mammals, including dogs, with our sensitivity to tested odor stimuli—which are called odorants—and are on par with or only slightly worse at discriminating tested odorants.4


HOW DOES OUR SENSE OF SMELL WORK?
Our bodies detect smells in a similar way to how they detect the basic tastes of sweet, bitter, and umami: the lock and key principle. Odorants (keys) bind to olfactory receptors (locks) in sensory neurons, which are part of what's called the olfactory epithelium in the nose. The receptors activate (unlock) and the neurons transmit the information to the brain, which then results in our sensory perception of smell. Processing odor is a sophisticated procedure that involves a relatively large part of the brain, especially compared to other mammals. The sensory neurons transmit information directly to the olfactory bulb and orbifrontal cortex (part of the frontal lobe), as well as to the limbic system (which you'll recall is the so-called primitive brain). Our brain power makes up for the fact that our olfactory receptors are sparse compared to other mammals (we have about six million, and dogs have about three hundred million, for example).5
What we may be able to describe as a distinct smell—coffee, for example—is actually a combination of odorants simultaneously activating their corresponding receptors to produce what neuroscientist Gordon M. Shepherd calls "smell images" in the brain. In other words, the brain processes odor spatially, and each odor molecule triggers a unique spatial pattern. The brain reads many sensory inputs as spatial patterns—the most familiar being the pattern that results in what we call visual images—and odor is no different, although it's a bit harder to conceptualize. In fact, the brain creates smell images very similarly to how it creates visual images. The brain can then recognize an odor's unique spatial pattern and interpret it, much like how we recognize a face. Scientists can physically map out neural activity that creates these patterns, meaning we can actually see the smell images ourselves. Keep in mind, it's not the odor receptors in the nose that do this; they send the signal to the olfactory bulb in the brain, where the smell image is created.6
As with our sense of taste, our sense of smell helps us avoid danger (we are generally repulsed by the stench of rot, for example). And although modern life does not often require us to consciously do so, humans can use their sense of smell in the way that other mammals do: to find genetically dissimilar sexual partners (you've heard of pheromones, right?), to detect information about other people and animals (what they eat, if they are related to us, if we know them, and so on), and to track food via a scent trail.7



Orthonasal olfaction (sniffing) occurs when odorants enter through the nostrils and interact with odor receptors.
Retronasal olfaction happens when odorants start in the mouth and travel up into the nasal cavity to interact with odor receptors.

Olfaction also plays a major role—a dominant role, really—in flavor perception, including in coffee.8 Remember, there are only a handful of basic tastes that our taste buds detect, but we can detect thousands upon thousands of odorants, often at minuscule concentrations. As we'll see, taste and odor molecules combine, in a sense, to create seemingly infinite flavors.
Recall that we smell in two different ways—orthonasally and retronasally—and that those two types of smelling allow us to experience coffee in different ways. The first, orthonasal olfaction, happens when we sniff something, such as freshly ground beans (fragrance) and freshly brewed coffee (aroma). When odor molecules from those grounds or that cup of coffee enter the nasal passage through our nostrils, they stimulate the olfactory receptors and we recognize that characteristic coffee smell.9
Orthonasal olfaction is likely what you think of when you think of your sense of smell; it detects what's going on around us. Humans are pretty good at this—think of the last time you knew someone in the neighborhood was grilling outside though you couldn't see them, or that it was about to rain because you smelled petrichor in the air,* but the physical structure of our olfaction system is not as optimized for this type of smelling as it is in other animals, which is a big reason scientists used to believe that our sense of smell was inferior by comparison. For example, a dog's olfaction system is designed for it to be constantly sniffing the environment, pulling in odiferous clues about what's happening now and what has already happened. There is a reason they are trained to sniff out drugs, dead bodies, and low blood sugar.
We, on the other hand, are optimized for retronasal olfaction. Retronasal olfaction plays the biggest role when it comes to flavor—and this is where the human olfactory system really shines. Retronasal olfaction originates inside the mouth when we chew or swallow something and then exhale through the nose. When we swallow coffee, odor molecules are released in the mouth and travel through the back of our throats up into our noses, where they are decoded by receptors. Retronasal olfaction is such an integral part of flavor creation and eating that we usually aren't aware of it—we think we are tasting ("I love how this tastes!"), and it seems to be happening only in our mouths, not our noses. In reality, our brains are simultaneously decoding disparate taste and tactile information from the mouth and smell information from the nose to create a detailed story that "reads" to us as a single, cohesive perception. That's what flavor is. And it's hard to overstate the critical role that retronasal olfaction plays in all of this. Without odorants, we'd detect only the basic tastes: bitter, sour, sweet, salty, and umami. What we think of as flavor derives largely from our sense of smell.



PALATE EXERCISE

Basic Tastes or Retronasal Olfaction?
Use this exercise to discover for yourself the outsized role retronasal olfaction plays when it comes to flavor.
What you'll need

■measuring spoons
■granulated white sugar
■ground cinnamon

Mix together 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Plug your nose and taste the mixture. What do you taste? Release your nose and exhale through your nose. What do you taste now? This exercise should illustrate the pivotal role that retronasal olfaction plays in flavor perception.



Tip

■You can also try a blinded version of this exercise by choosing a type of chewy candy that comes in different flavors, such as jelly beans. Close your eyes and select a piece from the bag. With your eyes still closed, plug your nose and eat half the candy. What do you taste? Can you guess what flavor you are eating? Unplug your nose and exhale. Can you guess the flavor now? Open your eyes and see if you are right.





ODORANTS IN COFFEE
We learned in the last section that odorants are chemical compounds that interact with specific odor receptors. We also learned that multiple individual odorants may be responsible for a single smell, or sensory quality, that we can name: freshly cut grass, wet dog, chocolate chip cookie, coffee. Scientists believe there are close to one thousand different odorants in roasted coffee, which is a big reason for its alluring complexity.10 As we've seen, odorants behave like a symphony throughout the coffee tasting experience, shifting in intensity and character from the fragrance of dried grounds to the aroma of brewed coffee to the brewed beverage's flavor to the lingering aftertaste.
So, what are these odorants and where do they come from?
Some odorants are present in green (unroasted) coffee and others develop during the roasting process. According to the SCA, scientists classify coffee odorants by their chemical family, and it's a long list: hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids and anhydrides, esters, lactones, phenols, furans and pyrans, thiophenes, pyrroles, oxazoles, thiazoles, pyridines, pyrazines, miscellaneous nitrogen-containing compounds, and miscellaneous sulfur-containing compounds. More than 140 compounds are in the furans and pyrans family alone, which are created via Maillard reactions during roasting.11
You might think the odorants within these families would have similar sensory qualities, but it isn't as cut and dried as that. Instead, the SCA recommends thinking about coffee odorants as fitting into two broad categories: those that contribute to "characteristic" coffee aroma/ flavor—what makes us say "that's coffee, by golly!"—and those that contribute to "a distinctive character of the cup"12—what makes us say "this coffee tastes like a blueberry muffin!"
Scientists believe that so-called potent odorants—odorants that are intense even at very small concentrations—that are common across different types of coffee (no matter the variety, processing, roasting, etc.) are responsible for coffee's characteristic sensory qualities. These odorants, the "basic ingredients," if you will, might be present in different concentrations and with various other compounds in different coffees, but they are a through line; that's why scientists believe they are responsible for coffee's, well, coffeeness.13 Some research suggests that there are as many as thirty-eight potent odorants in coffee, and strangely, they tend to not smell great on their own: descriptors such as meaty, catty, roasty, and earthy abound. Other associated descriptors—caramel-like, spicy—sound better. Nevertheless, taken together, they create the pleasant, alluring odor we know as coffee. Still, different coffees can smell wildly different. There are hundreds of different compounds that contribute to the unique character of individual coffees. The SCA says to think of these as the "spices and condiments that add complexity, depth, and diversity to the basic ingredients." Some of these compounds have known effects; for example, the compound ethyl 3-methylbutanoate is known to produce a blueberry quality.14 But it's likely that not every odor compound in coffee has been identified, and even if we can tie isolated compounds to certain sensory qualities, what happens when nature and roasting mix them together in different combinations and different ratios still cannot be predicted beyond broad strokes, if at all.
Coffee professionals often train their noses with an aroma kit called Le Nez du Café, which contains references for thirty-six key coffee aromas, grouped into ten categories: earthy, vegetable, dry/vegetal, woody, spicy, floral, fruity, animal, toasty, and chemical. Le Nez du Café is created in France by highly skilled craftspeople in much the same way that perfume is made. Each reference is a vial of liquid that has been precisely dosed to replicate an aroma. Often, the reference contains the chemical associated with the aroma, such as 4-ethylguaiacol, which is responsible for a clove-like characteristic in coffee (and wine). This kit is quite expensive, and therefore impractical for casual tasters. Although it is used in SCA sensory training courses, students don't usually purchase the kit themselves; they use the one their educator supplies. They repeatedly smell the references to lock the aromas and names into their memory bank until they can identify all of them during blinded testing. The idea is that they will then be able to identify and name the aromas when they are present in coffee. We will cover some similar aromas with different (more accessible) references in chapter 4.
There are some indications that smell can influence texture—one study found that the odor of vanilla increased the perception of creaminess in pudding.15 Although I could not find studies specific to coffee, other research suggests that specific aroma compounds can influence our perception of the basic tastes. One showed that certain aroma compounds in brown sugar could increase the perceived sweetness of a sugar solution (without increasing the true sweetness of the solution).16 This kind of thing might be the key to why coffee can taste sweet, even though its level of sweet tastants is below a human's detection threshold. Coffee has many aromas that are associated with fruity sweetness and caramel sweetness, for example.



Our Sense of Touch and Coffee
Our sense of touch is called somatosensation. The somatosensory system responds to three main types of physical stimulus via corresponding somatosensory receptors: pain (nociceptors), temperature (warm or cool thermoreceptors), and taction (mechanoreceptors). Taction includes several familiar stimuli, including touch, vibration, pressure, stretching, and more. The somatosensory system also helps us recognize where the parts of our body are and what they are doing, such as if our hand is behind our back or above our head, as well as what's required of our muscles at any given time.17 As we'll see, our sense of touch plays a key—though often overlooked—role when it comes to flavor perception in general. And although you may have never consciously considered how coffee feels when you drink it, I bet it's played a role more than once in how much you enjoyed a cup.

SMELL, ODOR, AROMA, FRAGRANCE ... OH MY!

You may have noticed at this point that the terms related to smelling—that is, perceiving a sensory quality through the olfactory system—are somewhat confusing. This is because laypeople use terms one way in everyday speech, while scientists may use these same terms to refer to something specific—and coffee professionals have added further levels of distinction for the language of their industry.
As mentioned, scientists tend to use the word odor to refer to any sensory quality that results from an odorant interacting with the olfactory system. Coffee people have two different terms they use for odor, depending on when it happens during the coffee experience: fragrance for the odor of freshly ground dry coffee and aroma for the odor of brewed coffee. Both refer to orthonasal olfaction. (Likewise, the World Coffee Research Sensory Lexicon uses the term aroma to refer to sensory attributes that are experienced orthonasally.) In the coffee industry, once olfaction is happening retronasally, the odorants are either contributing to flavor or considered aftertaste.
In this book, I try to use the term smell to refer only to the sense we call smell or the verb associated with the action—so I don't use it to refer to odor, even though we do that in everyday language.
There's one more term I'm going to throw into the mix: aromatics. The term aromatics—as in "the aromatics of this coffee"—is used by seemingly everyone to refer generally to the combination of odorants that contribute to the smell-related sensory qualities of a cup of coffee, no matter when it takes place in the experience or whether it happens orthonasally or retronasally.



HOW DOES OUR SENSE OF TOUCH WORK?
Unlike our senses of taste and smell, our sense of touch is primarily a physical sense: it responds to physical stimuli as opposed to chemical stimuli (usually, as we'll see). Like our other senses, touch uses neural receptors to detect stimuli and send that information to the brain. It starts with receptors associated with the trigeminal nerve, the fifth cranial nerve. The information is then transmitted first to the brain stem, where vital functions are controlled. This makes sense—if you feel pain, for example, it needs to be dealt with immediately. From there, signals make their way to the thalamus and then a part of the cerebral cortex that is associated with somatosensation.18
Although most of us probably associate our sense of touch primarily with our skin, there are somatosensory receptors in almost every part of the body—think about the pain you feel in your tummy and esophagus when acid reflux strikes. Our mouths are full of somatosensory receptors, too, and these are the ones we'll focus on as we explore the role of touch in the experience of coffee. In fact, our mouths are about as sensitive to touch as our fingertips, and our tongues are more sensitive to temperature than any other part of our bodies.19

Our mouths are about as sensitive to touch as our fingertips, and our tongues are more sensitive to temperature than any other part of our bodies.

Mouthfeel is the general term for the somatosensory inputs that are gathered in the oral cavity. In other words, it's the physical and tactile sensations we feel in our mouths when we eat or drink something.20 The neural network in our mouths lets us know if something is crunchy or squishy, piping hot or tepid, thick and sticky or thin and watery, hard as a rock or soft, and more. As mentioned, the trigeminal nerve plays a large role in our perception of mouthfeel. It's the sensory nerve of the face, large parts of the scalp, mouth, and teeth. On the motor side of things, it also controls your chewing and tongue. The movement of your tongue, along with nerve endings in your teeth, helps you determine the size, shape, and weight of something in your mouth—and also if it is painful or painless, hot or cold, crunchy or chewy, rough or smooth, and so on.21 For the curious: a different cranial nerve—the facial nerve—is responsible for the sense of taste and the muscles that create facial expressions.22
Mouthfeel is often directly related to whether we find things pleasant or unpleasant, sometimes completely independently of the flavor of the item. Part of this is personal preference. I, for example, am completely repulsed by the texture of Jell-O, though the flavor is fine, and I enjoy the texture of bananas, though the flavor isn't my favorite.
However, our judgment about food or drink is also often linked with whether mouthfeel confirms or refutes the expectations set by past experience and other sensory inputs—sight, smell, etc.—before we put things into our mouths. For example, if we see a potato chip that has been crispy in the past and appears crispy in the moment, we'll likely be turned off when the chip turns out to be soft in our mouths—even though the other aspects of flavor are exactly the same.23 This can be not just preference but a line of defense—just like our sense of taste and aroma, mouthfeel helps us determine whether something is safe to eat or not. When things that are usually hard are soft and things that are usually soft are hard, it's often a sign that the food is old, and possibly on the road to decay and danger. But mouthfeel also plays a role independent of expectation. Mouthfeel is what tells us our coffee is too hot to safely drink, for example.

CHEMESTHESIS (CHEMICAL IRRITATION)

Earlier I said that our sense of touch is "primarily a physical sense" and "usually" responds to physical stimulus. The somatosensory system can also respond to chemical stimuli, and when this happens it's called chemesthesis.24 Sometimes, chemesthesis is simply referred to as "chemical irritation" because the result is often irritating: the burning caused by capsaicin in chiles, the sharp cooling caused by menthol in mint, the pungency caused by piperine in peppercorns, the tingling caused by carbonation in soda, the warming caused by gingerols in ginger. However, in the right balance, these "irritations" can contribute to our enjoyment of food and drink.
The compounds that cause chemesthesis often come from plant oils and extracts, and these compounds might protect a plant in the wild—from grazing animals, for example.25
Chemesthesis can seem like it's part of taste, but technically speaking, it's not. The chemicals that provoke chemesthesis do not interact with taste receptors; they interact with touch receptors. Some researchers think of chemesthesis as "a sensory subquality" of touch,26 or a property of all three of the primary modalities of somatosensation (pain, temperature, taction). A chemical such as capsaicin interacts with temperature receptors, which is why we may perceive a room-temperature habanero as "hot" on our tongue, though it has nothing to do physical temperature. Chemesthesis can also trigger involuntary responses—coughing, salivating, sneezing—which are the body's attempt to rid itself of these irritants.
While chemical substances often interact with the sensory receptors of the trigeminal nerve, they can also interact with receptors and/or ion channels in epithelial cells (your skin is a type of epithelial cell), which means chemesthesis can happen all over your body, not just in your mouth and nose.27 (You may have noticed this when, um, voiding after a spicy meal.)
The most common tactile sensation in coffee is astringency, the tongue-drying sensation. This sensation is also common in red wine, and it's caused by tannins, a compound found in many plants. Coffee contains tannins, too, although it doesn't appear that the mechanism behind astringency in coffee has been studied much. Tannins are generally thought to contribute to coffee's astringency, as well as some acids, such as quinic acid and chlorogenic acid.28
It has been well established that astringency occurs when compounds, such as tannins, bind with proteins in saliva, causing them to separate out and create a residue in the mouth. Proteins are what cause saliva to feel slippery, so the binding action decreases that slippery feeling. This combined with the residue creates the drying sensation we know as astringency.29
However, there is some scientific debate about the mechanism that detects astringency—and remember, the mechanism is what scientists need to explain to definitively categorize the sensation. For example, astringency used to be considered a basic taste, but that has since been disproved, as taste receptors are not activated. The trigeminal nerve is involved, but details remain elusive. I have found research that refers to astringency as chemesthesis (meaning, it interacts with chemical receptors). But I've also found research that says it's not clear whether astringency is the result of an interaction with chemical receptors or other tactile receptors.30
The important thing, though, is to realize that astringency in coffee—whatever it is—falls under the umbrella of touch, or mouthfeel. People tend to conflate astringency with bitterness, and although both may be present in coffee at the same time, they are distinct sensory perceptions. Still, astringency is an important component of a coffee's mouthfeel, so it's well worth training yourself to detect it. Astringency is a distinctly drying, puckering, tightening, or tingling sensation felt on the surface and/or edges of the tongue. You may also feel it in in your cheeks.





PALATE EXERCISE

Astringency or Bitterness?
Use this exercise to train yourself to discriminate between astringency (touch) and bitterness (taste).
What you'll need

■digital scale (0.1 gram precision)
■alum
■1 liter filtered or spring water (no additives), plus more for tasting plain
■0.05% bitter solution (page 29)
■three equal-size drinking glasses

Create a 0.05% alum solution by dissolving 0.5 grams of alum in 1 liter of water, stirring or shaking until the alum is completely dissolved.
Pour the alum solution into the first glass, plain water into the second glass, and the bitter solution into the third glass. Taste each and compare the sensations you feel on your tongue and around your mouth.



Tips

■Alum can usually be found with the spices or herbs at the grocery store. It's used for pickling, so it may be placed near other pickling paraphernalia. If you can't find it, you can also identify astringency by eating an underripe banana. Try to focus on the drying sensation it produces in your mouth. Keep in mind that the intensity of astringency and where you feel it may be unique to you.
■Store the solutions in the refrigerator and use within a couple of days. Let them come to room temperature before tasting.
■The alum solution is the reference for the "mouth drying" attribute in the Sensory Lexicon. See chapter 4 for more on these attributes.




Mouthfeel contributes to our ability to distinguish and identify flavor. It can actually influence our perception of the other senses that contribute to flavor—and vice versa. For example, studies have found that viscosity increases the detection threshold (that is, it decreases the intensity) of sour, sweet, and bitter, while it increases the intensity of umami. Temperature also affects our ability to taste. Very hot temperatures impede our ability to taste. Research finds that we best detect sucrose (sweet) and other tastants at 72 to 91°F. Likewise, you can taste freshly brewed hot coffee better after it has a moment to cool.31 In fact, the SCA outlines protocols related to temperature for when professional coffee tasters evaluate coffee. The first taste should not happen until the coffee reaches 160°F. Certain aspects of coffee (acidity, body, and balance) are evaluated between 160 and 140°F, and other aspects (sweetness, uniformity, cleanliness) are not evaluated until the brew "approaches room temperature," or below 100°F. Professional tasters are not supposed to taste coffee below 70°F.32


MOUTHFEEL AND COFFEE
A coffee's mouthfeel contributes to not only our overall perception of its flavor but also our enjoyment of it. You can even use it to help you decide what kind of coffee preparation you prefer and how to adjust your brewing method to your liking. The main components of mouthfeel in coffee are temperature, astringency, thickness, and texture. Temperature and astringency may already be top of mind for you when you drink coffee. We tend to have our preferences about the preferred temperature of coffee—when it's cold outside, we tend to want it hot, and when it's hot outside, we increasingly want it cold.
The level of a coffee's astringency likely also contributes to your enjoyment of coffee, even if you didn't know it was called astringency until you read this book. Unlike in red wine, where astringency is often a desired quality, astringency in coffee is generally considered an unpleasant characteristic, as it can easily dominate the cup.33 According to the SCA, astringency is associated with coffee that is underripe or underroasted, both of which may have larger concentrations of chlorogenic acids, which we have learned contribute to astringency in coffee.34 In the United States, astringency also tends to be associated with poorly extracted coffee. Chlorogenic acids are relatively large, which means it takes some doing for water to extract them. But in some brewing methods, such as pour over, water can sometimes channel through the coffee bed, causing it to bypass some grounds and spend too much time with others. The latter provides an opportunity for water to extract the chlorogenic acids, increasing astringency.35
Together, thickness and texture are what coffee professionals call body. This is the definition that the SCA gives in the Sensory Cupping Handbook.36 In my experience, coffee people often use the terms body and mouthfeel interchangeably—you may have noticed this out in the world, too. But I'm going to go with the SCA on this one: Body is a characterization of only the tactile qualities of coffee, and it is a mere component of mouthfeel. Mouthfeel (for coffee specifically) includes temperature, astringency, thickness, and texture.
To complicate matters, the terms thickness and texture are nebulous. My understanding is that texture is the broadest term that describes tactile sensory qualities, and thickness is a subcategory, one that is associated with the coffee's "weight" (another euphemism that the coffee industry uses) or "viscosity" (a term related to a liquid's flow rate that science uses). But thickness and texture are often thought of separately in the coffee world. The simplest description I can come up with is this: thickness describes how close to water coffee feels in the mouth. The closer to water that coffee feels in the mouth, the "thinner" or "lighter" it is. The more that coffee feels like water plus something else, the "thicker" or "heavier" it is. Texture, on the other hand, describes all the other tactile sensations of drinking coffee.



PALATE EXERCISE

Heavy and Light Body
Use this exercise to help you distinguish between light body and heavy body in beverages, including coffee.
What you'll need

■skim (fat-free) milk
■1% milk
■whole milk
■filtered or spring water (no additives)
■four equal-size glasses

Pour equal amounts of skim milk, 1% milk, whole milk, and water into the glasses. Sip from each, focusing on the weight of the liquid in your mouth. Press your tongue through the liquid to help you get a sense of its thickness. Rinse your mouth with water between each sample. It may also help to compare the milk samples to the water. Can you tell the difference between them? Which feels heaviest? Lightest?
These milks all have different levels of butterfat in them, while the rest of the components should be largely the same. These percentages vary by country, but in the United States, skim milk has 0 to 0.5 percent, 1% milk has 1 percent, and whole milk has 3.25 percent. Fat is a lipid and lipids contribute directly to body.



Tips

■If you'd like to do this blinded, simply label the cups on the bottom and ask a friend to arrange them for you so you don't know which is which.
■For a more extreme comparison, throw half-and-half (10.5 to 18 percent butterfat) into the mix. Note: 1% milk and half-and-half are used as references for the oily mouthfeel attribute in the Sensory Lexicon.
■For vegan readers, try this exercise with canned coconut milk. Shake the can very well to distribute the coconut cream, then distribute the coconut milk evenly between two measuring cups. Set one cup aside; this is your full-fat reference. Dilute the second cup with an equal amount of water (so 1 part coconut milk, 1 part water); this is your medium-fat reference. Pour half of this mixture into a third measuring cup. Dilute this mixture with an equal amount of water (so 1 part mixture, 1 part water); this is your low-fat reference.




The biggest challenge, which extends beyond the coffee world, is that texture is abjectly difficult to describe, so we reach for words and end up speaking in a kind of metaphor. Senses tend to be like this, and it's hard enough when you can see the thing in question—how would you describe the color blue to someone?—let alone when you can't. Language is an imperfect medium, and in the end we tend to mix up terms, including those that have scientific specificity. On the facing page, I have adapted and renamed a table of expressions used to describe liquid foods from an academic paper called "Texture Is a Sensory Property" to focus it on coffee mouthfeel terms and offer some concrete definitions.37 In the Notes row, I have tried my best to provide context where needed and shore up the discrepancies between the science terms and the coffee terms. There is currently no exhaustive lexicon of common coffee mouthfeel terms,38 so keep in mind that these definitions are based on my own experience hearing and using these terms in the world. Perhaps we'll get a codified lexicon one day! In the meantime, I hope this table helps you describe your coffee more accurately.
Coffee's body (thickness and texture) is caused by insoluble solids—that is, compounds that cannot be dissolved by water—that are suspended in the brew. One type of these compounds is called polysaccharides (carbohydrate molecules such as cellulose, hemicellulose, arabinogalactan, and pectin), which are too large to dissolve. Instead, they "uncoil" and remain suspended in the coffee. Some bits of plant material are so large we can see them in the brew—we call these fines, or sediment when they settle. These are very fine particles of the beans, a by-product of grinding. Another big contributor to body is lipids (triglycerides, terpenes, tocopherols, and sterols). In lay terms, coffee oil is an example of a lipid. Lipids are hydrophobic, which means they can't dissolve in water. But they can become emulsified—think of a salad dressing that needs a good amount of shaking or whisking for the oil to combine fully with the acid and other parts. With the help of other compounds, coffee oils can become stabilized in coffee just like the oil in salad dressing. This is very apparent in espresso crema, but drip coffee can have suspended oil, too, though it may not be as incorporated—have you ever seen a shiny oil slick floating on top of your coffee? Lipids contribute to texture that is said to be smooth or oily.39

Notes
Science distinguishes between viscosity and body. It's blurrier in coffee. In my experience, the terms thick and thin are used as criticisms, while heavy and light are used to describe coffees that conform to expectations. But they all relate to the same thing: a coffee's thickness.
In my experience, creamy is used to describe a round, smooth, velvety feeling, and juicy is used to describe a feeling of increased salivation. These are on par with how science uses these terms, but these are much more subtle textures in coffee than, say, in dairy products or fruit juice. Round is an impression that you can feel the coffee all around the tongue/mouth simultaneously.
In my experience, oily, mouth-coating, and lingering go hand in hand. Oily coffees literally contain oils that tend to leave residue behind, so feelings of mouth-coating and lingering contribute to aftertaste as well. In my experience, clean is used to describe the opposite of oily: an absence of mouth-coating.
These terms are often used to describe aftertaste, too. This makes sense, as the chemical effect of astringency lingers. New research suggests that there can be different qualities of astringency, so that's why I put all these terms here. I'm not sure everyone would associate powdery with astringency, for example, but I do.
Thank goodness: one straightforward category!




The upshot is this: the more suspended stuff there is in coffee, the more our mouths can detect it—and the less like water it feels.
To some degree, body is influenced by the variety, processing, and roasting of coffee. For example, robusta coffee (C. canephora) tends to be denser with fewer lipids than arabica coffee (C. arabica), so robusta's body can feel heavier and rougher. Natural processed beans—in which the coffee cherry is left on the bean as it dries after harvesting—tend to have heavier bodies than washed, possibly because of the influence processing has on polysaccharides.40 And roasting degrades coffee material and forces more oil from the bean, which means that longer, darker roasts can also result in a heavier body than shorter, lighter roasts.41
But arguably, brewing method plays the biggest role when it comes to body. That is because some brewing methods allow insoluble compounds into the final cup, while others hold them back, out of the cup. For many manual coffee methods, this is primarily dependent on the type of filter that is used. A French press, for example, has a relatively open metal filter that allows many suspended compounds through into the brew, while something like a V60 or Chemex uses a paper filter, which captures many of those same compounds. The result is that French press coffee tends to have a heavier body than paper-filtered coffee. Decoction methods—which involve boiling coffee and water together to extract flavor, such as those made with an ibrik/cezve—tend to produce coffee with lots of suspended particles, which contribute to a characteristic heavy, gritty texture. On the other hand, espresso methods use pressure to help emulsify lipids, which results in not only crema but also a heavy, oily body.
When you are tasting coffee and evaluating mouthfeel, keep in mind the potato chip example (see page 63): our impression of mouthfeel often has a lot to do with expectation. If you purchase an espresso, which is supposed to be characteristically heavy and oily, you'll likely be disappointed with a thin, watery shot—it's a sign that it wasn't prepared to expectation. Likewise, if you order coffee made with an ibrik/cezve and fault it when it does not taste like a Chemex, I'd argue that's on you, buddy, not the coffee. In other words, there is no platonic ideal when it comes to body, and context is often key.

There is no platonic ideal when it comes to body, and context is often key.

Of course, preference plays a role—and you can choose preparation methods that align with your preference, once you know them. There is simply a lot of variability when it comes to body. In my circles at least, coffee professionals tend to prize so-called clean coffee (those with few fines and oils), which means noses sometimes get turned up at French press coffee, with its "inferior" thickness and texture. It's not inferior; it's just different. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
One complicating factor is that body can be a sign of under- and over-extracted coffee—that is, coffee that has been prepared at the extremes of the spectrum. Underextracted coffee tends to be watery (because there wasn't enough time for water to extract compounds) and over-extracted coffee tends to feel thick (because there was too much time for water to extract compounds). But body is only one of many signs of faulty extraction. Underextracted coffee also tends to have faint aroma and flavor and may be too sour. Overextracted coffee tends to be over-poweringly bitter and astringent in addition to feeling thick. In other words, you must consider the whole, not just individual parts, when making a judgment.



PALATE EXERCISE

Exploring Body
Use this exercise to apply what you learned with Heavy and Light Body (page 69) directly to coffee.
What you'll need

■ground coffee of choice
■French press
■paper-filter coffee device (such as V60 or Chemex)
■filtered or spring water (no additives)

Prepare coffee in a French press and with a paper-filter method. Try to time it so they are ready at the same time, or use an insulated thermos to keep one hot so you can taste them at the same temperature. Alternatively, buy these two types of coffees in a café. Taste each and compare their body. Compare each to water. What do you notice? Describe the thickness and texture using the terms from the table on page 71.



Tip

■The more types of coffee you drink—side by side, if you can—the better you'll be at distinguishing body. If you have the opportunity to travel, seek out different methods of preparation that might not be available where you live and make a conscious effort to note the body of the coffee.







Bringing It All Together: Flavor and Coffee
We've explored the senses that contribute to flavor individually, but how does our perception of flavor happen? At base, the brain simultaneously synthesizes sensory inputs—taste, smell, touch—to produce a singular complex impression in which the components cannot easily be teased from the whole. That whole is what we recognize as flavor. As described by neuroscientist Gordon M. Shepherd, "the brain actively creates the sensation of flavor" by generating patterns from sensory inputs, which can then be associated with specific meaning to us.42 The meaning of flavor—nutritious, dangerous, pleasant, unpleasant—can be stored and recalled quickly, as well as manipulated.
As we've seen, each of our senses starts with some kind of receptor that relays information to the brain. The pathways to the brain are different, but they all meet up in one place: the orbitofrontal cortex—part of the prefrontal cortex that is just above our eye sockets (aka "orbits"). According to Shepherd, this potentially means that this is where sensory inputs are combined, the site of flavor recognition. The cells in this region are also connected to the parts of the brain that are involved with emotion, flexible learning, memory, and decisions about rewards. All of these are necessary processes when it comes to responding to flavor: Do we like it? Is it good or bad for us? Have we had this before? Did it result in an unpleasant outcome? Does it remind us of anything we've eaten before? Should we keep eating?43 My understanding is that flavor exists to be responded to.
One of the most interesting things about flavor is that despite our intellectual understanding of its myriad components, it is a unique, singular impression—it's too simple to say it is the sum of taste plus smell plus touch. All these senses interact with each other, are informed by each other, and in some cases transform each other to create the perception we call flavor. This is called multisensory integration. If you read Shepherd's book Neurogastronomy—and I hope that you do—you'll see there are many examples that illustrate how flavor is more than the sum of its parts, but I'll mention just a few concepts here.
The first is costimulation, when two sensations, such as taste and retronasal olfaction, are experienced together. If you completed the exercise on page 57, you experienced this for yourself. When costimulation happens, it activates a larger portion of the brain than the sum area of each stimulus experienced individually. Sometimes, the sensations "fuse" together (aka sensory fusion), and we think we can, for example, smell a taste ("This coffee smells sweet"), which is not physiologically possible. In some cases, it's not just that the two stimuli are being detected at the same time; some cells actually respond to both stimuli at the same time. For example, some taste cells also respond to texture and temperature (mouthfeel).44
Sometimes, sensory modalities influence each other—we've touched on this briefly in other parts of the book. For example, viscosity (our sense of touch) is affected by the basic tastes: "sweetness enhances it, sourness lessens it, bitterness has no effect."45
And sometimes, different sensory stimuli enhance each other. This happens when two or more stimuli are perceived together and result in a fundamentally different perception than if each stimulus was experienced individually. Intramodal enhancement means this happens between two like stimuli (such as two of the basic tastes) and cross-modal enhancement means this happens between stimuli of different senses (such as taste and smell). For example, research has shown that when two tastants that are individually below the threshold for human perception are mixed and experienced at once, humans can suddenly detect both. The same thing happens between certain tastes and smells, although they must "complement" each other.46 As alluded to earlier, this is related to one of the theories floating around that attempts to explain why we all claim we can taste sweetness in coffee when all potential sweet tastants in coffee are below the human threshold for detection. Perhaps tastants and odorants are enhancing each other.


A representation of the primary taste, smell, and mouthfeel (touch) inputs that contribute to coffee flavor.

Shepherd coined the term "human brain flavor system" to describe the myriad parts and processes of the brain that result in flavor.47 He encourages us to think of this system in two stages. The first is all the sensory systems—olfactory, gustatory, somatosensory—that receive sensory input and combine it into flavor. Combined, these patterns create what Shepherd thinks of as an "'internal brain image' of a flavor object."48 The second is all the other parts of the brain that respond to flavor, "the action systems that draw on the full capacity of the human brain systems that generate and control behavior."49
Remember, from a biological perspective, flavor is a tidy packet of information—some hardwired and some learned—that tells our brain how to respond to the things we put in our mouths. The parts of our brain that engage in detecting, processing, and synthesizing flavor are vast, even when compared to other mammals, which implies it has played a critical role in our survival as a species. This aspect of our biology—the sheer amount of processing power the brain offers up for flavor—is, indeed, uniquely human. And perhaps most important for this book, our ability to articulate and appreciate flavor is uniquely human as well. To understand that a bit more, we should take a look at how flavor, emotion, and memory are interconnected.

FLAVOR, EMOTION, AND MEMORY
In the last section, I briefly mentioned that all roads of sensory input lead to the orbitofrontal cortex and that cells in this part of the brain are also linked to the limbic areas that deal with emotion, memory, flexible learning, and decisions about rewards. Biologically, this all boils down to motivation: to get what our bodies need, the brain must create a desire for food and drink. Emotionally, we interpret motivation, or lack thereof, as liking or disliking something. As mentioned earlier, the more scientific term for this is hedonic value, how pleasant or unpleasant we perceive something to be. So, at least in part, our emotions play a role in getting us to consume the nutrients we need to survive.
Interestingly, research has shown that our hedonic reactions to the basic tastes are hardwired from birth—sweetness creates pleasant reactions and bitterness creates unpleasant reactions and so on.50 But flavor seems like so much more than that. We all have experienced the emotion-eliciting power of food and drink. It can make us smile. It can make us recoil in disgust. It can surprise us. It can also trigger memories, which are linked to emotion.
For example, have you ever smelled something that triggered a memory of a specific time or place? Perhaps you couldn't even name the aroma, but a vivid scene from days gone by flashed in your mind's eye: a day spent at Coney Island, bath time as a child, the forest behind your parents' house. This phenomenon is not a fluke. Aroma and memory in particular are closely linked—and it has to do with the anatomy we've discussed before. Recall that aroma is first processed by our olfactory bulb, which is a part of our forebrain. The olfactory system is the only sensory system that sends information directly to the forebrain. The information is then sent quickly to the limbic system, specifically the amygdala and hippocampus, which are responsible for memories and emotions.51 Scientists believe that this more direct route makes aroma more deeply intertwined with memory. All the other senses go to the thalamus, the relay station deep in the center of the brain, for processing first; aroma bypasses it.52
Usually, a smell triggers an emotion first, then the memory follows (or sometimes it doesn't and you're left with just the emotion). The memories tend to be quite specific. For example, when I was trying out Le Nez du Café while researching for this book, one of the scents struck me as quite familiar—it reminded me of my horseback riding lessons in middle school and how my friends and I used to climb the hay bales and peer down to the arena from above. I hadn't thought about doing that in years. The aroma turned out to be straw.53
As we'll see in chapter 4, memories and emotions will play a key role as you set out to develop your palate. We will try to create aroma and flavor experiences (memories) so that you have a better chance of recalling them later. And you can use your personal memories to suss out clues as you try to identify sensory attributes in coffee.


WHAT INFLUENCES COFFEE FLAVOR?
There is still much to learn about the taste, aroma, and mouthfeel compounds that influence coffee flavor. Some say there are over a thousand compounds that contribute to coffee flavor. What we've talked about so far is just a tiny peek into the complexity of the coffee bean.
Although coffee's sensory attributes have been studied for more than one hundred years and many compounds (though not all) have been identified, there isn't a ton of research that comprehensively links specific compounds to specific perceived sensory qualities in coffee. Besides that, most research that does exist focuses on one type of coffee—a specific variety, processing technique, or origin. So, there is no comprehensive view or detailed list of chemicals and corresponding flavor attributes that I can reproduce here.54 And even if there were, we have just learned how multisensory integration—individual sensory attributes that add up to more than the sum of their parts—is at the heart of flavor. We have very little grasp of how coffee compounds combine to create the flavors we find in the cup.55
That being said, we know that coffee's flavor compounds are impacted by a variety of factors, including genetics, origin and processing, roasting, and brewing and consumption. Let's take a high-level look at the factors that affect coffee flavor.


GENETICS
The chemical makeup of a particular variety of coffee predisposes it to certain sensory characteristics. The exact chemical makeup of a coffee bean depends, first, on its species. The two most common species of coffee are arabica (C. arabica) and robusta (C. canephora). For example, the typical chemical makeup of green arabica coffee (the kind that is most frequently used in specialty coffee) is:

•Polysaccharides (50.0 to 55.0 percent)
•Lipids (12.0 to 18.0 percent)
•Proteins (11.0 to 13.0 percent)
•Oligosaccharides (6.8 to 8.0 percent)
•Chlorogenic acids (5.5 to 8.0 percent)
•Minerals (3.0 to 4.2 percent)
•Aliphatic acids (1.5 to 2.0 percent)
•Trigonelline (1.0 to 1.2 percent)
•Caffeine (0.9 to 1.2 percent)56

The other common coffee species, robusta, has a different chemical makeup, one that many specialty coffee professionals (at least in the West) have historically viewed as less desirable, with harsh, bitter, burnt, and rubbery attributes.* Chemically speaking, robusta has more caffeine (which may contribute to its more bitter taste), fewer lipids, and more chlorogenic acids (which may also contribute to its bitterness, as well as astringency).
Next, different varieties of coffee have different genetic makeups. Within specialty coffee there are dozens of arabica varieties, with new hybrids being developed as we speak. You have likely seen the names of varieties on your coffee bags: bourbon, typica, caturra, K7, maragogipe, SL32—the list goes on. Think of the mix of compounds in these varieties as the raw material—it is the starting point for the tastants, odorants, etc., that will eventually interact with our sensory systems. The potential of this raw material is shaped by how and where the bean is cultivated, how it's processed, how it's roasted, and how it's brewed. But genetics are where it all begins. If the potential for quality (read: flavor!) is not already encoded in the genetics, you can't make up for it at any later stage. You can, however, destroy quality (read: flavor!) at any or all of the later stages.57 You can also work to unlock the best qualities at each stage. Because so many factors influence coffee flavor, it's hard to make even generalizations about varieties and coffee flavor. But as you'll see in the next chapter, I do share some commonly accepted beliefs about flavor and variety.


ORIGIN AND PROCESSING
Where and how the coffee is grown, harvested, and processed can help green beans reach their highest sensory potential—or not. It all starts with how the coffee is grown; complexity develops as the coffee cherry—the fruit around the seeds we call coffee beans—develops.58 Research has shown that ripe fruit has lower concentrations of phenolic compounds (which means less astringency) and higher concentrations of volatile compounds (which means more aroma) than immature fruit; thus coffee must be picked at peak maturity.
Environmental and agricultural factors—geographic origin, climate, elevation, temperature, shading, fertilizers, and more—can also impact the coffee's flavor potential. In this way, coffee is like other agricultural products. Consider the wine industry, where it is relatively common knowledge that terroir of grape affects the flavor. These elements are so well studied in wine that master wine tasters can tell what region grapes were grown in just by smelling and tasting the wine. We're not quite there yet with coffee.
Processing, or how the fruit is removed from the coffee bean and how the bean is dried, has a big impact on flavor. For one thing, if this process is botched, it results in taints or defects in the cup. But in addition, the processing method producers choose to use can impart distinct flavor characteristics. There are two primary types of processing, and each affects coffee flavor in different ways.
In very general terms, wet processing (also called washed process) means the fruit is removed from the coffee bean (the seed) before the coffee bean is dried. A machine removes the outer skin and pulp, then the beans often go through a fermentation process before the rest of the fruit is removed with water and the beans are dried. Dry processing (also called natural process) means the beans are dried with the whole fruit on before it is removed. (There is also an in-between process where only part of the fruit is left on as the bean dries; this is called honey process, among other names.)

The anatomy of a coffee cherry.
Which process producers use often depends on where they are in the world. For example, localities with little access to water use dry processing methods. Similarly, it can be challenging to naturally process in countries with high humidity, as the moisture in the air can lead to long dry times and spoilage.
The process of removing the mucilage (pectin) layer contributes flavor compounds. If coffee goes through a fermentation stage, the enzymes and yeast involved with breaking down parts of the coffee cherry are thought to produce additional flavor compounds59 (though fermentation gone awry can produce chemical notes and other off-flavors). Some producers have been experimenting with various yeast strains and lactic acid bacteria during the fermentation process to encourage pleasant flavors, but this has not been scientifically studied in-depth.60
Natural process coffee dries with the fruit on, and it's thought that chemical reactions occur between the fruit and the bean as it dries, which accounts for the distinct fruity flavor notes of carefully processed natural coffee.61 Sometimes naturals are criticized for being "boring," perhaps because most natural coffees have similar fruit-forward flavor notes (often of dried fruit; page 108). But on the other hand, natural coffees tend to be surprising and bold for people who've never tried them before. Many coffee professionals were inspired to get into coffee after drinking their first natural, often an Ethiopian natural, which can taste exactly like a blueberry.
Wet process coffees tend to let the compounds inherent in the bean itself shine. They are often described as "clean."62 Research shows they tend to have higher acidity, lighter body, and more aroma than dry process coffees.63 Dry process coffees often have a distinct quality; they tend to be sweet and smooth with heavier body. And although science hasn't pinned down all the reasons why, I'm betting your tongue is already capable of distinguishing a natural coffee from a washed coffee.


ROASTING
The way a coffee is roasted makes the beans' highest sensory potential available to us or diminishes it. Lots of chemical reactions happen during the roasting process to alter or transform flavor compounds in coffee. And thank goodness. If you were to crush up raw coffee beans and extract them, you'd get a grassy, astringent beverage. Roasting transforms the mix of compounds into something enjoyable and makes the bean itself more soluble—so our brewing water can extract flavor compounds.64 In fact, the two hundred volatile compounds estimated to be in green coffee transform into more than one thousand volatile compounds after roasting.65
While trigonelline and caffeine, for example, reach the other side of the roaster virtually unscathed, sugars, amino acids, polysaccharides, and chlorogenic acids decrease significantly and lipids and organic acids slightly increase.66 Many compounds are changed through thermal reactions, including Maillard reactions, the same reactions that lead to delightful sears on vegetables and meats during cooking. The molecular products of Maillard reactions (called "melanoidins") are largely, to quote one scientific article, "ill-known structures."67 What we do know is that these reactions produce lots of carbon dioxide and the array of volatile compounds that contribute to coffee's characteristic aroma (and thus flavor) and brown color.68
The time and temperature of a roasting profile affects the coffee's flavor in the cup. But keep this in mind: roasting can't magically impart qualities that weren't in the bean to begin with. The most skilled roaster cannot take low-quality coffee and turn it into high-quality coffee with roasting alone. However, a roaster can obliterate flavor potential.
Generally speaking, coffees roasted to lower temperatures for shorter amounts of time (often called "light" and "medium" roasted coffee) emphasize the natural characteristics of the bean. They have complex aromas and flavor (meaning you can smell and taste many notes at the same time). They can range in flavor from fruity and floral to nutty and chocolatey. Coffees roasted to higher temperatures for a longer period of time (often called "dark" roasted coffee) tend to emphasize the flavors produced by the extremes of the roasting process itself, or "burnt/ acrid, ashy/sooty, sour, pungent, coffee, and roasted characteristics."69 These roasted characteristics tend to mask the flavors associated with the bean itself.
If you want to develop your palate and explore the wide range of available coffee flavor notes, you won't really be able to do that by drinking only dark roasted coffee. Companies that roast "traditionally" tend to roast darkly. That really popular coffee company? Its "blonde" roast is brunette at best when compared to coffee roasted by companies that use modern roasting techniques that preserve the characteristics of the bean. The type of coffee you like is, of course, personal preference. But if you want to taste all that coffee has to offer, you'll need to explore coffee across the spectrum of roasting profiles.
Different countries have different coffee preferences. In general, France and Italy tend to produce traditionally roasted coffee. Countries that have been developing a coffee culture around modern roasting techniques include the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and many Scandinavian countries—but this is just the tip of the iceberg.


BREWING AND CONSUMPTION
How roasted beans are ground, extracted, and consumed has a huge effect on the end flavor we perceive in a cup of coffee, even though the whole process takes only a few minutes. We have touched on this a little bit throughout the book, but I'll summarize a few high-level points here.
First, let's take a step back and talk about what we are actually doing when we brew coffee: we are combining water and roasted coffee grounds together in order to transfer flavor compounds from the coffee (a solid) into the water (a liquid). This is what we call extraction. Extraction happens in three stages. First, the coffee ground absorbs the water; this is important, as evenly wetted coffee grounds extract more evenly. Often, coffee brewers wet the bed first to allow this absorption to take place. Gases are displaced, which makes the brew bed bubble during certain brew methods, like pour over. This is called the bloom. Some espresso machines have pre-infusion capabilities, which is the equivalent of the bloom. Second, soluble flavor compounds are transferred from the beans to the water. (Water acts as a solvent, so soluble compounds are transferred into the water,70 whereas insoluble compounds become suspended in the water.) Last, the water and coffee grounds are separated from each other. In the end, you are left with a beverage that contains water infused with soluble compounds, oil (insoluble compounds), and fine coffee matter (also insoluble). All three contribute to the flavor profile of coffee.
Recall from the first chapter that different volatile aroma compounds—which play an outsized role when it comes to flavor—are released at different stages of the coffee experience. Similarly, compounds in coffee beans are extracted and subjected to chemical reactions caused by water and heat in different ways and at different rates. Some compounds are more soluble, and they extract first. Other compounds are less soluble, and they extract at a slower rate. A cup's sensory attributes are ultimately influenced by (1) the type of compounds that are extracted, (2) the chemical reactions that transform compounds into different compounds, and (3) the amount of each compound present in the cup.
Keep in mind that science has not definitively explained how all of this works, and many generally accepted observations have not necessarily been substantiated by science. That being said, percent extraction seems to correlate with broad sensory attributes.
Percent extraction, or PE (also called extraction yield, or EY), is the way extraction is scientifically measured. It is the ratio between the amount (mass) of the coffee you started with (your dose) and the amount (mass) of the coffee material that makes it into the brew. Research has suggested that, in general, an extraction between 18 and 22 percent will result in a pleasant-tasting cup. From a sensory standpoint, coffee with less than an 18 percent extraction ("low extraction" or "underextraction") can taste sour and sweet, and coffee with more than a 22 percent extraction ("high extraction" or "overextraction") can taste bitter and astringent.71
However, these objective numbers do not always correlate with or predict the multitude of sensory attributes that characterize a cup, many of which we will explore in chapter 4. And two coffees with the same percent extraction can taste wildly different. Sensory attributes, as you'll recall, can be measured only through sensory evaluation, which uses us humans as instruments. But the goal, of course, is to find a pleasing balance of sensory qualities—and that is usually described by coffee professionals as "well extracted" or "evenly extracted" coffee.
If you've read my first book, you know that there are things you can do to manipulate extraction and find your perfect balance. There are six main factors that affect how and when compounds extract, and the first three in the following list are interrelated. The upshot: a change in any of these factors will affect the final chemical composition of the brew and thus its sensory qualities.72

•Temperature. Hot water impacts extraction in two ways: it speeds up chemical reactions and it increases the solubility of certain compounds. The ideal temperature for hot brewing is generally agreed to be between 195 and 205°F. But cold brewing is also growing in popularity. It takes much longer to complete the extraction process (hours compared to minutes) when cold brewing, and the compounds extract differently. The same coffee that is hot brewed and cold brewed will have a different chemical composition, and thus a different sensory profile. It's also generally accepted that too-hot water extracts overly bitter and astringent compounds, reducing quality.73 Too low a temperature can result in underextraction (if coffee is not in contact with water long enough).
•Particle size. It is easier for water to extract solubles when the surface area of the coffee beans is increased. You can't really extract coffee from whole beans; you must grind it and increase the surface area. That means that the smaller the grind size (particle size), the easier it is for extraction to take place. In general, brew methods that use very fine grind sizes require less time to brew, and vice versa. Coffee professionals emphasize how important it is to have the most even grind size possible. Even the best burr grinders still result in a range of particle sizes. And each size has its own brew time. It is generally accepted that limiting this range results in a higher-quality cup. A too-coarse particle size can be a cause of underextraction and a too-fine particle size can be a cause of overextraction.
•Contact time. This is how long coffee is in contact with water. As we just learned, contact time is inextricably linked with temperature and particle size. In my experience, it is generally accepted that, in practice, certain compounds are extracted at the beginning of the process and other compounds are extracted later. I included an exercise in my first book that demonstrated this. The idea is that compounds that are acidic and sweet extract first and compounds that are overly bitter and astringent extract later. With certain methods, quick brew times result in low percent extraction, which we know tends to be acidic and sweet, and long brew times result in high percent extraction, which we know tends to be bitter and astringent. Both outcomes suggest an imbalance of specific compounds associated with those basic tastes. But according to the SCA, research shows that "there is only very basic evidence of specific types of compounds in the coffee extract being reliably dependent on time."74 In other words, what's actually happening on a chemical level is probably more complex than a simple factor of time.
•Water quality. It's long been known that off-flavored water will result in off-flavored coffee. But the chemistry of water also plays a role. The compounds in water—particularly calcium, magnesium, and potassium—affect extraction and must be present to get good results. You may already know that water that has no minerals (distilled water) does not extract well and results in poor-tasting coffee. Likewise, very hard water, with lots of minerals, may also result in less-than-ideal brews. Christopher Hendon is one of the leading researchers looking at how water chemistry affects coffee. Water for Coffee, the book he cowrote with barista Maxwell Colonna-Dashwood, explores the role of water chemistry on coffee flavor.
•Coffee-to-water ratio. This is the measure of dry coffee mass to water volume used. We know that the ratio greatly impacts the strength—or concentration—of the final cup. Strong coffee has a high concentration of coffee material in the brew, and weak coffee has a low concentration. Strength, as we mentioned in chapter 3, is correlated with body. Strong coffee tends to have a thicker body, and weak coffee tends to have a thinner body.
•Extraction pressure. In this context, pressure is the driving force that pushes water through a bed of coffee. The more pressure you use to force water through coffee, the more extraction happens, often in a short period of time. Pressure can also change the physical properties of the beverage. With espresso, for example, the pressure emulsifies coffee oils into the liquid, creating the distinctive crema on top of a shot.

As we touched on earlier, the type of brewing method you use also has a huge impact on flavor as it relates to mouthfeel. Most brewing methods can be grouped into one of three categories: decoction, infusion, and pressure.

•Decoction methods. These methods require the coffee and water to be in continuous contact for a certain length of time, often at high temperatures. They tend to extract more quickly than other methods, but the methods that require the use of boiling water with the coffee in direct contact with high heat—or those with extended brew times—can result in the extraction of undesirable flavors and the loss of aromatics, which equates to flavor loss. At the same time, strength increases the longer you brew.75 Examples of decoction methods include boiled coffee, coffee made with an ibrik/cezve, percolator coffee, and vacuum coffee.
•Infusion methods. These methods involve hot or cold water flowing through a loose bed of coffee grounds, which results in a shorter contact time and the introduction of fresh water at intervals, before being filtered. Fun fact: the term infusion comes from the Latin verb infundo, which means "to pour over." So, there you go : the more common term for these methods is pour over. In general, these methods are milder in comparison to decoction methods, with increased acidity and flavor.76 Examples include drip/ filter coffee (manual methods, such as pour over, and automatic drip machines).
•Pressure methods: These methods require water to flow through a compacted bed of coffee grounds (often called a coffee cake), with the help of pressure and heat. The most familiar pressure method is espresso, but plunger methods (such as the French press and AeroPress) and moka pots are also considered pressure methods. Pressure methods tend to have heavier bodies than other methods. And as we've discussed, the very high pressure of the espresso method gives the resulting shot a very distinctive thick, syrupy body and the crema on top. It also produces a strong (concentrated) beverage with intense aromas and flavors. In fact, because the pressure amplifies sensory qualities, there is nowhere for off-flavors inherent in the bean to hide. They are put on full display in espresso, which is one reason the perfect espresso shot is hard to achieve. The pressure component of espresso also seems to extract compounds differently, as the sensory qualities of the same coffee brewed with an espresso machine and via a drip method will be quite different. Additionally, espresso is meant to be enjoyed right away, as its name suggests (in Italian, the word espresso implies that it is made "on the instant, on an explicit order," or "extemporaneously"). And for good reason: when espresso sits out or is not enjoyed right away, compounds quickly start to change, which most notably results in the degradation of the crema and increased acidity.77

Within these categories, the methods themselves can result in distinct sensory qualities—and the same coffee brewed on different devices will have different sensory qualities.78 It is logical to conclude that this is because each method results in a different combination of the six factors listed on page 88. But there are other factors at play as well. As mentioned earlier, the type of filter used (if any) has a big influence on the final cup, as paper filters remove most insoluble compounds, such as fines and oils, from the brew, and metal filters (or no filters) let them pass through to the final cup. This has a great impact on body, but those insolubles also bring other sensory compounds to the party. For a detailed explanation of different brewing methods, see the chapter called "Technology IV: Beverage Preparation: Brewing Trends for the New Millennium," in Coffee: Recent Developments.


HOW WE EXPERIENCE COFFEE
As we've learned, sipping a cup of coffee is a multisensory experience, and there are a couple of things I want to emphasize at this point. First, there is no single flavor that is "coffee." True, it's unlikely that if you sipped a cup of coffee while blindfolded, you'd mistake it for anything else, but it contains hundreds of taste and aroma molecules—many of which science hasn't even identified yet—that result in a complex, layered experience. Especially with modern processing and roasting techniques that are geared toward preserving the characteristics of the bean, there are myriad flavor notes just waiting to be identified in your cup.
That being said—and here comes the second thing—when you begin tasting coffee thoughtfully, it may be difficult for you to describe your brew as anything other than "pleasant coffee" or "unpleasant coffee." You may not actually taste individual flavor notes. That's okay. The thing I call your palate—your sensory receptor to brain connection—is something that needs to be trained and practiced, just like any other skill.
And finally, you may not experience coffee exactly the same way someone else does. You and a friend may try the same coffee, and one of you may enjoy it while the other does not. That's okay, too. Part of what's fascinating about coffee flavor is just how many factors can influence our perception of how coffee tastes. Let's take a step back and look at all the factors that contribute to a person's coffee sensory experience.

•The coffee's chemical and physical properties (product). These are the compounds in coffee that can be measured and analyzed, such as the taste and aroma molecules present in the bean, as well as the compounds that cause chemesthesis, temperature, texture, and color. These properties are rooted in the genetics of the bean variety, which predisposes it to certain sensory characteristics. These characteristics can be shaped by how the coffee is grown, processed, roasted, and brewed.
•Your consumption of the coffee (behavior). People drink coffee differently, and this affects how a person perceives the sensory properties just outlined. This includes how much you sip, how you breathe, how you move the coffee in your mouth, how you swallow, and more.
•Your neurological and physiological makeup (brain/body). Our genetics to some degree determine the physical characteristics of our sensory receptors, how they communicate information to the brain, and how the brain perceives the information. For example, some of us experience bitter and sweet with greater intensity than others. Some people may not sense certain aromas (this is called anosmia). This complex system of sensory communication and perception boils down to two things: how our neurological system is wired and how our body parts function (also called physiology).
•Your psychology and sociology (life experience). Your past experiences, culture, mood, and more can all affect the way you experience coffee. Certain aromas may trigger memories that influence your perception of flavor. Your level of exposure to a certain flavor can affect your ability to taste it. It's been shown that we can grow accustomed to tastes, like bitter, and that we can develop our ability to detect and identify tastes and aromas with practice.79

At the end of the day, what this means is that two people can experience the same cup of coffee in different ways. Given this, how on earth can we ever know what each person is experiencing—let alone how to communicate it? Well, you'll find out in the next chapter.




*Petrichor is the name of the characteristic earthy smell that happens before it rains. It's a mix of volatile compounds—from plant oils, microorganisms, and more—that gets released into the air when soil dampens. A compound called geosmin, which is a byproduct of bacterial activities in soil, plays a big role, and humans are extremely sensitive to it. Geosmin can be found in coffee, contributing an earthy or beet-like odor. This earthiness is often considered a defect in the industry, but according to Le Nez du Café (described in the next section), it is characteristic of certain coffees that are dry processed on soil.
*This view is starting to change. A pro-robusta movement within specialty coffee argues that robusta has the capacity to be as high-quality as arabica when it is grown and processed with the same level of care (which it often isn't).













CHAPTER 4Developing a Coffee Tongue Language and Palate Development


AT THIS POINT YOU HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING of how your brain creates flavor, the current state of science as it applies to coffee flavor, and where, to the degree that it can be known, coffee flavor comes from. Now for the fun part: palate development! As I've mentioned throughout this book, anyone can develop their palate—that is, increase their ability to discern and identify the sensory attributes of their food and drink. The first step is simply to be more mindful when you consume: slow down and pay attention to the eating and drinking experience. What does the coffee smell like? Can you identify any basic tastes? What does the flavor remind you of? How does the coffee feel in your mouth? How does its flavor and aroma change as you drink it?
Now that's all well and good, but if you can't accurately describe what you're experiencing, you won't be able to effectively articulate what it is you've identified. And this is key. You need two things to develop your palate: sensory experiences and the vocabulary to describe them.
In this chapter, we explore language's role in palate development—and why I think language is the biggest hurdle we consumers face when it comes to identifying the coffee we like to drink. We'll look at the tools the specialty coffee industry has developed to help solve the problem of language in the professional and scientific communities, and then we'll use those same tools to help ourselves gain the experiences and vocabulary needed to identify sensory attributes in the coffee we consume at home and at coffee shops.
Rather than explore all sensory attributes that have been identified in coffee, I present you with six broad categories, which will give you a good understanding of the basic flavor attributes coffee offers. Each attribute has an exercise—something to taste and/or smell—to help you lock in the sensory memory so you can draw upon it when you are sipping brews in the real world. Together with the basic tastes (bitter, sour, sweet, salty, umami) and other attributes (astringency, oily body) you've already explored, you will have dozens of sensory experiences locked into your brain by the end of this book.

Language: An Imperfect Medium
I am a writer and a book editor, so my entire professional life is organized around the principle that language is an imperfect medium. I am reminded every day that we humans are not mind readers. Whatever is going on in our heads cannot be directly beamed into someone else's head. We must represent it with language—symbols, signs, and/ or sounds—and our representation must then be interpreted by another party. In other words, a pure idea must be translated, in a sense, twice by imperfect means. There is plenty of room for error. First, language offers a finite set of symbols, signs, and sounds to represent infinite feelings and ideas—I'm sure you've experienced a time when you simply couldn't find a single word or set of words to describe something the way you wanted to. Second, language has all manner of gray area, connotations, shades of meaning that can be interpreted different ways by different people, depending on context and life experience.
In the writing side of my life, this is exciting. Language is like clay that we can shape for desired effect. Language can be magical—sometimes the shape can be interpreted not only the way you intend but in unique ways that somehow simultaneously ring true. A reader can find something in your language that you didn't consciously put there, yet it can resonate with you deeply, feel even more truthful than the thing you intended. The imperfection provides the opportunity for magic.
On the editing side of things, I can see how language can be easily misinterpreted—especially when all you have to go on are the written symbols, without the benefit of tone, facial expressions, body language, and touch. A single word or punctuation mark on the page transforms the meaning of a sentence or increases the likelihood of reader confusion. My job is often to "optimize" language, but there is no one right way to do that, as it is so dependent upon the author and their target audience. And then there is that pesky fact that you will eventually hit a wall: language is simply imperfect.
None of this is more fully realized than in the language we use to describe our sensory perceptions, an idea I have touched on a few times already in this book. Describing a complex feeling or sensation is difficult under any circumstances. It's made more difficult when people can physiologically experience something in fundamentally different ways, as is very much the case with our sense of taste. It is made even more difficult when we don't share a common vocabulary or a common experience to attach to that vocabulary.
This, I believe, is one of the main roadblocks when we coffee lovers enter a coffee shop and attempt to interact with the language of flavor we find there. The language is all over the place. How should we interpret a "toasted marshmallow" flavor note? What, exactly, should we expect to find in our cup of coffee? There is no dictionary of sorts to help us—or the coffee professionals—understand it.
Or, is there? (There is.)
The World Coffee Research Sensory Lexicon is a product of a collaboration between sensory scientists and the SCA to produce a standardized language and reference list of the common sensory qualities present in coffee. From what I can tell, scientists researching coffee have largely adopted this lexicon, and the SCA promotes its use as its "trade language" in the training and research of producers, graders, sellers, roasters, and other coffee professionals. The SCA's comprehensive Sensory Cupping Handbook, which I have used as an authoritative touchstone throughout this book, emphasizes the importance of the lexicon's use in the industry—and promotes communication with this language between scientists and those in the coffee industry; indeed, it is the main purpose of the handbook.
A standardized language (vocabulary) that is directly tied to shared experience is crucial when it comes to scientific research and unbiased evaluation—but also, I'd argue, any kind of effective discourse between consumers and the industry. However, as of this writing, the lexicon is not always used by consumer-facing coffee professionals (baristas) or in the consumer-facing language we encounter every day in coffee shops and other coffee retailers. This is precisely why everything in this section is seeded in the lexicon itself and uses its language.1 Let's adopt it as our language, too. I want us to meet the coffee industry in the middle, so we are more successful in our communication with each other.


Tools of the Trade: World Coffee Research Sensory Lexicon and the Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel
World Coffee Research first released its Sensory Lexicon in 2016, after more than one hundred hours spent evaluating 105 coffees from thirteen different countries. As of this writing, the lexicon includes 110 sensory attributes that have been identified by scientists to exist in coffee.2 The term attribute is used to refer to a sensory quality—basic taste, aroma, flavor, or mouthfeel—found in coffee. These attributes are descriptive, quantifiable, and replicable. They are descriptive because the lexicon provides a neutral description that does not indicate whether an attribute is "good" or "bad"; it just is. The attributes are quantifiable because each one also has an intensity score on a 15-point scale—does it taste a lot like the attribute or a little? The intensity score means that if you are trained to know what "4" means, you can compare attributes in coffee with a certain level of precision (for instance, "This coffee has a more intense raspberry note than that one"). Finally, each attribute is tied to what is called a sensory reference, something specific you can smell or taste that represents the attribute. The reference is what allows people across the world to not only share the same sensory experience but name it in the same way—which makes the attribute replicable. The sensory reference is very important because, as I've mentioned, words alone have their limits. As the SCA says, "The only way to truly communicate [a flavor] experience is through a shared sensory experience."3
Let's take a look at what an attribute entry looks like in the lexicon, as I will be referring to these attributes throughout this chapter. The following is the entry for the blueberry attribute.
Blueberry

As you can see, the attribute is named (blueberry) and described ("the slightly dark, fruity, sweet, slightly sour, musty, dusty, floral aromatic associated with blueberry"). The sensory reference (Oregon Fruit Products blueberries in light syrup) and its preparation are clearly stated. There are also intensity scores (6.5 for aroma and 6.0 for flavor), which we're not going to worry about for the purposes of this book. To use the lexicon, you prepare the reference as indicated and then taste it (in the case of a flavor attribute) or smell it (in the case of an aroma attribute). Because the lexicon is designed to eliminate bias and ensure that everyone who uses it has as close to identical an experience as possible, even the size and type of serving vessel is indicated. Generally, you cover the prepared reference with a lid until you are ready to taste or smell, so as not to let the aromatics dissipate, which could affect your experience with the attribute.
The attributes from the lexicon have also been organized into the Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel (see page 170), which is a tool intended to make the lexicon "meaningful and accessible to the coffee community."4 Many food and beverage industries use flavor wheels, as they are highly effective at organizing and displaying information in an accessible way.
The coffee industry has had other versions of the flavor wheel, but the current one—published by the SCA in 2016—was revised with the lexicon as its basis. Additional research was done to help scientists categorize attributes by their relationship, which makes the wheel easier to use. Broad categories (roasted, spices, nutty/cocoa, sweet, floral, fruity, sour/fermented, green/vegetative, and other) are found at the center of the circle. Under those umbrellas, attributes get more specific as they reach the outer edges of the circle—fruity to berry to blueberry, for example. Additionally, the wheel visually displays these relationships with meaningful colors. For example, research has found that we associate red hues with certain types of fruit. The basic fruity category is red, and the more specific attributes transition to shades of pink and other colors (such as blue in the case of blueberry), depending on our associations with that fruit—remember this, as it will come in handy later.
Now, 110 attributes are way too many to cover in this book—and too overwhelming for those of us who are just starting our tasting journeys. Instead, we are going to focus on exploring the basics, the inner circle of the wheel, which will provide a solid foundation for those of you who want to continue to develop your palate on your own. In the following section, I have selected those attributes that, in my experience, are the most common and represent either one of the major flavor profiles that coffee offers or some other attribute I want you to be aware of. Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to collect the sensory references, prepare them, taste them, and create a sensory memory to carry off into the coffee world. You will provide yourself with the experience, pair it with the vocabulary, and then seek out the attribute in the coffee you drink.
In addition to the major coffee attributes, I throw in a few challenges and recommendations for additional exploring. For example, I may suggest you compare certain attributes or include more attributes in your tasting. Lastly, I provide some context to carry with you as you start to consciously taste coffees in the real world. Remember, the lexicon itself is value neutral. It is a tool that simply says "these attributes exist in coffee," not "this attribute is associated with defect" or "this attribute is highly prized." Where it is possible, I offer some guidance for the types of coffees you might wish to seek out to find each attribute, including the flavor notes that might point toward such an attribute. But remember: in coffee, there are no flavor guarantees. The best way to discover attributes is to taste widely and taste often. Give yourself the opportunity to come across them, and you will!
If you'd like to drill deeper than this introduction to flavor attributes, please refer to the Sensory Lexicon itself, which is available online free to everyone.5 Without further ado, let's get started!


THE BEST WAY TO DEVELOP YOUR PALATE

This book focuses on attributes that have been codified by science, but the best way to develop your palate is to eat and drink consciously and widely. This chapter gives you a good idea of the basic flavor profiles in coffee, but there is nothing stopping you from tasting the source: all kinds of fruit, all types of chocolate, all sorts of nuts, and so on. Compare and contrast foods in the same category together. This will help build your tasting muscle, so to speak, and cement sensory memories in your brain. This chapter is just a starting point!




The Broad Aroma and Flavor Attributes of Coffee
Before you begin tasting sensory references and locking attributes into your mind, remember this: the vast majority of the time, attributes in coffee are subtle. Tasting isolated references in this way is much more intense than you will find in coffee, where the attribute is found not only in lower concentration but also among a mix of many other aromas, tastes, and mouthfeel attributes. The lexicon also distinguishes between "aroma" and "flavor" attributes. Aroma attributes are those that you sniff orthonasally. Flavor attributes are those that you put in your mouth. Sometimes, the same sensory reference is used for both actions, and sometimes it's one or the other. In the following exercises, I follow the lexicon's lead.
Although World Coffee Research attempted to identify accessible ingredients for the attributes' references—and you may have some in your pantry already—gathering all the references for these exercises can be a bit daunting, so I recommend doing these exercises with friends so you can share. Most of the time, you will have some leftovers. I have tried to include recommendations for what to do with less familiar ingredients.
In terms of preparation, I have also followed the lexicon's lead, though in many cases I offer more detailed instructions than the lexicon provides (I am a recipe editor by trade, after all!). In some cases, I have adapted the lexicon's instructions or made them more precise so that the instructions are easier to follow at home. The whole point of the lexicon is to provide uniform instructions to ensure we are all having identical sensory experiences, but sometimes the lexicon's instructions are vague, incomplete, or challenging to accomplish in the kitchen. In these cases, I have used my best judgment for clarifying things, and I have noted when my directions substantially diverge from the lexicon's original.
You'll notice that the lexicon recommends snifters for smelling and 1-ounce cups for tasting. If you do not have a snifter, a small wine glass will do. If you don't have a 1-ounce cup, use one of similar size, such as a shot glass (which tends to hold between 1 and 1.5 ounces). If you are comparing references, make sure you use equal-size cups for serving. The lexicon also recommends you cover the references with lids until you are ready to smell or taste them. This keeps aromatics in the cup. I find that coasters, mason jar lids, and lids from round food containers (yogurt, cottage cheese, and so on) work well for this.
We have already explored some of the attributes from the lexicon via exercises: bitter (see page 29), sour (see page 33), sweet (see page 37), salty (see page 39), mouth drying (see page 66), and oily (see page 69). The first four are listed under "Taste Basics" in the lexicon and the last two are mouthfeel attributes, but some show up in other places as well, as you'll see.

FRUITY


Fruity
Description: A sweet, floral, aromatic blend of a variety of ripe fruits.
Reference: Juicy Juice 100% Juice, kiwi-strawberry flavor


Fruity is often the first attribute coffee drinkers recognize when their brew tastes like "more than just coffee." A general fresh fruity character, while delicate, can be distinctively present in coffee, especially those that are roasted to emphasize the character of the bean (as opposed to roast character). This makes sense: coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit, the coffee cherry.
Indeed, one of the most likely candidates in which to find that fruity attribute is naturally processed coffee or semiwashed (honey) processed coffee, in which coffee is dried with all or part of the fruit, respectively, after harvesting. Research has shown that natural processing of arabica coffee results in a greater concentration of known fruity odorants compared to coffees without the fruit attribute.6 That isn't to say washed coffee can't be fruity; it can. But if you are seeking out this flavor attribute to experience and lock into memory, you might want to try a natural coffee first.
Fruity is the umbrella attribute for all fruity attributes. The lexicon breaks the general fruity category into four subcategories: berry, dried fruit (see page 108), other fruit, and citrus fruit. Each of these are broken down further for a total of eighteen specific fruit attributes. Parsing between some of them—such as raspberry and strawberry—as they appear in coffee can be difficult without practice, but detecting a general fruity quality is well within reach. In some instances, I find certain specific attributes, such as apple and the citrus fruits, to be linked with distinct qualities of acidity, which we explore on page 110.



PALATE EXERCISE

Fruity
Use this exercise to familiarize yourself with the fruity attribute, as both an aroma and a flavor.
What you'll need

■1 box/bottle kiwi-strawberry Juicy Juice
■fresh water
■medium snifter or wine glass
■1-ounce cup or shot glass
■lids

Aroma: Mix ¼ cup of kiwi-strawberry juice and ¼ cup of water in the snifter, then cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid to smell. What does the aroma remind you of? Describe it as best you can and/or connect it to a memory.
Flavor: Pour full-strength kiwi-strawberry juice into the cup and cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid and taste. What does the flavor remind you of? Describe it as best you can and/or connect it to a memory.



One interesting phenomenon is that fruit flavors and aromas often taste or smell artificial in coffee, closer to candy than the actual fruit. Some naturally occurring compounds in roasted coffee are not found in the real fruit they are associated with, but they are the compounds the food industry uses to artificially flavor candy. For example, furfuryl acetate is not found in real bananas, but it is used to create banana-like artificial flavor—and it is naturally occurring in coffee. A similar artificial aroma or flavor can occur when naturally occurring fruit compounds show up in coffee—because they show up in relative isolation. For example, isoamyl acetate is part of a real banana's characteristic flavor, and it's also found in roasted coffee. But in a banana, it shows up alongside many other compounds, creating the complex flavor we know as banana. Coffee does not have all those compounds, so the resulting aroma or flavor may suggest a banana but it doesn't replicate all the complexity of the real thing.7

ETHIOPIAN NATURALS: YOUR TICKET TO FLAVOR TOWN

One exception to my "difficult to parse" qualification might be the blueberry note that is characteristic of Ethiopian naturals. Sometimes, this flavor presents so spectacularly that coffee folks refer to them as "flavor bombs." Multiple times in this book I have tempered your expectations, emphasizing that flavor attributes are often subtle in coffee. In this case, the blueberry flavor can be so present, you might think it has been artificially flavored. Ethiopian naturals are often spark coffees—they show us how exciting coffee can be!
If you'd like to prime your palate for the blueberry attribute—"the slightly dark, fruity, sweet, lightly sour, musty, dusty, floral aromatic associated with blueberry"—the lexicon reference is Oregon Fruit Products brand canned blueberries in light syrup. Put 1 teaspoon in a medium snifter or wine glass for smelling, and put some in a 1-ounce cup for tasting.


When trying to seek out this note, look for light to medium roasted coffees—particularly those with natural or semiwashed (honey) process—with flavor notes that correspond to the lexicon attributes, fresh fruit, fruit jams, berries, or food products made with fruit, such as fruit candies, beverages, desserts, and more.


Dried Fruit
Description: An aromatic impression of dark fruit that is sweet and slightly brown and is associated with dried plum.
Reference: Sunsweet Amaz!n prune juice


Although I am recommending that you need not worry about distinguishing between all eighteen specific fruit attributes on the flavor wheel, I do think it's worth learning to recognize a dried fruit attribute and to distinguish between fresh and dried fruit characteristics.
When trying to find this attribute in coffee, find a naturally processed coffee. Remember, naturally processed coffee is dried after harvest with the coffee cherry on, so it makes sense that a dried fruit quality might infuse into the bean. If you have a chance to try cascara—dried coffee cherries you can brew like tea—you'll be able to get a good idea of what dried fruit tastes like, too. Drinking cascara helped me identify dried fruit attributes in coffee even though the attribute may express a bit differently. For example, the lexicon includes prune and raisin attributes under the general dried fruit category. Distinguishing between prune and raisin attributes in coffee is difficult, but being able to identify a general dried fruit characteristic is within reach.
When trying to seek out this note, look for light to medium roasted coffees with flavor notes that correspond to the lexicon attributes (dried fruit, raisin, prune), any other dried fruit, or food products made with dried fruit, such as fig cookies and trail mix.



PALATE EXERCISE

Dried Fruit (general)
Use this exercise to familiarize yourself with the dried fruit attribute, as both an aroma and a flavor.
What you'll need

■Sunsweet Amaz!n prune juice
■fresh water
■medium snifter or wine glass
■lid

Aroma + Flavor: Mix ¼ cup of prune juice with ¼ cup of water in the snifter, then cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid to smell and taste. What does the aroma remind you of? The flavor? How are they similar? Different? Describe them as best you can and/or connect them to a memory.



Tips

■If you don't want to purchase a whole bottle of prune juice but have raisins or prunes (dried plums) on hand, either or both will give you a general idea of the dried fruit attribute. Chop ½ cup of raisins or prunes and combine them with ¾ cup of water in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 2 minutes, then strain the liquid. Transfer 1 tablespoon of the liquid to a snifter or wine glass to sniff, and pour the rest into a 1-ounce cup to taste.
■If you really want some practice with this attribute, it's relatively easy to set up a blinded test for yourself (see page 148) with the prune juice, homemade raisin liquid, and homemade prune liquid. Let all liquids come to room temperature before tasting. Can you distinguish between these three aromas and flavors?






SOUR/ACID


Citric Acid
Description: A mild, clean, sour aromatic with slight citrus notes accompanied by astringency.
Reference: Citric acid




Malic Acid
Description: A sour, sharp, somewhat fruity aromatic accompanied by astringency.
Reference: Malic acid




Acetic Acid
Description: A sour, astringent, slightly pungent aromatic associated with vinegar.
Reference: Acetic acid


As we've learned, acidity is an important characteristic in specialty/ craft coffee. The term acidity is associated with the sour basic taste, and if you've been following the exercises, you know that we made a 0.05% citric acid solution, which is the reference for the sour attribute, earlier in the book. It's also the reference for citric acid, and I recommend that you compare the citric acid attribute to two other acid attributes in the lexicon: malic and acetic.
Recall that there are lots of different acids. Many of them possess a sour quality, but they have additional qualities that give them a unique character. The three in this section—citric, malic, and acetic—are common in our everyday lives and associated with familiar items: lemons, apples, and white vinegar, respectively. Comparing and contrasting them will give you not only an appreciation for the subtle differences between acids (the recommended solutions are about the same in intensity of flavor) but also a head start in identifying these references in your coffee.

Citric acid is present in green coffee beans, and the roasting process does not amplify it; it slowly degrades it.

In my experience, these different acids play a key role in identifying the various fruit attributes in coffee. Citric acid plays a critical role in the citrus fruit attributes; indeed, the lemon attribute's reference is diluted lemon juice, which will give you an idea of citric acid if you don't have access to food-grade citric acid itself. But the term citric also shows up in the descriptions for the citrus fruit, grapefruit, orange, and lime attributes. These attributes can be thought of as a combination of a citric acid quality and additional qualities. Furthermore, citric acid is often responsible for what coffee people call "brightness," "zest," or "zing" in both washed and natural coffees. Citric acid is present in green coffee beans, and the roasting process does not amplify it; it slowly degrades it. For example, a medium roasted coffee may have about half as much citric acid as its green counterpart.8 This explains why citric acid can contribute to a pleasant acidity but be overpowering and unpleasant at high concentrations, such as in underdeveloped coffee beans.
Likewise, malic acid is often associated with apples, but it's also the main acid in many other fruits that appear as attributes in the lexicon, including blackberry and blueberry (under the "berry" attribute) and cherry, grape, peach, and pear (under the "other fruit" attribute). Malic acid is a component of these notes in coffee, and research has shown that coffees that seem "fruitier" tend to have higher concentrations of malic acid.9 Malic acid is somewhat similar to citric acid, so learning how they differ through comparison is an informative (and fun!) exercise.
Most of us have acetic acid (white vinegar) in our homes, but you may not have realized that it plays a key role in coffee quality. Some acetic acid develops during fermentation stages when coffee is processed, but most acetic acid develops during roasting as carbohydrates break down, which can lead to an increase of twenty-five times acetic acid's original levels. Because acetic acid is formed from carbohydrates, green coffee beans with more sugar tend to have higher levels of acetic acid after roasting. Acetic acid is most present in light to medium coffees, as it starts to break down again if roasting continues beyond that point. Acetic acid is not as strong of an acid as citric and malic acids, but acetic acid is key to overall perceived acidity in coffee, as well as to aroma—human noses are very sensitive to it. In low concentrations, acetic acid "imparts a pleasant clean, sweet-like characteristic," but in high concentrations, it gives off a fermented quality that is generally considered an off-flavor.10
Most light and medium roasted coffees have an element of acidity, as it is considered part of a balanced cup in many coffee cultures. If you are seeking an acidity-forward coffee, look for flavor notes such as "bright," "sparkling," and similar euphemisms, as well as those associated with food and beverages with known sour/acidic qualities, such as lemonade, candies, and fruit.


DEFECT FLAVOR: FERMENTED (OR IS IT?)

The lexicon also includes the references butyric acid (associated with fermented dairy products, like Parmigiano-Reggiano) and isovaleric acid (associated with foot sweat and aged cheeses like Romano). These acids are associated with a cheesy, fermented quality that is generally considered a defect by professional cuppers. These attributes are also rare, even at a professional cupping table, so it's highly unlikely that you'd come across them as a consumer. The acid references aren't as easy to come by either, but if you really want to level up, get some Parmesan and Romano and compare their scents and tastes.
It's more likely that you'd come across the fermented attribute ("the pungent, sweet, slightly sour, sometimes yeasty, alcohol-like aromatic characteristic of fermented fruits or sugar or over-proofed dough"). As mentioned, fermented qualities are frequently considered defects, but some cuppers like them and they are expected from certain coffees, so it's possible that a roaster likes them, too. The lexicon reference for the fermented attribute (aroma) is Guinness Extra Stout beer, and it instructs to fill a 2-ounce jar one-third full of the beer for every three participants, lidding it to keep the aromatics in. It can be served at room temperature.



Most light and medium roasted coffees have an element of acidity, as it is considered part of a balanced cup in many coffee cultures.




PALATE EXERCISE

Citric, Malic, and Acetic Acids
Use this exercise to familiarize yourself with three acid attributes—citric, malic, and acetic—by comparing them. Note that malic acid does not have an aroma component, while the other two do.
What you'll need

■0.05% citric acid solution (page 33)
■food-grade malic acid
■5% acidity distilled white vinegar
■fresh water
■three 1-ounce cups or shot glasses
■lids

Citric acid (Aroma + Flavor): Pour the citric acid solution into the first cup, then cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid to smell and taste. What does the aroma remind you of? The flavor? How are they similar? Different? Describe them as best you can and/or connect them to a memory.
Malic acid (Flavor): Create a 0.05% malic acid solution by dissolving 0.5 grams of malic acid in 1 liter of water, stirring or shaking until the malic acid is completely dissolved. Pour into the second cup, then cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid to taste. What does the flavor remind you of? Describe it as best you can and/or connect it to a memory.
Acetic acid (Aroma + Flavor): Create a 1% acetic acid solution by combining 20 grams of white vinegar and 80 grams of water. Pour into the third cup, then cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid to smell and taste. What does the aroma remind you of? The flavor? How are they similar? Different? Describe them as best you can and/or connect them to a memory.
Tips

■I recommend preparing the citric and malic acid solutions in 1-liter water bottles, so you can store them and use over a couple of days. This is a great exercise to do as a blinded tasting (see page 142).
■Malic acid and citric acid can be purchased online or at well-stocked pharmacies or supplement stores (powdered or capsule malic acid) or grocery stores (food-grade citric acid). The leftover citric acid has tons of uses, including in candy making, cooking, cleaning, and bath bomb making.
■If you don't have access to citric and malic acids, use lemon juice (citric) and applesauce (malic) in place of them. If you dilute one part fresh lemon juice in four parts water, you now have the flavor and aroma reference for the lemon attribute (under "citrus fruit" on the flavor wheel). Gerber 2nd Foods apple puree is the flavor reference for the apple attribute (under "other fruit" on the flavor wheel). Although lemon and apple have additional qualities in addition to their acidity, you should still be able to get a sense of how the acidities differ when you compare the two attributes.







FLORAL


Floral
Description: A sweet, light, slightly fragrant aromatic associated with fresh flowers.
Reference: Welch's 100% white grape juice


Distinguishing floral notes is a challenge for beginners and may more rightly be the objective of more experienced tasters, but they play a critical role in contributing to other attributes like specific fruits, spices, and nuts, which is why I want you to give it a shot. The lexicon also lists four specific attributes under the general floral category—rose, jasmine, chamomile, and black tea—but I recommend starting with the basic floral attribute first. If you are interested in sharpening your floral detection skills, it can be expensive to gather the references listed in the lexicon. An alternative is to seek out rose and jasmine at your local nursery and smell and sample some high-quality rose tea, jasmine tea, chamomile tea, and black tea. It may also be informative to compare the floral attribute to the fruity (see page 105) and dried fruit (see page 108) attributes to help you distinguish the difference.
Floral notes are considered delicate, and as mentioned earlier, the easiest place to spot them might be at the fragrance stage, right after you grind whole beans. They are associated with esters, which are volatile, often fragrant, compounds derived from carboxylic acids. Research has shown that floral attributes, along with fruity, sweet, spice, and sour acid, are most prized by cuppers and green coffee buyers—and have the biggest impact on coffees' quality scores.11
Floral notes tend to be overwhelmed by roast characteristics, so light and medium roasted coffees are more likely to express floral notes than darker roasted coffees. The gesha variety of coffee—made famous by the Peterson family at Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama—is said to have a distinct jasmine quality. If you want to seek out a floral quality in coffee, you may want to start there. Just keep in mind that there is no guarantee; floral qualities can be elusive, and you may find it on the nose more easily than in the mouth. Otherwise, seek out coffee with flavor notes associated with the lexicon attributes and other flowers, such as hibiscus, honeysuckle, and coffee blossom (which is very similar to jasmine, by the way).



PALATE EXERCISE

Floral
Use this exercise to familiarize yourself with the floral attribute, as both an aroma and a flavor.
What you'll need

■Welch's 100% white grape juice
■fresh water
■medium snifter or wine glass
■1-ounce cup or shot glass
■lids

Aroma: Mix together ¼ cup of grape juice and ¼ cup of water. Pour half of the mixture into the snifter, then cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid to smell. What does the aroma remind you of? Describe it as best you can and/or connect it to a memory.
Flavor: Pour the remaining mixture into the cup, then cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid to taste. What does the flavor remind you of? How does it compare to the aroma? Describe it as best you can and/or connect it to a memory.





NUTTY/COCOA


Nutty
Description: A slightly sweet, brown, woody, oily, musty, astringent, and bitter aromatic commonly associated with nuts, seeds, beans, and grains.
Reference: Diamond sliced almonds, Diamond shelled walnuts


Research has found that the nutty attribute is associated with light roasted whole coffee beans and light to medium roasted ground and brewed coffee.12 Chemically speaking, the nutty attribute is often associated with pyrazines, which are primarily formed in the early stage of roasting and tend to degrade and become obscured by other compounds as roasting continues.13
In my experience, nutty and cocoa (see page 120) attributes are often found together in coffee (and they are often lumped together when coffee professionals evaluate coffee). If a person is transitioning from drinking coffee that emphasizes roast characteristics to coffee that emphasizes bean characteristics, I often recommend coffee with nutty/ cocoa attributes. These "brown" flavors are often perceived as robust, round, full, and comforting, which are qualities people tend to appreciate about roast characteristics. However, the nutty/cocoa attributes are often accompanied by a sweet attribute in light to medium roasted coffee instead of a roasted/burnt attribute in dark roasted coffees, making the overall profile less robust.



PALATE EXERCISE

Nutty
Use this exercise to familiarize yourself with the nutty attribute as a flavor.
What you'll need

■Diamond sliced almonds
■Diamond shelled walnuts
■blender
■bowl
■1-ounce cup or shot glass
■lid

Flavor: Puree an equal amount of the almonds and the walnuts in a blender on high speed for 45 seconds. Transfer to a bowl. Serve in the cup, then cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid to taste. What does the flavor remind you of? Describe it as best you can and/ or connect it to a memory.



Tip

■If you don't have a blender, try to chop equal amounts of almonds and walnuts together as finely as possible, then mix together thoroughly.




The lexicon breaks the general nutty attribute into three specific attributes: almond, hazelnut, and peanut. The peanut reference doubles as the medium roasted reference (see page 128), but it's easier to pick out a general nutty attribute in coffee than to distinguish between specific nut notes.
When trying to seek out this note, look for light to medium roasted coffees with flavor notes that correspond to the lexicon attributes, any other nut, or food products made with nuts, such as praline.


Cocoa
Description: A brown, sweet, dusty, musty, often bitter aromatic associated with cocoa beans, powdered cocoa, and chocolate bars.
Reference: Hershey's cocoa powder (natural, unsweetened)


Research has found that the cocoa attribute is associated with light roasted whole coffee beans and light to medium roasted ground and brewed coffee—and that the cocoa attribute tends to decrease in intensity as roast level increases. Cocoa can sometimes be easier to perceive when smelling whole beans rather than ground (although research has generally found the opposite, that attributes are easier to perceive when smelling ground coffee).14
There are two other specific chocolate references in the lexicon: chocolate and dark chocolate. These are similar to cocoa, although dark chocolate is characterized by increased bitterness and astringency.
When trying to seek out this note, look for light to medium roasted coffees with flavor notes that correspond to the lexicon attributes (cocoa, chocolate, dark chocolate), cocoa or chocolate products (candy bars, sauces, etc.), and food products made with chocolate, such as ice cream, cakes, cookies, and other desserts.



PALATE EXERCISE

Cocoa
Use this exercise to familiarize yourself with the cocoa attribute, as both an aroma and a flavor.
What you'll need

■Hershey's cocoa powder (natural, unsweetened)
■fresh water
■medium snifter or wine glass
■1-ounce cup or shot glass
■lids

Aroma: Combine ¼ teaspoon of cocoa powder and 100 grams of water. Pour half of the mixture into the snifter, then cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid to smell. What does the aroma remind you of? Describe it as best you can and/or connect it to a memory.
Flavor: Pour the remaining mixture into the cup, then cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid to taste. What does the flavor remind you of? How does it compare to the aroma? Describe it as best you can and/or connect it to a memory.



Tip

■The three cocoa-related attributes (cocoa, chocolate, dark chocolate) are good candidates for exercising your palate through comparison tasting:

-Prepare the cocoa reference as described here.
-Prepare the chocolate reference. For aroma, place 1 teaspoon of chopped Nestlé Toll House semisweet chocolate morsels in a snifter, then cover.15 For flavor, place another 1 teaspoon of the chocolate in a cup, then cover.
-Prepare the dark chocolate reference. For aroma, chop a piece of a Lindt Excellence 90% chocolate bar and place 1 teaspoon in a snifter, then cover. (Save the rest for a snack.) For flavor, serve a ½-inch square of the chocolate in a cup (chop it up to make it less visually distinguishable), then cover.
-Smell and taste each side by side and compare their qualities. What distinguishes them for you?





GREEN/VEGETATIVE


Green
Description: An aromatic characteristic of fresh, plant-based material. Attributes may include leafy, viney, unripe, grassy, and peapod.
Reference: Parsley water


Green/vegetative attributes are always present in green coffee and can show up in the final cup, although roasting tends to diminish their presence and so are more likely to be found in light roasted coffee.16 The lexicon divides the green/vegetative attribute into four subcategories: olive oil, raw (see page 126), beany, and green/vegetative (again), which is further divided into seven specific attributes: underripe, peapod, fresh, dark green, vegetative, hay-like, and herb-like.
We humans are very sensitive to some of the compounds responsible for green attributes—such as 2-Isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, the compound associated with the earthy, fresh, green peapod attribute. We could detect just a few drops in an Olympic-size swimming pool of water.17
Some coffees are expected to have a green, vegetal, herbaceous note. For example, Southeast Asian coffees, such as those from Sumatra, are known to have a characteristic green earthy note that some liken to green bell pepper.* This particular flavor can be polarizing, and it may even be considered a defect if it presented in coffee from other origins. Unless a coffee is known for its green character, an overwhelmingly green/vegetative note would likely be considered an off-flavor by most coffee professionals at a cupping table. But if the green note shows up in the background or in a pleasant supporting role among other attributes, that might be acceptable, depending on preference.



PALATE EXERCISE

Green
Use this exercise to familiarize yourself with the green attribute, as both an aroma and a flavor.
What you'll need

■digital scale (0.1 gram precision)
■knife
■1 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley (rinsed)
■fresh water
■strainer
■medium snifter or wine glass
■1-ounce cup or shot glass
■lids

Aroma: Chop 25 grams of parsley. Place in a small bowl with 300 grams of water, cover, and let sit for 15 minutes. Strain out the parsley and discard. Transfer 1 tablespoon of the remaining parsley water to the snifter, then cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid to smell. What does the aroma remind you of? Describe it as best you can and/or connect it to a memory.
Flavor: Transfer 2 teaspoons of the parsley water to the cup, then cover to keep the aromatics in. When ready, lift the lid to taste. What does the flavor remind you of? How does it compare to the aroma? Describe it as best you can and/or connect it to a memory.



Tips

■There are usually two types of parsley available at the store: flat-leaf (Italian) and curly. World Coffee Research does not specify which one to use, so I am assuming they mean flat-leaf, which has a stronger taste.
■To up your game, compare the green attribute to the herb-like attribute ("The aromatic commonly associated with green herbs that may be characterized as sweet, slightly pungent, and slightly bitter. May or may not include green or brown notes."); it's easy to do a blinded tasting (see page 142) with this one. You'll need some McCormick dried herbs: bay leaf (crushed with your fingers), ground thyme, and basil leaves. Combine 0.5 grams of each herb in a mortar and pestle (or spice grinder) and grind together until fine and combined. Combine the herb mixture with 100 grams of water in a bowl. Transfer 5 grams of the herb water to a snifter, then add 200 grams of water. This is your aroma reference. Combine another 5 grams of the herb water with another 200 grams of water, then serve some in a cup. This is your flavor reference. Smell and taste, then compare to the parsley water.
■It can be difficult to get the bay leaf to crush to a powder without an electric spice grinder. If this is the case for you, do the best you can, prepare as directed, and then strain the liquid to remove the larger chunks of bay leaf.




By the time coffee gets to us consumers, the most common cause of a green note in coffee is probably underdevelopment—that is, coffee that has been roasted in a way that falls short of unlocking its full potential. I included this attribute because light roasted coffee is becoming increasingly common and sometimes you run into an underdeveloped coffee (I did once while I was working on this book), which is considered a roast defect. A green attribute combined with an intensely sour attribute and/ or astringent attribute is usually a sign of underdeveloped coffee.
To find coffee with a green note that isn't a roast defect, seek out Indonesian coffees, such as those from Sumatra and Sulawesi. Look for flavor notes that correspond to the lexicon attributes, as well as related ones, such as "herbaceous" and "dried basil."

DEFECT FLAVOR: THE POTATO DEFECT

Reference: Raw potatoes or the cut base of a head of romaine lettuce
Defect flavors are, in general, rare for consumers to experience because the coffee professionals all along the supply chain are trained to detect off-flavors. Defects disqualify coffee from being considered specialty coffee, so it's unlikely that your local specialty roaster is dealing with defective coffee.
However, there is one defect that does occasionally make its way to us consumers: the potato defect. It affects only coffee that is grown around the Great Lakes in Africa. The potato defect—so called because its sensory effect is reminiscent of raw potato—is caused by the antestia, a bug that lives in East Africa. As of this writing, there is still some debate about how the bug actually causes the defect, but there are two likely ways. One, the bug feeds on the plant, leaving it vulnerable to bacteria that produce the foul-smelling pyrazine that causes the defect. And two, the damage left by the bug may cause the coffee plant itself to produce the pyrazine in response to stress.18
The problem is that beans infected by the bacteria don't look different from uninfected beans. It really can't be detected until coffee is roasted, which is how it makes its way into the supply chain. Technically, any coffee from the Great Lakes region—which includes Ethiopia, Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, the DRC, Tanzania, and Uganda—is at risk of the potato defect. In my experience, it's most common in coffees from Burundi and Rwanda.
Although processes have been put into place to reduce the instances of potato defect—and please don't let it put you off from trying coffees from the affected countries—it's still common enough that I recommend using your sniffer before brewing coffee. After grinding a dose of Burundi or Rwanda coffee, smell the grounds: the potato defect is so potent that you should be able to tell that something is off right away. It smells just like raw potato. I've found that another good reference is the stem end of a head of romaine lettuce. Next time you are slicing romaine stems from the head's base, take a good sniff of the cut part. Now you have the potato defect aroma locked into memory.
The defect affects individual beans, not whole bags. You may have only one bad bean in the entire bag. One bean will ruin your brew, but don't throw away the whole bag. Just smell as you go and dump any doses with the defect. If you don't catch it and you end up drinking the coffee, it won't make you sick. But I guarantee you'll be able to tell that something is off—it will not taste as good as other brews from the bag!




RAW + ROASTED + BURNT


Raw
Description: An aromatic associated with uncooked products.
Reference: Fisher whole natural almonds




Roasted
Description: Dark brown impression characteristic of products cooked to a high temperature by dry heat. Does not include bitter or burnt notes.
Reference: Raw blanched peanuts




Burnt
Description: The dark brown impression of an overcooked or overroasted product that can be sharp, bitter, and sour.
Reference: Raw blanched peanuts


Though this may seem obvious, research has corroborated that roasted (and burnt) attributes are associated with dark roasted coffee beans and medium to dark roasted ground and brewed coffee—and that the intensity of these attributes increases with the level of roast.19 Roasting—specifically the Maillard reactions and other chemical reactions—creates the compounds that give us roasted attributes. And if the roasting continues, the compounds responsible for burnt attributes are produced. We tend to be sensitive to these compounds, and the more there are in the coffee, the more likely it is that they will supplant or overwhelm more delicate, subtle characteristics in the cup.
The compound 2-furfurylthiol has long been considered an important player in coffee aroma and flavor, as it contributes significantly to roasted attributes in coffee. In fact, one of the first in-depth studies of coffee aroma, in the 1920s, identified this compound as "exhal[ing] a pleasant note indicative of coffee."20 This compound is what is used as the roasted coffee reference in Le Nez du Café. Modern research has shown that during the roasting process, 2-furfurylthiol increases as roasting continues for some coffee varieties, while for others it increases during the light to medium-dark stages and then slightly decreases at the dark roasted stage.21 Phenols are associated with burnt notes.22 Burnt attributes are generally considered undesirable—a roasting defect—in the coffee community.
Raw, roasted, and burnt attributes live on a spectrum, and I think it's interesting and informative to compare them to one another. The more familiar you are with the flavors, the easier it will be to identify the different intensities of roast characteristics in your brew. Even when coffee is roasted to emphasize bean characteristics, roast characteristics still play a role in the overall flavor of coffee—and you may even learn to detect when a characteristic is unintended, such as when a raw attribute crops up in underdeveloped coffee or a burnt attribute shows itself in an overdeveloped cup.

The more familiar you are with the raw, roasted, and burnt attributes, the easier it will be to identify the different intensities of roast characteristics in your brew.




PALATE EXERCISE

Raw + Roasted + Burnt
Use this exercise to familiarize yourself with qualities associated with roast level by comparing five flavor attributes: raw, light roasted, medium roasted, dark roasted, and overroasted/burnt.
What you'll need

■rimmed baking sheet
■parchment paper
■raw blanched peanuts
■Fisher whole natural almonds
■five 1-ounce cups or shot glasses
■lids

Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line the baking sheet with the parchment paper, then spread the peanuts evenly across the sheet, making sure the nuts aren't touching each other (if they touch each other, they may steam instead of roast). Place the baking sheet in the oven and roast for the time indicated to achieve each reference.
Raw (Flavor): Put unroasted almonds in a cup, then cover to keep the aromatics in.
Light roasted (Flavor): Roast the peanuts for 7 minutes, then remove about one-quarter of the nuts from the pan. The nuts should show no change in color. Transfer them to a cup, then cover.
Medium roasted (Flavor): Return the pan to the oven and roast for 3 more minutes (10 minutes total), or until the nuts are medium brown. Remove about a third of the remaining nuts from the pan, transfer them to a cup, and cover.
Dark roasted (Flavor): Return the pan to the oven and roast for 5 more minutes (15 minutes total), or until the nuts are dark brown. Remove half of the remaining nuts from the pan, transfer them to a cup, and cover.
Overroasted/Burnt (Flavor): Return the pan to the oven and roast for 5 more minutes (20 minutes total), or until the nuts are burnt. Remove from the oven, transfer to a cup, and cover.
Taste the almonds and each type of peanut, covering between tastings to keep the aromatics in. How are they similar and different? What do the flavors remind you of? Describe each as best you can and/or connect it to a memory. This is a great opportunity to test yourself with a blinded tasting (see page 142).



Tips

■Note that the raw attribute ("an aromatic associated with uncooked products") is under the green/vegetative general category, but it's a good point of comparison to the roasted attributes.
■The lexicon's reference is almonds (not peanuts) for raw, but if you don't want to buy two types of nuts, you can probably get the idea of raw by eating the raw, unroasted peanuts.





ROAST CHARACTERISTICS AND COLOR

I've been using the common terms light roasted, medium roasted, and dark roasted in this book to refer to the level of coffee roasting because that is the language that lots of my research used, but I want to emphasize that these terms are an oversimplification. Roast level is a complex matrix of heat and time, and although coffee beans do tend to turn darker brown the hotter and/or longer they are roasted, physical color is not an ideal indicator of flavor characteristics. Two types of beans may be an identical "medium brown" color, but one could have intense roast characteristics and the other may not. Indeed, the scientists behind the lexicon are quick to point out that the roast attributes listed there are related to "the intensity of roast character." They write that "it is common for panelists to [detect] some flavor attributes that seem to relate to color, with a direct measure of intensity as they would with color, but this may not be correct.... There is not a linear relationship of light to dark roast. One cannot simply add more brown notes and get a darker roast flavor because the flavor actually changes to different types of notes."23 Because color-related roast terms are overly simple, many craft roasters do not even list them on their bags of coffee.





The Problem with Flavor Notes
Flavor notes are the descriptions that roasters and coffee shops use to describe the sensory attributes of coffee. It's the main way they have to set the expectations of consumers so they know what kind of coffee they are getting. Unfortunately, the coffee industry has not yet done a great job in setting our expectations around the limitations of flavor notes.
Many people have had the experience of purchasing coffee with delicious-sounding flavor notes—hibiscus, pink lemonade, effervescent-only to taste none of them. They immediately think they've done something wrong—that they've brewed or tasted it incorrectly. This may not be the case, and there are a few reasons for it.
First, as we've discussed, flavor attributes tend to be pretty subtle and often require a measure of palate development—or at least the ability to taste consciously and thoughtfully. Hopefully, this book helps you overcome that challenge.
Second, those flavor notes may have been decided by the roaster on a specific day, in a specific place, with a specific kind of water, and a specific brew method, the cupping method (see page 137). The cupping method dictates a specific roast level and preparation method, neither of which may match how the coffee is ultimately roasted and prepared for consumers. Think back to the "What Influences Coffee Flavor?" section (page 79). Because coffee by nature is complex—and so many factors can affect its flavor—it's possible you (or a barista) might not be able to replicate the exact flavor notes when it's time to brew. If you spend any time brewing coffee at home, you likely already know that tweaks to your preparation method can change flavor outcomes. And that it's not uncommon for coffee's flavor to change slightly from the beginning to the end of the week, even without preparation changes. That doesn't mean the coffee is "bad" or brewed incorrectly. It might just taste a little different.
In my experience, however, coffee does not usually change fundamentally; a bright fruity coffee likely wouldn't turn into a dark chocolate one, but a distinct blackberry note at the cupping table might materialize as a general berry or fruity note many months later when the coffee is brewed in the shop. Or a delicate floral note could be lost entirely. Or one characteristic may become more pronounced than another. Remember, you can't create flavor in a bean if the potential is not already there to begin with—but you can destroy flavor and obscure it.
Last, always remember that there is no guarantee that the person who is writing flavor notes is a certified Q grader—a top sensory professional in coffee—and/or using the standardized vocabulary of the lexicon. They also may not have any marketing training, meaning they aren't well versed in communicating product information effectively to consumers. Honestly, sometimes it doesn't even seem like the flavor notes are intended for consumers but rather are there to impress or interest other coffee professionals.
Some roasters and coffee shops recognize these issues with flavor notes and are actively trying to more effectively communicate with their audience of consumers, often by simplifying flavor note language so that it resonates with common, likely shared, and replicable flavor experiences. But many others are guilty of the opposite: extremely specific descriptions and flowery, meaningless marketing language that obfuscate common, replicable experiences and create confusion.
So, what are you to do when you encounter such language? I recommend you interpret it broadly and try to break up overly specific attributes into parts using the language of the lexicon and flavor wheel, since they've done a lot of the hard work for us. Because the primary characteristics of coffee don't fundamentally change, most of the time you can set your own flavor expectations well enough. Of course, this means guesswork is still involved, but now you have the tools you need to make informed assumptions.
Let's take a look at the flavor notes I mentioned earlier—hibiscus, pink lemonade, effervescent—which happen to be on the bag of coffee I'm drinking as I type. Notice, first, that none of these attributes are part of the lexicon or flavor wheel. To the average coffee consumer, they are at once specific and nebulous. Here's how I interpret them:

Hibiscus: A flower, the specific flavor of which many people would not be able to describe off the top of their head. This is overly complicated marketing language that is trying to suggest an "exotic" quality, I guess. I would expect a general floral note.
Pink lemonade: Lemonade = sweet + fruit, perhaps a citrus fruit. A citrus fruit suggests a sour component. Now for "pink." Most pink lemonade is simply dyed and has no discernable difference from regular lemonade, so they probably chose "pink lemonade" because it sounds appetizing and nothing more. It's possible this is trying to imply another fruit quality, such as strawberry, but that doesn't affect my general assessment. I'll expect to find sweet, fruity, and sour notes in this coffee.
Effervescent: The coffee is not carbonated, so it cannot be literally effervescent. This is likely an attempt to sound appealing and fancy, but it's probably also attempting to describe acidity, since the word effervescent is often associated with crisp, fresh, bright beverages and those euphemisms are also used to describe acidity. So, this coffee likely has pronounced acidity, which means a sour characteristic, probably citric acid, based on the other flavor notes.
Overall: This coffee likely balances tropical fruit-like acidity with sweet, fruity, floral notes.

The problem with specific flavor notes is that not all people share that flavor experience, which makes the note exclusionary. It implies that consumers are not on the same level as the coffee roaster ("I know what hibiscus tastes like; too bad if you don't"), which smacks of pretention. And because these specific notes are not in the lexicon, there really isn't a way for consumers to "get on the roaster's level" because there are no descriptions or references available to calibrate the palate. Until the industry as a whole decides to use standardized language with consumers, we will have to do our best to interpret overly specific flavor notes.
In general, in my experience, flavor notes are best interpreted broadly. Very specific notes are almost always disappointing. Instead, try to break a note down into broad categories based on the specific note: roasted, spices (which I did not cover here), nutty, cocoa/chocolate, sweet, floral, fruity, sour/fermented, and green/vegetal. So, if you see the flavor note "s'more," don't expect to taste the campfire treat. Instead, expect to taste a broad sweetness, with chocolate and roasted qualities. If you see "green apple," expect a broad fruitiness with some level of acidity.




*This green character is often attributed to the unique wet-hull process (called Giling Basah) that is common in Indonesia. It is different from the washed (wet) processing that you are likely more familiar with.













CHAPTER 5Practical Tips for Tasting Coffee


IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER, YOU STARTED BUILDING your brain's reference library, stuffing it full of coffee-related sensory attributes and committing their names to memory. This, of course, is all in the hope that you will find these attributes in your daily brew and be able to articulate them in the moment. This is called sensory literacy. To develop sensory literacy, you must taste coffees—a lot of different coffees. Preferably, side by side, if you can. Tasting individual coffees in isolation is fine, but their subtle sensory differences become clearer—sometimes startlingly so—when you taste two or three at the same time.
Now, this poses challenges. As we've seen, preparation can greatly impact a coffee's sensory attributes, those attributes evolve over time, and small differences—such as temperature—affect the way we taste. To present coffees on a level playing field and reduce our biases as much as possible, we need a way to taste coffee that has been prepared the same way at the same time at the same temperature. We also need a method that isn't so onerous that we never want to do it.
Lucky for us, coffee professionals have already figured out a quick, easy, systematic way to taste multiple coffees at once—it's called cupping. In this chapter, you'll learn how to set up a cupping so that you can easily taste different coffees at the same time. You will also find tips on testing yourself with a specific kind of cupping exercise called triangulation, setting up a blinded tasting, and tasting mindfully.

How to Set Up a Cupping
Technically speaking, cupping is a tool that coffee professionals use for the specific purpose of evaluating green (unroasted) coffee. The SCA has developed a detailed protocol, which you can view online.1 This protocol is quite involved and rigid because cupping is a sensory tool used to evaluate and describe the sensory attributes of coffee with limited bias, something that's a challenge when the human palate is your instrument of measure.
In order for the results of the cupping to be quick and accurate, everything from the coffee's roast and grind size to the brewing temperature and tasting method is streamlined and controlled. Cuppers use the SCA Cupping Form to assess specific categories: roast level, fragrance/aroma, flavor, acidity, body, balance, aftertaste, uniformity, sweetness, cleanliness, overall, and defects.2 The SCA is very clear about the intended purpose of cupping in its handbook: "Though sometimes demonstration 'cuppings' are done for educational or promotional purposes, this is not cupping per se; cupping proper exists within the green coffee trade as an evaluation and quality assessment tool."3
So, we aren't going to worry about the complicated cupping form—much of it does not apply to us because we are drinking coffee that has already gone through the rigorous cupping assessment. The outcome of this assessment is a score on a 100-point scale. The specialty coffee we drink must score more than 80 points, so there is no reason for us to assess the quality of the coffee in the way that professional cuppers do.
That being said, we can still use the preparation method as an out-line—it's really the simplest way to taste multiple coffees at once—and we are still going to call it "cupping," despite what the SCA says. Instead of evaluating coffee, we will use cupping as a way to explore a coffee's flavor and develop our sensory literacy. We can do this with two kinds of tastings: discriminative tasting (deciding whether there is difference between samples) and descriptive tasting (articulating the difference between samples). If you already know how to cup, you'll quickly realize that I'm paring things down. For example, a professional cupper would have five samples of each type of coffee on the table (to check for uniformity across the samples), which is unnecessary for tasters like us. I recommend you cup two to three different coffees at a time to explore their differences.



Cupping uses a very basic brewing process—you set out equal-size cups, pour equal amounts of different coffee grounds into each, and then fill the cups with hot water. The coffee steeps, much like tea, for a set amount of time, then you skim out the grounds using spoons. In this way, samples can be prepared almost simultaneously, and you don't need to worry about keepings things warm or about inconsistencies in the brewing method. You then taste the coffee using a spoon. The spoon—each taster has their own—allows multiple people to taste the coffee at once while keeping things sanitary. What follows is a pared-down version of the SCA cupping process. As you'll see, I generally recommend that you try to be as uniform as possible to achieve the most consistent samples.

WHAT YOU'LL NEED

•Fresh filtered water. It should not smell of chlorine or other odors. Do not use distilled or softened water.
•A burr grinder. This will ensure your grounds are as evenly chopped as possible. If you do not own one, have your coffee ground at a local coffee shop. You're looking for a size that is "slightly coarser than for drip."
•A way to heat water and measure its temperature. I use an electric kettle with a built-in thermometer. If you don't have this, use a food thermometer, or use the water immediately after taking it off boil.
•Digital scale. This should be accurate to 0.1 grams. I recommend you weigh everything (including the water) in grams because it's the simplest and fastest way to prepare the cupping.
•Timer. You can, of course, use your phone!
•Spoons. You'll need a spoon for skimming out grounds, plus a spoon for each taster for sipping coffee. There are special cupping spoons, but no need to invest in them. Use soup spoons if you have them, but any spoon will do in a pinch.
•Small, shallow, wide-mouth cups. Professionals use special cupping bowls, but you don't need to invest in those. Just use coffee cups or small bowls that hold between 7 and 9 fluid ounces (which is 207 to 266 grams). You need one cup for each coffee you are tasting. Make sure they are all the same size, shape, and color—you should not be able to tell them apart by looking.
•Cups of any size. One is for spent coffee grounds. The others (one per taster to keep things as sanitary as possible) will be filled with water for rinsing your spoons.



THE METHOD

1.Figure out how much water your cups hold. Figuring out the capacity of the cup means you won't have to worry about measuring water when you brew. Place one of your identical cups on the scale set to grams, zero it (hit the "tare" button), pour water to the very top, and write down that measurement. If the only glasses you have are too large, weigh out 207 to 266 grams and make a fill-line mark (with masking tape) on each cup so you know how much water to add later. That way you don't have to fumble with the scale during brewing.
2.Figure out your dose. You should use 8.25 grams of coffee per 150 grams of water. Remember, 1 milliliter of water is the same as 1 gram of water, so it's easy to weigh everything out. For example, if your cup will comfortably hold 220 milliliters of water, that's the equivalent of 220 grams, so you'd start with 12 grams of coffee. I recommend writing down your dose for future use. Now that you've completed the first two steps, you can skip directly to the third step next time.
3.Prepare your setup. Set out as many shallow wide-mouth cups as you have coffee samples. Arrange them in a row on a table or counter so that you can easily work from left to right, stepping to the side to taste the next one. Place your other cups behind the row. Fill all but one with water. Set out one spoon and give another spoon to each taster. Place the timer within easy reach. Once you're ready to brew, things go quickly, so this preparation step is key.
4.Grind the beans and note the fragrance. Weigh out your beans, adding a little extra since some grinders tend to "eat" beans. Remember, the grind size should be slightly coarser than you'd use for drip (around a medium coarseness). If using different beans, flush out the grinder between each type of bean—just throw a few of the next type in there, grind, and discard. This will reduce the risk of cross contamination. Weigh the coffee again after grinding (removing extra as needed to get the desired weight), and place each dose of grounds in a separate cup. While the water heats (step 5), smell each coffee and note its fragrance (see page 15).
5.Heat your water to 195 to 205°F. Keep in mind that once the coffee is ground, you don't want it sitting around for too long before you brew, as precious aromatics quickly dissipate. The SCA recommends no longer than 15 minutes.
6.Pour water into each cup and note the aroma. Set a timer for 4 minutes and, working from left to right and as quickly as you can, immediately pour the water into each cup, filling it to the brim or to the fill line you marked (the coffee grounds float, so the coffee grounds are what reach the fill line). As you wait for 4 minutes to elapse, note the aroma (see page 17) of each sample.
7.Break and remove the grounds. When the timer sounds, starting on the left with the first cup you poured, use your personal spoon to "break the crust" by stirring the coffee a few times. (If you are the one breaking, you can note the aroma again. Professionals say it's most potent after the break, but it's also not strictly necessary for us to do.) Then use the same spoon and the one on the table to skim off the grounds and transfer them to the empty cup. Try to skim just the grounds and foam but not the coffee. Skimming might be tricky at first, but you'll get better with practice. Start at the top of the cup with both spoons and curve them along the edge of the cup like parentheses, collecting grounds as you go. It's easier to learn by watching.4 Rinse the spoons in the cup of clean water before moving on to the next sample to avoid cross contamination. At a professional cupping, a different person usually breaks and removes the grounds from each cup, so it's done all at once, but you can instead designate one person to do it.
8.Taste the coffee. Once the samples have reached the target temperature (see the tips on page 153), work from left to right and start with the first cup you poured. Using your personal spoon, take a small amount of coffee from the surface, then taste (see the Tasting Method section on page 151). Rinse your spoon in your cup of clean water, and move to the next sample to the right. Now there's an open spot at the table for the next taster to follow you. Repeat this process with the remaining samples until everyone has tasted all samples.


A MORE CASUAL AFFAIR

If you don't want to go through the process of cupping, you can of course order two different coffees (or share with a friend) at a coffee shop and compare them. They'll likely be ready around the same time. The following are some pairings you may find informative. You can also use these for triangulation (see page 148) ideas to test your palate. Depending on where you live and the coffee shops around you, you may be able to ask the barista for help finding these coffees on the menu. But remember, not all shops prioritize the same things and not all baristas receive sensory training.

•Natural coffee and washed coffee
•Fruity profile and cocoa/nutty profile
•High-acidity coffee and low-acidity coffee
•Traditional roast and modern roast (or dark roasted and light roasted)
•African coffee and South American coffee
•Blend and single origin
•Espresso and filter (drip) coffee, made from the same beans

I've found that the problem with doing side-by-side taste testings at home is simply the time it takes. It's hard to keep one coffee hot while brewing the second, but you can probably achieve it with high-quality insulated thermoses and some patience.





How to Set Up a Blinded Tasting
Several of the sensory reference exercises in this book suggest that you taste things blinded, or without knowing which sample you are tasting. Triangulation (see page 148) in particular must be done blinded, and professional cuppers always cup blinded. When you are starting out, I think it's worthwhile to taste known coffees because you are trying to build up associations, so not every cupping you do must be blinded. But when it comes to taking it to the next level or testing your palate, blinding the cuppings becomes essential.
Tasting blinded is important because it's common to form biases from known information. There are three categories for bias and error when it comes to tasting: physiological (when something physically diminishes our abilities, such as a cold), neurological (when our brain causes us to perceive something "incorrectly"), and psychological (when our expectations color our experience). Blinded tastings are designed to reduce psychological bias and error, sometimes called expectation bias.
Professional tasters are not immune from psychological bias; in fact, they may be more susceptible to it because their knowledge base is so great. They may "associate certain sensory attributes to other factors such as origin, variety, processing method, roast level, etc."5 Then, on a conscious or subconscious level, they either search for those attributes when tasting or "find" them there, confirming the expectation. For example, if a taster knows they are tasting a naturally processed coffee, they may expect it to taste fruity and score it higher in the fruity category. Indeed, the SCA recommends that each "cupper should know the minimum amount of information as is practical when cupping a coffee."6
So how do you accomplish this? In an ideal setup, you'd ask a friend to choose coffees for you and/or prepare the cupping, so you'd have no idea which coffees you were tasting and/or what order you were tasting them in. This is not always feasible, especially when you are trying my recommended pairings in this book—you will necessarily know, at least, what samples are on the table. The following are some options you can try to help eliminate bias during cupping when the group of samples on the table are known. In both methods, identical cups must be used, and in an even more ideal scenario, the cups would be opaque and/or black so that you cannot see the contents.

DON'T ALWAYS GO IN BLINDED

Though blinded tasting reduces bias, flavor explorers can often learn a lot with full knowledge of which coffees they taste while cupping. Comparing coffees can make their differences more apparent on a neurological level. I mentioned neurological biases earlier, and this is one example. Studies have shown that when professional tasters are cupping left to right, a defective coffee can make the next sample in the lineup seem higher quality than it may objectively be. Cuppers tend to score them higher than they would if there was no defective coffee in the mix.7 The influence that a cup of coffee can have on the next one is called the carry-over effect.8
If you are a professional who is attempting to objectively evaluate coffee, you want to limit the carry-over effect as much as possible. But I argue that for home tasters, comparison tasting helps us solidify our understanding of different flavor profiles. The carry-over effect, I think, can help highlight differences between two disparate coffees and help you describe that difference. In isolation, a coffee with a fruity profile may seem only slightly different from a basic coffee flavor. But when you sip a fruity coffee and then sip a chocolate coffee, the difference can be remarkable. In science terms, this is called "release from suppression." If you taste something that is intense in a certain category, such as fruitiness, your palate adapts to that flavor and stops sensing it as acutely. I'm sure you've experiences this with smells—if you're baking cookies, after a while, you might stop being aware of the delicious smell. But if someone new walks into the room, they might remark on how delicious the cookies smell. Likewise with coffee: when you taste another sample, the quality you adapted to is muted in the new sample, and contrasting flavors will seem elevated.9 It may not help as much with similar coffees, but there are workarounds.
When preparing a tasting of known coffees, be sure to order the coffees from the lightest roast/most delicate/most subtle to the darkest roast/ least delicate/least subtle, then start tasting on the light/delicate side.
Otherwise, you may overwhelm your palate with bold flavors, and the subtle flavors will be harder to detect and appreciate. This is also recommended in wine pairings, where you taste from lightest white to boldest red.
One easy, fun tasting is to prepare coffees that run the gamut of roasting techniques. As a generalization, I mean "light roast" to "dark roast," but that terminology is often tricky. Many craft roasters don't use these terms at all, and big specialty brands might say "light roast" but it's more roasted than anything you'd get from your local craft roaster.
If you are having trouble sourcing coffees, your local roaster or barista may be able to help you select them. Just tell them what you're trying to do: taste different roasting styles. Here, I have provided at least one suggestion for each category. It's tricky to give specific recommendations because coffees I have access to might not be available everywhere. Also, coffee is a seasonal product. Single-origin coffees usually aren't available year-round, but they tend to have more varied flavor attributes than blends, which offer consistent product year-round.

•The lightest roasted coffee you can find. Try a Scandinavian roaster, if you can. They have a modern roasting tradition that tends to skew quite light. Two Scandinavian roasters I enjoy are Coffee Collective (Denmark) and Morgon (Sweden), but of course, there are many to choose from.
•A light roasted coffee. Try Ethiopia Mordecofe or Rwanda Huye Mountain, both of which are usually available for at least half a year from Stumptown Coffee Roasters.10
•A medium roasted coffee. Try Holler Mountain or Homestead from Stumptown.
•Starbucks blonde roast, such as Veranda Blend.
•Starbucks medium roast, such as Pike Place.
•Starbucks dark roast, such as Caffè Verona.




DOUBLE BLINDED TASTING
This method involves two people, and neither know which coffee is being tasted. The setup is a bit complicated, and at a cupping, the method would need to be accomplished during the 4-minute brew window. You would prepare the cupping as outlined on page 137, knowing which samples are on the table, but while the coffee brews, you randomize the samples in such a way that neither of you know the order. You need to be able to mark the cups and remove the marks during the 4-minute brew time. I recommend colored dry-erase markers and a phone with a camera to record what's happening.
STEP 1
Person A marks each cup with a different color.



STEP 2
Person A writes down which samples correspond to which colors, then shuffles the cups.



STEP 3
Person B marks each cup a second time, using new colors.



STEP 4
Person B takes a photo of the setup, removes the first set of marks, and then shuffles again.



Here are the steps—in this scenario, person A sets up the initial cupping with person B out of the room. At the beginning of the randomization, only person A knows the order. For the purposes of this example, let's say there are three different coffees and they start in this order: Ethiopia, Panama, and Brazil.

With person B out of the room, person A marks each coffee with a different color marker. In this case, person A marks Ethiopia red, Panama blue, and Brazil green. (If you're doing a triangulation [see page 148] and two of the cups are the same, you'd still mark each with a different color.)
Person A writes down which samples correspond to which colors, then shuffles the order of the cups. Let's say the new order is Panama (blue), Ethiopia (red), and Brazil (green). Person A exchanges places with person B but does not show person B the paper.
Person B is now alone in the room with the cups: they see the order—blue, red, green—but do not know which coffee is which. Person B adds a second mark to each sample, using different colors. In this case, person B marks orange (blue), purple (red), and black (green).
Person B takes a photo of the setup to record the color pairings, then they wipe off the first marks (blue, red, and green) and shuffle the cups. Person A returns but is not shown the photo.

Now neither person A nor person B knows which coffee is which. When the timer sounds, the tasters can break the grounds and proceed with the cupping as normal. At the end of the cupping, person A and person B can reveal the information contained on the paper and in the photo and discover in which order they tasted the coffees.


BLINDED TASTING BY YOURSELF
If you are tasting by yourself, you can still set up a blinded tasting. Make sure you are using identical cups—you should not be able to distinguish any of them by looking. Label the bottom of each cup with the coffee you intend to brew in it, then add the grounds. Before you start evaluating fragrance, close your eyes and randomize the order of the cups. Then you can complete the rest of the cupping process (see page 137). After you're done tasting, you can peek under each cup to reveal the coffee.

SHH! DON'T INFLUENCE OTHERS' OPINIONS!

If you are attempting to conduct a blinded tasting with a group of friends, resist talking about your thoughts while the tasting is going on. Commentary from the tasters in the room can influence others' opinions, which is called social bias. This is especially difficult to overcome when the person providing the commentary is considered the most skillful taster by others (authority bias). Humans tend to want to follow the leader and fit in with groups.11 So go ahead and write your thoughts down, but keep them to yourself until the tasting is over. In fact, everyone at the tasting should try to keep their poker face on—facial expressions, gestures, and other nonverbal communication can also influence others' opinions.





How to Triangulate Coffee
Triangulation is a type of sensory test that reveals whether a person can distinguish between two different coffees. In a triangulation, you seek to identify the different coffee from three samples. The three samples are called a triad; two are the same coffee and one is different. The goal is simply to pick out the different cup, not necessarily what the difference is. Triangulation is common in the professional coffee world, and Q graders must pass triangulation tests to get their certification. The World Cup Tasters Championship also employs triangulation tests. Other coffee professionals, such as roasters and baristas, may triangulate coffee as part of their sensory training and maintenance. You can use the same method to test your differentiation skills. It's also fun!
Because triangulation is concerned with difference, it's super important that the two like samples are actually the same. The SCA recommends batch brewing instead of cupping for triangulation so that the two like samples actually come from the same brew and thus are identical.12 However, best practices also state that all other factors be controlled—including keeping temperature the same—which I've already mentioned can be difficult to achieve when brewing at home. Again, one alternative might be to conduct your tasting at a coffee shop that can serve you two different coffees at once, or else taking those coffees home in insulated thermoses and checking temperature with a thermometer.
All that being said, you can still achieve good results with the cupping method (see page 137). Simply follow the same steps, making sure that two samples are the same and one is different. When conducting a triangulation, however, it is even more important that you are being as careful as possible to eliminate unintentional difference, especially when grinding beans and measuring doses. Because the color of the brew can signal difference, it's crucial to use an opaque (ideally, black) set of cups and to make sure the tasting is blinded (see page 142).
Triangulation is an excellent way to test differentiation skills, especially when multiple tests are done in a row. This is because it's statistically unlikely for a person to get the right answer by chance multiple times in a row. For example, the probability that a person passes five out of six triangulations by chance is only 1.8 percent (about 2 in 100).13 That means that if you can pass five out of six triangulations in a row, you likely are good at differentiating between two coffees!

TRIANGULATION TEST IDEAS

Triangulation tests can be easy or hard. For example, differentiating between a light roasted and dark roasted coffee might be easy (because the difference is large), while telling the difference between two different Kenyan coffees might be hard (because the difference is subtle, depending on the coffees). Beyond generalizations, I don't have any way to measure how difficult my recommended triangulation tests are, but you can have fun figuring it out. If you are testing with a group, it's reasonable to assume that easy tests will result in more correct answers and hard tests will result in fewer correct answers.
You can triangulate any or all of my suggestions from the "A More Casual Affair" box on page 142. You can also use triangulation to test your skills with the basic tastes and other attributes. And here are some more ideas. Have fun creating your own!

•Standard coffee versus strong coffee: Using the same coffee beans, brew two samples with a standard brew ratio and a third with a strong brew ratio (that is, use more beans but keep the water the same). For example, if you are typically cupping with 220 grams of water and 12 grams of coffee, up the third cup to 15 grams. The bigger the difference in ratio, the easier the triangulation will be; the smaller the difference, the harder. You can also do this with standard coffee and weak coffee (meaning, use fewer beans but keep the water the same).
•Standard coffee versus added acidity: Using the same coffee beans, brew all three samples in the same manner. (This test is perfect for batch brewing because you are dealing with only one type of coffee. Simply brew a batch of coffee and pour equal amounts into your three cups.) Add 5 grams of 0.05% citric acid solution (page 33) to one sample. The more you add, the easier it will be. You can do this test with all five of your basic taste references. By increasing and decreasing the amount of the reference you add, you can determine your detection threshold!



Remember the neurological biases I mentioned earlier, in which the position of a cup in a tasting can highlight difference? This affects triangulation tests, too. If the different cup is in the middle position, it is easier for us to taste the difference. To counteract this, professionals make sure to randomize the cupping order and do multiple tests. If you are really trying to test yourself, it might also be a good idea to balance your tests like the professionals do. That is, if the first test had two of coffee A and one of coffee B, then the next test would have two of coffee B and one of coffee A.14


Tasting Method and Tips
We all know how to taste the food we eat, but in this section, we'll explore how we can try to work with our physiology to give us the best shot at discerning and identifying flavor in coffee. This section will help you taste more consciously, whether you're sipping your daily brew, setting up a tasting among friends, or testing yourself with a blinded triangulation. It also provides advice for using the flavor wheel to help you identify flavors.
If you really want to get into it, I recommend taking notes as you taste any new coffee or challenge yourself with exercises and tests. Writing things down helps many people commit information to memory and strengthen recall, and also provides a handy record to look back on to refresh your memory. For those readers who like a programmatic approach, I have included a coffee tasting resource in the back of the book (see page 172). It's something you can use to guide your tasting and is available for download at jessicaeasto.com/coffee-tasting-resource.

TASTING METHOD
Before you get started tasting, reacquaint yourself with the order of the experience, which we went over in chapter 1. Recall that the coffee experience starts with your nose—the orthonasal olfaction we use to smell the dried coffee grounds (fragrance) and the brewed coffee (aroma). Once the coffee is in our mouth, we experience flavor (basic tastes + mouthfeel + retronasal olfaction). But it's not over. The flavor we experience as we drink is often noticeably different from the flavor that remains (aftertaste) in our mouths once we swallow the coffee. There are a few techniques you can use while drinking the coffee that may help you detect flavor notes.

•Slurping. This is a hallmark technique of professional coffee tasters, and some are quite exuberant about it. It's easy to make fun of, but there is a reason they do this. To slurp, you quickly suck a small amount of coffee (from either a cupping spoon or cup) into your mouth, spraying it across your entire palate. This not only gives your entire tongue an opportunity to join the tasting party but also helps vaporize and push aromatic compounds that need to travel to the back of your throat and up into your nose. I think some people are hesitant to do this because they have seen others slurp loudly, but the effectiveness of the slurp is not measured by how loud you do it. You can slurp quietly, too, if you want.
•Exhaling after swallowing. Exhaling after swallowing continues the work that slurping started. It forces air from the oral cavity up into the nose and out your nostrils, providing an extended opportunity for your nose to detect the aromatics that contribute to flavor via retronasal olfaction. Take a very deep breath in before slurping, slurp, swallow, and slowly exhale through your nose. You can extend that flavor detection quite a bit to allow time from your brain to do its magical calculus and recall. When concentrating on aftertaste, I also like to take a deep breath in, swallow (so there is no coffee in my mouth), and slowly exhale through my nose.
•Moving tongue through coffee. For judging mouthfeel, it often helps to take another sip and focus only on that. Sip some coffee, hold it in your mouth, and press your tongue through it. Move your tongue slowly up and down and side to side, focusing on the tactile sensations detected by your tongue and cheeks. If you are having trouble separating feeling from flavor, plug your nose to eliminate the aromatic component.

In general, when tasting coffee to develop your palate, it may be beneficial to limit yourself to one or two small sips. Ida Steen, a sensory scientist at CoffeeMind and the author of Sensory Foundation, encourages coffee drinkers to "take small sips of coffee and keep each sip in the mouth for only a couple of seconds."15 This is because your palate will be most sensitive to the first and second sips. She also recommends that you wait fifteen to sixty seconds between sips.


OTHER TIPS

•Let your coffee cool slightly. High temperatures make you less sensitive to flavor detection in general, so it's a good idea to let your coffee cool slightly before tasting it. You also don't want to burn your mouth. Steen recommends letting your coffee cool to about 130°F before tasting.16 The SCA Cupping Protocol states that tasting should begin once the sample is cooled to 160°F, which is eight to ten minutes after filling the cups with hot water in a cupping situation. This is the best time to do your slurp because the aromatics are at maximum flight strength at this temperature. After that, the SCA recommends evaluating other factors at lower temperatures, down to room temperature, which it defines as 100°F, and stopping the tasting once the coffee has reached 70°F.17 We might not have to worry about all that, but I do recommend tasting the same coffee multiple times as it cools—it's an interesting exercise. We have already learned that coffee's flavor changes as it cools, mostly because different compounds are active (or not active) at different temperatures. This exercise illustrates the evolving flavor of coffee.
•Don't distract your senses. Avoid wearing perfumes or other strong scents, and avoid smoking before tasting. Scents can get in the way of detecting delicate notes in coffee, and smoking tends to cloud both your palate and your nose (in both the short and long term).18
•Avoid sensory fatigue. Sensory fatigue happens when the sensory receptors in your mouth and nose become physically or chemically saturated, making them less effective at detecting what they're supposed to detect. This can happen when you taste lots of coffee. To avoid this, limit the number of different coffees you taste in one session to three to five. You can also take breaks from tasting and smelling to give your taste buds and olfactory receptors a break. Don't take a break by eating or drinking other flavorful things, though. The next tip explains why.
•Avoid the carry-over effect. Earlier I explained why I think tasting disparate coffees one right after the other can be beneficial in highlighting difference. Other times, especially when coffees are more similar, it may muddle things. This is most apparent if your first tasting sample is the first coffee you've had in a while. Science has found that tasters often find the flavor and aroma of first cups to be more intense. To avoid this, use palate cleansers and take some time between tasting samples. Popular palate cleansers include plain water, sparkling water, and unsalted crackers. Cleanse your palate between each sample that you taste. You should also avoid eating while tasting, as strong tastes and flavors can lead to adaptation and release from suppression (see page 144).




PALATE EXERCISE

Understanding Mixture Suppression
Earlier in the book, I told you that machines cannot perceive flavor as well as humans. Part of the reason is that machines can't replicate how humans experience flavor. A scientific concept called mixture suppression illustrates this point well—and I think it also partially explains why it's so difficult to reliably predict flavor outcomes in coffee. Mixture suppression means that we perceive individual components more intensely when we taste them alone than when they are mixed together. Something about mixing them tones down the intensity of each. Try this yourself with any combination of the basic taste references you created in chapter 2.
What you'll need

■two basic taste references, such as the 1.0% sucrose solution (page 37) and the 0.05% citric acid solution (page 33)
■three identical small cups

Pour some of the sucrose solution into the first cup, some of the citric acid solution into the second cup, and equal parts of the sucrose and citric acid solutions into the third cup. Taste the pure sucrose solution and note its intensity, then taste the mixture of sucrose and citric acid, noting its intensity. Do the same for the citric acid solution, followed by the mixture.
Although the mixture contains an equal concentration (intensity) of sucrose as the pure sample, the mixture will likely taste less sweet. The same goes for the citric acid solution.





FINDING YOUR WORDS
Taking a triangulation test to see if you can differentiate between samples is one thing, but tasting to describe coffee is another ball of wax. When our intention is to describe, we must use our words, and most of this book is an attempt to help you build your vocabulary so you have the words when you need them. But finding the words in the moment? That's that hardest part.
I have created a coffee tasting resource (page 172) that helps guide you through tasting a sample. You may find that this helps you as you begin learning how to taste to describe. I recommend using the tasting resource together with the Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel (page 170) to help you pinpoint vocabulary. This section will provide some guidance on how to do this.

•First thought, best thought. Before you get too into the weeds—or if you simply want to simplify things—take note of the first thought or association you have when you first take a sip of coffee. Remember, flavor (aroma in particular) is deeply connected to memory. Latching onto those sparks in the beginning can help us intellectualize what's happening later. This is one of my favorite things about being alive. I love walking through a smell and being immediately whisked away to the past. You'll remember the story I shared earlier about the coffee that reminded me of the stables where I used to ride horses in middle school. Eventually I realized it's because the coffee had similar pleasantly sweet, earthy, grainy qualities of hay, which was stored in one of the barns. If you have an association, write it down without thinking about it too much at first. Keep tasting and come back to it later, if needed.
•Don't discount color associations. Sometimes when you are tasting, you may find that an attribute is familiar but you can't quite put your finger on the word. Sometimes you might think, "It tastes red" or "This reminds me of green." These are often helpful clues. Our brains associate flavor and color, which is why the flavor wheel is in color. If something tastes "red" to you, start looking through the reddish sections of the wheel for attributes. If something tastes "dark" or "brown," you might start in with the attributes created during literal browning processes during roasting (roasted, nutty/ cocoa, etc.), which by no coincidence are brownish on the wheel. Your memory might be sparked by something you find there.
•Start at the center of the wheel and work out. Remember, the center of the wheel holds the broadest attribute categories, and these are what we focused on in this book. It's tempting to want to be as specific as possible, but I find you have a better shot at being accurate if you start in the center and methodically work your way out. Ask yourself broad questions to help narrow things down: "Is this coffee sour or bitter?" "Does this coffee read as sweet? If so, does it remind me of anything, such as a flower or a fruit?" "Is it more fruity or more nutty/cocoa?" These are just a few examples. If you land on, say, the broad category of fruity, you can start to get more specific by looking at the next row of attributes—you may try to determine if the fruity attribute is a fresh fruit attribute, a dried fruit attribute, or a citrus attribute.
•Build off basic attributes. As we saw in chapter 4, many of the attributes listed in the lexicon and flavor wheel can be parsed into even simpler notes. For example, fruity's description is "a sweet, floral, aromatic blend of a variety of fruits" (emphasis mine). And we also know that fruity attributes often go hand in hand with sour/acid attributes. If you pinpoint something like fruity, you may be able to investigate other areas of the wheel by taking your cues from the attribute itself. If you start at fruity, you may investigate sour/acid to see if you're picking up on citric acid or malic acid. That might give you a clue as to the type of fruit attribute you're dealing with. It works the opposite way, too. If you can pinpoint both sour/acidic and sweet, you might decide to take a look at the fruity section to see if anything sparks your memory.
•Keep in mind that coffee can have overlapping profiles. A coffee can have more than one major characteristic, so you may need to go through the wheel more than one time.
•Don't forget mouthfeel! The mouthfeel attributes in the lexicon are not present on the flavor wheel. That's why I have given it its own section on my tasting resource.




Coffee is one of the most complex beverages ever created, and though we learn more about it every day, a comprehensive understanding of its flavor is likely to elude us for the foreseeable future. But we can come to understand coffee on a deeper, more intuitive level by tasting it widely, thoughtfully, and consciously. I hope this book has helped you develop your palate and your language around coffee flavor, deepening your appreciation of your daily brew and making it easier to communicate with fellow coffee lovers. One of the most exciting things about coffee is that its flavor can present in the cup in seemingly infinite ways, providing endless opportunities to challenge our sensory systems, to slow down and savor, and to admire the complexity of nature and our own abilities, which evolved to meet it.

2The lexicon is considered a "living document." As such, it will be updated as new attributes are identified and codified, and references may be updated or added as needed. Since its publication in 2016, it has been updated once already, in 2017. The lexicon acknowledges that its references sometimes aren't widely available outside of the United States. To combat this, the new edition includes globally available references made in partnership with a flavor company called FlavorActiV. These may be more accessible to professionals; it's not practical for consumers like us to purchase these kits. I've taken this into consideration when selecting attributes for this book.

2You can download the official cupping form at sca.coffee/research/protocols-best-practices. However, during this writing, the SCA announced it has been reevaluating its cupping protocol and form, since it has been twenty years since they were revisited. The original form was designed to distinguish "specialty grade coffee" from "commercial coffee." The SCA wants the new form to "[respect] diverse consumer preferences while simultaneously strengthening producers' understanding of how to communicate and increase the value of the coffees they produce." It is currently conducting research to determine how both resources should evolve.
