TestingIn the following screenshot we can see the results of measurements of the system acquiring data from sensors: 









EnhancementThis program is a sample of how to use fuzzy logic to develop a decision system. There are many ways you can improve this program. The following is an improvement area to which you can contribute:Modify the fuzzy membership model to improve the definition of comfortAdd more input data to improve accuracyAdd fuzzy inference methods to obtain the aggregation value












Summary



We have reviewed some basic decision systems by taking two samples, that is, Bayesian and fuzzy logic. We also explored Python libraries for implementing Bayesian and fuzzy logic and then practiced with them. As the last topic, we deployed a decision system using fuzzy logic as a study sample on how to integrate a decision system on an IoT project with Raspberry Pi.
