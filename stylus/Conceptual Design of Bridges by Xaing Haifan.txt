					FOREWORD 

					After the 1952 adjustment, China's Higher Education in Science and Technology basically
					inherited the former Soviet system, namely, establishing universities corresponding
					to industrial sections. Engineering Colleges were grouped into civil engineering,
					electrical and mechanical engineering, hydraulic engineering, chemicals, mining,
					aviation, geology, transportation and other colleges to meet the industrial needs
					for engineers and technicians. Arts and Sciences were combined into general university,
					resulting in the separation of engineering and Arts and Sciences, an unfavorable
					situation for engineering education. 

					In the 1950s and 1960s, most engineering textbooks translated from the former Soviet
					Union. Those were teaching materials with practicality in mind, i.e., students were
					taught to design according to design specifications. Since the reform and opening
					up, department setup started to follow the discipline line and became to follow the
					international system, but the industry's influence remained. In the new textbook
					"Bridge Project" published in 2004, all articles, chapters, sections arranged basically
					inherited the former Soviet Union old textbooks except some necessary changes under
					the new requirements. 

					In the 2006 annual meeting of the International Bridge Engineering in Budapest, Professor
					M. Schlaich of the Department of Civil Engineering of the Technical University of
					Berlin published a report entitled "The challenge of education — conceptual and structural
					design," at the General Assembly. He introduced ongoing civil engineering education
					reform at Berlin University, i.e. combining the steel materials department and concrete
					structures department into a new "conceptual and structural design" department, and
					the three full professors no longer taught "Steel Design", "Design of Concrete Structures"
					according to the standard methods of analysis and design methods, instead, they taught
					conceptual design and structural design methods about all types of building materials
					according to the structure (bridges, tall buildings and space structures) to strengthen
					the cultivation of students' innovative ideas and ability, not only the basic design
					skills. 

					2007 onwards, Bridge Engineering at Tongji University decided to open a new course
					"Concept Bridge Design" for graduate students in order to bring forward a new generation
					of bridge engineers with conceptual design capabilities to overcome the shortcoming
					in innovative ideas quality and aesthetic considerations in China's bridge engineering.
					

					The course started in the Spring of 2008, first in the form of lectures given by
					several young professor in the division. 2008 summer, Professor Hoi Fan also joined
					the ranks of the course construction, participated in determining the teaching guideline,
					and co-authored with Professor Xiao Rucheng Chapter 1 Introduction; Chapter 2 Bridge
					Aesthetics and Design; Chief Engineer and Senior Engineer Professor Xu Liping and
					Professor Wei Hongyi at Bridge Design institute co-authored; Chapter 3 Basic Factors
					to be Considered in the Conceptual Design and Conceptual Design; Chapter 4 Analyzes
					Innovative Ideas; Professor Ge Yaojun Wrote; Chapter 5 Bridge Structural Disaster
					Prevention and Durability, and Part of; Chapters 2 and 3; Professor Xiao Rucheng
					Wrote; Chapter 6 Bridge Structural System and its Key Mechanical Problems; Professor
					Shi Xuefei Wrote; Chapter 7 New Problems in Conceptual Design and Solutions; and
					Finally 

					Conceptual Design Chapter 8 was rewitten by Tongji Urban Bridge Alumni, Tianjin Urban
					Construction Group Chief Engineer Professor Han Zhenyong, Senior Engineer. The book
					was validated by Professor Xiang Haifan before finalization. 

					Recently, in the midst of the "Question of Qian," we feel the urgency and the necessity
					of reform in engineering education in China. We hope that the publication of "the
					concept of bridge design" can bring inspiration and encouragement to Chinese students
					majoring in bridges sector as well as colleagues to overcome the deficiencies in
					China's bridge design, to come out of misunderstanding, and to help the education
					of bridge engineering in Chinese Universities rid of the shackles of traditional
					materials and methods and to keep up with the international engineering education
					reform. We welcome all feedbacks, especially to the errors in the book, from colleagues
					bridge engineering for future amendment in the second edition in order to further
					improve this "Conceptual Bridge Design" and make it a compulsory textbooks for 21st
					century bridge engineers.

					INTRODUCTION

					1.1 OVERVIEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN BRIDGE (1660-1945) 

					1.1.1 Preliminary Period (1660~1765) 

					Modern civil engineering went through the initial one hundred years (preliminary
					period, 1660 to 1765) over a period of 300 years from the 17th century to the mid-20th
					century. Italian Scholar Galileo Galilei (1564~1642), published a book "Dialogue
					on the Two New Scientific Theory" in 1638, and discussed the concept of mechanical
					properties and strength of the material, and then in 1660, the British State Scholar
					Robert Hooke (1635~1703), establish a relationship between stress and strain material
					(Hooke's law), and in 1687, British Scholar Isaac Newton (1642~1727), suggested the
					three great laws on mechanics and they became the theoretical foundation of civil
					engineering. 

					The French government established the first bridge ministry in 1715, and established
					the world's first engineering college in 1747, as Paris bridge school. In 1765, before
					the British Industrial Revolution occurred, the French engineer Jean-Rodolphe (1708~1794),
					led the Paris bridge school to studied the stone arch pressure lines, and calculated
					the size of arch and pier using mechanical and material strength theory, and built
					many flat arch bridges (Fig. 1.1), bringing the stone arch bridge design in Europe
					to a high level. While the emergence of flat arch bridge in Europe was 1000 years
					later than China's Sui Dynasty arch bridge (1765~1874), they were built on the basis
					of theory-derived scientific design.

					1.1.2 Progressive Era 

					The second period was the development of modern bridge from the British Industrial
					Revolution to the "Progressive Era" before the First World War (1765~1874), the metal
					material gradually replaced in natural stone and wood as the main building material
					of the bridge. 

					In 1779, the British engineer Abraham Darby III (1750~1790), designed and built the
					world's first cast-iron arch bridge, the Coalbrookdale bridge. It was 30.65 m-span
					(Fig. 1.2) and also known as the end of the ancient bridges from first of modern
					times. 

					Subsequently, the British engineer Thomas Telford (1757~1834), built more than a
					dozen larger span cast iron bridge, from which the most representative one was the
					Eaton Hall bridge (45.75 m-span) built in 1824. For the construction of multi-arch
					iron bridge, R. Stephenson (1803~1859), invented the Tied arch in 1849, this design
					spared the pier from the force generated by the arch and it established a new bridge
					type "Tied Arch Bridge". 




Fig. 1.2 English Coalbrookdale Bridge. 

					At the same time, inspired by the Chinese Journey novels, England in the second half
					of the 18th century began to try to build Modern Suspension Bridges. The span gradually
					increased from the initial 70 ft (21.34 m), in early 19th century. The British engineer
					John & William Smith brothers designed and built the Dryburgh Abbey Bridge in
					Scotland with the main span of 260 ft (79.25 m). The bridge successfully used wrought
					iron rod eye as main cable. Then, in Wales and England several wrought iron rod suspension
					bridges were also be built, including the Union Bridge with the main span of 136.86
					m built by the British engineer Sammel Brown in 1820. 

					In 1826, British engineer Welsh Telford built the Menai Straits Bridge (Fig. 1.3)
					with the main span of 176.6 m (580 ft). The bridge still used the shots with wrought
					iron rod as eye cable, using stone pier and stone bridge approach, wooden planks
					laid on bridge surface. Unfortunately, the bridge was destroyed in 1839, by wind
					and rebuilt in 1940. Since then, wrought iron rod suspension bridge gradually spread
					to Europe and the Americas, and many suspension bridge in the range of 100~340 m
					were built in Austria, Hungary, Russia, the United States and South America, Brazil
					became important achievements of European and American Iron Bridge construction in
					the 19th Century. 

					In 1850, the British engineer R. Stephenson built a giant (141 m-span) box girder
					bridge—the Britannia Bridge (Fig. 1.4) with pieces of wrought iron. Because wrought
					iron box girder bridge was too bulky. In 1857, German engineer H. Gerber under the
					inspiration of cabin truss built a six-span (131 m) bridge spanning multiple lattice
					trusses. In 1864, the first cantilever truss girder bridge with hanging hole was
					built, with sub-span of 23.9 m + 37.9 m + 23.9 m. This quiet cantilever truss system
					with hanging hole is named Gai Erbo truss, because of its simple and clear stress
					analysis, soon it became popular in Europe and America and was a major bridge type
					of large-span railway bridge. For instance the 1859, Britain's Albert Bridge has
					the main span of 138.6 m, the 1860 France's Lu Zhate viaduct has a span of 55.125
					m + 57.75 m + 49.125 m.

					1.1.3 Development Period I—The Born of Steel (1874~1945) 

					In 1874, the US replaced wrought iron with steel and built the first steel arch bridge,
					and opening a new era of large-span steel bridge construction. Since then, engineers
					have gradually abandoned cast iron and wrought iron and used steel for better performance,
					then bridge spans increased significantly. In 1890, the British built a 521.2 m-span
					Forth Bridge in England. The bridge used cantilever construction method and the pneumatic
					caisson on the basis, becoming a representative work
					of modern steel bridge (Fig. 1.5). 



Fig. 1.5 England Forth Bridge. 

					In 1909, the United States built the Queens bridge connecting New York Long Island
					and Manhattan Dayton across the East River, the bridge uses a cantilever truss, astride
					143.17 m + 360.4 m + 192.15 m + 300 m + 140 m, and for the first time used of low-alloy
					steel (nickel-containing 3%), with the strength increased 40% than steel, thus greatly
					reducing the weight of the bridge. The Quebec bridge, Canada, with 548.78 m main
					span of the bridge, after experiencing two Cantilever Erection accident (the first
					due to the web instability of bar, and the second time crushed casting connector
					of the Hanging hole) was culminated in the 1918, and set the maximum span as a cantilever
					truss bridge. 

					In 1869, moved to the United States, the German engineer Roebling family of three
					(father, son, daughter in law) began the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge (486
					m-main-span) in New York, and for the first used cold drawn steel wire rod eye-based
					cable in place of wrought iron. The bridge was completed in 1883, (Fig. 1.6), becoming
					a representing work of modern steel suspension bridge. 



Fig. 1.6 Brooklyn Bridge in New York. 


					1.1.4 Development Period II—Steel Suspension Bridge (1883~1945) 

					In early 20th century, the suspension bridge deflection theory established by Austrian
					engineer J. Melan in 1888, began to drew the attention of people. In 1912, Lithuanian
					engineer LS Moisseiff who had immigrated to New York was the first to designed with
					the deflection theory and built the Manhattan Bridge with success. Compared with
					the earlier Brooklyn Bridge (1883), and the Williamsburg Bridge (1903), and find
					out that the tower and main beams of Manhattan Bridge are more slender, that achieving
					better economic efficiency. 

					Since then, the deflection theory has been rapidly promoted, and between 1926 and
					1940, multiple large-span suspension bridge, designed by or consulted with, were
					built by using the deflection theory in the United States, the notable ones are:
					


						Benjamin Franklin Bridge (L = 533.75 m, 1926) 

						Ambassador Bridge (L = 564.3 m, 1929) 

						George Washington Bridge (L = 1067 m, 1931, Fig. 1.7) 

						Golden Gate Bridge (L = 1280 m, 1937, Fig. 1.8) 

						San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge (L = 704 m, 1937) 

						Bronx-Whitestone Bridge (L = 701 m, 1939) 


					Advantages of the deflection theory is that the use of gravity suspension stiffness
					reduced the bending stiffness of the bridge deck allows design engineers gradually
					abandoned bulky truss stiffening girder and used more economical plate girder bridge.
					With the reduced plate girder height and corresponding reduction of assumed bending
					moment, the safety of the bridge structure is ensured. 



Fig. 1.7 George Washington Bridge. 

					Built in 1940, Washington State Tacoma has a main span of 853 m and the width of
					the two-lane bridge is only 11.9 m, the height of plate girder stiffening beam 1.3
					m. Due to the negligence of the deck torsional stiffness in the design and the deterioration
					of the aerodynamic performance, the bridge was destroyed by wind 4 months after its
					completion (Fig. 1.9). Thereafter, the suspension bridge stiffening beam resumed
					its previous hollow truss design which has better aerodynamic performance and become
					the basic form of a suspension bridge before the secondary world war.

Fig. 1.9 Tacoma destroyed by wind. 

					1.1.5 Development Period III—Reinforced Concrete Bridge (1875~1945) 

					In 1875, French engineer Joseph Monier built the first reinforced concrete footbridge
					Chazelet Bridge, with a span of 13.8 m and 4.25 m in width, which is a T-shaped bridge,
					a new bridge type transformed from the ceiling of house and the pre-cursor of reinforced
					concrete bridge. In 1877, French engineer Hennebique built a Steel Concrete footbridge
					(16 m-span and 4.0 m width), in 1898, he designed and built a reinforced concrete
					arch bridge (52.46 m span)—Chàtellerault Bridge. 

					In 1890, Austrian engineer Milan (J. Melan) Push invented a construction method using
					stiffness frames as arch to cast reinforced concrete arch bridge, known as the Milan
					method which had increased the span of arch bridge to over 100 m. For the instance,
					Risorgimento Bridge, L = 100 m, 1911, Swiss Langwies Bridge, L= 100 m, 1914. The
					Swedish Sandö Bridge (Fig. 1.10), built in 1943, has 178.4 m in span and is a masterpiece
					of modern reinforced concrete arch bridge. 



Fig. 1.10 Sweden Sando bridge. 

					Back in 1886, Jackson was the first American engineer to be awarded a patent on pre-stress,
					in 1888, German engineer Doehring also obtained a patent in pre-stress application
					in the floor, but failed due to low value of steel pre-stress tendons as well as
					creep strain and shrink losses of concrete. Success was not seen until 1928, when
					French engineer Freyssinet invented the conical anchor using a high-strength steel
					and high-strength concrete (1939). After World War II due to shortage of steel, the
					need for repairing bridges destroyed in the war led the rapid development of the
					pre-stressed concrete technology. 

					1.1.6 Summary 

					Throughout the course of 300 year development of modern bridges: from the first phase
					(1660 to 1765), the theoretical foundation, to the second stage (1765~1874), cast
					iron bridge, (wrought) iron truss bridge and eye rod suspension, and the third phase
					(1874~1945), of steel (steel truss bridge, steel arch bridge and steel suspension
					bridge) and the subsequent emergence of reinforced concrete bridge. It can be said
					that the mainstream of modern bridge is steel bridge, including many railway bridges
					and urban bridge, with the representing landmark bridges being the Coalbrookdale
					iron bridge, Scotland Forth steel truss bridge, steel suspension bridge built in
					Brooklyn, New York, in the 1930s, and the representing modern bridges of the highest

					1.2 A BRIEF HISTORY OF MODERN BRIDGE (1945~2008) 

					In about 300 years from the mid-17th century to the mid-20th century, civil engineering
					completed evolution from the initial "foundation period" (1660~1765), to the "Progressive
					Era" (1765~1900), symbolised by the British Industrial Revolution, as well as the
					pre- and post-World War I period including the 30 years of great development or "Mature
					Period" (1900 to 1945), and started modern civil engineering characterised by the
					use of computer and IT technologies, corresponding to the development of modern bridge
					engineering. 

					After the Second World War, the world has entered a relatively peaceful reconstruction
					era. After a period of post-war recovery, Europe and the United States started to
					implement highway construction and urbanization plans in the 1950s, and emerged many
					representing works of innovative technology for modern bridge engineering. Among
					them, the pre-stressing technology and related construction methods, the revival
					of cable-stayed bridge and the invention of streamline flat steel box girder bridge,
					invented and created by famous engineers and scholars from France, Germany and the
					United Kingdom respectively, are three most important landmark achievements in post-war
					modern bridge engineering, these achievements greatly promoted the rapid advancement
					of modern bridge engineering.

					1.2.5 Innovation Theory and Analytical Methods 

1. Computer Technology and Finite Element Analysis Theory 

					The world's first computer "Aini A G" (ENIAC) (Fig. 1.75) was born in 1946, the world's
					first PC arrived in 1981, the application of computer greatly promoted the progress
					of human civilization in 1943. Courant was the first who introduced the concept of
					unit; from 1945 to 1955, Argyris development the Structural Matrix Analysis; in 1956,
					Clough introduced the idea of structural matrix analysis into elasticity analysis
					and was the first to propose the "FEM" in the 1960s, which was gradually developed
					and perfected in the 1960s. A large number of mathematicians, mechanics and engineers
					had made important contributions in this area.

2. Bridge Design Analysis Software 

					Development of the theory of finite element analysis and computer technology laid
					the foundation for the development of design and analysis software, and a number
					of large commercial software gradually emerged in the 1970s (Table 1.1), and the
					finite element analysis started its application in bridge design.

3. Seismic Theory 

					Early 20th century, the Great Kanto Earthquake of San Francisco and two disasters
					caused emphasis on structural anti-seismic research. Researches basic theory in earthquake,
					strong motion records, model test, analysis theory had been conducted in the engineering
					fields. Structural anti-seismic research started its rapid development period after
					1940. In 1943, Biot published accelerated response spectrum deducted from actual
					seismic records; from 1950s to 1970s, scholars represented by Housner, Newmark and
					Clough of the United States and Muto of Japan laid the foundation of modern response
					spectrum anti-seismic theory and carried out research on the dynamic response process
					of structural elastics and inelastic analysis; in the 1970s, Newmark, Park, Paulay
					put forward the concept of anti-seismic design ductility; in the mid-1990s, scholars
					from the United States and Japan proposed a performance-based anti-seismic design
					method. 

4. Wind-proof Theory 

					The wind destruction incidence of the Tacoma suspension bridge in 1940, which occurred
					at low wind speeds, triggered the beginning of comprehensive study of wind. 

					Induced vibration and aeroelastic prelude theory concerning long-span bridge in the
					engineering field, and T. Von Karman and others of the USA conducted bridge model
					wind tunnel tests. 

					Wind Theory Studied progressed and was perfected since the 1960s. Davenport of Canada
					proposed statistical mathematics approach in wind engineering research, solving creatively
					the problem of random buffeting and expressing the wind effect as an equivalent form
					of wind loads; Scanlan of the USA formed the bridge flutter theory and the shaking
					vibration theory; in the 1990s computed fluid dynamics made a significant progress
					in fluid dynamics, which is now able to solve the uniform flow, simple form, low
					Reynolds number numerical simulation computational problems. 

5. Non-linear and Stability Theory 

					In the end of the 19th century, scientists discovered that the linear theory of solid
					mechanics was not applicable in many cases and began the study of non-linear mechanical
					problems. In 1888, Melan of Austria was the first to propos deflection theory and
					applied it to suspension cable analysis; in mid-20th century, the theoretical foundation
					of non-linear mechanics was Laid; in 1959, Newmark first proposed for solving non-linear
					dynamic problem using the Newmark-method; in early 1960s, Turner, Brotton and others
					began to publish research results solving problems concerning large displacement
					and initial stress. In late 1960s, the combination of finite element method with
					the computer gradually helped solve non-linear problems in engineering. 

					On stability, Euler (L. Eular) in 1744 put forward the famous bar stable formula;
					Engesser and Karman of Canada proposed the tangent modulus theory and fold. 

					Modulus operator theory respectively, based on a large number of observation that
					long lever exceeded the elastic limit before buckling. Since the 1980s, the space
					elastoplastic stability theory was gradually established based on a computer analysis.
					

6. Health Monitoring and Vibration Control Theory 

					In 1969, the paper by Lifshitz and Rotem were regarded as the first one illustrating
					the dynamic response of structural health monitoring and evaluation modern structural
					health monitoring concept; in 1987, Britain laid sensors on the 522 m three-span
					continuous steel box girder bridge Foyle to monitor the operational phase of the
					bridge under wind loads and vibration of the vehicle main beam deflection and strain
					response, the system is one of the first and complete health monitoring system ever
					installed. 

					In the 1960s, linear systems theory and the progress of modern control theory laid
					a theoretical foundation for the structure of the active vibration control; in 1972
					Yao Zhiping proposed the concept of civil engineering structural vibration control
					by combining with modern control theory and created a new phase of the study in structural
					vibration; in 1973 The Mass Damper (TMD) passive control style device was first installed
					on the CN Tower in Toronto, Canada; in 1989 Active Mass Damper (AMD) was first used
					in the Kyobashi building in Tokyo, Japan. Structure control evolved from passive
					control and active control theoretical research, and applied research phase of active
					control devices. 

7. Coupled Vibration and Ship Collision Theory 

					In early 20th century, Kirilov, Timoshenko, et al., carried out beam dynamic response
					studies regarding on constant force on the bridge, later A. Schalenkamp, Inglis,
					Bigggs et al., further studied the dynamic response of the bridge moving-mass and
					spring-mass model of the bridge, these studies were considered classical Axle System
					Vibration theory. After the 1960s, the gradual emergence of a wide range of applications
					and computer finite element theory, as well as the construction of high-speed railway
					in some countries in Western Europe, made the coupled vibration theory and test progressed
					rapidly, and modern computing Axle vibration model more refined, and the theoretical
					research advanced from plane to space, dynamic interaction and coupling relationship
					between axle to more in-depth research, analysis of the bridge-girder bridge advanced
					from bridge in the past to arch bridge, suspension bridge and other complex type.
					Research results have been applied to the design of high-speed railway bridges, as
					well as the formulation of the relevant provisions of the bridge specification. 

					System research on vessel-bridge collision problem began in the 1980s, IABSE, AASHTO,
					Eurocode and other organizations or specification had developed a special design
					specifications or guidelines, a wide range of anti-collision facilities had also
					been implemented in more than a dozen large bridges, domestic or foreign. However,
					research in this area is not yet ripe, and the focus of research is on the aspects
					of design, protection policies, ship collision force calculation and design of protective
					equipment. 

8. Durability Analysis Theory 

					In 1960s to 1970s, the durability problem of concrete were found, and became the
					problem of the world. Holland in 1993, defined the durability as the following: under
					normal maintenance conditions, the use and the performance of material and structure
					does not exhibit a major change after a period of carrying capacity. It is generally
					defined in China as: the structure meets safety, functionality and appearance requirements
					by design requirements in the lifetime without reinforcement need or extra expenses.
					In recent years, the durability studies in materials research mainly concentrated
					in the corrosion problems due to carbonation of concrete and steel in the atmosphere
					in terms of the main components, and on the performance of corroded reinforced concrete
					parts in terms of the components, and research methods such as survey and assessment
					in terms of structure. Research in this area is focused on durability analysis using
					computer numerical simulation system, durability test basis, lifespan-based concrete
					aspects of bridge design. 

					1.2.6 Summary 

					Reviewing the 60 years of modern engineering development, many new bridge systems,
					new structures, new materials, new construction methods as well as the creation and
					invention of new theories and methods of analysis have made modern engineering completely
					different from the early modern engineering: the value of modern bridge engineering
					resides in the spirit of innovation. With the continuous upgrading of the emergence
					of new labour law and the corresponding construction equipment, bridge construction
					is also increasingly accurate, lightweight, automatic control, less reliance on manual
					operations, and the quality of the project better and more durable, continuously
					pushing the development of high performance materials. It can be said that the quality
					and durability of modern bridge engineering come from equipment innovation. Bridge
					engineer must strengthen quality concept, utilising advanced equipment to control
					and guarantee the quality, greatly reducing the reliance on manpower. 

					Bridge engineer should also be continue to improve the aesthetic attainment, master
					the method of aesthetics design, promote cooperation with architects, design and
					create beautiful bridges to meet people's aesthetic requirements of the bridge. Beautiful
					bridges do not rely on more money, but on balance and harmony of the most reasonable
					performance, most economical and most convenient structure construction.

					1.3 ACHIEVEMENTS AND SHORTCOMINGS OF CHINA BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (1978-2008) 

					1.3.1 Introduction 

					Brilliant achievements of ancient Chinese bridge had played an important role in
					the history of world bridge development, as recognised by the world. The 18th century
					British Industrial Revolution created the modern science and technology, empowering
					Europe and the United States arrive to a new era of modern engineering. 

					Opium war in the mid-1800s, resulted the already underdeveloped China beccoming a
					semi-colonial semi-closed country under imperialist aggression. Since then, the imperialist
					powers plundered the resources of China's railway construction, the excavation of
					the mine, in the Jin-Pu, Ping-Han railway built by foreign engineers the Yellow River
					Bridge, in the early years of forced concessions (such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Ningbo,
					etc.) Despite the construction of a number of bridges, the Yangtze River remained
					a natural moat. 

					After the 1912, Revolution, Sun Yat-sen had planned transportation construction in
					China's "Founding outline" in successive years but failed to materialise due to Warlord
					and long-term civil war. The construction of Hangzhou Qiantang River Bridge started
					in 1935, and was the first modern steel bridge design by a Chinese engineering, in
					just 30 months, in September 1937, it was inaugurated, the bridge is a Chinese History
					Monument. 

					After the founding of new China, with the rise of the national economy, and transportation
					infrastructure and bridge construction started booming. In a first five-year plan
					to start building the first bridge of the Yangtze River — Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge,
					with the help of the former Soviet Union, using a new type of Column base and advanced
					manufacturing and erection steel beam techniques. In 1957, the 9-hole 128 m with
					a total length of 1155.5 m Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was completed, laying the foundation
					for the development of modern large-span steel bridge and deep water foundation project.
					In 1968, Yangtze River Nanjing Bridge was design and constructed by our engineers.
					Compared with the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge span increased
					to 160 m, using a continuous steel truss bridge taken off the stiffening of the third
					chord. Because of the complex geological conditions on the bridge site, the bridge
					is a milestone in the construction of the Yangtze river bridge. 

					In the 1960s, due to the impact of three years of natural disasters, financial and
					steel are very scarce. China provincial highway departments had to develop low cost,
					less steel, with a variety of human resources, arch became popular during this period.
					In 1961, Yunnan Changhong broke the 100 m span stone arch bridge; Wuxi originated
					hyperbolic arch bridge; in 1968 the Henan bridge with a 150 m main span is to the
					best of this Large span type. At the same time, pre-stressed concrete technology
					also began to be used from the railway bridge to the road bridge, and 1964 saw the
					completion of the first pre-stressed concrete T-strap hanging hole rigid frame bridge
					with a main span of 50 m Henan—Five Ling Wei River Bridge. 

					Because of problems in curved arch bridge built on the soft soil, in early 1970s
					Lightweight construction of the reinforced concrete arch truss bridge suitable on
					soft ground was created, with the representing 75 m Zhejiang Ninghai bridge in 1976,
					and the 9 hole 50 m Henan Song County bridge. Meanwhile, in the Yunnan, Guangxi,
					Guizhou, Sichuan, south-west mountainous areas, the development of easy non-support
					construction of reinforced concrete box arch bridge were built, e.g., the 100 m Yibin,
					Sichuan Minjiang River Bridge (1973), the 116 m Yunnan Red Bridge (1974) and the
					105 m Guangxi Laibin Bridge (1978). 

					In 1972, due to the need to develop oil fields the Shandong Yellow River Highway
					Bridge is relatively rare steel bridge in China. Its main bridge is a 4-hole 112
					m continuous steel truss bridge approach using porous 33 m pre-stressed concrete
					beams. Bored piles buried deep at a record 107 m. The bridge plays an important role
					in the development of China Steel Bridges. 

					Western technology of cable-stayed bridge was introduced to China in the late 1960s,
					Shanghai and Chongqing research department began to build this new bridge, and in
					1975 built the 54 m Shanghai new five bridge and 75.8 m Yunyang Tang River bridge
					in Sichuan. The completion of these two pioneer bridge is the harbinger of cable-stayed
					bridge in the 1980s, in China. In 1980, the 174 m largest domestic span pre-stressed
					concrete T-rigid frame bridge opened to traffic. 

					1.3.2 Bridges the Rise of China in the 1980s 

					After the smashing of the "Gang of Four", China has entered a new period of reform
					and opening up, bridge construction also ushered in a golden age. 

					In 1981, the first railway pre-stressed concrete cable-stayed bridge with a main
					span of 96 m, Guangxi Laibin red water river bridge was opened to traffic. 

					In 1981, at the National Conference held in Jinan experience on the construction
					of pre-stressed concrete cable-stayed bridge was reviewed. In 1982, the 220 m of
					Jinan Yellow River Bridge opened to traffic, it symbolises cable-stayed bridge in
					the country rapid growth in China. 

					In 1982, the world's largest rail span Slant Leg Rigid Frame — 176 m Shaanxi Ankang
					railway bridge in the country was completed, a major achievement of the railway bridge
					construction achieved in China. 

					In the early 1980s, the Guangdong Province has attracted national attention around
					the bridge sector counterparts. To solve the Pearl Delta traffic barriers, many bridges
					were built. Among them, the 1984-90 m Rongqi bridge, which for the first time used
					5000 kN floating crane overall erection of pre-fabricated beams and the simple support
					design. In 1988, Guangdong Panyu Luoxi Bridge of 180 m main span was built as prestressed
					concrete continuous rigid frame bridge. This is China's large-span pre-stressed concrete
					beam bridge construction. 

					For the development needs of the construction of Shandong oilfield, China's first
					steel-tower cable-stayed bridge deck and anisotropy type bridge, 288 m long Dongying
					Yellow River Bridge was opened to traffic in 1987, the bridge's cables used a New
					Generation of hot extrusion PE Parallel to the cable casing system (NWPS). In 1988,
					the 110 m off the coast of Guangdong Jiangmen bridge opened to traffic, it is the
					first short-term use of precast pre-stressed concrete cantilever erection of advanced
					construction of continuous beam bridge. 

					Throughout the 1980s, the construction of cable-stayed bridge thrived in the country
					with the follows worth mentioning: 


						Guangdong Nanhai Jiujiang Bridge (1988), the main span 160 m, using floating cranes
						assembled piecemeal cantilever construction. 

						Chongqing Shimen Bridge (1988), the main span 230 m, was the longest cable-stayed
						bridge cantilever construction. 

						Guangzhou Haiyin Bridge (1988), the main span 175 m, the bridge width of 35 m, was
						the widest single cable plane cable-stayed bridge. 

						Long Xiangjiang Jiangbei Bridge (1980), the main span 210 m, the first time the use
						of light hanging basket full section once before fulcrum suspended casting construction
						technology. 


					1.3.3 1990s China Bridge Takeoff 

					After entering the 1990s, due to the rapid development of the national economy development
					and construction of Shanghai Pudong, bridge construction also expanded Shanghai Nanpu
					Bridge construction is an important opportunity, Shanghai Municipal House has invited
					Japanese companies to participate in the pre-design work. Upon the appeal from a
					professor at Tongji University in Shanghai, the then CPPCC Chairman of Shanghai Comrade
					Jiang Zemin decided to entrust Shanghai Nanpu Bridge to the cooperation in design
					and construction domestically, a self-building opportunities for scientific and technological
					progress achieved through practice. Of course, this is also a challenge as the state
					bridge sector realised the leap from the construction of more than 200 m span cable-stayed
					bridge to a main span of 423 m combination of cable-stayed bridge girder bridge.
					Shanghai Nanpu Bridge opened to traffic in 1991, and immediately after another span
					cable-stayed bridge, Shanghai Yangpu Bridge with main span of 602 m was erected in
					1993. The successful construction of two cable-stayed bridges was greatly encouraged
					by the self-construction of the bridge counterparts large-span bridges of confidence
					and enthusiasm, setting off a national upsurge large-scale construction of the bridge
					in the 1990s. 

					Cable-stayed bridge over 400 m include: 


						Hubei Yun County Hanjiang River Bridge, the main span of 414 m, 1993. 

						The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the main span of 400 m, 1995. 

						Tongling Yangtze River Bridge, the main span of 432 m, 1995. 

						Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge, the main span of 444 m, 1995. 

						Shanghai Xuputaiqiao main span of 590 m, 1997. 

						Queshi Bridge, the main span of 518 m, 1998. 


					The successful construction of cable-stayed bridges encouraged China to build a bridge
					of modern suspension bridge. The 452 m of Shantou Bay Bridge is the first attempt,
					due to the more serious local air-sea corrosion, pre-stressed coagulation soil stiffening
					beams were used. Each main cable contains 110 shares of steel wires of 91 root 5
					mm, with outside diameter up to 56 cm. The bridge was built in 1994. 

					Guangdong Province in the construction of the Pearl River Expressway (Guangzhou-Shenzhen,
					Guangzhou-Zhuhai) had also begun planning the construction of Humen Bridge across
					the Pearl River. Several British experts were invited to help in bridge construction.
					When Professor Li Guohao lettered to the governor of Guangdong Province, Comrade
					Ye, strongly appealing for independent construction, and in return of Hong Kong on
					the eve of victory in 1997, built a Humen Pearl River Bridge with a main span of
					888 m. This suspension bridge, Auxiliary Channel 270 m pre-stressed concrete continuous
					rigid frame bridge is another bridge in Chinese Milestone. 

					In 1990s construction of the bridge has also made important progress. Since the steel
					supply has gradually abundant, application of steel concrete arch was introduced
					in China. This composite structure with easy installation and construction, the materials
					used by the reasonable economy, the ability to carry a big advantage. In 1990 Sichuan
					wangcang built the first 115 m main span concrete arch pipe. Later, in the decade
					built dozens of such bridge, such as Guangdong three main span of 200 m main span
					of 270 m Shanxi Bridge and three in Guangxi Shore Bridge. 

					At the same time, bridge using the strength of the skeleton of reinforced concrete
					box arch has made development. Built in the late 1980s, the 200 m of Chongqing Fuling
					Wujiang River Bridge and the 240 m Sichuan Yibin Jinsha River bridge marched into
					a new type of steel pipe mixed Concrete arch skeleton, alike the 313 m Yongning Yongjiang
					Bridge. Using this technology the world's longest span concrete arch with main span
					of 420 m, the Wanxian Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge, was built, another Monumental.
					

					In 1994, preparations for the long Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge was started, cohesion
					of the Chinese people's dream of several generations of the bridge, the first Chinese
					long span suspension bridge over 1000 m designed by the Chinese people. The North
					Shore has a huge caisson foundation anchorage and coagulation Dobashi tower construction
					company independently by China, the upper structure construction due to funding problems
					by the British company's total contracting actually subcontract completed by Chinese
					companies. The 1385 m main span of Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge opened to traffic
					in 1999, marking China with its bridge construction scale and speed of development
					as well as a variety of bridge-span charts at the forefront of the outstanding achievements
					in the world. 

					It should be noted that before the reform and opening up, China bridge construction,
					particularly the large steel bridge construction was carried out by the Ministry
					of Railways Bridge Engineering Bureau. Chinese road level is not high, many major
					rivers still rely ferry connections. After 20 years of efforts, the Chinese public
					road transportation construction team has to grow up quickly, designed and built
					a bridge across the Yangtze river and its many deep water foundation. It can be said,
					in China's contribution to the bridge construction, the provincial Ministry of Transportation
					and Communications Department of the design and construction team have occupied a
					very important position. 

					1.3.4 China Bridge at the Beginning of the 21st Century 

					Chinese modern bridge made the last 20 years of the 20th century has made progress
					and achievement, and ready to build more ambitious Cross River Bridge Project. After
					the 1980s, "to learn and catch up" and 1990's "track and improve the" two stages
					of development, China bridge community should enter a "innovative and go beyond"
					the new era in the early 2000s, through innovative design and construction achieve
					development in order to improve international competitiveness of Chinese bridge.
					

1. Large-span Cable-stayed Bridge and a Suspension Bridge Construction 

					In 2000, China has built a main span of 618 m Wuhan white sandbar and the 312 m main
					span rail-cum cable-stayed bridge — Wuhu Yangtze River Bridge, the end of the bridge
					construction in the 20th century. Cable-stayed bridge has become the preferred bridge
					type for Yangtze River Bridge in Hubei, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. Many cable-stayed
					bridge built simultaneously, on the Yangtze River. In planning Run Yang Yangtze River
					Highway Bridge, there are concerns among bridge engineers for China's large span
					cable-stayed bridge over 800 m. On the completion of the main span of 1385 m Jiangyin
					Yangtze River Bridge in 1999, on the decision to adopt a main span of 1490 m and
					greater span suspension bridge. In the 21st century, requires the construction of
					Stonecutters Bridge in Hong Kong, the ultra-km cable-stayed bridge, inspired by Chinese
					community participation in the design of bridge competition in the process also improves
					the impact of ultra-km cable-stayed bridge in confidence. Thus, in previous work
					Su Tong Bridge, tried using 1088 m main span cable-stayed bridge program, in order
					to avoid the difficulties suspension deep-water anchorage foundation construction.
					

(a) Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (Fig. 1.101) 

					Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is the longest span cable-stayed bridge in China. Maximum
					span of the high tower, the longest cable and maximum width of the bridge is considered
					to be a huge challenge. If breaking scale did not meet applicable limits of existing
					technology, overcoming the obstacles set by technological innovation can be achieved
					through careful construction practice can obtain high-quality results. 

					Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Tower Pier using "composite foundation", that the double-wall
					steel cofferdam, caps and bored pile group consisting of whole resistance ship collision
					force, in fact, the use of excessively large span has greatly reduced the chances
					of ship collision. Since the bridge's small navigational clearance, compared with
					the first parallel Japanese Tatara Bridge tower, tower above the bridge deck height
					and total height ratio is too small, resulting in "Short leg" effect, the impact
					of the tower's appearance. 

					Long cables in full bridge closure after the emergence of a strong rain vibration,
					plus an interim decision on the cable after the suppression of the spiral wound vibration,
					this experience later provided an important basis for direct production of finished
					cable with spiral strips (Fig. 1.102). 



Fig. 1.101 Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. 



Fig. 1.102 Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Helix Cable. 

					Long cantilever construction control in the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, the use
					of more advanced "neural network control technology" in cable force and elevation
					of dual control, achieved a higher closure accuracy. Orthotropic steel box girder
					bridge deck construction site with steel panels welded joints and U-shaped longitudinal
					ribs bolted form, is a new attempt and has promotional value. Finally, the steel
					deck pavement does not solve the problem long-term. Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge
					has introduced American epoxy asphalt concrete pavement technology through mechanical
					analysis and experimental research, improvements and equipment research and development
					to achieve a localisation formulations, excellent quality, and to fill the gap. After
					years of testing in summer and winter seasons, within the constraints of overloaded
					vehicles in good running condition of the bridge, has been applied in more than a
					dozen subsequent bridge. 

(b) Yangzhou Yangtze River Highway Bridge (Fig. 1.103) 

					When the main span of 1490 m of South Branch Runyang Yangtze River Highway Bridge
					was completed, it was the largest suspension bridge in China. In Runyang Yangtze
					River Highway Bridge construction, little difficulty superstructure on the basis
					of experience in building Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge, the main Challenges from
					infrastructure projects. The 50 m deep north anchorage using embedded rock underground
					continuous wall (Fig. 1.104). Although underground continuous wall at the construction
					site is a mature technology, but for the huge plane size is 69 m × 50 m bridge foundation
					remains a challenge. Construction side of the use of information technology in construction
					methods, a variety of information and continuous wall surrounding soil for real-time
					monitoring control and forward and inverse analysis to ensure that the basic construction
					of fast and safe. 



Fig. 1.103 Runyang Yangtze River Highway Bridge. 



Fig. 1.104 Runyang Yangtze River Highway Bridge underground continuous wall. North
						Anchorage (Elevation units: m; size unit: cm) 

					Similarly, south anchorage freezing method technique is the traditional construction
					technique for mine shaft, but on the basis of the large size of bridges its use is
					a bold initiative with a huge risk. Construction by eliminating the danger, and finally
					succeeded. Bridge Tower Construction employed foreign template technology, which
					greatly improves the appearance and internal quality concrete progress has been made.
					As the The deck height is small, although the lateral wind loads can be reduced,
					also reduced the torsional rigidity and thus cannot meet the stability requirements.
					Construction of the first time the central buckle and central stabilising plate measures
					to solve this problem (Fig. 1.105). 

					Bridge main cable corrosion was first introduced in Japan in dry air de-humidification,
					as a new technologies. In addition, the anchorage, foundation, tower, piers and and
					other concrete box girder bridge approach works have adopted the technique of fly
					ash added to improve the durability of the bridge is expected to ensure a lifespan
					of 100 years. 

(c) Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (Fig. 1.106) 

					Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge has a chevron-shaped arc of the new tower. It should
					be acknowledged that this is inspired from the Stonecutters Bridge, the second top
					design in the Hong Kong international bridge competition. In order to speed up the
					construction speed, the bridge over the tower with steel was pre-manufactured, and
					brought down tower junction structure puzzle for steel-concrete segments. Eventually,
					opening on the the steel tower was opted and in-situ concrete and reinforced through
					the formation of PBL shear key was used as the main component load transfer (Fig.
					1.107). After wind tunnel tests, rectangular-section steel tower cutaway was the
					best possible treatment to suppress the vibration of galloping and vortex. We can
					say that the south Beijing Tower Bridge is a creative design in steel bridge. 

					Tower located at the depth of more than 40 m, imposing a greater risk to the traditional
					steel boxed construction, through careful organisation of the construction unit the
					foundation construction was completed successfully. High steel tower 215 m, it's
					the introduction of a highly efficient air installation crane France, the smooth
					realisation of the seal top. Although the steel tower costs more than the average
					cost of the concrete tower, but won the construction speed in return.

(d) Su Tong Bridge (Fig. 1.108) 

					Su Tong Bridge (hereinafter referred to as Su Tong Bridge) is China's first cable-stayed
					bridge over 1000 m. In the wide Yangtze River Downstream waters, both to meet the
					100000t seagoing vessel's navigation requirements, and to avoid the construction
					of water anchorage difficulties, it is necessary to adopt ultra large-span cable-stayed
					bridge. 



Fig. 1.108 Su Tong Bridge Full-Bridge. 

					The first is the deep water tower pier foundation. By comparison, it was decided
					to adopt large-scale construction grasp the larger group pile foundation. The 131
					drilled shaft, 114 to 117 m long from 2.5 m to 2.8 m large diameter bored piles requires
					a lot of caps, steel boxed quality reaches 6000t, need to overcome many problems.
					Meanwhile, in order to prevent future erosion threatening the foundation, there was
					need for permanent erosion protection. 

					Wind-proof and anti-seismic design was the center of the design phase of the Su Tong
					Yangtze River Bridge, focusing on issues considered, after the election and more
					than the program, using a combination of rigid and fluid viscous limit longitudinal
					restraint device, the introduction of American Taylor's advanced liquid viscous dampers,
					and specially designed for the bridge with a limit (maximum limit force 10000 kN,
					maximum limit ± 750 mm) king damper so that strong winds and a strong earthquake,
					the bridge will not lead to large displacements occurred adversely affected by the
					force of the pylon, and endanger joints become span bridges important protection
					systems to ensure the safety of the bridge tower. 

					Su Tong Bridge deck is wide, and the use of better stability of the oblique cable
					plane layout makes wind stability guaranteed. In order to reduce wind load and lateral
					displacement of the deck small cable while preventing cable stormy wind-induced vibration
					and other vibration, Su Tong Bridge uses Japan's advanced surface treatment technology
					with pits, as well as the cable side of the damper device. Meanwhile, large-scale
					detailed high reynolds wind tunnel tests and studies to avoid adverse deck vibration.
					

					Installation of the 300 m high bridge tower construction and advanced overhead steel
					anchor box demanded efficient, safe, and secure the crane. Su Tong asked French bridge
					crane company for advanced reconstruction and transformation, making it suited for
					Su Tong Bridge. It also introduced advanced equipment and climbing formwork concrete
					pumping equipment. The 1990s advanced equipment to ensure that the bridge Tower's
					safe, efficient, fast construction, to ensure the completion of the bridge towers
					quality. 

					The construction of steel box girder bridge over 1000 m is a challenge. Because Su
					Tong Bridge Deck Normandy Bridge and Japan than in France Tatara Bridge should be
					wide, although the cantilever length increases, but instead a small wide-span ratio,
					so that the lateral stiffness of the construction phase is relatively large, and
					the side to wind-induced vibration is reduced, which is more advantageous. In order
					to control the Su Tong Bridge Construction catch the world's advanced level, construction
					workers using the "precise geometry control" advanced technology, command and construction
					general contractors invited to the British and Danish company. COWI company flourished
					as a consultant unit, with their advanced software to assist in the control, and
					achieved good results. In order to ensure the efficiency and accuracy of assembly,
					the introduction of the British Door Lang Company (DL Tech) advanced bridge crane,
					make up more than 500 meters cantilever erection smooth closure. 

					In addition, the non-navigation arch of Su Tong Bridge for the first time uses the
					international advanced pre-stressed pre-cast segments and in vitro with cable technology,
					through the success of the practice, it has made significant progress, catch up with
					the world advanced level, became the pioneer in prestressed concrete continuous beam
					bridge. The demonstration project (Fig. 1.109). 

					It can be said, Su Tong Bridge headquarters insisted independent construction, but
					does not exclude the developed countries to assist, so that bridge the technology
					used to achieve the international standard of the 1990s, and ensure the quality of
					the project to improve the efficiency, Made a lot of progress, has also been praised
					by foreign counterparts.

					Zhoushan island project in Xihoumen bridge with a main span 1650 m split three-span
					continuous box girder bridge. Xihoumen main navigation road water depth of 80 m,
					and the wind and waves, is the first international one officially started construction,
					the use of split large-span suspension bridge, in order to ensure the wind-proof
					stability of the bridge.

					Xihoumen Bridge's main cable used ultra high strength steel, developed by Shanghai
					Baosteel, with reduced diameter of the main cable and the weight and thus saving
					rope clip accessories, anchorage size and lower cost base, reached the advanced level.
					Main cable construction used for the first time the Helicopter pilot rope traction
					over the sea, avoiding the risk of traditional methods may bring. 

					Split deck design, manufacture and installation is the first attempt, the international
					community also can learn from the lack of experience in bridge hair exhibition in
					the history of the landmark (Fig. 1.111).

2. The Construction of Large-span Steel Arch Bridge 

					China's steel arch bridge construction had long been lagging behind the Western countries.
					In the 1950s, Chinese steel arch bridge spanned no more than Hundred meters, such
					as the Jianghan bridge helped by the former Soviet Union in 1955, with a main span
					of the deck 87.37 m Beam Arch. Chengdu-Kunming railway built in 1966, to welcome
					water river bridge with a main span of 112 m Sophie just Truss Arch Combination.
					

					After the reform and opening up, Sichuan Province built the first span of 115 m of
					concrete pipe Tied Arch — wangcang East River bridge. This good economic indicators,
					the construction of the bridge-fast and easy to promote in the country, built in
					2000, Guangzhou Yajisha main span has reached the 360 m, span. 

					In the early 2000s, China began to try to build modern steel arch bridge with a span
					about 500 m, in order to change the backwardness aspect of the Chinese steel arch
					Bridge. 

(a) Lupu Bridge (Fig. 1.112) 

					Main span of 550 m of the Lupu Bridge is a world record-span steel arch bridge. Arch
					bridge spanning over a 300 m generally use hanging erection to reduce the arch truss
					and to decrease assembly weight, Lupu Bridge boldly used sloping arch box to obtain
					"basket handle arch" aesthetic styling. Roll stability from the analysis, the surface
					can be obtained in parallel arch enough to stabilise the security system, and in
					the arch sloping surface quality up to 480t of Ribs segments hanging fight, is indeed
					a huge challenge. Lupu Bridge Temporary work units using giant cranes and buckle
					cable systems, and through a lot of weights measures, and the introduction of foreign
					lifting equipment to overcome the difficulties and Ribs to closure. Shanghai's large-span
					arch bridge on soft soil must be built strong balance Tied Arch Thrust. There are
					several systems in the construction to be converted and temporarily transferred to
					buckle cable tension level. Construction control of the whole process should be a
					very distinctive creative work (Fig. 1.113).

Fig. 1.113 Lupu Bridge construction plans. 

					Arch Rib is a bluff body section, although the arch aerodynamic stability is very
					safe, but in a state of uniform flow wind tunnel test a strong vortex vibration rib
					was observed. While large urban turbulence intensity may inhibit the occurrence of
					vortex vibration, a hydrodynamic calculation method works best without affecting
					the aesthetics of "isolation membrane" pneumatic vibration suppression measures at
					a pre-set upper rib. The insulating film connecting device (Fig. 1.114), as the need
					to install the future. Moreover, in the vault at the sightseeing platform has played
					a part in the vortex vibration inhibition. 

					After the completion of the bridge and from the effects of perspective, although
					it took some more steel and construction costs and the economic indicators are not
					good, it proved box arch over 500 m is feasible. Compared with the classical truss
					arch, box-shaped rib arch may be more modern.

(b) Caiyuanba Bridge (Fig. 1.115) 

					Caiyuanba Highway Bridge is an upper and lower dual arch of urban rail transit designed
					By Chongqing Jiaotong Research and Design Institute and Tung-Yen Lin International
					companies design consortium, a Rigid steel-concrete composite Tied Arch of the new
					bridge system. 

					Caiyuanba is a five cross-symmetrical arrangement consisting of a total length of
					800 m including 420 m, 112 m and 88 m side spans. Main arch is inclined basket arch
					bridge following the use of concrete arch rib, compared with steel box deck above
					arch. Both the deck at the butt level and the formation of a hybrid structure. Orthotropic
					bridge deck using steel joist, the upper six-lane highway, the lower two-lane urban
					rail transportation. 

					The Caiyuanba has a longitudinal separation system, which is divided into the cross
					tie rod and tie rod side span (Fig. 1.116), and anchorage independence in order to
					carry out the internal forces and linear adjustment and control. 



Fig. 1.116 Separate Tied arrangement (A pair of symmetrical pre-stressed concrete
						continuous rigid frame + Tied hogging). 

					In terms of structural design, construction details Caiyuanba adopted many optimisation,
					such as steel box arch ribs and anchor construction boom, the department of 7 strand
					wire rod in vitro cable with PE jacket, Y-shaped rigid frame and mid-span the use
					of separate connecting Tied Tied shear key construction, steel box arch rib concrete
					rigid frame with a Y-shaped steel-concrete joint structure of PBL, as well as connecting
					structure side span joists and between the Y-shaped rigid frame and so on. 

					Caiyuanba using a combination of structure, saving 13,000~15,000t of steel. Construction
					used the traditional day of hanging, hanging buckle cable and hybrid programs to
					fight portion of the stent, and a separate tied and active control technology for
					large-span arch bridge construction offers many worthwhile lessons learned. 

(c) Chaotianmen Bridge (Fig. 1.117) 

					Chaotianmen bridge located in the southeast end of the peninsula, famous pier Chaotianmen
					about 1.3 km downstream, was the main site of the six lines radiating outward things
					to fast main road, connecting the east Nan'an District, Chongqing and Guizhou Expressway
					Huangjuezhen Bay Interchange. 
The main span of the bridge is a record of 552 m, in
					the traditional continuous steel truss tied arch bridge. The upper deck of a double
					two-way six lanes and sidewalks on both sides, the total deck width 36 m; lower middle
					lane urban rail lines are arranged on both sides of each set aside a spare driveway.

					Span arrangement for the 190 m + 552 m + 190 m. Tied plane coincides with the plane
					of the main arch truss, force a clear, simple structure, easy construction. The bridge
					was opened to traffic at the end of 2007, not only to improve the traffic situation
					in the main city, has become the fast-track connection YuBeiOu, Jiangbei district
					and the South Bank area, and has important implications for social and economic development
					of Chongqing. 

3. Cross-sea Engineering Construction 

					Cross-sea bridge project began in the 1930s, with construction of the Bay Bridge
					(Bay Bridge), including a bridge across the mouth of the bay, most notably in 1937
					when pushed San Francisco Bay, built in the mouth of the Golden Gate Bridge. The
					1890 Bay Bridge, built in Scotland Forth can be said to herald the Bay Bridge. According
					to statistics, the world's Bridge has built nearly 70 in more than ten countries,
					including Japan 18, US 18, Denmark 6, out the top three. 

					Japan and Denmark are two of the countries in the 1970s, began to connect homeland
					across the sea island project. Japan's bridge as a starting point, the construction
					of the four-island project contact line; the small Danish island project kelp bridge
					construction started. In the end of the century with the completion of the two famous
					sea Belt Bridge (1997) and the Akashi Strait Bridge (1998), to achieve the ambitious
					island project plan while among the world powers of the bridge. 

					In the 1970s, the world's longest-linking project is 25 km Bahrain Island Narrows
					Bridge between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia by a French construction company. 

					Bay Bridge construction in China began in the 20th century, the early 90s Shantou
					Bay Bridge and the new Hong Kong airport line island project in the three bridges,
					namely, Tsing Ma Bridge, Kap Shui Mun Bridge and Ting Kau Bridge. Since then, the
					Zhoushan island project has quietly started, gradually advancing to the mainland
					from the island of Zhoushan Islands Link. Other coastal cities, island project is
					also planned. 

(a) Donghai Bridge (Fig. 1.118) 

					China's first cross-sea waters off the coast in the vast construction project was
					completed in 2005, in the East China Sea Bridge. The bridge connected by Nanhui District
					of Shanghai Yangshan Deepwater Port, full-length 32.5 km, at the mouth of Hangzhou
					Bay, Yellow Sea and East China Sea at the junction, is a landmark bridge, it's built
					for the future of China across the sea projects, such as the Hangzhou Bay Bridge,
					the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, as well as the planned Bohai Strait and Qiongzhou
					Strait project, providing valuable experience. 



Fig. 1.118 Donghai Bridge. 

					Donghai bridge builders face the harsh environment of the sea, the upper and lower
					portion of the structure are made of whole Erection of large pre-fabricated, equipped
					with a 2500t large floating crane. To ensure the service life of 100 years, the development
					of high performance concrete sea and various anti-corrosion measures to improve the
					durability of concrete in marine environment. In the waters of the construction GPS
					technology must be used, the construction of large storm-resistant construction platform,
					management also uses innovative ideas to ensure the smooth conduct of offshore construction.
					

					The two main navigation bridge Donghai Bridge, though not too long, but all using
					a combination of cable-stayed bridge girder bridge creative. Main channel bridge
					using a single cable plane and combined box girder bridge, with inverted Y-shaped
					pylons; stars Pearl Hill Bridge (Fig. 1.119) was combined with a parallel cable plane
					of the deck beams on the bridge tower using light beams steel crossbars. Since the
					main girder bridge using a combination of full bridge deck pavement and a new uniform
					joints large container truck traffic provides a smooth, durable good driving conditions.
					

(b) Zhanjiang Gulf Bridge (Fig. 1.120) 

					Opened to traffic by the end of 2006, Guangdong Zhanjiang Gulf Bridge, located in
					Zhanjiang City Maxie Bay, connecting East District, Zhanjiang Port is located on
					the international waterway 50,000 tons level. To save costs, and taking into account
					the ship out of port speed is constrained using cable-stayed main span of 480 m,
					in order to meet the 50,000 ton ocean-going vessel bound two-way navigation requirements.
					



Fig. 1.119 Stars Pearl Mountain Bridge. 



Fig. 1.120 Zhanjiang Gulf Bridge. 

					Although Zhanjiang Bay Bridge span is small, but in the design and construction process
					structure has many improvements made innovative efforts, especially in the anti-ship
					collision facilities and construct two cable-stayed bridge anchor, has made good
					results. 

					Used to increase the "collision avoidance" high design costs, and to resist more
					than 8000t ship collision force will also greatly increase the cost basis of the
					span or set collision pier. Zhanjiang Gulf Bridge proposed a "flexible energy dissipation
					crash" scenario, in order to reduce ship collision force, only the cost of more than
					twenty million yuan (two main pier) is to achieve a "small hit is not bad, the hit
					repairable, big hit does not fall (pier no damage), the goal." In a small bump process,
					so piers, ships and three collision facilities are protected, become a "three is
					not bad" crash facility. 

					Designed by Zhanjiang Gulf Bridge Steel Corporation and Shanghai Institute of Marine
					Research program was jointly developed by the outer pontoons, pontoon rope bull ring,
					the inner composition of the pontoon (Fig. 1.121), when subjected to ship collision,
					the bull ring absorption part of the ship collision force, while the bow goes to
					the side, along the outer pontoon slip away, thus changing the impact angle, reducing
					the ship collision force. This is a very creative achievements, the design of the
					future bridge crash will have an important role model. 

					Cable was anchored to the steel box girder bridge, a methods now mostly used in the
					structural form of the anchor box. To simplify the structure, convenient construction,
					Zhanjiang Gulf Bridge envisaged commonly used in the I-beam anchor pull extended
					to the steel box girder structure success, through a detailed three-dimensional stress
					analysis and experimental research to prove the rationality of this anchoring structure
					advantages and ease of construction for future large-span steel box girder design
					provides a reference, but also an innovative sense of achievement (Fig. 1.122).

Fig. 1.122 Cable Anchor Way - Zhanjiang Gulf Bridge. 

					In addition, Zhanjiang Bay Bridge tower design, the bridge approach movable formwork
					equipment and deck epoxy asphalt pavement aggregate localisation and other aspects
					of a number of technical improvements, become one of the technology demonstration
					project in Guangdong Province, China Communications Construction quality engineering.
					

(c) Hangzhou Bay Bridge (Fig. 1.123) 

					In the early 1990s, began planning the construction of Zhejiang Zhapu port connected
					by Hangzhou Bay, Cixi channel. Shanghai Tung-Yen Lin commissioned consultants Brandon
					newly established pre-feasibility study to compare a few possible direction, bridge
					type arrangement and form the basis of the line, and estimate the cost. Financing
					in the late 1990s, progress had been made, the former
					Ministry of Transportation Highway Planning and Design Institute completed a feasibility
					study report, the Ministry of Transportation (now renamed as the Ministry of Transport)
					approved the project, into the formal planning stage. Ningbo, Zhejiang Province organized
					a command, followed by Shanghai Donghai Bridge to start construction later in order
					to use heavy construction equipment and troops Donghai Bridge, drawing Donghai Bridge
					offshore construction experience. 



Fig. 1.123 Hangzhou Bay Bridge. 

					Hangzhou Bay Bridge is located in Hangzhou Bay, with a length of 36 km, the total
					length of the bridge over the East China Sea. Navigation bridge located two holes,
					North Navigable twin towers 448 m main span steel cable-stayed bridge with double
					cable planes, navigation standard 35000 t; South Navigable single cable plane is
					a single tower steel bridge, navigation standard 3 milliont. In addition to the North-South
					traffic openings, the remaining non-maritime shipping Span are continuous pre-stressed
					concrete box girder after 70 m simple support. Donghai bridge construction on some
					of the issues that appear, such as crack control of pre-fabricated pier wet joints,
					continuous box girder pre-fabrication and pre-tensioning technology, continuous box
					girder joints wet process so take a seat at the improvement measures (such as changes
					in marine concrete mix, increasing the protective layer and adding good ruth fibers,
					etc.), has made technological advances, hoping to solve the joint after the wet concrete
					cracking durability. For two non-navigation bridge box girder construction heavy
					200t, using design and manufacturing company from Germany, Italy advanced beam carrier,
					the precast beams moved into position by the hole to install, compared with the general
					adoption of mobile formwork situ process, improved quality. In addition, to improve
					the high wind environment lane bridge, the first large-scale use of wind barriers
					set up to achieve very good results. 

					Hangzhou Bay Bridge was built in 2008, and synchronised Su Tong Yangtze River Bridge,
					realised with three trunk road across the Yangtze River Estuary and Hangzhou Bay,
					the two key projects, coastal Zhejiang and Fujian and Shanghai Zhucheng's leading
					road transport more convenient, unobstructed. 

(d) Zhoushan Island Project 

					In the early 1990s, the development of economic Zhoushan and Ningbo had aspirations
					on Liandao bridge connecting the islands. At the time, stone is the company's business
					owners, from Zhoushan, he is willing to make contributions to an island project planning
					and commission of Tongji road and traffic engineering, bridge engineering Zhoushan
					sent teachers togather the relevant information has been reconnaissance waters, completed
					the program and practicable route to meet the requirements of the bridge-navigation
					preliminary plan and estimate construction costs, but this proposal was shelved because
					conditions are not ripe. 

					In the late 1990s, the city has determined to use its own financial resources, advance
					the Zhoushan Island and several nearby islands connected together, when conditions
					permit, and then connect Jintang Island, the progressive realisation and connecting
					Ningbo. In the 21st century, Zhoushan City has completed the three island project,
					built Taoyaomen Bridge, the island of Zhoushan Island and booklet fused, the last
					two remaining major sea project, namely, Xihoumen Bridge (Fig. 1.124) and across
					the waterway connecting Ningbo Jintang Bridge (Fig. 1.125). 



Fig. 1.124 Xihoumen Bridge. 

					The central government approved the construction of Shanghai Yangshan Deep water
					Port and Donghai Bridge to form the Shanghai Shipping Center. In this situation,
					Zhejiang Province and the Ministry of Transportation decided to use a deep water
					port in Zhoushan City resources, and Ningbo Beilun port in Hangzhou Bay south wing
					jointly build a large naval base, as the main access to the sea Zhejiang, Jiangxi
					and Fujian north north-west region, and echoes and Shanghai, East China together
					constitute an international shipping center in the Pacific
					Ocean in the West Bank. 



Fig. 1.125 Jintang Bridge. 

					Xihoumen Bridge is suspension bridge spanning 1,650 m over the waterway with a depth
					of 80 m. As is located in typhoon-prone areas, the basic wind speed up to 44 m/s,
					requires flutter test wind speed 78 m/s, exceeding the limits of aerodynamic stability
					of the overall streamlined box girder could be achieved, and thus must be split slotted
					box girder cross-section. Additional stability is necessary when the central board
					to improve wind stability. Xihoumen Bridge has become China's largest span when completed,
					and the first use of split deck suspension bridge. In 2006, construction of the main
					cable fairlead first traction over the sea using a helicopter to succeed, the whole
					bridge was completed in 2009, making the island of Zhoushan Jintang Island and connected.
					

					Jintang Bridge Engineering Zhoushan island project for the last one to be connected
					Jintang Island and the mainland. Originally planned to use the direct route across
					recently, due to the Strait of deep water, technically difficult, after the switch
					to a total length of 21 km, crossing the shallow water ashore in Zhenhai program.
					A 620 m using the main navigation span steel bridge, something the two auxiliary
					points navigable hole hole using a main span of 216 m of continuous rigid frame and
					156 m main span continuous beam, and the rest were non-navigable approach for 60
					m, 50 m and 30 m pre-stress concrete continuous beam. Jintang Bridge draws on the
					successful experience of the East China Sea Bridge and Hangzhou Bay Bridge, the total
					cost was 7.7 billion yuan, opened to traffic before the opening of Expo 2009 Shanghai,
					a century-old dream of Zhoushan people. 

(e) HZMB Connection Works (2009-2016) 

					Pearl river estuary Lingdingyang is the most important estuary, the Pearl river delta
					has four of the eight entrances to import Lingdingyang, bay mouth wide and 30 km,
					an area of 2000 km2. Lingdingyang east of Shenzhen, Shekou and Hong Kong, Zhuhai
					and Macao to the west, from the top of the Tiger Bay entrance Humen Bridge 65 km.
					With the rapid economic development of the Pearl river delta region, on both sides
					of the bay mouth began to consider the idea of the Lingdingyang bridge. 

					Former Transportation Ministry organized design competition in 1993, collecting a
					number of domestic and international bridge-type program. A total length of 33 km,
					six-lane traffic, construction cost was estimated at about 16 billion yuan. December
					1997 state approved a feasibility study of the project. 



Fig. 1.126 HZMB location map. 

					Due to the construction of the Disneyland on Lantau Island by the Hong Kong government,
					the Pearl of the West Bank cities to attract tourists; and the gaming industry in
					Macao also hopes to attract tourists to Hong Kong to Macau easy, so the Hong Kong
					Parliament rejected the Northern Line Lingdingyang ashore in Tuen Mun bridge program
					(I). Highway Planning and Design Institute Limited by HZMB Advance Work Coordination
					Group commissioned undertook a feasibility study on various proposed solutions by
					detailed comparison, recommended line position IIa (field stone Bay Northern Line
					- Beaconsfield / Pearl) and bridge and tunnel combination regimen. 

					In December 2009, the preliminary design was completed and reviewed at several rounds
					of expert meetings, bridge and tunnel construction party decided to use a combination
					of programs (Fig. 1.126). The eastern section of the main channel by the immersed
					tube tunnel crossing, long 5.99 km. The western part of three auxiliary channel press
					the navigation requirements at different span cable-stayed bridge spans: from east
					to west, with a main span 458 m Green Island Channel Bridge; 2 × 258 m main span
					cable-stayed bridge in the Three Pagodas — Direct Ship Channel Bridge jianghai; main
					span of 298 m Jiuzhou Channel Bridge. Bridge length of 22.9 km, a total investment
					of 34.72 billion yuan. The bridge was under construction by the end of 2009, was
					opened to traffic in 2015. 

(f) Qiongzhou Strait Project 

					Qiongzhou Strait Tunnel State national lines is the southernmost project. In the
					early 1990s, the Guangdong Provincial Communications Department started a program
					of work, and invite international companies to do a preliminary exploration. According
					to the existing charts, geological, meteorological and hydrological data, preliminary
					planning a two-line position, namely, the Straits shortest median line bits and Nishiguchi
					line position. The former total length of 20 km, the average depth of 80 m, maximum
					depth of 160 m for avoiding the need to build multi-span 3000~5000 m suspension bridge;
					the latter a total length of 40 km, but the depth of only 40~45 m, can be a smaller
					span bridge or bridge and tunnel bonding scheme. 

					In 1998, Guangdong Provincial Communications Department to allocated 83 million yuan
					in special funds, and Humen technology consulting firm was commissioned to carry
					out preliminary work of upto five years to complete a total of seven volumes of the
					1.8 million word documents, technical standards, and natural conditions, navigation
					standards, traffic line position is preferred, conceptual design and environmental,
					technical and economic evaluation of bridge and tunnel scheme and so do a detailed
					study. After detailed research report comparing and preferred to avoid the basis
					of the midline 80 m water depth, recommended Strait Nishiguchi new line VII bit (Fig.
					1.127), and recommend the most economical 2 × 800 m cable-stayed bridge with three
					towers programs. Auxiliary Channel Bridge north and south two 30,000ton ocean-going
					vessel traffic requirements, clear height of 50 m, 800 m each using hybrid cable-stayed
					bridge deck, the rest of the side holes available 250 m and 50 m continuous rigid
					frame composed of pre-stressed concrete continuous beam. Thus, taking the Strait
					Nishiguchi new full bridge VII line B program not only mature technology, but also
					the lowest cost, is an economically rational basis for competitive programs, feasibility
					studies for future projects provide a good technical foundation. 



Fig. 1.127 Line position Qiongzhou Strait project comparison chart. 


					Since 2008, the central government decided to expand the Yangpu Port in Hainan Province,
					facing South-east Asia trade; in Wenchang construction of a new space launch base.
					For this reason, the requirements of the railway across the Channel to replace the
					current ferry transport, and decided to re-planning and preliminary studies Qiongzhou
					Strait project led by the Ministry of Railways. In February 2009, two (railway, transport)
					and provinces (Guangdong, Hainan) in Haikou, the first joint meeting was held to
					discuss the work to build a highway and railway. Joint Working Group proposed a variety
					of comparison program, overall, is currently working on preliminary investigations
					navigation area, traffic, geological exploration, hydrological and meteorological
					conditions are not sufficient to bridge deep water foundation and technical preparation
					immersed tunnel is not enough, as well as coordination problems between the Ministry
					of Railways and the Ministry of Transport, the need to have sometime to do the preliminary
					work consciously careful argumentation comparison, not hastily. 

4. Participation and Cooperation of Foreign Companies 

					After the reform and opening up, China's bridge engineering counterparts in developed
					countries began to have contacts and exchanges. Visit abroad and participate in international
					conferences of university teachers, China Road and Bridge Corporation and the China
					Railway companies by overseas contracted projects, but also have a preliminary cooperation
					with foreign contractors. In exchange, we deeply felt and technical level of developed
					countries there is a big gap between the need to catch up, trying to learn the developed
					countries in the 1960s to 1970s, construction boom in the creation of many new technologies.
					Design units have introduced foreign advanced design software, and construction companies
					are buying a number of advanced equipment to replace the original inefficient outdated
					equipment. 

					In the late 1980s, Shanghai Nanpu Bridge in self-construction process, invited the
					Chinese-American Mr. Deng Wenzhong as a design review and technical consultant for
					the Asian Development Bank successfully passed the review expert group played an
					important role. 

					Guangdong Province, the first to open up, introduced advanced VSL clip anchor to
					the building of the Luoxi Bridge. Off the coast of bridge construction in Jiangmen
					by foreign investment in Japan Kumagai served by a contractor, and the use of advanced
					short pre-cast segmental construction method and hanging fight. Shandong Province,
					bought Japanese PE sheath parallel finished wire rope in Dongying Yellow River Bridge
					construction. These technologies played as an important bridge between the model
					and guide during the progress and development of China. 

					Since the 1990s, encouraged by the success of the Shanghai Nanpu Bridge and Yangpu
					Bridge independent construction, the provinces climax independent construction of
					the bridge, the provinces have begun to frequent visits abroad, while also inviting
					foreign well-known companies, such as the United States, Tung-Yen Lin (TY Lin) International
					Corporation, Japan's growing up (Chodai), Germany's Leonhardt companies such as consulting
					services. Anhui Tongling Bridge construction, Mr. Deng Wenzhong recommended cantilever
					construction of cable-stayed bridge in front fulcrum Light Hanging Basket; Queshi
					Bridge is used VSL strand group's anchor cable system; some of the main cable construction
					used in Japan pioneered strand (PWS) working method. Some design and construction
					units are happy to invite some well-known outside consulting company as some of the
					challenges, but also to buy some advanced equipment, such as Germany's rig, Britain,
					Italy and France, cranes, movable formwork cast Norway, etc. Germany and Switzerland
					as well as large travel joints, vibration dampers and buffers as well as advanced
					construction pylon climb molds. 

					On the software, the United States, Ansys, Korea Midas, TDV, Austria and the United
					Kingdom Lusas also introduced major software, major design institutes, independent
					design of the bridge to China has played an important role. 

					In bridge construction boom in the late 20th century, some British companies such
					as Hong Kong Maosheng (Maunsell), Halcrow (Hacrow), Ao Weina (Orup) and Bandung (McDonald)
					and Denmark's Cowi other well-known companies are in consulting services, sub-contracting
					tasks, the joint bid, case studies and other means, to participate in the design
					and construction of Chinese Bridge Cooperation of China's development and progress
					of bridge played a very positive role. 

					In addition, for some difficult problems to solve, such as steel deck from lack of
					pavement, through the introduction of epoxy asphalt American ChemCo's patented technology
					has been resolved. Another example of fine cracks in the concrete, but also through
					the introduction of foreign fiber adding technology to overcome. It should be said,
					advanced technologies and successful experiences of developed countries is very helpful.
					

					In the 21st century, our country and outside the company's cooperation has entered
					a mature stage. Some large-span bridges and sea project need to rely on large advanced
					equipment to ensure the project's quality and durability, but cannot employing sea
					tactics and outdated equipment to complete. Some Bridge Engineering Command actively
					inviting foreign well-known companies as the site's resident advisor on critical
					design and engineering methods were reviewed and checks, and also listed in the budget
					cost of purchasing advanced equipment in order to ensure the smooth progress of the
					project, such as Shanghai Donghai Bridge, Jiangsu Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge and
					Su Tong Bridge. We all recognise that the gap between China's equipment manufacturing
					industry cannot solve the short-term, we also need time, through the efforts of independent
					innovation, to catch up with the level of equipment in developed countries. 

					In some cities, domestic and international public tenders include foreign and domestic
					design companies have begun to design units, or through the establishment of China
					branch in the country registered a way to participate. Such as Guangzhou, Chongqing
					and Tianjin cities bridges bid by Mr. America Tung-Yen Lin Deng served as the international
					design. Some foreign companies have been gradually creative design accepted and appreciated
					for the Chinese community has also touched the bridge and inspiration. It should
					be said that this is a positive exchanges and cooperation for China's development
					and progress of the bridge is very useful. 

					The fifty years of development history of China's modern bridge, in the first two
					Five Year Plan period (1953 to 1963), by 156 former Soviet Union aided engineering,
					quickly established the west since the 18th century industrial revolution two hundred
					the accumulated years of modern industrial system. In terms of bridges, aided by
					the former Soviet Union Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, we have mastered the modern steel
					bridges, reinforced concrete and pre-stressed bridge of advanced technology, with
					a design and construction team and several bridges factories. We can say that we
					have basically caught up with the pace of the world bridge project forward. 

					Unfortunately, the "Cultural Revolution" made China's economic on the verge of collapse,
					we completely missed the world in the 20th century, 60 to 70 years of postwar modern
					bridge technology booming golden age. When in 1979, the first batch of scholars and
					students to go abroad and see the Western Highway and the spectacle of urban modernisation,
					tremendous progress can only exclaim post-war modern bridge. We must study hard to
					catch up lost time to make it up as soon as possible. 

					Fortunately, the Chinese bridge circles in the 1980s, after learning and catching
					up, in the 1990s, to track and improve both the development stage, and seize the
					opportunity to Shanghai Nanpu Bridge and Guangdong Humen Bridge construction, chose
					a learning foreign advanced technology, but do not give up the right of autonomy
					of independent road construction, and finally succeeded. We gradually catch up with
					the pace of the world of modern bridge forward, also won the international bridge
					industry peer recognition and praise, to become an international bridge an important
					member of the extended family. 

					1.3.5 Problems in Bridge Construction in China 

					China bridge construction in the past 20 years has achieved tremendous progress and
					achievement, but in the face of the 21st century bridge engineering tasks and after
					entering the WTO counterparts in developed countries to compete in the Chinese market
					situation, we need to address the problems, and overcome as soon as these affect
					the competitiveness of the defects, ready to meet the challenge. 

1. Design Innovation 

					Design is the soul of the project, which largely determine the project's quality,
					cost, construction difficulty and duration. Since the reform and opening up, although
					there have been a number of representatives of the excellent design of this era,
					but most designs there is a lack of innovation, poor economic indicators and the
					problems caused by poorly designed wasteful and unsafe bridge on the technical progress
					of the project with be adversely affected. 

					Innovation should be the soul of design. However, we seem to lack an incentive mechanism
					used in the design of new structures, new materials and new processes. First, the
					design cycle is too short, too much to undertake the task, excessive pursuit of economic
					efficiency, the unit did not have enough time to make the design and optimisation
					of innovative thinking compared to imitation and plagiarism meet existing design.
					Secondly, the lack of truly fair and open competition system and strict design review
					and supervision system, but also the lack of creativity and economic indicators bad
					design passed and implemented. Finally, there is a look at the size of the awards
					at all levels of the project, not to pay attention to the tendency of design innovation
					and economic indicators, so that innovative ideas for design engineers tend to indifference.
					These are the causes for Chinese bridge design lacking creativity and poor economic
					indicators. 

					Our bridge design has a bad tendency, the thicker text the better the design. However,
					the most important design concept is very simple statement, did not say the reason
					clear choice programs. Foreign designs are limited to the number of pages of tender
					documents, tender design does not have to repeat basic information and requirements,
					the key is set forth innovative ideas and solutions approach, so that the file has
					distinct characteristics and persuasive. 

					Foreign bridge design only do the bidding of construction tender design, equivalent
					to China's preliminary design or technical design, the foundation of a large number
					of construction plans by the successful contractor based on business equipment and
					experience in the design upto complete the tender. Thus, the design department had
					sufficient time and energy to do the work of the design concept and technical innovation.
					There are even some smaller consulting engineer firm, specialising in doing the feasibility
					study and work program of the competition. This division of labour is very conducive
					to innovative design and construction of innovative technologies. We should change
					the current form of organisation to complete the design by the institute a full range
					of work from the feasibility study until the construction plans as soon as possible.
					

2. Engineering Quality Problems 

					The speed of Chinese bridge construction often makes foreign counterparts "unbelievably"
					amazed. However, the haste of the design cycle and the construction period is not
					a good thing, it brings a lot of regret, leaving a lot of quality problems. Since
					the contract price is too low, even worse, even construction equipment purchase were
					not even included, construction contractors only lower than the fixed labour costs.
					In order not to lose money, they are forced to subcontract to low qualifications,
					lack of experienced engineering team to construction, so the layers of sub-contracting,
					the phenomenon is difficult to avoid cutting corners, eventually leading to poor
					quality of the project, undermines the engineering durability. 

					In addition to the problem of technology, processes and qualifications on the Chinese
					market, there is still a material fake, shoddy problems. Cement, steel, pre-stressing
					equipment, templates and basic engineering materials have many quality problems,
					some even very serious. Although the construction supervision system, but there are
					still many loopholes and unhealthy, it is difficult to achieve a high degree of responsibility
					and strict supervision. 

					Some Chinese-American counterparts during a visit to a Chinese bridge construction
					site, has repeatedly warned: "China's bridge may require repair climax in less than
					30 years". This is contrary to our "long-term project, Quality First" slogan. "Corruption
					and waste is a great crime", if our project is not durable, less than the design
					life requirements, which is a tremendous waste, we would have lost to future generations.
					

					China bridge construction engineering quality problems spread through the Chinese-American
					and Hong Kong counterparts, has affected the reputation of Chinese bridges become
					their "incredible" a satire of Chinese speed and annotations. We still have to promote
					the rational design cycle, reasonable duration and scientific attitude reasonable
					cost, and provide updates to the construction contractor equipment to improve the
					development of space technology, the complete elimination of layers of qualification
					reduced sub-contracting, resolutely resist shoddy materials and fraud, the implementation
					of strict supervision. Only in this way can China bridges to high-quality brand internationally
					respected peers. 

3. Bridge Aesthetic Issues 

					Since the reform and opening up, China's bridge construction at an unprecedented
					scale and speed to make the world wonder. But whether we are in a hurry to build
					a bridge gives a sense of beauty is a question worthy of reflection. Bridge is not
					only an important part of the transportation system, but also a landmark building.
					People want to praise uttered by the bridge at the time, enjoy the beauty. As a bridge
					engineer has the responsibility to pay attention to aesthetic value and landscape
					features in the design of the bridge, to meet people's desire to watch. 

					Foreign bridge engineers and architects have long-term cooperation, especially in
					a multi-program comparison of the conceptual design phase, aesthetic assessment of
					the bridge is often a very important factor. In some long-span bridges in the international
					design competition, aesthetic evaluation even more than the technical indicators
					become the decisive factor. In contrast, some of our bridge, since the design is
					not enough emphasis on aesthetics, the lack of participation and co-architect of
					various possible scenarios compare inadequate and often leave a lot of regret, such
					as giving a clumsy, dull and rough feeling and so on. 

					In the past, our design principle was for the economy, and take care of appearance
					only when conditions permitted. As China's economic strength, the concerns on the
					environment and landscape requirements are also rising. Aesthetic design of the bridge
					should become increasingly important principle, bridge engineers to constantly improve
					their aesthetic and artistic qualities, so that every bridge became landscaping,
					bringing joy to the people of art. 

4. Economic Issues 

					The costs of China bridge from the surface is lower than the cost of European countries,
					so give people create a false impression that the is the best interms of economy.
					Chinese bridge. However, after careful consideration the impression is not true.
					

					First, because of China's low labour costs, many bridges have gathered a lot of sites
					of migrant workers, bridge equipment using relatively backward. Although the bridge
					can be built, and even record-breaking bridge, but often bring construction quality
					problems. While an investment is low, but if life is very short, the future costs
					of maintenance and reinforcement is very huge, from the viewpoint of the whole life
					is still very economical. 

					Secondly, the bridge construction in China are often the first choice by the owners
					and design units, made by a scheme comparison, expert consultation meeting to discuss
					the decision by the final implementation plan. In economic comparison scheme will
					be some counterintuitive phenomena and man-made, even in order to meet the wishes
					of the owners and the total disregard of the economy, so uneconomical, weird, difficult
					construction program through false irrational economic indicators and not scientific
					"reasons" to be implemented. During the construction phase and then an additional
					budget to make the project economic principles useless. 

					Again, an important indicator of the economy of a bridge is the amount of material
					per square meter deck, attached great importance to this reflects the level of competitiveness
					and technology indicators in the international design competition. Because of China's
					gap in the material industry, almost using the same kind of S345 steel bridge steel,
					concrete bridge most of the strength of the relatively low-level of C50 concrete,
					therefore, thicker steel plate and steel bridge in more varied, complex structure
					and bring welding process problems, concrete bridge also often seem relatively clumsy
					and obesity, the bridge will lead to increased costs. 

					Finally, there is a problem in the choice of the bridge span. In addition to the
					bridge site topographic and geologic conditions unfavourable to cross the river to
					be a special project requirements, the country has a lot on Yangtze River in the
					blind pursuit of large span, even in the Xiangjiang River, a tributary branch of
					the Yangtze River Gan River and other inland waterways would have to build super-kilometer
					span bridge, which is very uneconomical. 

					1.4 MODERN BRIDGE ENGINEERING 

					The end of World War II in 1945, marked the beginning of modern engineering to IT
					technology and computer applications characterised, so far we've gone through the
					first six years. From the previously described six years about 60 innovations of
					modern engineering can be seen, and before the war compared to modern bridge technology
					has made a huge progress, including high-performance materials, finite element method
					and computer software, construction method innovation and large-scale automation
					equipment and other aspects of construction, showing a more sophisticated modern
					bridge design, construction and more high quality and high efficiency, conservation
					and management of monitoring techniques are increasingly sophisticated. 

					In the last decade of the 20th century, there are many international bridges are
					in 21st century conference theme. June 2006, the US Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)
					held a "Future of Civil Engineering Summit" in Virginia Rand Youngstown City formed
					a prospect, "2025 Civil Engineering" report. The report calls for civil engineering
					counterparts around the world to work together to take action to create a more beautiful
					day for the early 21st century civil engineering. 

					Bridge project is an important branch of civil engineering, if we can follow the
					stages of modern civil engineering that: From 1945 to 1980, period is the foundation
					of modern bridge engineering; 1980 to 2010, period is progress, creating the 1950s
					to 1970s, many of the new technology has been fully applied and developed in the
					late sprint cross-sea engineering and 20 years in large-span bridges; in 2010, the
					modern bridge project will be matured in the turning point of this development, we
					also need Looking to bridge engineers operational goals for the next 20 years and
					important mission. 

					1.4.1 Bridge Engineer's Mission and Mandate 

					"2025 Civil Engineering," the report said: "Civil Engineers shoulders create a sustainable
					world and to improve the global quality of life sacred mission." Therefore, "sustainable
					development" and "quality of life" is the 21st century, two important proposition,
					but also exposed the past 60 years the main issues and challenges faced. So the mission
					can be summarised as follows: 


						Bridge engineers are not only planners, designers and builders of the project, they
						should also be the lifetime operators and maintainers. 

						Bridge engineers should have the concept of sustainable development has become a
						protector of the natural environment and conservation of resources and energy advocates.
						

						Bridge engineers should be involved in decision-making infrastructure, and construction
						of high quality and durable construction through continuous innovation, improve the
						quality of people's lives become an active promoter. 

						Bridge engineer should become the project guardian against natural disasters, emergencies,
						accidents and other risks. 

						Finally, bridge engineers should also have team spirit and work ethic to become a
						model to resist all kinds of corruption performer. 


					1.4.2 Research and Development of Bridge Project 

					To achieve the above mission and mandate, bridge engineering must rely on the latest
					achievements of science and technology development, and through ongoing research
					and development work, and constantly improving existing technologies to create and
					invent more advanced technology to overcome shortcomings and resolve new issues to
					meet the greater challenges of the 21st century. Research focused on the following
					five areas: 


						Improvement of material properties is an important driving force behind the continuous
						progress of the bridge project. Modern steel and concrete bridge engineering is still
						the main building materials. Over the past six decades, the development of the steel
						from S343 to S1100, the development of concrete from C30 to C150, has made substantial
						progress. A variety of high-strength lightweight composite materials and smart materials
						have been used in bridge engineering. In the foreseeable future, nanotechnology and
						biotechnology may become an important driving force of technological innovation in
						the 21st century, and continue to enter the field of bridge engineering applications,
						has become a new generation of building materials carriers. 

						IT technology and improvement of computer processing power and the corresponding
						structural analysis software continues to progress, will make increasingly refined
						bridge design, to create the conditions for the realisation of numerical simulation
						and the "Virtual Reality" (VR) technology. Therefore, to carry out research of advanced
						theories and methods of conceptual design of bridge engineering, structural design,
						construction control, health monitoring, management and other aspects of conservation
						and development of appropriate software and database technology is a very important
						area of research. 

						Intelligent monitoring devices (sensors, diagnostic monitors, portable computers)
						and inventions of large intelligent robot construction equipment, will enable the
						construction, management, monitoring, maintenance and repair work of the bridge and
						a series of on-site automation and remote management. Our industry is still relatively
						backward equipment, heavy construction equipment, advanced testing equipment and
						sophisticated sensors are dependent on imports, we should vigorously carry out research
						and development work in this field of hardware, and gradually increase its investment
						in this regard, to get rid of external dependence. 

						Natural disasters and terrorist threats put high risk to the future world. National
						Natural Science Foundation of China's recently launched a major research program
						on "major projects power disaster" will help reduce risk and ensure the safety of
						people's lives, but also improve important aspects of people's quality of life. In
						addition, the study of risk assessment and improve the structural durability should
						be taken seriously in order to ensure the normal life of major projects. 

						Finally, norms and standards to reflect an important indicator of the level of nation-building.
						In the allowable stress method (1923~1963), after which the limit state law (1963~2003),
						developed countries have begun working to develop performance-based design specifications
						(Performance-Based Design Code) in order to improve the level of infrastructure construction.
						The development of this new design is based on a full life and sustainable development
						of the concept of performance-based design codes and standards, should be one of
						the most important tasks in the early 2000s to keep up with trends in the world of
						civil engineering development. 


					1.4.3 Bridge-building in the Era of Knowledge Economy 

					By the end of the 20th century, a new economic revolution quietly rose. In the 18th
					century Industrial Revolution two centuries later, with the information revolution
					as the core of the knowledge industry will bring a new era of human knowledge economy.
					

					Era of knowledge economy is essentially an intelligent and efficient era. The development
					of modern communications technology makes highly information-oriented society, but
					also to family life, office, factory production, transportation, construction, education
					and training, health care, national management and other activities can take advantage
					of visual communication networks and multimedia, "information superhighway" automated
					and intelligent. Human intelligence and computer networks combine to make the knowledge
					innovation has become the most valuable products, a mainstay of the economy and the
					core of various industries. 

					Bridge construction in the era of knowledge economy will have the following characteristics:
					


						In the planning and design phase of the bridge, people will use a highly developed
						computer-aided tools for effective rapid optimisation and simulation analysis, virtual
						reality application of technology so that the owners can be very realistic in advance
						to see the completion of the bridge after the appearance, function, and then simulate
						performance under earthquakes and typhoons, the impact on the environment and landscape
						day and night in order to decisions. 

						In the stage of manufacturing and erection of the bridge, people will use intelligent
						manufacturing systems complete the processing components in the plant, and then use
						the Global Positioning System (GPS) and remote control technology, thousands of miles
						away from the site outside the headquarters of the management and control of the
						bridge construction. 

						After the bridge is completed and delivered, by automatically monitoring and management
						system to ensure safe and proper operation of the bridge. Once a fault or damage,
						health diagnosis and expert system will automatically report the injury site and
						conservation countermeasures. 


					In short, in the knowledge economy era bridge engineering and other industries will
					have the intelligence, information and remote automatic control features. A variety
					of intelligent building robots managed by computer software under the control of
					the commanding officers at headquarters, the completion of underwater and aerial
					work under field conditions, precisely as planned bridge construction, it will be
					a 21st century bridge engineering magnificent sight. 

					By the end of 2007, the US National Academy of Engineering announced the approval
					by more than 50 experts in the "21st century 14 major engineering challenge project",
					belonging to sustainable development, health, disaster prevention and improving the
					quality of life in four areas. Which in addition to the health sector, and the remaining
					three are related and future bridge projects. 

					Looking into the modern engineering in the next 20 years, we should be fully understand
					the mission of bridge engineers and tasks in materials, software, hardware (construction
					equipment and monitoring equipment), disaster prevention and re-double their efforts
					to a new generation of standardised five aspects, greet challenges across the sea
					and island project for building and sustainable development in line with the concept
					of the whole life of the 21st century, modern bridge engineering our contribution.
					

					Finally, it should be noted that the invention of plastic in 1907, one hundred years
					has gradually developed into a new family of materials. Metal and mineral products
					have been a large number of high performance fiber reinforced plastic composites
					and replaced in the field of electrical appliances, medical equipment, automotive,
					aviation, agriculture, machinery and equipment, etc., and has been infiltrated with
					cement and steel as the basic material of the modern civil construction. After the
					near future (probably in 20 to 30 years later), engineering plastics and composite
					materials instead of cement and steel will gradually become the protagonist of building
					materials, playing the role of a landmark, which will be modern civil engineering
					(engineering) into modern new era, and caused revolutionary changes in design theory,
					system configuration, connection technology and construction method and the like.
					

					1.5 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN AND INNOVATIVE IDEAS 

					Conceptual design is responsible for each project engineer given a mandate in the
					initial stages of brewing in the hearts of design ideas, but also the starting point
					for creative designers. In the past, civil engineering education in most countries
					in the world university professor of materials according to specifications at the
					different structural design. In the 21st century, many European countries have begun
					to recognise the need to train students' innovative ideas, you must set up "concept
					design" new course. 

					In order to catch up with this new trend, Tongji Bridge Engineering decided to open
					a "concept bridge design" course, hope that through this engineering education reform,
					strengthen innovation consciousness of young engineers from the bridge for China
					to bridge power. 

					1.5.1 Conceptual Design Significance 

					Conceptual design is the core of engineering design, but also the entire design phase
					of the project the most important and the most difficult part, can be said that the
					soul of design. 

					Conceptual design reflects the designer of the overall objectives of insight, ability
					to control the design task, and the ability in technological innovation, engineering
					thinking and integrated treatment and the like. The success or failure of a design
					task and depends heavily on the quality of its conceptual design, a mediocre concept
					design from the outset, the project decided at a disadvantage in the competition,
					even if the approval is also unlikely to succeed. Of course, a good conceptual design
					may also be due in the subsequent design phase aborted or not implemented destroyed
					the original idea. 

					Conceptual design includes the "concept generation" and the "concept selection" in
					two stages. The concept generation is defined according to the needs arising from
					multiple objectives, targets and constraints to form a thought process all reasonable
					and feasible solutions. At this time, insight engineers is very important, this insight
					includes intuition, genius, inspiration, knowledge and experience, but also reflects
					the designer's unique personality and style. 

					From the "brainstorming" the generation of program should be "the more the better."
					Therefore, we can mobilise the imagination and creativity of the design team, as
					much as possible to accept different personalities, different styles, different perspectives
					and emphasis of the design, to avoid missing some ingenious design concepts and ideas.
					

					Concept of choice is all possible options to evaluate and compare screened out a
					few excellent programs for analysis, research and detailed comparison in order to
					finalise an optimum conceptual design. 

					In general, the conceptual design stage does not need to invest a lot of money and
					manpower, does not need too detailed calculations, especially to avoid using technical
					design and detail design methods to do conceptual design, and to focus on reflection
					and comparison, and with a small amount of text and a few pictures to express the
					designer's ideas and creativity, outstanding personality and style that some different
					from the traditional, conventional and existing design highlights. In short, to demonstrate
					the designer's insight and creativity. 

					1.5.2 Basic Principles of Conceptual Design 

					Foreign bridge design emphasises the 3E principle that the efficacy (efficiency),
					the economy (economy) and beautiful (elegance) are the three elements, this and "practical,
					economic, aesthetic care, where possible conditions," the construction of the originally
					proposed guidelines are consistent. As China's economic strength, people's living
					standards improve, for aesthetic demands more attention, coupled with safety and
					quality problems occur frequently, the principles of engineering design was changed
					to "safe, suitable, economic, aesthetic." This "character principle" has become the
					consensus-building system, appeared in many engineering design documents. It should
					be said, that the goal of safety and quality of construction of the main pre-requisite
					for the design, which is included in the design specifications of the various articles,
					the site is the design engineer must follow the law, that is designed according to
					specification requirements. 

					As a basic principle of conceptual design, in addition to security, application,
					economic and aesthetic, construct ability should also be considered to guarantee
					the conservation of nature and life-use features durability. In recent years, for
					the sustainability of the project (sustainable engineering) saving resources and
					protecting the environment should be an important principle of the concept conceptual
					design to be considered. 

					In short, the bridge concept design in the 21st century should meet the "safe, practical,
					economic, aesthetic, durable and environmentally friendly," the six basic principles
					to reflect the spirit of conservation and environmental protection and sustainable
					development. And innovative ideas or creative (innovative or original idea) must
					run through the whole concept of the design process. 

					1.5.3 Definition of Innovation 

					The concept of innovation was first used by Schumpeter (J. Schumpeter), published
					in 1912, "Theory of Economic Development" presented in a book. He will be lead to
					a qualitative change in the means of production and the development of the economy
					is defined as the occurrence of a new combination of "innovation", while for small
					steps simply by adjusting production, although it also brings some amount of change
					or growth, but it cannot be called innovation. Visible innovation is a revolutionary
					tool that can cause things change. 

					Innovation in technology should be a core technology for product innovation, rather
					than on the periphery of the secondary components or partial to make some adjustments
					and changes, which can only be described as an improvement. Thus, changes in qualitative
					or quantitative changes only, it should be important to define the criteria between
					innovation and improvement. 

					China's Eleventh Five-Year Plan put innovation into three levels, namely, original
					innovation, integrated innovation and the introduction of absorption and innovation.
					Obviously, living in the highest level of the original innovation, it is the first
					(initiation) and original (origination). If science to discover (discovery) as the
					core technology is to the invention (invention) and creation (creation) as the core
					patent is a legal means to protect the original innovations, and "core technology"
					came from those with a patent the original innovations. 

					About two later levels of "innovation", in October 2008, at the Chinese Academy of
					Engineering President Xu stated in the speech, "to implement the scientific concept
					of development, building an innovative country". 

					"Integrated innovation" generally is overall an autonomy design driven by national
					needs, but the core components are often the best value for money to buy foreign
					products, assembly (integrated) up as high-speed rail EMU, regional aircraft, large
					tunnel excavator. 

					"Introduction, digestion, absorption and re-innovation" is primarily a local improvement
					based on the imitation, such as home appliances and information industry, although
					some core components can be produced, but the poor performance, not durable (due
					to materials, production equipment, technology level gap), and some also purchase
					foreign patents components and software, pay high royalties, even if completely successful
					imitation, but the problem still exists levels of durability, which is the gap. Have
					a similar situation in China bridge construction of large mechanical equipment, such
					as drilling rigs, cranes and so on. Lower levels of generic success is not truly
					"independent research", "completely independent intellectual property rights," and
					some do not actually "complete", and some overall design of the product is to ask
					foreigners to do with the high-priced purchase. Therefore, innovation must be realistic,
					to tell the truth, should not be exaggerate. 

					Developed countries have a strong technological power innovation, invention patent
					them through continuous research and development arising, holds the industry's core
					technology. They can stand on end, not only leading the development of science and
					technology, but also through the export of capital and technology from high-end low-end
					production leadership and command of developing countries. 

					As Song Jian, former director of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said: "Our only
					way out innovation, innovation in order to break the limit, to get rid of containment,
					withstood threats, only innovation can grasp out of containment inventions and intellectual
					property rights in order. equal access to international cooperation, "the former
					president of the Chinese Academy of Comrade Zhou Guangzhou also said:." innovation
					must stand on the shoulders of giants, the "giant" is mastered the core technology,
					leading the developed technology. Therefore, we must first learn to be innovative
					application of the most advanced technology, this is a tough process to the forefront.
					If you want to further improve, it can only create new and better technology to replace
					the existing old technology, it is necessary "new channels", "innovation." 

					At the early stage of reform and opening up, we introduced a lot of international
					cooperation through advanced technology and production equipment, but very little
					digestion difficult to re-innovation. Comrade Zhu Lilan, former director of the National
					Science and Technology Commission said: "The core technology is the soul of innovation,
					while the core technology cannot be bought." So, to master the core technology, but
					also to continue to move forward, we must have a stable R&D investment, the establishment
					of a high level of R&D team, and advance technical preparations for sometime,
					in order to obtain truly original innovation and core technology, otherwise it will
					be always lag behind. 

					From concept bridge design point of view, the reform and opening up in the 1980s,
					in the study of innovation in many developed countries started in the design, there
					are some improvements. Since the 1990s, across the major rivers due to the need began
					to impact a variety of bridge-record span. To ensure the quality and improve efficiency,
					we have the introduction of foreign advanced construction equipment and design software,
					and also invited some well-known international companies to help do some of the technical
					difficulties of consulting services, has made great progress in technology, has also
					been international peer recognition and praise, can be said to have entered the advanced
					ranks. In the 21st century, some of the design and construction enterprises have
					gradually realised the importance of technological innovation, developed through
					research and development to continuously improve learning and experience in technology
					updates, have set up R&D team as a backup and technical support, it should be
					said that this is a great progress. 

					Some people think, according to its nature and intensity innovation can be divided
					into breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation. The former brings a qualitative
					change in technology is a completely different old things revolutionary change, is
					an original and pioneering technology, such as modern bridge projects described above
					60 years is about 60 original innovation, it makes modern bridge completely different
					from the modern bridge of epoch-making change. The incremental innovation is a partial
					improvement is based on the original replacement, such as a variety of new variants
					cable-stayed bridge, thin cable becomes tight rope pyramid innovation, cable corrosion
					change, the same construction method equipment replacement and advancement. This
					improvement may occur dozens a year. Thus, innovation is original or groundbreaking,
					but is associated with the core technology. The rest should be called improvements
					or updates are local quantitative and improvements based on the original. In the
					introduction of absorption based on "re-innovation", if not a breakthrough can only
					be a kind of "improvement." The "integrated innovation" was more ambiguous and difficult
					to define. 

					In short, the conceptual design of a project can have 1 to 2 real breakthrough innovations
					and technical improvements of 3 to 5 is a remarkable achievement, there can be a
					lot of innovations. Innovation in the "a" word is a creation (creation) of Italy,
					cannot arbitrarily labeled "innovative" label, but should have the support of patents,
					a qualitative change in the performance of the core technology mission to lead a
					new trend initiative. 

					1.5.4 Create Innovative Ideas 

					President of the world-famous Tung-Yen Lin International, Inc. (TY Lin International),
					American Academy of Engineering, Chinese Academy of Engineering, Foreign Member Teng
					Wenzhong said on innovation: "A bridge engineer if you do not attempt in each design
					as much as possible to improve, then he did not do due to the obligation engineer."
					"Visible, innovative ideas from the existing level of technology continues to be
					improved motivation, that past achievements and satisfied with the desire to climb
					new heights." When a series of quantitative improvements reached its limit, but it
					is difficult to solve the problem when it must be broken, namely, the need to create
					a new technology to replace old technology. At this time, there have been a qualitative
					change, an innovation was born. 

					On bridge innovative, Mr. Deng Wenzhong said in his article "urban bridges innovation,"
					innovation can be simply defined as "meaningful improvement." The so-called "meaningful"
					must add value, just to "different" and change, it makes no sense, cannot be considered
					"innovative." 

					"Modern bridge project six years," cited about 60 major innovations of modern engineering,
					including innovative bridge type and systems, new materials and connection technology,
					innovation and structural construction and ancillary equipment, innovative engineering
					methods and equipment, and innovation theory and analysis methods in five areas.
					These are original and inventive, it should be listed as the first level of the original
					innovation. And a lot of bridge engineering innovation activities is Mr. Deng Wenzhong
					said "meaningful improvements" to make existing technology to get more value, they
					are "reflected in the improvement in function and reduce costs (economy), enhanced
					durability and aesthetic effect." There is a form in the application of traditional
					concepts and methods of expanding its range of applications, because most of the
					original system and the beginning of innovative engineering methods are used for
					smaller spans, such expand or extend (expansion or extension) is also greatly promote
					the progress of the bridge, but also a creative achievement. 

					To sum up, there innovative bridge is at three levels; original (origination) and
					invention, a meaningful improvement, as well as to expand the (extension) on the
					application of the prior art. We should have great respect for pioneering achievements,
					such as Shibanpo Bridge's first hybrid continuous rigid frame bridge deck, the French
					Millau bridge's first cable-stayed bridge continuously pushing construction. To encourage
					a large number of bridge engineers "meaningful improvement", every new bridge will
					be able to do a better job than the previous one bridge to overcome the shortcomings
					and eliminate hidden dangers, step on a higher level. For the expansion of technology
					applications have certainly, but do not bother to pursue the span of, and should
					not be go barely expanding, wasteful, and thus give up on inventions to explore new
					and better technologies. Therefore, we must be "meaningful expansion", which must
					be beneficial and add value. Specifically, to get more value in the structural performance,
					economical, convenient construction, increased durability and so on. For example,
					the caps do more deep foundation piles high the greater the number of most contention
					pile, size of the caps, but in a strong river erosion, or strong earthquake zone,
					or other aspects of the anti-ship collision, high-pile platform whether it is the
					best? Are there hidden dangers and risks? We must consider whether it makes sense
					to expand this, if there is a better solution, not to pursue meaningless expansion.
					

					Mr. Deng Wenzhong said: "Innovation comes from a question." First ask why? This problem
					gives us the opportunity to challenge the conservative habits. Why only use the same
					old thing? Why should imitate, copy the original design? Why only someone did something
					we can do? 

					The second question is why not? It gives us the opportunity to introduce new ideas
					and breakthroughs constraints. Why not another way to do it? Why not try another
					material? Why cannot modify the old norms? Why not put anything else in the industry
					learn from the successful experience to solve our problems? The "Why not?" the problem
					is the core of innovative power, which lead us to be bold and innovative, play our
					greatest imaginative and creative, resulting in many new concepts and solutions,
					greatly improving the quality of conceptual design. 

					The third question is "What if"? It allows us to be cautious and conservative, that
					is properly solve new problems arise because of the creative, so creative carried
					out, without a security risk. Some people say: "Innovation will increase the risk."
					This is the traditionalist excuse is lazy in philosophy. For the result of innovation
					and the challenges and the way forward in what we need to do is overcome the difficulties,
					and it is part of the innovative ideas. 

					Among the three questions of Innovative, the last one is the key to success. 

					Mr. Deng Wenzhong stressed: "The project is a multi-program, so the engineer's duty
					is to choose the most suitable solution." Therefore, we must not meet in the conceptual
					design for "feasible", and to the pursuit of "excellence" that all aspects of the
					requirements and conditions to find an optimal solution. 

					1.5.5 Tasks and Content of Conceptual Design 

					As previously mentioned that the conceptual design is the soul of design, which showed
					the designer's creativity, imagination, innovation and spirit of exploration. 

					Imagination and conceived in the form of a bridge designer's mind, in addition to
					meeting the basic functional requirements and mechanical properties, but also consider
					a variety of important factors. Designers experiences, lessons learned from the past
					and knowledge accumulation are the basis of his creativity in the conceptual design
					of the foundation. 

					Mr. Ostenfeld K. President of the Danish company COWI Zhu Wen had described his experience
					in the conceptual design of major bridge projects, he said, "The bridge design is
					a multi-disciplinary working way (a multi-disciplinary approach), in addition to
					technology, but also there are many political, social, environmental and other common
					constraints final decision." 

					In the process of conceptual design (engineering feasibility and preliminary design
					phase), the engineer but also through more programs, select the optimal integrated
					solution from a number of viable options in order to ultimately reflect the "safe,
					practical, economic, aesthetic, durable and environmental protection," six basic
					principles as follows: 


Safety: In addition to the structure with excellent mechanical properties, but also
						contains withstand natural disasters, ship collision, anti-fire and other man-made
						disasters, other sporadic anti-risk capability and extreme (small probability events)
						as well as the case. 

Function: Refers to satisfy the deck transportation, bridge navigation, and other
						basic requirements for aviation bounding functions. 

Economics: Refers to the cost in the whole life philosophy, conservation and management
						of the economy, as well as in the design of structures for durability, constructability,
						you can check, can take full account of the conservation of nature. 

Esthetics: Conceptual design aesthetic considerations should include a variety of
						aesthetic requirements of the bridge structure as well as the coordination of the
						landscape and the surrounding environment (see Chapter 2). 

Durability: Non-durable structures will be cause great waste and damage the reputation
						of Chinese bridge. Among them, promoting the use of high performance materials and
						the development of higher durability design standards will be China's bridge in the
						future must focus on solving the issue. 

Environment Protection: Core conserve natural resources and protect the environment,
						reduce CO2 emissions and the sustainable development of scientific concept of development,
						but also important challenges of the 21st century, the world faces. Infrastructure
						in resource consumption and CO2 emissions and energy are high proportion, must draw
						the attention of bridge engineering. 


					The above six are important factors in decision-making and the right bridge design
					concept is the core mission, which must be fully demonstrated, in order to avoid
					a lack of creativity, mediocre, plagiarism, and grandiose, the blind pursuit of large
					span, weird the difficult construction, not durable, non-economic and unreasonable
					solutions by not rigorous "review" and is implemented, which greatly affect the progress
					of China's bridge. 

					Finally, the conceptual design of the content is generally divided into the following
					four steps: 


Conceiving: Imagination, conceived plan, compare the selected creative process, but
						also the conceptual design is the most important step. 

Modeling: On the idea of a structural program abstraction for analysis and calculations.
						But the conceptual design phase of analysis and calculation accuracy and technical
						design requirements are different, not the pursuit of precision, mainly to relatively
						program between, and for the next step to determine the size of the service, so approximate
						methods and means of empirical coefficients, etc., may be used. 

Dimensioning: Is an estimate of the number of the main engineering and cost, including
						the application of high-performance materials and combinations of different materials
						used. 

Detailing: For innovative systems, construction and improvement of traditional technologies
						meaningful, we must consider the relevant details of construction, so persuasive
						and creative programs, feasibility and security implementation. 


					Chapter I to V of the book will be focus on the conceptual stage and Chapter VI on
					the key size selection and mechanical accounting, Chapter VII on the details from
					design through construction, application of innovative equipment and high-performance
					materials and advanced technology, sound conceptual design to solve new problems
					arise, that is, to solve Mr. Deng Wenzhong presented "What if" the third question,
					so that creativity can be achieved. 

					1.6 CHAPTER SUMMARY 

					According to the seventh volume, the statistics, of Dr. Joseph Needham's "Chinese
					History of Science and Technology", China since about 4500 years BC to the 15th century,
					the year 3000 has contributed nearly 300 inventions, in many ways ahead of the world,
					including four great inventions and 26 are arranged in alphabetical important invention
					of the world-famous, there are pontoon (4th century BC) in bridge engineering, outrigger
					beam bridge (4th century AD), rope bridge (6th century AD), open shoulder Arch (610
					AD Sui) and consistent wooden bridge (AD 1032 Song), etc. 

					However, unfortunately, since the 16th century European Renaissance, China's creative
					activity began to decline until the demise became the famous "Needham Question":
					Why does not China modern science and technology to produce advanced why China cannot
					maintain the advantage and take the lead in creating? Industrial revolution happened
					and why China in the 19th century, the country was actually reduced bullying powers
					suffer ignorance and backwardness? 

					Some with insight pointed out: China's centralised authoritarian system of feudal
					society stifled the spirit of freedom of the Chinese people and the elite intellectuals
					had been attracted to a career via the imperial examination system and advocating
					obey the will of the emperor of a unified, thus weakening the inventions enthusiasm.
					Coupled with the complacency and lack of motivation to compete, eventually leading
					to a decline of nearly three hundred years of Chinese science and technology. We
					can say that this idea legacy still affects our younger generation of creativity.
					

					In commemoration of the founding of new China 60 years ago, we are at the historical
					turning point. After 30 years of reform and opening up efforts, Chinese bridge in
					the world community has kept up with the pace of modern bridge and entered into the
					international advanced level. 

					However, we cannot be complacent, but to acknowledge gaps and weaknesses, our way
					in innovation. Only truly master the advanced core technology innovation in order
					to get rid of containment and control of the developed countries, in order to achieve
					the great re-juvenation of the Chinese nation. Premier Wen Jiabao's recent speech
					at the University of Cambridge, said: "China to catch up with developed countries,
					there is a long-long way to go." 

					Articles of technical summaries are mostly straightforward but are lack description
					of the concepts like design and creative from foreign counterparts, instead emphasise
					more on size, such as the number of "difficult" and how "most" used words. In addition,
					many bridges are very similar, the lack of features and ideas, which is common in
					Chinese culture advocates, imitation and consistent, not to encourage negative reflecting
					the "maverick" consciousness, but also the technical progress of the taboo. 

					The Chinese nation is nation of wisdom, China's five thousand years of history and
					cultural heritage will be help us achieve revival. As long as we do not complacency,
					face inadequate and prudent, and through education reform, renewed the younger generation's
					imagination and creativity, we will be able in the near future through innovation
					efforts, from bridge to bridge solidly Liang Daguo power. 

					REVIEW QUESTIONS 


						In 60 years of the development of modern bridges, unlike in developed countries has
						created many new bridges of modern technology, is widely used around the world, what
						do you think are the ten most influential technology? And compared these advanced
						technologies, China reform and opening up 30 years built a major bridge project,
						there are several technologies which have originality? 

						China's achievements and progress in modern bridge is huge, compared to developed
						countries, but there are still gaps and weaknesses, what do you think the main reason?
						How to overcome these problems? 

						"Innovation" There are many different interpretations and positioning, which view
						you agree? Media propaganda in the "completely independent intellectual property
						rights" was, how should evaluate? 

						Are you on the "conceptual design," meaning, principles, tasks and content of a new
						understanding? In the future design work in practice, how would you go to implement
						it?

					AESTHETIC BRIDGE DESIGN 

					Efficiency, economy and elegance are considered to be the three elements of design
					guidelines since ancient Greece and its followed by the world engineers. China's
					reform and opening up previously, due to the limited economic conditions, the only
					mention of the "practical, economic, possible conditions under proper care and beautiful"
					construction principles. In the 1990s, with the national strength, this principle
					has been changed to "safe, suitable, economic, aesthetic," the eight-character principle,
					to secure a prominent position. Especially in urban bridge construction, bridge aesthetic
					requirements continue to increase, reflecting the demand for functional and aesthetic
					value of the landscape in the future to improve the lives of the bridge. Therefore,
					the aesthetic design of the bridge should be an important part of the concept of
					bridge design. As a bridge engineer, one has the responsibility to strengthen the
					aesthetic ideas in the initial stages of the design concept, engaging with beautiful
					ornamental bridges to meet people's aspirations. 

					Of course, aesthetic considerations should not violate the basic principles of technical
					safety, application and economy. Similarly, when according to technical and economical
					criteria options, nor should deviate from the target aesthetics. 

					2.1 PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION OF AESTHETICS 

					Unlike animals, humans are capable of thinking and manufacturing tools. In the tools
					era in the progress of human civilisation (from 2.5 million years ago to 50,000 years
					ago, Paleolithic and Neolithic from 50,000 years ago to 6,000 years ago), humans
					in order to survive and gradually get rid of the nascent, gregarious nest to acquisition-based
					primitive life, entered a hunting and fishing, animal husbandry, cooked and farming
					era, and the transition from a matriarchal society to a patriarchal society, the
					formation of association and the national society. In the course of evolution, humans
					are bound to ponder the nature of the moon and stars, thunder and lightning storm,
					biological growth, and reproductive senescence phenomena and human individual and
					social Relationships between groups, gradually gave birth to the original philosophy,
					which also includes Reflections on the United States. 

					Mr. Tang Huancheng stated in his book "bridge philosophy of beauty," a book mentioned
					in the introduction: "Bridge is a bridge aesthetic philosophy of beauty", "height
					is not raised to understand philosophical aesthetics." Therefore, learning bridge
					aesthetics will be certainly talk about the philosophical basis from aesthetics.
					

					2.1.1 Philosophical Foundation of the West 

					Western philosophy began in ancient Greece, 10th century BC to the 3rd century. When
					the 5th century BC, ancient Greece into the Golden Age, 331 BC, the Greek Alexander
					the Great conquered the ancient Persian empire. Development of ancient Greece's industrial,
					commercial and seafaring culture and art and promote the prosperity of philosophy,
					there has been a number of far-reaching influence on Western civilisation philosopher.
					Of which the most famous are Pythagoras (Pythagoras, 582 BC to 500 years) (Fig. 2.1),
					Socrates (Socrates, 469 BC — 399 years) (Fig. 2.2), Plato (Plato BC 427~347 years)
					(Fig. 2.3), and Aristotle (Aristotle, 384 BC — 322 BC) (Fig. 2.4), et al. 

					In ancient Greece, many natural phenomena did not have scientific explanation, but
					by virtue of the ancient Greek philosophers intuitively recognise the genius of nature
					does not change things are in motion in repose, resulting in the initial astronomy,
					meteorology, biology science and mathematics. Pythagoras that "things are harmonious
					whole number composed by the United States lies in the proper proportion and harmony
					numbers." Socrates is considered "standard of beauty is a measure of the utility,
					useful to the United States, harmful to the ugly." That is advocating social standards
					of beauty, or "functional beauty." Western political philosophy of Plato as enlightening,
					as was the slave owners to establish a national democratic system and political philosophy,
					namely, human and social norms. In terms of aesthetics, he believes that "philosophy
					is all of this, is the origin of beauty, artistic beauty is a concept of beauty to
					share." Aristotle is known as ancient Greece's greatest philosophers and scientists,
					who, as an objective materialism representative, does not agree with his teacher
					Plato's objective idealism "concept says," and that "the essence of the concept of
					beauty is not called, and in a complete form of the object", and "orderly, well-balanced
					and clear regarded as the formal beauty of the law that emphasises the beautify of
					form."

					In 284 AD, ancient Greece was conquered by the Roman Empire and became part of the
					Eastern Roman Empire. In Roman times, the dominant theology and religion, God is
					exalted as the source of beauty. As the new Plato philosopher Plotinus (AD 204~270
					years) (Fig. 2.5) stated that "God is the source of beauty." St. Augustine (Augustine
					St, AD 354~430 years) (Fig. 2.6) then said, "God is the root of all things beautiful."
					

					AD 476, the Western Roman Empire was defeated by the Northern Germanic peoples, Europe
					entered a medieval feudal period, which is the knight and theocratic despotism period
					of upto one thousand years of the Dark Ages. Italian 15th century Italian Renaissance
					Alberti (Alberti) (Fig. 2.7) defined beauty as "the harmony of the parts," and again
					to carry forward the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras' aesthetic philosophy.

					The rise of western classical school in the 18th-century generated German idealist
					philosopher Baumgarten (1714~1762) (Part Fig. 2.8), Kant (1724~1804) (Fig. 2.9) and
					Hegel Seoul (Hegel, 1770~1831) (Fig. 2.10), as well as students of Kant Schopenhauer
					(1788~1860). Western materialistic philosophy school, there are British Burke (1729~1797),
					Diderot (1713~1784) (Fig. 2.11) and the 19th-century Russian revolutionary democrat
					Czerny Schiff Chomsky (1828~1889) (Fig. 2.12). Baumgarten is known as the father
					of Western aesthetics, his book in 1750, "Aesthetics", a book advocating "Aesthetics
					is artistic beauty way to thinking, is beautiful art theory." Kant believes that
					"the aesthetic nature of the representation of an object is something purely subjective
					aspects." Hegel's idealism has established a complete aesthetic system, he believes
					that "the concept of beauty is absolutely outside by the human mind into the sensual
					image that America is the concept of emotional show."

Fig. 2.9 Kant 



Fig. 2.10 Hegel 



Fig. 2.11 Diderot 

					If the German idealist philosophy is representative of the maintaining of a medieval
					theocratic feudal rule of conservative ideas, then British philosophers represented
					materialist aesthetic system represents the emerging bourgeoisie and the Industrial
					Revolution infancy, but also inherited and developed the ancient Greek philosophy
					simple materialism. Burke believes "things change a variety of reasons constitutes
					quality beauty." Diderot is that "beauty is the thing itself attributes are present
					in our around them." Chernyshevski is presented "Beauty is Life" famous thesis, he
					stressed the objectivity of beauty that the US cannot leave people and their activities
					independently exist. 

					Before the 18th century industrial revolution, low productivity, science and technology
					was not developed. The majority of poor people cannot control their own destiny,
					but also the fear of divine nature, only in the hands of religious superstition and
					dreams afterlife transport. Imperial and theocratic religion and idealism also depend
					on the natural values and social values to maintain authoritarian rule. While a few
					pioneering scholars tend to materialism, but the force of a single potential thin,
					after all, cannot resist the ravages of the inquisition and oppression, such as the
					sufferings of Galileo (1564~1642) and Bruno (1548~1600). 

					Controversy between Philosophical idealism and materialism existed for two thousand
					years, Engels (1820~1895) (Fig. 2.13) in the "Dialectics of Nature", a book of contemporary
					natural science made great discoveries and important results summary philosophical
					idealism to materialism defeated the foundation, while drawing on the core of Hegel's
					rational, and finally to establish a correct understanding of the nature of the unique
					way—materialist dialectics. 

					Engels' comrades, the great Marx (1818~1883) (Fig. 2.14) fought in the field of social
					sciences on behalf of the oppressed working class was to establish a dialectical
					materialist conception of history and Marxist doctrine, and on this basis the formation
					of an advanced Marxist aesthetic theory. 

					2.1.2 Philosophical Foundation of the East 

					Although China entered a bronze as a symbol of the slave society of the Xia Dynasty
					(2140 BC) nearly two thousand years later than in the West, but it had developed
					rapidly, after providers and Zhou have reached the heyday of the slave society, the
					"Book of Changes" yin and yang, gossip already pregnant with the simple philosophy.
					To the Spring and Autumn Period of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 BC to 221 BC), Chinese
					society began the transition from slavery to feudalism, the emergence of contending
					ideological thinkers and cultural prosperity. Eastern philosophy whereby the originator,
					the most influential thinkers in when Confucianism and Taoism. 

					Confucian, founder of the school of Confucius (551 BC to 479 BC) (Fig. 2.15) promoted
					virtue and music, mainly the pursuit of harmony and unity of man and society. Aesthetic
					concepts of Confucianism is "Zhiyong, head concept, Bede, Praising God," stressed
					the practical beauty, shape beauty, moral beauty and spiritual beauty, namely, about
					beauty and ethical unity. 



Fig. 2.12 Chernyshevski 



Fig. 2.13 Engels 



Fig. 2.14 Marx 

					Laozi, founder of the Taoist school (about 600 BC to about 500 BC) (Fig. 2.16) advocated
					the road as the source of the universe, the main pursuit of unity and harmony of
					nature, to go in and change things opposition unity create beauty realm. 



Fig. 2.15 Confucius 



Fig. 2.16 Laozi 

					Laozi's thought inherited that from Huangdi and this is also referred to as "Huang-Lao."
					Confucius followed Zongzhou, and the two are not inconsistent, but complementary
					A. Five Emperors era, society is relatively simple, and therefore is to explore the
					relationship between Taoism main-man and nature; the Shang and Zhou, the complex
					social conflicts, wars between slaveholders frequently, and therefore more concerned
					with the relationship between Confucianism and society. However, Taoism and Confucianism
					are that the universe is constantly moving and changing world, and recognise the
					opposition and unity of yin and yang. We can say that the ancient Chinese philosophy
					already has a simple Dialectics. Especially Taoism is full of original ideas materialist
					view of nature. Thus, the ancient Chinese aesthetic thought still shining wisdom
					charm. 

					In summary, the Chinese culture respected "realistic", "practice makes perfect",
					"Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth" and so reflects the essence of
					materialism. And think things are in constant motion and change, recognise primary
					substance, also admitted that the reaction of the spirit and initiative is the essence
					of dialectics, the two combine to form a contemporary outlook of materialist dialectics.
					

					2.2 THE PRINCIPLES OF BRIDGE AESTHETICS 

					Mr. Tang Huancheng (Fig. 2.17)'s "bridge beauty philosophy," is a good summary of
					Eastern and Western philosophy based on the principles of the basic rules of bridge
					aesthetics. He particularly stressed: Any arts requires law as a rational guide,
					but to create works in practice cannot completely rely on the law, and to use their
					imagination and wisdom. Therefore, we need to know the law, as "the book calligraphy,
					painting tips, metrical poetry," but cannot make it rigid and inflexible. Here are
					several laws of bridge aesthetics. 

					2.2.1 Diversity and Unity (Change and Unity) 

					This is the first law of dialectical materialism aesthetics, because the world is
					diverse and unified. Chinese culture "and different" and "Heaven," and the Greek
					Pythagoras thought "Harmony is a unified multi-hybrid" is a meaning, namely respect
					for diversity and change things, opposed to the monotony and uniform, but not chaotic,
					but to seek unity in diversity, and unity in seeking change. 

					Mr. Tang Huancheng mentioned several times in his book the three unities are the
					most important attribute of beauty; the unity of emotional and rational, that feeling
					and consciousness of unity; unity of subjective and objective, namely, to harmonise
					the natural and human; form and content of unity, that unity of style and function.
					

					Germany's famous bridges and aesthetic specialist Prof. Leonhardt (Leonhardt F) (Fig.
					2.18) said in his monograph: "The US can change and similarities between the display,
					between the complex and orderly, and thereby be strengthened." Visible, both complex
					changes, and orderly re-unification between non-identical and non-messy show rich
					level and content is giving to enjoy the beauty and soul stirring aesthetic essence.
					

					We create beautiful bridge following the aesthetic rules should be as beliefs in
					mind, and throughout the conceptual bridge design, which reflects the bridge design
					is the most important "innovation beauty." 

					2.2.2 Ratio and Symmetry 

					Pythagoras of the ancient Greece believed that "number is the nature of things,"
					"Beauty is harmony and proportion." Here is the previously mentioned harmonious diversity
					and unity, while the proportion reflects the beauty of mathematics, or that an important
					proportion of US law. Plato also believes that "proportionate form is beautiful."
					Medieval da Vinci (Fig. 2.19) also attaches great importance to the ratio, the proportion
					he believes not only in numbers but also in sound, quality, time, location being.
					The ratio is a relative number, the proportion of the United States may exhibit symmetry,
					adaptation, decent, presenting a "proportional beauty." 

					Leon Hart said: "We first respond to the proportion of objects that width to length
					ratio, high aspect ratio, or the ratio of the size and depth in the space between."
					Grasp the concept of a variety of scales in bridge design an appropriate proportion
					between the very important. Improper proportion will be give a feeling of deformity,
					weird, ugly and distorted image. 



Fig. 2.17 Huancheng Tang 



Fig. 2.18 Leonhardt 



Fig. 2.19 Medieval Da Vinci 

					Symmetry is not only a uniform and symmetrical, collectively, but also contains the
					right proportion, meaning decent match. Chinese Literary Arts pay attention to symmetry,
					such as the poetry of duality, couplet, buildings are arranged symmetrically around
					the central axis stress, gives a solemn, balance and beauty. Symmetry reflects the
					unity of the opposition and philosophy, that up and down, left and right, and echoes
					similar before and after, but not exactly similar. 

					Strict symmetry represents dignified beauty, but can be too serious, strict and gives
					a dull feeling. Sometimes forcibly arranged in irregular environments symmetrical
					structure but will result in consequences clumsy and uncoordinated. In the terrain
					and the river bridge asymmetric-asymmetric arrangement but give people a kind of
					wisdom and coordinated beauty. Similarly, in the height of a small navigable waterway
					insist arranged oversized lower span of the bridge, will be lose the proportion of
					the beauty, people feel very depressed, and wasteful. 

					2.2.3 Balance and Harmony 

					Bridges is a force-bearing structure, rather than a craft, and therefore must emphasise
					balance of forces. Its body shape to obey the laws of mechanics, gives a sense of
					security and stability. Also, handle the balance between security and economic, to
					"make the best use, rational distribution" to avoid waste. 

					China put great emphasis on aesthetics of relative harmony and unity between two
					opposite features, such as rigid and soft, harmony with the movement of Yin and Yang
					and the actual situation, etc., between 4 opposites, reflecting a "harmonious beauty."
					

					All arts are inseparable from the rigid, requiring there are just soft, firmness
					and flexibility. In the bridge, there are just beams with flexible and rigid arch
					flexible beam, the beam is also flexible with just the tower and the tower just soft
					beam. 

					Another manifestation of rigid-soft is still and movement. In the plastic arts should
					behave out in a static, static in action, showing the movement changes, relaxation,
					advance and retreat of harmony and unity. 

					Yin and Yang was originally the collective sum of opposing faces, natural light and
					dark, cold and heat, fine buildings and rough, complex and simple, reflects a harmonious
					and orderly change between Yin and Yang. 

					The essence of the actual situation of Chinese aesthetics is virtual and real, imaginary
					in reality, is the highest in a virtual realm of art, the creation of the bridge
					will be a great inspiration. 

					In short, the structure should be the shape and design of various antagonistic relationship,
					such as security and economic balance and harmony, load and strength. Therefore,
					the bridge will be able to shape the beauty reflecting all aspects of balance and
					harmony between the various parts, namely, to find the most reasonable force system,
					most economical and most convenient arrangement structure construction technology
					to simultaneously showing the bridge. "Mechanics beauty," "Balance of beauty" and
					"Harmonious beauty." 

					2.2.4 Rhythm and Coordination 

					Rhythm is at the heart of art, but also the focus of any art trauma and feelings.
					

					British engineer Faber stated in the "aesthetic concept of civil engineering design,":
					"a structure to the beauty, there must be touching interest (excite interest), and
					attractive (charm)". English "charm" of the term can be translated attractive word
					charm, magic, the equivalent of the Chinese "charm." 

					German professor Leon Hart said in the book "Bridge Aesthetics and Design," bridge
					construction needs charm (reize), which is intended charm or rhythm. 

					Chinese and foreign poetry should rhyme according to certain rules to reflect the
					change and repeat rhythm or regular, making it touching beauty, in order to achieve
					"character" or "charm" of the overall artistic charm. 

					In the overall design of the bridge, in the main bridge and the parts, the main hole
					and side hole, superstructure and substructure, bridge and harmony with the surrounding
					environment (culture, geography, landscape), the goal is to find this rhythm and
					charm and to achieve seamless and "coordinated beauty". 

					In summary, the aesthetic design of the shape of the bridge is to make a bridge to
					reflect global and local innovation (change) United States, unified the beauty, the
					proportion of beauty, balance beauty, harmony and beauty, rhythm and coordination
					of the beauty, so the bridge in its life not only has the function of traffic, and
					can never get tired of its charm, gives a sense of beauty, when people through the
					bridge will be a beauty, physical and mental feeling of pleasure. As the American
					philosopher John Ruskin said: "When we build a project, not only for current use,
					should it become a future generations will thank us work." 

					2.2.5 Innovations and Aesthetic Considerations in Conceptual Bridge Design 

					In section 1.5.4, it is has already cited Mr. Deng Wenzhong words:. "A bridge engineer
					if you do not attempt to make improvements in each design as much as possible, then
					he did not try to engineer bounden duty," he did here said, "innovation", but with
					the "improvements", in fact, improved innovation was derived from the idea that does
					not repeat old, have been found for the problems and shortcomings of the past cannot
					repeat, but to be overcome to improve the existing technology, the constant development,
					has become a source of innovation. 

					Innovative, safe, plus art is Deng's design philosophy. Among them, the last of the
					"Art" is the concept of bridge design aesthetic considerations. He said, "Engineers
					should make this world more beautiful and proud", "relative to the mediocre designs,
					people are more concerned about the appearance of the bridge, but also willing to
					pay more to keep their aesthetic appearance of the bridge is more durable, "and that"
					if there is a bridge engineer aesthetic accomplishment, slightly a little effort
					you can put a bridge made very beautiful. "he added," progress is the accumulation
					of innovation. "Engineers must make every building we built through innovation, while
					ensuring the safety applies more economical and more beautiful. 

					Leonhardt professor of Germany in his "bridge aesthetics and design" (Bridge Aesthetics
					and Design) introduces the creative process to bridge engineer of the creative process.
					


						The design is based on a variety of information and completely digested in mind;
						

						To understand the scope of application of various types of bridges and adept in the
						heart; 

						The original idea in the minds of possible solutions; 

						Lays out the first sketch, drawn in accordance with an appropriate proportion of
						the preliminary general arrangement and approximate size of each portion; 

						To continue the consider other possible scenarios for comparison; 

						The sketch on the wall of the programs they watch, and asked questions of peers and
						colleagues and critics to discuss the appropriate construction method; 

						The satisfaction of the draft can be drawn for a large proportion of the map, and

					2.3 SUCCESS STORIES IN THE WORLD OF BRIDGE AESTHETIC DESIGN—WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL
					BRIDGES OF THE 20TH CENTURY 

					In 1999, the British "Bridge Design and Engineering" magazine held a 20th century
					world's most beautiful bridge contest. Magazine editorial department invited 30 internationally
					renowned bridge academics, engineers and architects, including the United States,
					Tung-Yen Lin and Deng, the German Schlaich J, French Virlogeux, Menn Switzerland
					and the United Kingdom Firth, Flint and Head, etc. Call for comments on the 20th
					century's most beautiful bridges. Although tens of thousands of bridge built-in the
					20th century, but in the end only 15 were nominated bridge, the top three receiving
					most of the votes are: 


						Salginatobel Bridge (Fig. 2.20) designed by Swiss engineer Maillart R. in 1930. This
						is a cross-valley sickle deck arch bridge. Architects said: "Walking on the bridge
						is a real spiritual enjoyment you and mountains, white clouds, blue sky so close,
						it constitutes a beautiful Alpine landscape.", "All parts of the bridge are just
						right, impeccable. This is truly a combination of fine art and bridges." 

						Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco (Fig. 2.21) designed by American engineer J.B.
						Strauss in 1937, with Swiss engineer Amman (Fig. 2.23) as consultants. It's comment:
						"It's sleek, proportion, is the jewel in the bridge project, so that the designers
						of this century has been unable to go beyond."

						15. Danish Great Belt Bridge (Fig. 2.34), COWI company Ostenfeld K Design (1997), 


					This is not the longest span suspension bridge in the 20th century, but the unique
					design of the bridge towers and anchorages gives a deep impression. 

					Among the above 15 are suspension bridges, Golden Gate bridge, Booz Poros Bridge,
					and Great Belt Bridge; 5 Stayed Bridges: Severin Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge, East Carolina,
					Normandy Bridge, Tatara Bridge and Ting Kau Bridge; 3 Arch Bridges; Sarkisyan Valley
					Bridge, Sydney Bridge, Fehmarn Belt Bridge; 4 plate pull bridge: Kish Beckham Bridge,
					Olin Bridge, Shengniboge bridge, Gan Patel Bridge.

Fig. 2.33 Fehmarn Belt bridge, Germany. 

					From the above the nationality of the bridge designer one can appreciate the country's
					contribution to the aesthetics as well as the artistic accomplishment of the designer
					himself. Among them, four in Germany, Switzerland and France all three, England two,
					the United States, Denmark and Japan each one. 

					It can be seen from this authoritative selection that span is not the most important
					factor. The top three winners were arch, hanging rope bridge and the bridge, but
					not the maximum span of this bridge type. Ranked fourth and the fifth are two overpass
					spans are 35 m and 53 m. World-known names of the bridge agree, "Do not bother to
					pursue the longest span." Span should be meet navigable and natural topographic and
					geologic conditions determine the requirements, how the safety and under the premise
					of making a bridge designed to be more applicable economic, more beautiful is what
					we should strive for the ideal.

					All the selected 15 bridges have a higher aesthetic and landscape value, convincingly.
					In appreciation of the process, we will realise the beauty of their innovations,
					the proportion of beauty, balance beauty, harmonious beauty, rhythm, coordination
					and harmonisation of the US America. As a learning object, let some aesthetic problems
					on the domestic large-span bridges were cross-sectional analysis and find out some
					errors and gaps in order to strengthen our bridges in the future aesthetic considerations
					design. 

					2.4 SUCCESS STORIES IN CHINESE AESTHETIC DESIGN OF BRIDGES 

					Although China has not been nominated for the bridge in the 20th century's most beautiful
					bridge in the selection, but in many Chinese bridge also has aesthetic value was
					recognised by some bridges the public and industry experts. Here are 10 (arranged
					by the completion of age) in innovation and the United States, the proportion of
					the United States, the mechanical beauty, beauty and modeling aspects of successful
					examples of coordinated beauty. 

					2.4.1 Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (1968) 

					In 1959, China began the Sino-Soviet split and the journey of self-construction of
					the Yangtze River Bridge. Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (Fig. 2.35) In addition there
					are many technological advances in the form of steel and foundation engineering aspects,
					the main span of 160 m of continuous steel truss used to increase the stiffness of
					the third string, aesthetically also received a magnificent appearance.

					2.4.7 Lupu Bridge (2003) 

					Main span of 550 m, the Lupu Bridge (Fig. 2.41) has a span of a world record in the
					steel arch bridge, but does not have the conventional parallel truss arch form, and
					the use of more aesthetic in basket-style box bearing rib arch. Due to the quality
					of the rib segments box reached 480t, in the face of the inclined arch Cantilevering
					is a huge challenge. While much of the construction costs of steel, and to overcome
					the difficulties of construction control, but the aesthetics point of view, than
					the box-shaped arch truss rib arch more modern. 2008, Lupu Bridge gained international
					bridge association's outstanding architecture award.

					2.5 CHINA BRIDGE AESTHETICS DESIGN PROBLEM ANALYSIS 

					2.5.1 On the Rationality of Bridge Main Hole Span 

					Main hole span of bridge is the most important aspect in long-span bridges scale,
					which determines the bridge type selection. Main hole (Navigable) navigation bridge
					span must first meet the requirements, taking into account the main pier anti-ship
					collision safety. China's inland waterways is no clear uniform standard, they use
					a bridge deliberations, after the Ministry of Transport Water Transport Department
					to conduct feasibility studies depending on the circumstances at the bridge site
					fairways make case decisions. In this case, since the revetment work is limited to
					China waterway near the city zone, resulting in a large and stable enough swing waterway,
					plus there are still a large number of small vessels and large tugs hit pier accident,
					waterway sector is often calls for increasing the main span of the bridge to ensure
					navigation safety. There are also the owners in order to pursue "the span of the
					first", indicating the use of excessive force span, which brought the ratio between
					the bridge across the main navigable height and disorders, but create a sense of
					oppression. 

					The normal ration of main span (two-way navigation) to the navigable clear height
					falls between 15 m to 18 m, the maximum should not be exceed 20 m. An arrangement
					of two navigable holes (top and bottom rows of holes navigation), the main span and
					the clear height ratio should be 10 or less. However, there are many domestic large-span
					bridges have exceeded this proportion. Since the main crossing points is too large,
					so that cable-stayed bridge pylon height above deck and below deck height imbalance,
					especially when used in deck elevation elected at the legs of the gem-shaped pylon,
					it shows the lower part too short and tall enough to affect the aesthetics of the
					bridge tower shape. 

					A Case Study of Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, the bridge main span of 628 m, while
					the navigation bridge is only 24 m in height restricted Nanjing Bridge upstream,
					resulting ratio between the two is 26.2. Tower high above the deck for 150 m, above
					and below deck tower higher than 150/24 = 6.25, which creates the effect of short
					leg pylon gem type (Fig. 2.45), make cable-stayed bridge in overall lack of beauty.
					In contrast, the Shanghai Nanpu Bridge and Yangpu Bridge pylon shaped gem because
					there upright sense of proper proportion. 



Fig. 2.45 Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. 

					In the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (Wuhan-Nanjing section), in order to meet
					the requirements of navigable inland level (clear height 24 m), the use of cable-stayed
					bridges with the main span of 400~500 m is a reasonable choice for the economy. If
					the underlying low construction cost can also be used across 160~200 m of multi-beam
					bridge to meet up and down the rows of holes navigation. However, in the blind pursuit
					of large-span, but there have been some misguided thinking across a river 800~1000
					m span cable-stayed bridge, and even super-kilometer suspension bridge. At this point,
					span and bridge clearance height ratio much higher than the 20 : 1, even upto 50
					: 1 entire deck "lying" on the water, completely lost beauty. Moreover, the cost
					is very expensive, and the adjacent smaller bridge span is also very coordinated.
					France, Greece, in the design of the Strait of Rion-Antirion bridge, in order to
					meet the requirements of 180000t of navigation, the use of multi-span cable-stayed
					bridge 560 m (Fig. 2.46). Between Denmark and Germany Fei Manen Channel Bridge, for
					the navigation 260,000t seagoing vessel, the recommended solution is multi-span 780
					m double rail-cum Cable Stayed Bridge, bridge truss Composite Beam (Fig. 2.47), a
					solution worth learning. 



Fig. 2.46 Rion-Antirion Channel Bridge, Greece. 



Fig. 2.47 Fei Manen Channel Bridge. 

					2.5.2 Facade Layout Symmetry 

					Arranged in accordance with the position of the main channel fairway hole layout
					principles is a quite natural layout. However, some owners prefer regardless of position
					in the water channel width symmetrically arranged, or even ask to move the channel
					by channel diversion works and dredging, which is very unreasonable. 

					Facades of foreign long-span bridges are mostly arranged to determine the position
					of the main hole span and in accordance with channel centerline, while the edge of
					the hole at the actual water depth and geological conditions are arranged left-right
					asymmetry (left and right edges of different pore size). As the water widens, it
					can also be arranged in a symmetrical side hole, plus about the length of different
					non-navigable water hole bridge, to form an asymmetric distribution holes in general,
					and to indicate to the navigation of the ship channel the water side of the actual
					bias location. Sometimes, you can also employ single tower cable-stayed bridge asymmetric
					arrangement or the use of collaborative systems to adapt to nature, and to achieve
					the purpose of the economic fabric of the hole. 

					Take the design of a bridge to the program as an example [Fig. 2.48(a)], because
					the owners unreasonably required by the symmetrical arrangement of the water and
					had to increase the span of the main hole to 428 m, and the need to move the channel
					46.5 m, in order to meet shipping requirements, navigable but still biased side of
					the main pier, increasing the risk of ship collision. Moreover, increasing the main
					hole is not conducive to the stability of the whole economy and arch bridges, but
					also increases the difficulty of construction. 

					Instead, the use of asymmetric arrangement [Fig. 2.48(b)] not only conforms to the
					natural, to the economy and security in general, but also in the aesthetic point
					of view, a reasonable asymmetrical arrangement can also be presenting a beauty. 



Fig. 2.48 Facade arrangement of a bridge (size unit: m) (a) Arranged symmetrically;
						(b) Are arranged asymmetrical. 

					2.5.3 The Side Holes Scales in Cable-stayed Bridge 

					The ratio of side hole and central hole in the twin tower cable-stayed bridge is
					a question of the overall arrangement must focus consideration. According to earlier
					studies, Professor Leonhardt of Germany, in order to control the magnitude of stress
					tail cord to ensure its anti-fatigue properties, the tail rope must reserve sufficient
					internal forces of dead-load, live-load so that the positive and negative changes
					caused by the internal forces without causing too much stress amplitude. One important
					measure is appropriate to shorten the length of side spans of dead-load to increase
					the tail rope tension, and dead-load and live-load than the smaller side span and
					is also smaller than the mid-span. 

					At anchor when the ratio of maximum stress to minimum stress is under kac = 0. 4,
					relationship shown in Table 2.1 can be drawn from Fig. 2.49. 

					Domestic cable-stayed bridge, a strong side beams and pouring of concrete at the
					ends of the hole plus the weight of the transition are commonly used to to provide
					balance weights, there will be a mutation in the shape of the beam, affect the appearance.
					It is mostly used in foreign countries made a long pull anchor seat, anchor pier
					on the use of weight to balance the tail rope pull force, and set the continuous
					transition pore (transition span), the joints move to the rear end of the transition
					pore to optimize the structure at the anchor pier, as shown in Fig. 2.50. 



Fig. 2.49 Beam stiffness affect the relationship between la/lm and p/g of (kac =
						0. 4 time).

					2.5.4 The Arrangement of the Auxiliary Pier in Cable-stayed Bridge Side Span 

					Whether applying auxiliary pier on the side span is an important issue to be considered
					in the preliminary design. 

					If the side spans are in the water and often the same structure is used throughout
					the bridge deck, then an auxiliary pier is used mainly to resist high wind resistance
					cantilever construction phase, because the balance will-enable shimmy double cantilever,
					construction boom length frequency increases with a sharp decline, with a corresponding
					wind stability also decreased, but increased the amplitude of the cantilever end
					of construction very unfavourable. In the side span navigable meet the conditions
					required, you can set an auxiliary pier, in order to advance the fixed side of the
					cantilever, the formation of a single cantilever construction better stability. 

					When the side spans are arranged on the shore, you can use the mixing deck approach,
					that edge may be more economical PC across the deck and arranged a number of shore-side
					pier, so that the force to meet the high beam simply supported beam construction
					phase state requirements, and with the cross-beam of high co-herence. 

					Side span of the pier can be uniformly arranged [such as France Normandy bridge,
					Fig. 2.51(a)], can also be arranged unevenly, across the river to the shore that
					is gradually decreasing cross direction, in order to achieve a sense of rhythm aesthetic
					[such as Hong Kong Ngong Shuen Island Bridge, Fig. 2.51(b)]. 



Fig. 2.51 Arrangement of shore side span in cable-stayed bridge pier aid (size unit:
						m) (a) Nommandy bridge; (b) Stonecutters bridge. 

					2.5.5 Pyramid Select and Proportion 

					Pylon cable-stayed bridge is an important factor in the landscape, we must attach
					great importance to the proportion of its shape and size, and the latter more important.
					

					The tower of built bridges can be summarized as follows: 


						Gantry towers parallel to the surface of the cable and H-shaped towers (vertical
						column and diagonal column). 

						A-shaped ramp tower cable plane, inverted Y-shaped towers, as well as the legs to
						form a bridge following gem-shaped pylons. 

						Single column towers wit single cable plane of (Stonecutters Bridge in Hong Kong),
						and after additional cable plane cable-stayed to ramp-shaped tower mixed gems (such
						as the Ting Kau Bridge in Hong Kong). 




Fig. 2.52 Various cable-stayed bridge tower. 

					Various pyramids as shown in Fig. 2.52. 

					In these tower designs pay special attention to the two proportional: 


						Height of tower above the deck to bridge width ratio H2/B. 

						The deck height and full-tower high ratio H1/H. 


					High tower cable-stayed bridge deck above the main span L and economy than H2/L ≈
					0.2~0.25. As most of the domestic requirements of six-lane bridge deck width, namely,
					B ≥ 30 m. If you wish to H2/B upto 4 or more, to make sense of the pyramid there
					is upright, the main span of L must satisfy the requirements of the following formula:
					



					Obviously, cable-stayed bridge with span less than 500 m, if the bridge width is
					more than 30 m, the ratio of H2/B is not good enough, the pyramid will be look chunky
					and not beautiful. 

					Navigation bridge deck clearance height determines the deck height H1, if they wish
					a H/H1 ratio less than 4, the main span of L should satisfy the requirements of the
					following formula: 





					Thus the follows are deducted: 



					As mentioned earlier, such as the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, the bridge height
					less than 30 m, main span of 628 m, is inappropriate and unnecessary in the navigation.
					Under the bridge span is too large to make the legs after Chantha than the total
					height of the tower is too small, resulting in poor aesthetics short legs. Similarly,
					Su Tong Bridge's main span of 1088 m, but insufficient headroom under the bridge
					60 m, such as the use of the legs of the proportion of gem-shaped pylons are not
					good enough, do not use inverted Y-shaped legs of the tower is more beautiful, is
					the right choice. 

					Hong Kong's Stonecutters Bridge's main span is 1018 m, bidding plans such as single
					column bridge pylon tower, A-shaped towers, inverted Y-shaped towers all avoided
					the imbalance problem caused by legs. 

					In addition to Nanjing Bridge, the Yueyang Dongting Lake Bridge, white sandbar Bridge
					and Runyang Bridge Auxiliary Channel Bridge also used gem-shaped pylon legs, the
					height of its deck following a high percentage of the total column and are small,
					giving a sense of short legs, affecting the aesthetics of the bridge tower. Each
					of the bridge are the result of the irrational pursuit of large-span. Only when the
					main span to navigable headroom maintain proper proportions, can sleek pylon be achieved.
					

					2.5.6 Asymmetric Single Tower Cable-stayed Bridge and Collaboration System 

					Bend in the river at a mainstream bank often tend to form asymmetric riverbed section.
					In this case the use of asymmetric single tower cable-stayed bridge is more appropriate,
					such as Germany Rhine Flehe bridge (Fig. 2.53). Shoal in the side span can be arranged
					into a small cross, and the use of PC deck, while the steel bridge across the river,
					forming a very economical and easy mixing deck construction. 



Fig. 2.53 Flehe German Rhine bridge. 

					The First single tower cable-stayed bridge using
					the collaboration system was the United States East Huntington Bridge (Fig. 2.54).
					Since the river side of the bridge approach across multi-span continuous form beams,
					cantilevered and then use the relative access cable-stayed bridge formed a collaborative
					system. In order to make use of the side beams and double cable-stayed bridge deck
					and use a central box girder continuous girder bridge can smooth docking, you must
					set a transitional period, so that the bridge structure is more complex, which is
					a drawback collaborative system. 

					Our Zhaobaoshan Bridge has a similar topography, also used the transition period
					with a single tower cable-stayed bridge and the bridge connecting structure of the
					cooperative system. Although the cable-stayed bridge cantilever bridge construction,
					due to improper control of the emergence of the web and the bottom of the box girder
					section crush accident, but after the removal and repair damage zones and construction
					control method has been adjusted and pre-stressed arranged after successfully built
					a bridge. Clearly, as long as the design and construction handled properly, this
					cooperative system with single tower cable-stayed bridge in the special terrain is
					very appropriate. 



Fig. 2.54 US East Huntington bridge. 

					2.5.7 Arrangement of Side Span in Suspension 

					Suspension currently uses the vertical arrangement of double cable plane (large-span
					suspension bridge there may be cases of three cable plane or spatial cable plane),
					and therefore is not appropriate pyramid changes, mostly using gantry bridge tower,
					the only difference is the number of beams. 

					The main problem is in the main span to determine how the terrain conditions appropriately
					furnished by side span. When the side span to cross the water and the long, hanging
					on the main cable is necessary to form a three-span continuous deck. Such as pylons
					already ashore, direct access to the main cable anchorage, but with the formation
					of small independent single-span suspension bridge span bridge approach. When the
					cross-strait situation is not the same, while there may be side span continuous deck,
					while the asymmetric arrangement of small independent cross, and even using some
					of the suspension, a small cross-section independent special arrangement, not in
					order to construct and calculate the simple use of unreasonable symmetrical arrangement.
					Typical arrangement of side span suspension bridge shown in Fig. 2.55. 



Fig. 2.55 Suspension facade arrangement (dimensions: m) (a) Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong
						Kong; (b) Dragon Bridge, Hong Kong. 

					2.5.8 Proper Height of Main Beam Girder 

					Girder suspension and cable-stayed bridge girder selection is an important issue
					in the conceptual design factors to be considered are the following two aspects.
					

1. Coordination between the Main Bridge and the Height of Bridge Approach Main Girder


					Suspension bridges with large span or cable-stayed bridge with Facade layout span
					on both sides of the main bridge should be accompanied by a certain length of bridge
					approach. Approach bridge type usually choose economic aperture as 50 ~ 70 m of small
					and medium-span continuous beam or a simply supported beam, high beam is 2.5~3 m
					deep. In order to make the entire bridge deck has a uniform height of the sides in
					order to achieve a coherent aesthetic, the height of the main bridge deck and bridge
					approach should be close to the height of the main beam, avoid large jumps. 

2. Meet the Wind-proof Requirements of Large Span Bridge 

					From the perspective of wind stability, suspension and cable-stayed bridge on the
					main beam height requirements are different. Most mining suspension with parallel
					straight cable plane, this time mainly depends on the main girder high torsional
					stiffness and provide corresponding torsional frequency, and therefore the main beam
					height should not be too small. As the Danish Great Belt bridge final selection 4.5
					m high beam depth with aspect ratio of B & h main beam =  =  ≤ 7,
					to obtain enough to twist and twist frequency ratio. Run Yang Yangtze Bridge using
					high beam is small, although the lateral wind loads can be reduced, but the twist
					frequency is low, so that lack of stability, and finally had additional central stabilising
					plate to meet the wind requirements. Long Span Bridge is generally used oblique arrangement
					of cable plane. At this time, due to the oblique cable plane (structural measures)
					provide a good torsional capability, high beam girder can be small as much as possible,
					through a wider aspect ratio to reduce wind resistance and vortex shedding. Such
					as the use of parallel cable planes and even a central single cable plane cable-stayed
					bridge, you still need to consider the main beam should have sufficient height and
					torsional rigidity. When using separate double box and slotted central section (aerodynamic
					measures), the main beam height can be chosen to be as small as possible, because
					the separation tank has provided sufficient aerodynamic stability. 

					2.6 CHAPTER SUMMARY 

					Bridge aesthetics philosophy is that every bridge engineer must have the basic literacy.
					We designed the bridge in addition to the life of each period to maintain the excellent
					quality of service, you must also give the user the enjoyment of beauty, that bridge
					not only have traffic function, but also has aesthetic and landscape value. 

					Famous bridge in the world are beautiful, and beautiful bridge will get more protection,
					will be more durable. With the improvement of people's living standards, people will
					continue to require strengthening of bridge aesthetics, and even willing to increase
					a certain percentage of the cost of programs to choose more beautiful, but not the
					most economical solution. However, the appearance does not necessarily rely on more
					money, but through innovative efforts to find the ratio of the structure, balance
					and harmony, tend to force the most reasonable performance, most economical and most
					convenient structure construction, but also can be the most beautiful bridge. 

					Well-known foreign design companies have a high bridge engineer aesthetic qualities,
					but also to establish long-term cooperative relationship with the architect, the
					whole concept of the design process in constant communication and discussion, to
					seek technical and artistic coordination and harmonisation. 

					Chinese bridge design profession shows inadequate attention to aesthetics, and the
					lack of participation and collaboration of architects, and sometimes there is interference
					and misconceptions affect homeowners, there have been some flaw in violation of aesthetic
					principles and mistakes, hoping to learn a lesson, to overcome this deficiency, and
					constantly improve the level of Chinese aesthetics of the bridge.

BASIC FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 

The basic concept of the design factors that should be considered include other natural
conditions, function and various bridge type and basis of suitability and investment.


Natural conditions is an objective at the bridge site, not to change the will of
the designer, we have through research, collect and test analysis to fully understand
and fully grasp it. Extensive research, such as the river regime, must be at the
bridge site over the years of hydrological data, the reaction riverbed erosion and
siltation, the deep channel stability, etc., over the years bathymetry and tidal
information, etc., to make sub-holes are arranged to meet the riverbed underwater
environment the laws of nature, laws of nature without destroying hydrology, but
also to ensure the structural safety of the bridge. Conversely, if the destruction
of the hydrological environment, leading to a lot of erosion and siltation, causing
riverbed changes, deep grooves change, will be affect shipping, affect bridge safety.
Therefore, through full study, understanding and digesting the results of the rational
use of the thematic biography bridge natural conditions, the concept can be scientifically
designed to meet these natural conditions, a basic safety requirement for conceptual
design. 

Functional orientation must be subject to the objective requirements of engineering
construction and road construction, urban construction, transportation construction
and shipping master planning regulatory documents. Determine the functions to meet
the functional requirements, including bridges flat, vertical alignment design, layout,
and other section shall meet the requirements of the traffic feature, set the main
navigation and sub-hole layout should meet the requirements of the shipping function,
the applicability of the concept design of the basic requirements. 

A variety of bridge type and applicability is one of the bases of the professional
knowledge, only more learning, more accumulation, in order to ensure the creation
of the designer has a scientific basis and foundation of all kinds of bridge type
has its history, characteristics and stress the applicability of the concept is designed
to meet the scientific laws, can only local conditions and constant innovation. 

Economy is a basic requirements of designers from the state, conceptual design must
comply with reasonable requests economy. Rational innovation economy is the real
technical innovation, meaningful innovation. To understand the evolution of technical
suitability, as well as the scope of the various forms of bridge-variety basis, and
know how to use economic point of concept selection. This is the conceptual design
of technological innovation and economic rationality of the basic requirements. 

3.1 A VARIETY OF NATURAL CONDITIONS AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 

Collection of natural conditions and functional planning and other basic information
are done mostly through the professional sector or industry department in the form
of research reports and raw data for statistical analysis and inference, through
a certain review or approval procedures provided for bridge designers its use. Of
course, the study of these thematic information itself requires a certain period,
so that the work is often synchronised with the design phase, a phased approach.
Such as engineering feasibility study stage, you need to geophysical and geological
data for individual drill hole data available to the preliminary design phase requires
Chukan geological reports, construction design phase of the project requires detailed
geological survey data reports. 

Conceptual design must submit the appropriate depth of these basic data requirements
for the outcome, as the basis of the information or documents conceptual design,
of course, it does not need as much detail as the preliminary design and construction
design, comprehensive, but require accurate, able to seize the natural conditions
or functional orientation characteristics, difficulties and points. 

Natural conditions and functions of the conceptual design is the first step, and
it is an important step. 

3.1.1 Natural Conditions 

Natural conditions include river regime, hydrology, climate meteorology, topography,
geology water quality, environmental and earthquakes, this section describes each
of these bridge conditions at the same time, by engineering examples illustrate how
to analyse, use of the information, how to make the conceptual design for to meet
these basic conditions. 

These data used in the conceptual design phase generally has two aspects: on the
one hand, the understanding of these materials on the basis of digestion, to seize
their core elements and control conditions, the formation of the embryonic form of
our ideas and layout; the second aspect, calculation and analysis (macro and control)
for general and key components, verification and adjustment of previous ideas and
arrangements. As for the geological data, you first need based on geological data
and other relevant data to form the basis for discussion and conceptual design and
form the basis of this kind of basic size, construction methods and key technologies
controlling data, followed by application of geological information related to the
macroparameters to checking the feasibility of the basic program. 

1. River Regime 

In the river dynamics, river regime is defined as a plane posture rivers, including
the mainstream lines, waterlines and flat morphology (e.g., branch road, corners,
edges beach, the heart of the beach, riverbank, floodplain) posed and surface phenomena
is about the form of the elements of assembly, sometimes referred to as the basic
river flow potential. In addition, there are also pointed out that the definition
of river is river flow situation and development trend of the plane. Include: changes
in the distribution and trend of river flow dynamic axis position, direction, and
the bay, shoreline and sandbars, beaches and other heart. 

Evolution of river bed is a branch derived from the research and practice of river
regulation process by engineering and technical personnel and technology workers
from a broad riverbed evolution out of pure research to a separate branch of the
flow plane change. Therefore, the river regime change is the interaction of water
and sediment and bed boundary conditions, the results of mutual influence. 

The main factors influencing the evolution of river generally include the following
three aspects: 


Water and sediment conditions: mainly refers to the total amount and the process
of entering the water and sediment downstream. 

River border: mainly refers to accommodate the main features and parameters and constraints
river border movement of water. 

Project boundary: mainly refers to the case of other works by the stream length,
arranged in the form, size and spacing between the upper and lower engineering convergence
as well as engineering. 


Overall, the main concern when choosing the bridge site is about how over the years
in the area of the riverbed mechanical action of the water, the main river channel,
waterway and other elements of the situation, determine the extent of the impact
the stability of the natural elements, and after the bridge on these basic conditions.


River regime also inflience the location of navigable hole layout and thus plays
a decisive role. 

Example 3.1. Taizhou Yangtze River Road Bridge over election. 

Reach for the comparison of Zhenjiang Yangtze river bridge site from the existing
shoreline conditions and planning, as well as the stability of river areas, identified
three possible positions, namely, Wing Chau North, South Wing Chau Bridge eight bits.
Fig. 3.1 Taizhou Yangtze River Highway Bridge segment total plane. 

Wing Chau Pak channel on the right bank of the water turning red top position, the
downstream heart bypass beach area, look left and right support thalweg still swing
within a certain range from years of data analysis, but the range is limited, cross-sectional
area over the water, river width, average depth change is limited. 1998 more after
the changes tend to be small, river regime basically stable. Fig. 3.2 shows a cross-sectional
Wing Chau North Bridge bits. 

Wing Island South Corridor is wide and shallow riverbed, was typical W-shaped, central
to the heart of the beach, the main features of evolution: Heart on the beach above
mentioned diversion point decline occurred when the heart beach plane position is
not stable enough, about thalweg appears limited swing (over 200 meters), the river
regime is relatively stable. Fig. 3.3 shows a cross-sectional Wing Chau South Bridge
bits. 

Eight bridge has wide and shallow river channel, deep grooves stickers right, U-shaped
cross-section, the deep grooves on both sides of the development of this position
closely with upstream over the hearts of Boat Harbour Beach, while the confluence
point of the lateral movement of a large (500 m), 1998 years later, and have put
on the right. Beach and river regime by heart day Xingzhou greater impact. Fig. 3.4

2. Hydrologic 

That is flow, flow, water quality, tidal, wave and other basic information on the
maximum and minimum navigable water level, of bridge site area and needed for bridge
design, constant level, the design frequency of flood level, wave height, wave power,
etc., design parameters. 

According to "General Specification for Highway Bridge Design" (JTG D60-2004), freeway,
highway design flood frequency Bridge 1/300, 1/100 Bridge. 

The pier is located in the water, the water pressure should be calculated, and so
the role of wave forces on piers, bridge tower. 

Example 3.2 Wuhan White Sandbar Bridge. 

Wuhan White Sandbar Bridge is City Master Plan linking the north and south sides
of another traffic arteries, the Hankou hydrological station, 11.1 km downstream,
during which the Han river to import, according to statistics, the average annual
flow of the Han river accounts for about 6% Hankou station, average annual sediment
load accounted for 10.8% Hankou station, therefore, Hankou hydrological station sediment
eigenvalues basically reflects the bridge site reaches of run-off and sediment conditions.

From the run-off and sediment from the Hankou station statistics, Hankou station
to sediment run-off during the year mainly concentrated in the flood season in October,
73.3% of its accounts for the year runoff, sediment accounts for the year 84%, more
sediment than to focus on the flood water. 

Wuhan river flood control standard shows, according to the Yangtze river flood control
planning, once in a century flood contained within dikes and flood diversion area
upstream of the joint use of the standard range of defense, while the water level
in Wuhan dike designed for the highest level measured in 1954, 27.64 m (Yellow Sea
elevation, the same below), therefore, the use of bridge design water level with
the corresponding values of 27.99 m, the design flow using the value of 1954 Hankou
station measured maximum flow rate 76100 m3/s minus the Hanjiang river flows into
the sink after 73380 m3/s. 

Highest navigable water level used is the 20-year flood peak of 26.25 m, the minimum
guaranteed rate of navigable water level of 99% using the low water level 10.21 m.


3. Weather and Climate 

Meteorological refers to the atmosphere of hot and cold, wet and dry, the general
term for the wind, clouds, rain, fog, snow, frost, lightning, and other physical
phenomena and physical processes. Meteorological observation projects have air temperature,
humidity, temperature, wind direction, wind speed, precipitation, sunshine, barometric
pressure, weather phenomena. 

Climate refers to a region-specific integrated weather for many years, the so-called
unique weather conditions refers to the average weather conditions in both years,
including the area in individual years the emergence of some extreme weather conditions,
is an area of cold, warm, dry wet weather conditions and other basic features of
a comprehensive reflection. Various statistics of meteorological factors (temperature,
precipitation, wind, etc.) (mean, maximum, probability, etc.) is the fundamental
basis for the expression of the climate. 

Determine the parameters and design based on meteorological data directly relevant
to the study of climate. 

Basic design wind speed in bridge area (m/s), is according to the Department of flat
open ground, 10 m high from the ground, the return period of 100 years 10 min, average,
maximum wind speed calculated and determined; when the lack of wind speed observations
bridge area, v10 can norms "national basic wind speed map and weather stations across
the country the basic wind speed and basic wind pressure value" of the relevant data
and the use of the field after investigation and verification. 

Construction stage of the design wind speed is multiplied by the wind speed according
to different return periods return period factor, such as the return period of 5
years, the return period is 0.84 coefficient of 0.78,10 year, when construction of
the bridge over the surface structure of less than 3 years, may be not less than
5 years return period wind; when the construction period of more than three years
or a bridge located typhoon-prone areas, we can use a moderate increase than the
actual wind conditions return period factor. 

According to bridges and culverts specifications, calculate the role of bridge structures
caused due to a uniform temperature deformation or constraint applied, the structure
should be restrained when the temperature begins to consider the role of the effect
of the highest and lowest effective temperature. Maximum and minimum standard value
of the effective temperature of the structure is calculated according to the local
calendar highest or lowest average daily temperature average daily temperature, such
as for steel deck bridge, with temperatures between 20~45ºC, its effective temperature
standard value = 38 + (Tt - 20)/2.00; the temperature is between (2~50ºC), the effective
temperature of the standard value = -1.48 + Tt / 0.91. Such as the lack of actual
survey data, the value adopted by the specification table. 

According to the environmental conditions in which the durability of bridge design
is performed, specification of the environmental atmosphere is grouped into four
environmental categories: (i) class is warm or cold regions, and non-aggressive contact
with water or soil; (ii) class is cold regions of the atmosphere use of de-icing
salt environments, coastal environments; (iii) class is the marine environment; (iv)
class is subject to aggressive substances affect the environment. 

Example 3.3. Hangzhou Bay Bridge. 

Hangzhou Bay is located in the eastern coast of China, the sub-tropical monsoon climate
zone, monsoon significantly, the annual four seasons, mild climate, humid, and rainy.
Meteorological elements characteristic bridge area values can be analysed based on
the series of Cixi weather weather stations and bridge the north shore of Pinghu

Severe weathers affecting the Hangzhou bay area are mainly typhoons, tornadoes, thunderstorms,
strong cold air, fog, heavy rain, etc. These severe weather has some effect on the
construction and operation of the bridge, need to be considered. 

4. The Topography 

Topography mainly refers to the terrain and location of surface morphology, including
natural and artificial surface features, including the feature, the ups and downs
of the state of the surface. Its natural form can be divided into mountains, hills,
plains and basins. 

Example 3.4. Hangzhou Bay Bridge. 

Hangzhou bay is located in the Yangtze river in the landscape, river plain area north
of Zhejiang plain area, is composed of coastal and lake sediment accumulation formed
environment, low and flat, the general elevation of 2~7.5 m, many in the region,
Wu Tong, dense river network. Near the bridge site can be divided into land, beaches
and waters of the three geomorphic units. 


Land: Across the Hangzhou bay is a vast plain terrain, flat, local monadnock distribution.


Beaches: Beaches across the Hangzhou bay has developed, with silty sand and silty
floodplain dominated under the tide, is a tidal flat topography. North Shore beaches
narrow to shore erosion mainly south coast beaches, said three north shallows to
silting based. 

Sea: Under the strong trend of Hangzhou bay, the main role of the formation of the
trend and the trend of the ridge notching two landforms. 


Example 3.5. Su Tong Bridge. 

It was known from October 2001, underwater topographic maps that the main channel
bridge bit of Su Tong Bridge has a steep slope on the right side, in the south of
the main pier on both sides to be selected around each 200~300 m slope of 2.5% to
4% zone relatively slow, and the bridge upstream position -40 m deep trench distance
of about 500 m, obviously this bridge than the engineering feasibility study stage
main pier south axis to optimize more favorable position, shown in Fig. 3.5. 

Figure 3.6 June 2003 schematic cross section measured bridge axis, the distance between
the levee is about 6250 m. Main channel was "V" shape, a bit south coast, -10 m contour
covering waters width 1970 m, -20 m contour covering waters width 1170 m, the deepest
point elevation of about -32.7 m, the north-south main tower location situation bed
elevation are about -15 m and -26 m; clip groove in the main channel south of the
main channel and clip groove center distance of about 1700 m; clip was bowl-shaped
groove, width of 430 m, a bottom surface elevation of about -10 m . 

5. Geology 

Geology refers to the nature and characteristics of the earth. Mainly refers to the
earth's material composition, structure, construction, development and history, including
the Earth's spheres of differentiation, physical properties, chemical properties,
rock properties, mineral composition, rock formations and output state, the contact
relationship between the Earth history of structural development, biological evolutionary
history, the history of climate change, as well as the status and distribution of
occurrence of mineral resources. 



Fig. 3.5 River bed topographic maps near the South Main tower. 



Fig. 3.6 Axle shaft section. 

These data are obtained by geological and geophysical exploration drilling. Geophysical
map identify: geological structure (fracture location, size, fragmentation width,
occurrence, nature, etc.), poor geological phenomena, the bridge near the axis of
the underwater terrain, cover thickness, bedrock depth, lithology and so on. Given
soil, bedrock material through mechanical parameters of the standard penetration
test, soil testing, rock testing. These data are used for the designer to select
pier bit bearing stratum and construction methods. 

Example 3.6. SuTong Bridge. 

Bridge site area bridge site area is divided into 22 engineering geological layers
based on geological strata expose era, genetic type, lithology, and burying their
physical and mechanical characteristics, each layer is mainly characterised as follows.


Holocene (Q4) is divided into four layers (1~4 layers): one for the north side of
the upper layer of silt loam or silt clip, sub-divided into three sub-layers; two
for the south bank of the upper layer of clayey "crusty layer"; 3 layers of silty
loam or silt south side of the upper mezzanine, divided into two sub-layers; 4 layers
for the bottom of loam or silt loam with inter-bedded. 

Upper Pleistocene (Q3) is divided into four layers (5-8 layers): five layers of silt-based,
local clayey, is divided into three sub-layers; 6 layers of coarse sand. 

Pebbly, local sand, was divided into two sub-layers; 7 layers of fine sand, silt;
eight layers sandwiched coarse pebbly silty sand, clay sandwiched lens-shaped sub-divided
three sub-layers. 

Pleistocene (Q2) is divided into 6 layers (9 to 14 layers), lithology powder, sand
layer, clayey soil. 

Lower Pleistocene (Q1), on the third line (N) at 200 m above the roof depth, roughly
divided into eight engineering geological layer (15 to 22 layers). 16 to 22 projects
for the Lower Pleistocene geological formations and the Upper Tertiary sediments,
sand next to the main folder Pleistocene clay, on the third line for the semi-cemented
like clay, sand-based, bottom to expose the basalt. Table 3.3 Quaternary stratigraphy

Geological survey results show that 1 in 4 layers of loose overburden, 5 layer of
dense — dense fine sand, 6 to dense sand layer below. 

Layer-based, local folder with soft plastic clay layer. 6-1 and 8-1 large sub-sub-layer
thickness, depth of approximately 65 m, 76 m, stable distribution Fixed, is an ideal
base stratum. 

The downside of the Su Tong Bridge bedrock geological conditions that are deeply
buried (on the 21st floor of weak wind flower basalt, elevation -309.59 m, that is
the bedrock depth of nearly 300 m), not directly as a substrate bearing stratum,
the foundation cannot support the underside strength. The deformation of the rock;
advantageous in that a sedimentary, stratigraphic distribution is relatively stable,
relatively uniform thickness, which base at the end deformable surface is also more
evenly, reducing the likelihood of uneven settlement. 

Preliminary design studies may form the basis of a variety of uses, after a preliminary
post-election than the main caisson foundation and pile foundation for two species
form the basis of equal depth research, and various forms of pile foundation conducted
a comprehensive comparison. Holding force on the caisson foundation analysis layer
as shown in Table 3.4.

Carrying capacity of 300 kPa 

5-2 layers of fine sand overlying strata, saturated, dense, relatively homogeneous
in thickness than the small, distributed stable foundation allowable bearing capacity
for 240 kPa. 

6-1 layer of gravel sand, small thickness of about 4 m, distribution is more stable.
Ground capacity Xu carrying capacity of 450 kPa. 



Lying down 

Under the seven layers of fine sand strata lying, dense, relatively homogeneous.
Greater thickness distribution Stable foundation for allowable bearing capacity 300
kPa. 

7 layers of silt, dense and relatively homogeneous. Small thickness, foundation
permit hosts force 200 kPa. 



Based on the analysis 

Uncorrected allowable bearing capacity of the foundation for the 450 (500) kPa, the
thickness is large, can be used as a base caisson holding force. 

Layers, such as elevation of the substrate disposed in a certain depth of the layer
into the, ideal can be obtained carrying capacity. Allowable bearing capacity of
the foundation uncorrected for 300 kPa, greater thickness, can be as a base caisson
bearing stratum, such as setting the base elevation in the feed into a certain depth
of the layer can be obtained more satisfactory bearing capacity. 




Conclusions on the main tower pile bearing stratum are shown in Table 3.5.

6. The Seismic 

Earthquakes are the Earth's internal media locally generated seismic rupture occurs
abruptly, causing the phenomenon of ground shaking within a certain range. Earthquake
Earth's surface is a fast shock, also known as the earth in ancient times. It and
the wind, rain, lightning is a natural phenomenon often occurs on earth. The earth
shook and the earthquake the most intuitive and general performance. Strong earthquake
occurred in the sea or coastal areas, can cause huge waves, called tsunamis. Earthquakes
are very frequent, global earthquake occurred about 5 million times a year.

Modern seismic project area is characterised by the strength of the weak, the small
magnitude, low frequency, the basic seismic intensity less than VI degrees. According
to historical statistics and information on the recent earthquake monitoring stations,
Taizhou and adjacent regions (including North since Ning Hainan to Wenzhou, east
to the west coast of Jinyun) historical earthquakes was recorded rarely, mostly less
than 4 magnitude, which is equal to or greater than 4 in the historical earthquakes
have six times the maximum magnitude 4.75 earthquake Wenzhou October 17, 1813 occurred.
Strong earthquake in the history of the region (referring to an earthquake greater
than or equal to 4) are concentrated in the 55 years between 1813~1867. 

Recent earthquakes are less than two microseismic, and occurred in the area west
of the Western Cape - Fenghua large fault zone near the north-east, and there is
a certain distance from the surveyed area.

3.1.2 Functionality 

Use features include transport function (road-rail, rail and pedestrian non-motorized
transport), shipping functions (navigation bridge, port, etc.) as well as possible
to reserve space for development (reserved lanes, rail or navigable holes, etc.)
landscape feature requirements. 

Bridge construction to meet the social development needs of direct transport function,
landscape features, etc., but it is a structure for shipping obstructions, so the
two bridges span arrangement and there is always demand for navigable waterways contradictory,
mutual influence, later see Art. 3.2. 

Bridges functionality should be determined according to their orientation of highways,
railways, urban transport planning, construction regulatory documents, by type of
discourse analysis needs roads, function, class, capacity and rail, rail transportation,
etc., if necessary, to consider their long-term needs reserve function, determine
the basic technical criteria including design, including a cross-section. 

Here we have different types of bridges with different conceptual design requirements
in accordance to their functional aspects, in general, different functions of the
bridge, its construction clearance (including width and in height), load, stiffness
and power requirements are not the same. 

1. Highway Bridge

culverts clear width specified by the traffic lane width W, the left and right shoulder
width L1, L2 and other components. Among them: 

W —  Lane width (m), for the number of lanes, lane width multiplied, and included
in the set plus (minus) fast lane, emergency stop road, climbing lane, the slow lane
or the wrong lane width. Lane width is determined according to the design speed,
generally 3.75 m, 3.5 m and 3 m. 

L2 —  Bridges and culverts on the right shoulder width (m), corresponding to different
levels of road have different requirements. 

M1 — Intermediate width (m), the two left-side curbs and median strip with a composition,
which varies with design speed related, such as design speed of 120 m/s, median strip
width of 3~2 m. 

L1 —  Bridge on the left shoulder width (m), eight-lane highways and bridges should
be set on the eight-lane over the left shoulder, and its width should be 2.50 m.
The left-side of the left shoulder width contains curbs width.

3000 kN, 4200 kN special flatbed trailer. 

(a) Deck Clearance 

For city bridges, bridge cross-sectional form is determined by the following 5 factors
of roads and bridges: speed, trunk roads and bridges, once dry roads and bridges,
roads and bridges and bridge support. Bridge can be used as rapid Fig. 3.7(b) arranged
in the form shown in the bridge and the bridge, the central median line drawing can
be used instead. But must be set between the fast lane and a bicycle lane or the
fast lane and sidewalk median or divider fence, the fence should be re-established,
when necessary, the clearance can be arranged in the form shown in Fig. 3.8. 

Motor vehicle lanes clear height requirement shall not be less than 4.5 m, 5 m can
be used while driving trams. Non-motorized vehicles clear height h desirable 3.5

(c) Clearance 

Rail gauge should be determined according to the outline of a comprehensive analysis
of the size and performance of different vehicle line features, equipment installation
and construction methods and other factors. Rail-bound and bound into a vehicle,
equipment gauge, construction clearance. Pantograph gauge is an integral part of
the vehicle bounded. 

Vehicle gauge is the maximum dynamic envelope of a vehicle under normal operating
conditions. 

Equipment clearance is intrusive boundaries outside a vehicle for limiting installation
Construction clearance is a bounded envelope equipment outside. Clearance between
construction clearance and equipment should be fully considered installing equipment
and pipelines on the location of the building, in the width direction should stay
out of 20~50 mm safety clearance between the equipment and pipelines and equipment
gauge. 

According large vehicles such as (catenary power supply) vehicle contour, vehicle

(c) Clearance 

According to the "standard gauge railway construction clearance" standard gauge (1435
mm) railway construction clearance limit is defined as a cross-sectional contour
and line perpendicular to the centerline. In this profile, in addition to rolling
stock and locomotives have interaction with a device (vehicle speed reducer, train
staff giving and receiving, a contact wire and other), other equipment or buildings
shall not be intrusive. Bridges and bridge restrictions limit-1A limit-B applies
to new and re-built steam and diesel traction singlet and double rail, its load of
freight trains should not exceed the height of 5300 mm, bridges and bridge limit-2B
limit-2A applies to new and re-built when single-line and double electric traction
railway, using the gauge, cargo train loading height should not exceed 5300 mm. Fig.

Understanding and being familiar with roads, city bridges, railways and rail traffic
lane width and height of the other basic requirements help designers conceived the
bridge section and its flexible structure types. In modern bridge function, since
urban land resources, major rivers Guojiangtongdao resources are increasingly scarce,
and urban development need to build more roads and municipal bridges, high-speed
railway bridges and rail bridges, so in many cases bridge will be need to share a
bit of resources. 

When required to meet highway bridges, rail transportation and other functions, one
should pay attention to its technical requirements, as described below. 

• Design Live Load 

Combined rail bridge on the existing railway bridge specification double railway
live load combinations, you can access the reduction factor of 0.9, while the live
load in combination with the road, multi-lane highway in the live load in accordance
with the specifications off road under reduced circumstances, is still on the road
after the live load reduction be discounted; Metro design specification is not specified
live load reduction when the double railway portfolio, mainly taking into account
the urban rail transport loaded with high probability, for highway and railway bridges
integration whether the reduction of live load when a combination of road and rail
is not specified. Taking into account the full rate of urban rail transit, traffic
density, for not double railway live load reduction when combined cannot live load
reduction when the rail and highway live load combinations, only the live load in
accordance with its lane highway number of reduction according to specifications.


• Vertical Deflection 

Note the difference between the S-Bahn and a large railway, high-speed railway between
the bridge stiffness requirements. Railway freight train load large, vibration, bridge
stiffness requirements of the most stringent; high-speed rail load light, but the
speed is high, the train bridge, bridge will have a greater vibration of the bridge
stiffness requirements are very strict; Urban Mass Transit load, low speed across
the bridge, the bridge stiffness requirements can have a greater relaxation. In addition,
in the form of road and railway bridges with one of the plane has a larger lateral
stiffness, which makes the upper part of the lateral stiffness of the beam is no
longer a controlling factor, or even the main navigation Long Span Bridge can also
be natural to meet the train running for the bridge lateral stiffness claim. 

According to domestic and international rail and metro design specifications, for
beam bridge, using stiffness standard L/1500; for such large-span cable-stayed bridge
Shanghai Yangtze river bridge, the main channel of the bridge, according to the actual
construction experience at home and abroad, using stiffness standard L/500's . 

On large-span bridges, railways states had no clear specification limits stiffness
from railway bridge has been built at home and abroad to see, flex cable-stayed bridge
across the ratio between 1/350 to 1/550, Suspension Bridge scratch span ratio between
1/200 to 1/250. These vertical stiffness of the bridge is much less than the relevant
norms prescribed value on small and medium-span railway bridge, but the operations
of these bridges are very good. 

• Pier Longitudinal Stiffness 

The requirement for the limit for the longitudinal stiffness of the pier are for
two main purposes: First, to meet the requirements of CWR, the second is to meet
the train operator safety requirements. As Shanghai Yangtze river bridge consecutive
non-navigation bridge over 350 m in length, temperature and more cross-linked structure
long beam joints of large deformation, the bridge is set long CWR is difficult. The
bridge mostly high pile platform, and high piers, pier stiffness by increasing CWR
meet set requirements, extremely unreasonable economically, there are also difficulties
in the design, the bridge structure to be used simply support system, is more unreasonable.
To this end, the track joints in the beam off, set the track telescopic adjustment
means for controlling the basic design is no longer off the rail force, longitudinal
horizontal stiffness requirements of the piers can also be relaxed; as for traffic
safety issues, are as previously described urban rail traffic load is small, low
speed across the bridge, the bridge stiffness requirements can have a greater relaxation,
has been carrying out analysis of train running study, the conclusion is entirely
feasible. 

• Beam End Corner 

Different railway bridge specification standards for different trains made different
requirements on the beam end corner, depending on the circumstances, Shanghai Yangtze
River Bridge in Urban Rail Transit train, the beam end knuckle using 3% limits. In
addition to the main navigation calculations show cable-stayed bridge, the other
bridges in the road and rail transport joint action live load can be controlled within
3%, the main channel cable-stayed bridge in the joint action of road and rail transport
of live load, Liang end knuckle can be controlled in 3%, but with neighbours across
superimposed over 3%. To this end, consider setting retractable buffer device to
solve, or adopt appropriate measures to reduce the beam end knuckle value. 

Example 3.8. Shanghai Yangtze River Bridge take into account urban rail transit across
the bridge, using the same forms to build roads and railways plane is different from
the typical highway bridge, is also different from a typical rail bridge, shown in
Fig. 3.13. The bridge design has more characteristics of roads and bridges in general,
and must be consider the technical requirements of rail transportation. 



Fig. 3.13 Shanghai Yangtze River Bridge cross-section layout (dimensions: m). 

Example 3.9. Originally designed the Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong, only road and
rail access to the airport, and on Lantau container berth will go through the Tsing
Ma Bridge, then this channel has also been retained to cope with bad weather. Capacity
to achieve this all-weather shell encased by stainless steel rail and two road lanes.
Fig. 3.14 shows a cross section of Tsing Ma Bridge arrangement. 



Fig. 3.14 Tsing Ma Bridge cross-section layout (dimensions: m). 

Example 3.10. Shanghai Minpu Bridge upper deck for the eight-lane highway, both sides
of the emergency strip, design speed of 120 km / h; the lower deck for six-lane urban
local road design speed of 60 km/h. I standards for highway design load level. Fig.
3.15 shows the Shanghai Minpu Bridge cross-section layout. 



Fig. 3.15 Shanghai Minpu Bridge cross-section layout (dimensions: m). 

Example 3.11. Is the Yangtze river bridge in Shanghai high-speed railway (300 km/h)
on the channel across the Yangtze river in Nanjing, Shanghai-Wuhan-Chengdu Railway
is the river channel, at the request of Nanjing also equipped with dual sub-way.
Design live load for six railway, is the design load largest high-speed railway bridge
in the world. The main bridge main span of 336 m of two steel truss arch structure.


At the beginning of Dashengguan planning and construction, Nanjing Bridge was already
under construction 1.5 km downstream of the bridge site, and the Nanjing bridge used
a 648 m main navigation arch. Thus, the bridge across the hole arrangement to be
considered including the Nanjing Bridge, including habitual route, bridge-type programs
to meet the channel requirements. 

Since the large railway live load and requirements for train operation, using the
same large span bridge across the railway is economically and technically not a reasonable
choice. In navigation, the route between the two bridges also require smooth convergence.
Therefore, the preparation of navigable hole, the first being the Nanjing bridge
main span of 2, using two 330~340 m of hole-way navigation programs; followed by
two-way shipping to select single-hole program, try to use more main navigation large
span (then drawn about 500 m). The technical requirements of special demonstration
showed that the two-way hole hole 336 m of the main navigation scheme is more suitable
smooth convergence route between the two bridges, better than other programs. 

Established in accordance with technical requirements for navigation span arrangement
requirements, span and side span are 336 m and 192 m, respectively, its side-center
ratio is 0.571, far more than the general layout of cable-stayed bridges, especially
when using three-tower cable-stayed bridge during its vertical stiffness are worse,
it is difficult to meet railroad operational requirements. While the 0.571 cross-ratio
is more in line with the edge of mechanics characteristics of warping, but 336 m
main span girders 

Stiffness requirements for bridge will be find it difficult to meet the high-speed
rail. the 336 m main span constructed of vertical stiffness of steel truss arch structures,
on both sides of the cross smaller side-span continuous steel trussed girder, smooth
connection between the formation of a six-span continuous steel truss arch—truss
composite structure bridge beam alignment graceful, structural rigidity, can meet
the high-speed trains run on the bridge and smooth navigation of ships required under
the bridge, realisation of bridge style and the bridge function in a perfect integration.


3.1.3 Landscape Requirements 

Landscape architects mainly based on bridge location and surrounding environment,
human landscape and a bridge has been constructed nearby, such as bridge-building,
also owners and the cite departments concerns and concerns on urban planning to put
forward what style bridge needs to be built, or according to area the importance
and significance of the bridge itself bridge functions, landscape orientation and
requirements. These are all subjective needs, all with builders, architects and owners
themselves aesthetic value, aesthetic quality and so on, when bridge engineers in
the ideas programme concept, have the responsibility to make the landscape requirements
consistent with bridge aesthetics the basic principles of subject to bridge the rational,
reasonable cost, such as the basic idea. See Chapter 2 bridge aesthetics design.


3.2 HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL ALIGNMENT AND HOLE LAYOUTS 

In bridges' horizontal and vertical alignment and hole layouts, the main factors
to consider include: traffic on both sides of the horizontal and vertical alignment
of the bridge to meet plan requirements; bridge axis, waters port shipping facilities
such as to meet the safety requirements of linear horizontal and vertical curves
parameters and their combinations to meet the requirements of traffic safety and
the smooth landscape; the hole layout to meet force of bridge structure, underwater
topography, existing channels and at the request of the planning course (main navigation,
secondary navigation, or a dedicated navigation etc.) shipping requirements and so
on. 

Conceptual designs for many specific parameters of the technical standard (General
horizontal curve radius, gradient, the sustainability of specific coordinates, and
so on) do not needs to be exhaustive, detailed explanation. However, for horizontal
and vertical alignment and hole layouts played an important controlling parameters
or related read the specific parameters of the feasibility of the design, the size
should be accountable. 

3.2.1 Layout of Bridge-axis and the Horizontal Alignment 

Topics such as hydrology and navigation results based on bridge axis flow as far
as possible in accordance with the water flow to the orthogonal to meet on both sides
land-use planning, principle of demolition and less wiring on both sides, the axis
of the bridge was laid. Long span bridge's plane line layout exhibits "S", "C" shapes
and so on, making the angle between the axis of the main navigation channel bridge
and water flow is more reasonable, and avoid long straight lines, causing drive driving
fatigue. While bridge landscape is more fluid and variable. When you view bird's
eye view from the air, like a Dragon Snaking River Bridge, like scallops fluttered
to Earth again, it seems difficult to find a more appropriate words to express its
complete the expressiveness and vivid image. From the viewpoint of driving will see
near bridge over and when the distance changes, deck rich can give people the comfort
and sense of pleasure. 

Example 3.12. Donghai bridge in Shanghai international shipping center's Yangshan
deep water port (deep 16 m) supporting the important works. 

Project starts at luchao port, Nanhui, Bay across the vast North Sea to Yangshan
port phase transition point, is about 32.5 km across the board there are four navigation
channel for vertical control points, non-navigable and navigable height difference
between 15~35 m. Bridge's largest longitudinal slope is 3%, minimum longitudinal
slope for drainage is not less than 0.3%. 

Horizontal alignment: sea line has 4 turning points, the smallest circle r = 2500
m, full range of linear or smooth, as shown in Fig. 3.16. Fig. 3.17 shows the total
facade of Donghai bridge layout, Fig. 3.18 shows Donghai bridge renderings. 





Fig. 3.16 Bridge line plane. 



Fig. 3.17 Total facade of Donghai bridge layout. 

Example 3.13. In design of horizontal and vertical alignment, the Su Tong bridge,
for one, two or three different profile layout, specifically landscape analysis of
horizontal and vertical coordination. 

1. Scheme 1 

Effect of horizontal alignment as shown in Fig. 3.19, curvy layout landscape better.




Fig. 3.18 Effect chart of bridge of Donghai bridge. 



Fig. 3.19 Scenario a horizontal alignment rendering. 

Effect of vertical alignments as shown in Fig. 3.20, from the side elevation point
of analysis, between the main private channel bridge is slightly rough, but concaving
part is not so obvious. Effect of bridge traffic view is shown in Fig. 3.21, you
can see the majestic appearance of the bridge very well from the main bridge and
private airlines. 

Road and bridge junction is slightly concaved, but linear pattern is basically smooth.

Effect of horizontal alignment as shown in Fig. 3.22, curvy layout landscape looks
better. Effect of vertical alignments as shown in Fig. 3.23, seen from the side view,
the whole bridge line in one fell swoop, complete smoothly. Bridge traffic view effect
is shown in Fig. 3.24, the high bar provides a good view of the main bridge-view
can be used to show the curves of bridge deck, the whole line radian is beautiful,
good landscape effect, the scheme is recommended.

Effect of vertical alignments as shown in Fig. 3.26, from the side elevation point
of analysis, between the main private channel bridge is slightly rough, but bridge
line is not smooth enough. Effect of bridge traffic view is shown in Fig. 3.27, the
longitudinal gradiant in K20 + 446 ~ K21 + 807 of the programme there is a marked
concaving, as the slopes on either side of the main bridge adjustment, from a driving
point of view a bridge line is not smooth enough. 

4. Comprehensive Analysis 

Bridge adjustment programmes meet the recommended scheme of horizontal alignment
of bridge landscape requirements, main channel bridge and private airlines road and
bridge connecting the transition gently, dovetail with the approach curves and smooth,
from bridge traffic view when you can see at different distances the main bridge
tower images while watching the bridge there is a coherent whole momentum, but due
to the overall horizontal alignment of the bridge does not is a double-curved s-shaped,
curved to the left (bird's eye view from Nantong direction), so compared to the landscape
and the left lane right lane is a bit poorer.

Example 3.14. In Jiaojiang bridge bridge site selection Jiaojiang bridge-bridge located
downstream of jiaojiang, channel is busy, around port-intensive, research laid bridge
axis enforcing several specifications as follows: 


The pathway and bridge axis angle according to the General specification for design
of highway bridges and culverts (JTG D60-2004), bridge axis angle between normals
and pathway is less than 5°. 

The distance between axis and pier of the bridge in accordance with the general design
of river port engineering practice (JTJ 212-2006), bridge and upstream/ downstream
ports the safety distance (distance), respectively, shall be not less than 4L and
2L, L to design a ship or pier for the berthing of ships and realistic length. 

The distance between axis and pier of the bridge in accordance with the general design
of river port engineering practice (JTJ 212-2006), bridge and upstream/ downstream
anchoring sites the safety distance, respectively, shall be not less than 4 L and
2L, L to design a ship or pier for the berthing of ships and realistic. 


Engineering feasibility study stage three bridge programme (Fig. 3.28): 


Scheme A a planned bridge, the bridge site is located in the North Shore rats Jiang
Tao Zha XI Island, South Bank wearing Zhejiang Jiuzhou Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited
Division Plant, Jinghai Pharmaceutical East Shugang road, Jiaojiang Bridge a total
length of 3548 m, and flight path angle 74°3′45″. The scheme bridging midline of
the normal flight path angle is too large, upto 15.9°. 

Scheme B bridge site is located in the North Shore rats Jiang Tao Zha XI Island,
from the conch cement Terminal 465 m, South Shore line by the Zhejiang Huadee dyes
chemical plant to the South East of Tengyunshan, after the barracks through the mountains
to the west deflect shugang road. The scheme avoids rock head substations and hisun
pharmaceutical plant. Jiaojiang bridge bridge a total length of 3640 m, and flight
path angle 85°0′7″, the channel was about 5°, meet the standard angle should not
be greater than 5° requirement, but need to relocate troops barracks, shooting range,
3.35 kV high voltage tower. 

Scheme C the bridge site is located on the North Shore rat islet West of the Fortress
Hill, 150 m Hill, from the conch cement Terminal 221 m, South Division plant, Jinghai
Pharmaceutical East shugang road, Jiaojiang bridge bridge a total length of 3460
m, and flight path angle 74°3′45″. 85°3′27″, namely, bridge line of the angle between
the normals and waterway about 4.9°, meet the requirements specification for angle
is not more than 5°, but the premise is to remove moved to Anhui conch cement pier,
policy processing is difficult. North and south, the two sides had an "S" bend, alignment
is poor. 


Comparing the above three bridge schemes, it is concluded that plan B has the basic
line with overall urban planning, the bridge centre line with pathway near orthogonal,
marina and buildings demolition have constructability, engineering cost (taking into
account the relocation of plant and equipment cost) the advantages of lower, has
obvious advantages, it is recommended to implement bridge.

3.2.2 Main Navigation Span Setting 

According to the navigation needs to determine the size and position of the main
navigation channel was assigned by the facade of the bridge priority and bridge engineer
considered in the design of the first scale. Hole size will be the decisive factor
in selection of bridge type. 

Sea the world's major rivers, are set up in the Bayou or some distance away from
the mouth of the harbour as a demarcation of maritime and inland waterway transport
and the point of interconnection, such as Thames London, Hamburg, Elbe, Weser, Bremerhaven
port, Rhine, Rotterdam Hong Kong, North America, New Orleans Mississippi River Harbour.


The inland river system in China, Yangtze River and Pearl River is the most important
navigable waterways, leads to the East and South respectively. From Yibin to Shanghai,
more than 700 km of the Yangtze River waterway navigation is basically divided into
three sections: the Nanjing port carries upto 50,000 tons below below the level of
the sea wheels, vertical clearance of high 50 m; to consider the future development
of the shoreline of Jiangyin bridge needs, so its navigable levels increase to 100,000
tons level, vertical clearance is a 62 m. 

Nanjing to Wuhan over our waterways inland I-level channel, required vertical clearance
of high 24 m, 160 m net wide for 2 holes with a main span 160 m of the Nanjing Yangtze
River Bridge to meet I-level standard of waterway; above from Yibin, Wuhan is a river
II-level channel, requires clean and high 18 m, NET a 2-hole 105 m, Wuhan Yangtze
River Bridge main span of 128 m meet the navigation standard. 

After the completion of the three Gorges Dam, reservoir water depth increased, suitable
for larger inland waterway vessel traffic, sources say-Chongqing section of the three
gorges allows Navigation of 10,000 ton ships. But the three gorges ship lift was
still designed for 3,000 tons ships, 10,000 ton ships cannot pass the three Gorges
to the Nanjin's waterways, and therefore cannot be sailed from Shanghai to Chongqing.

Build bridges over river shipping channel needs to meet more than 5,000 DWT ships
navigation requirements, such as the lower reaches of the Yangtze river, the Pearl
river access to the sea and waterways of Shanghai's Huangpu river. 

According to the International Committee of Qiaoxie Tissue Research was proposed
to prevent accident risk reduction of ship collision with bridge piers "ship domain
theory" (Fig. 3.29), free (don't slow down, about 30 knots ≈ 55 km/h) safety of navigation
width is 3.2 L (the captain), and constraints (snare) navigation can be halved to
1.6 L, such as seagoing vessels entering and leaving the harbour pilots dictate speed-pass
span; or waterway, only a small number of large-tonnage ships occasionally through
the bridge opening, should be also take into account slowdown, saving bridge cost.


Greece sailing Rion-Antirion bridge is to use constraint criteria of 180,000t ship
to 16 knots (≈ 30 km/h) speed by bridge provides two high net 65 m, net 500 m wide
holes up and down navigation clearance, finally uses the porous 560 m cable-stayed
bridge CHST, and does not take into account kilometers or more long-span bridge program.
This is worthy of our reference examples. 



Fig. 3.29 Ship "activity domains". 

According to statistics, 1~30 ton (seventh-generation containers) the length of the
ship between about 150~350 m, press 1.6 L meter A "constraint sailing" required vertical
clearance of wide (1.6 L) between the 240~560 m, taking into account and reservation
width between piers, upstream or downstream line hole navigable span between 300~600
m required for each hole. As more expensive due to the cost of deep-water Foundation,
may also be considered on the downside hole transport, where a two-way navigation
span of 600~1200 m. If the Cross-Sea Bridge is not near the port does not request
slowdown or "freedom of navigation", up and down-hole sailed every hole spacing will
be doubled to 600~1200 m, and with a hole sailed span requires 1200~2400 m. Limit
can be considered as seagoing vessels in the future development of a 500,000 ton,
high vertical clearance may be still will remain at 70~75 m to fit the criteria of
an existing bridge, mainly increased the width, length and draught of the ship. 

Captain is expected to reach 460 m, needed to hole up and down navigation at this
time the largest bridge span in 3,200 m (see Table 3.9).

Therefore, it is recommended that water transport sector according to the shipping
planning and bridge proposed "freedom of navigation" or "bound voyage" requirements,
and when two sailing up and down-hole navigation the clearance criterion, as for
the hole or holes from the design department under economic rationality to decide,
not rigid rules to enforce sailing through joint holes and only uses the ultra long
span bridges. Such as unreasonable in middle reaches of the Yangtze river, uneconomic
large-span suspension bridge, bridge height-span ratio resulted in serious disorder,
and incongruously and adjacent to the bridge. 

Investing a great deal of cross-Sea Bridge should be more realistic shipping planning
and assessment, according to the number of ships, comprising and future development,
reasonably determine navigation standard. Such as is being planned by the Qiongzhou
Strait, shipping status only under 10,000 ton, it is yet earmarked 300,000t of navigable
standards. According to hole's "bound voyage" requirement, the original double 800
m cable-stayed bridge programme has been able to meet the requirements. If certain
requirements "freedom of navigation"is required, one can consider double 1200 m cable-stayed
bridge scheme, nor recovery 2500 m with a hole for suspension bridge scheme, so as
to avoid deep water Anchorage Foundation construction at risk, and the cost will
be increase, which needs to be carefully considered. 

Channel setting the upper and lower rows of holes (two channel) or up and down rows
of holes (a channel) traffic, how to choose separate hole or joint holes depending
on topography, geology, and foot bed construction conditions, to span the economy
(from the top hole of a structure and principle of equal to the lower part of a pier
and abutment Foundation cost) is smaller than hole sailed wide vertical clearance
requirements, you should choose separate hole navigation programme based Pier, Greece
Rion-Antirion bridge 2 × 560 m hole 180,000t of seagoing vessels for navigation requirements.
Such as base cost is too high, you should use more than 1000 m one of the main hole
to meet up and down-hole the navigation requirements. 

And as the Huangpu road, Shanghai is 35,000 DWT of shipping lanes. Due to heavy shipping,
should not be located in the water tricks, one hole across the River, and therefore
uses the above 400 m of large-span cable-stayed bridge with one hole and arch bridge
spanning the Huangpu River. 

Suzhou-Nantong Yangtze River Bridge asked to see 100,000 tons of shipping, demanding
high net 62 m net wide and 800 m (or 2 × 400 m), are used. 

Cable stayed bridge with a main span of 1,088 m, side spans are arranged in auxiliary
navigation channel of the river steamer is reasonable. 

Combination of the Shanghai Yangtze River tunnel for the South Northbridge, continues
South as requiring carries upto 150,000t boats, tunnel crossing. North port requires
only 50,000 tons of lanes, one hole 712 m cable-stayed bridge. 

Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge spanning 50,000 ton lane, net height 50 m. 800 m at
that time was considered a hole of cable-stayed bridge over economic programme, decided
to take advantage of the South Bank of the construction of a suspension bridge with
a main span of 1385 m anchorage conditions. 

Above from Nanjing to Wuhan Yangtze river level fairway, navigation or hole that
you can use 2 × 160 m 1,320 m hole transport, depending on the economy may be. Tongling
Yangtze River Bridge, built in the early 1990, of the 20th century (432 m), the Jiujiang
Yangtze River Bridge (216 m), Wuhan Yangtze River (400 m), the Wuhu Yangtze River
Bridge (312 m) in hole pattern is very reasonable. Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge over
the river grade channels in Yichang, vertical clearance of high 18 m, movement 2000t
class vessels. However, starting in the late 1990s, the pursuit of span to break
the trend had the upper hand, a number of bridges over the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River 600 m and even the span of more than 1000 m. At the level of river channel
(NET 24 m) 500 m on long-span bridges, if there is no special reason it is inappropriate,
certainly is not economical. We should have a very good reflection, out of misunderstanding.
In the hole layout first step in design of navigation requirements and meet the economic
and rational concept of hole designs work well. 

Height of the ship design (water lines to top of mast) and Helen have a certain proportion
of the length of, and safety mark vertical clearance and wide wheel having a certain
relationship, such as constraint navigation 1.6 times rounds long. Therefore, the
vertical clearance of high and wide net there a certain ratio. Such as inland waterways,
General Navigation NET width and height in ratio 6~8 between the main span to height
ratio is generally not advisable for more than 10, if the terrain needs to cross
the river or water depth and geological complexity make larger span, consider hole
transport, main span and height ratio should not be more than 20, or it will make
the imbalance, affect the bridge's appearance. See Chapter 2 bridge aesthetics design.


According to track lay out of main navigation span (one hole or two holes) and the
necessary auxiliary navigation opening size and location, we can start bridge type
selection. 

3.2.3 Hole Layout 

Elevation hole layout consists of main channel bridge, and non-navigable bridge span
of secondary channel bridge arrangement, factors to be considered are: primary and
secondary navigable spans of the navigation requirements; main channel bridge, and
non-navigable spans of the bridge structure itself of secondary channel bridge of
reasonable needs; lines span the coordination of continuity and change in sense of
rhythm; the ratio of span deck height beauty; span and water depth and geological
condition economy and construction of in-water pier of ship collision-proof requirements.


Non-navigable spans of the bridge is often account for the bulk of total cost, it
should be place particular emphasis on the economic hole in order to get a reasonable
score hole layouts. 

Example 3.15. Main navigation span of Donghai bridge, the Vice-navigable and non-navigable
spans of layout.

Fig. 3.31 Bridge span (unit: cm). 

Through six programmes of landscape simulation and study on comparison and selection,
continues that a dedicated channel bridge and the bridge due to the short distances,
should not be used on the bridge building plan. Beam bridge can be used to highlight
the tall, majestic and imposing towers. Scheme 1 bridge bridge flat and focused,
to better set-off on the main role and the overall coordination of the bridge, on
the whole, more prominent main light stretch, tall images, momentum and volume in
favour of main bridge, the bridge focus process out clear priorities. From a landscape
point of view therefore recommends a dedicated channel bridge, bridge program. Table
3.10 shows bridge type comprehensive analysis.

4. The cable-stayed bridge is a double combination, combination seems to repeat,
and the body of main navigable spans of the bridge are not equal, does not fit, so
visual effects not ideal. 





5. Speaking from bridge structure, the Group had not fitted reason,

3.3 APPLICABILITY OF VARIOUS BRIDGE TYPES AND BASES 

Bridge engineer or architect's mastery of bridge engineering, structural mechanics,
and architectural aesthetic expertise, with a engineering experience, the concept
design phase of an exciting programme is an important basis for so-called lofty towers
from the ground. In this section, geithner and finishing of various type of evolution
data, discusses the scope and limits of various type of offers a number of super
long-span bridges design research and information, for your reference in the conceptual
design phase and hope through research and learning, technology change into the source,
technical innovation, technical progress, ways of thinking, mode of operation and
technological advances of the historical role of technology development principles.


3.3.1 Bridge Type Evolution 

In order to overcome obstacles, people invented many different structures. Many of
the bridge has a very ancient history, along with people class the progress of civilisation,
the oldest bridge in its own structure on the characteristics of the materials and
the construction methods based on evolving and in the process, also spawned new structural
forms. Various type of evolution is the growing awareness of the new material and
continually evolving processes of expansion and on the methods of construction. Existing
bridge main arch, beam and continuous continued rigid-frame bridges and cable-stayed
bridges, suspension bridges, cable-stayed suspension combination bridge, the self-anchored
suspension bridges and cable-stayed bridge with low pylon. 

1. Arch Bridge 

Arch Bridge is an ancient bridge type. From the historic stone arch bridge, such
as the Zhaozhou bridge in China and Italy completed Augustus bridge (Pons Augustus),
the first cast iron bridge was built in 1779, 1867~1874 year for the construction
of Eads Bridge Steel Arch Bridge, 1978 United States using weathering steel-built
masterpiece of early-age concrete arch bridge in the New River Gorge Bridge, 19 century—france
Chatellerault Bridge until our country—the modern concrete-filled steel tubular through
arch bridge of yajisha bridge and welded steel box arch rib of the Lupu bridge. Construction
method of Cantilever construction of full space supports, slings, erection and other,
forming a rich and varied material application and construction method of the bridge
type system, and other aspects of the history of technology, learning the history,
can we provide conceptual design an important accumulation of knowledge. 

The first cast iron bridge was built in 1779, Coalbrookdale bridge across the Severn
river, a main span of 30.5 m, composed of 5 parallel consist of cast iron arched
ribs, as shown in Fig. 3.32. 



Fig. 3.32 Coalbrookdale Bridge. 



Fig. 3.33 Eads Bridge. 

In year 1867~1874 construction of the Eads Bridge, the lower arch, consists of three
trans 158.5 m composed of steel, there are road, rail double-deck road, as shown
in Fig. 3.33. The completion of the bridge, ushering in a new era of long-span steel
arch bridges. 

In 1916 United States milestone in New York's Hell Gate Bridge is a steel arch bridge.
The bridge for the next half-through steel arch bridge span 298 m railway passage
four columns, as shown in Fig. 3.34. Hell Gate Bridge for modern steel arch bridge
has laid the technical foundation. 

In 19th century the biggest long-span concrete arch bridge in France Francois Hennebique
designed Chatellerault Bridge, as shown in Fig. 3.35. It is also representative of
early-age concrete arch bridge, which spans more than 100 m.

of concrete-filled steel tube truss. 

2. Continuous Girder and Continuous Rigid Frame Bridge 

Continuous beam is one of the oldest and most common type of bridge. After the industrial
revolution, steel, concrete and other materials, application techniques mature and
in-depth study of structural systems, based on the modern concepts of continuous
beam bridge in the original has been greatly developed. 

Continuous rigid-framed bridge is evolved from the t-shape rigid frame bridge, its
structure is characterised by continuous beam, beam pier consolidation, there is
a great deal of CIS bridge bending rigidity and transverse torsional stiffness, to
meet the force requirements of long-span bridges. 

Development of continuous beam bridge in the 20th century, primarily development
of pre-stressed concrete continuous girder bridge. By 1953, the Federal Germany engineer
Ulrich Finsterwalder Worms Nibelungen were built-in Br u CKE, main span 114.2 m,
as shown in Fig. 3.40. This marked the application of traditional construction method
of steel bridge with precast segmental cantilever method on pre-stressed concrete
creative applications, and develop at -Frame. 

Before 1964, the Federal Germany and completed the construction of main spans of
208 m Bendorf Bridge, as shown in Fig. 3.41, once again showed a Cantilever advantages
of construction method at the same time, Nibelungen Br before u CKE structures were
made on the basis of innovation. Lightweight main Pier with the upper row Liang Gu,
and formed arrangement of bridge for 43 m + 44.35 m + 71 m + 208 m + 71 m + 44.35
m + 43 m, intermediate cross-belt of continuous-rigid-frame hinge system.

Fig. 3.41 Bendorf Bridge. 

In the mid 1950, of the 20th century began construction of pre-stressed concrete
beam bridges in China, started late than in Europe. But for the last 20 years show
quick construction. Built-in 2000, Nanjing Yangtze River beichaqiao, long-span 90
m + 165 m × 3 + 90 m. 

In addition to pre-stressed concrete beam, also of continuous Liang Zhuliang materials
useful beam, girder, and the use of high-strength, lightweight mix concrete is one
of the developing direction of the beam. Built-in 1962, Germany Rheinbr U CKE Wiesbaden-Schierstein,
see Fig. 3.42, the main bridge span for 70 m + 170 m + 4 × 70 m + 85 m + 205 m +
85 m + 70 m. Its 70 m + 170 m + 70 m and 85 m + 205 m + 85 m span parts of using
a steel box girders, and medium span trestle and Bridge uses a composite beam. The
main bridge box girder beam depth is 6.5/7.9 m, central main span is 3.7/4.2 m. This
bridge is also used for the first time 2500t large bearing bridges. 

In 1998, Norway Central 184 m, Stolma across 301m bridge built using high performance
lightweight aggregate concrete structures. 

China Chongqing shibanpo bridge is a continuous rigid frame bridge of steel-concrete
composite structure, as shown in Fig. 3.43, span combination: 86.5 m + 4 × 138 m
+ 330 m + 132.5 m, Middle 103 m is a steel box girder main span, weighing about 1400
t.

3. Cable-stayed Bridge 

In the 1850, of the 19th century, Dischinger design of cable-stayed bridge in the
sense of a first real—Cable Stayed bridge, Strömsund Bridge, see Fig. 3.44. The bridge
is located in Sweden, built-in 1956, with a main span of 183 m, on both sides of
the cross is 74.7 m, the tower is a door-frame, cable a radial arrangement, beam
formed by two pieces of plate girders. 

Study on calculation means of limitation did not prevent the engineers and design
better, more innovative forms of bridges. At the same time, in 1966, the German H.
Homberg designed the first secret cables of cable-stayed bridges in the world—on
the Rhine, Friedrich Ebert Bridge, as shown in Fig. 3.45. After most of the cable-stayed
bridge cable system uses this key. Friedrich Ebert Bridge recovery with a thinner
cable, and before the cables are relatively crude. Box girder used in 20th century
50~60 Pu again using the steel box girders, and greater use of concrete stiffening
girder of cable-stayed bridges in the future. 



Fig. 3.44 Strömsund Bridge. 



Fig. 3.45 Friedrich Ebert Bridge. 

6 years later in 1972, Germany Ulrich Finsterwalder engineers designed the world's
first all-concrete, steel twisted pair cable of cable-stayed bridge—New Hoechst Bridge,
as shown in Fig. 3.46. Length of main span of the bridge 148 m, using concrete the
Tower of pre-stressed concrete girders. 

Due to the use of pre-stressed concrete cable-stayed bridge construction techniques
have been developed. In 1978, the United States of Columbia Ya he built first of
prestressed concrete segmental cable-stayed bridge—Pasco-Kennewick Intercity Bridge,




Fig. 3.46 New Hoechst Bridge. 



Fig. 3.47 Ed Hendler Memorial Bridge. 

Now known as the Ed Hendler Memorial Bridge, as shown in Fig. 3.47. Main span of
299 m, long 722 m, tower height of 72. 94 m. The Cantilever Assembly to the side
from the main tower of the bridge, with crane lifting every piece of 270 t of pre-cast
segments. The bridge is North America's largest for long-span cable-stayed bridge,
completed by Arvid Grant and Fritz Leonhardt cooperation. The bridge stay cable using
a radial, and cables all from cable top pass, as shown in Fig. 3.48. Fig. 3.49 shows
the construction of pre-stressed concrete girder of the bridge. 

Composite girder cable-stayed bridge main span is an example of classic 465 m Canada
Annacis Bridge, as shown in Fig. 3.50 and 3.51. Full bridge girders of girder system,
consists of two longitudinal steel girders and enemy of the steel cantilever steel
beams and the sidewalk and other components of the steel frame combined with the
beam on top of the concrete form. Tower for h-shaped steel-concrete structure by
using rectangular hollow cross section.

Typical examples of hybrid girder cable-stayed bridge is France the Normandy bridge.
Normandy bridge is a double Tower double cable plane for long-span hybrid girder
cable-stayed bridge, full length 2141.25 m, located in France North-west between
northern peninsula south of Honfleur and Le Havre in Normandy on the mouth of the
Seine with a main span of 865 m. Side span and pre-stressed concrete section is close
to the Tower, with three-cell box girder; main span of 624 m is in the middle of
flat steel box girder. Use y-shaped bridge towers, the lateral wind load resistance
is very effective. Bridge tower 202.7 m. Using cantilever construction control of
super long, parallel strand cables and new rain vibration of helical surface treatment
and resistance players. Figs. 3.52 and 3.53 show the pouring of concrete box girder
of the bridge of Normandy and hoisting of steel box girder, and Fig. 3.54 shows the
coagulation steel box girder of tuliang binding sites. 



Fig. 3.52 Pouring of Concrete box girder. 



Fig. 3.53 Steel box beam hoisting. 



Fig. 3.54 Concrete beam and steel box girder binding site. 

Zhihou, Japan very much renound as Mr. bridge for Normandy bridge, became the longest
cable-stayed bridge in the world. Many Luo bridge 890 m, beam has been adopted. Luo
bridge has also been adopted for the first time, while many parallel wire hot-extruding
anti-corrosion cable bushing, concave surface finishing of construction methods.


Our main channel bridge of Su Tong Yangtze River Bridge main span of 1,088 m, is
the world's largest long-span cable-stayed bridges, steel box girders, beams of the
tower for the first time by damping plus the limit connection system, damper for
seismic and other responses play a role; limit focuses on limiting under vertical
wind plays a limited longitudinal displacement between the beams of the tower, but
also can effectively control tower force. 

4. Multi-Tower Cable-stayed Bridge 

Tower cable-stayed bridge with single tower cable-stayed bridge in the process of
development, is the extent and development of multi-tower cable-stayed bridge. The
earliest tower inclined cable-stayed bridge was built-in 1963, by Italy who designed
by Ricardo Morandi Venezuela Maracaibo Bridge, as shown in Fig. 3.55. It is the first
prestressed concrete cable-stayed bridge in the world, its structural concept is
clear: a series of pre-stressed concrete truss rigidity support cantilevered sections,
simply supported beams hanging connections.



Fig. 3.55 Maracaibo Bridge overall print (size: m). 

Later, Many scholars performed a study of multi-tower cable stayed bridge. Now there
are basically rigid tower system and Jiajinsuo system the two systems. Typical rigid
tower system with Greece's Rion-antirion Bridge, as shown in Fig. 3.56; stiffening
cable fragrance Ting Kau Bridge in Hong Kong, as shown in Fig. 3.57. Yiling Changjiang
River Bridge in tower cases do not use rigid tower and jiajinsuo, through reasonable
matching ideal stiffness of the structure, as shown in Fig. 3.58. 



Fig. 3.56 Rion-antirion Bridge (size: m). 



Fig. 3.57 Ting Kau Bridge. 

Multi-tower cable-stayed bridge in the France of the Millau Viaduct is a characteristics
of one seat, as shown in Fig. 3.59. High pier of 240 m, connected to energy beams.
Bottom of the reinforced concrete column type piers 17 m × 27 m, at a certain height
along the vertical forks, fork height 90 m. Such designs make the pillars have greater
flexibility, better to adjust the horizontal and vertical direction of change. The
construction method is also very original, first pushing steel box girders, in order
to reduce the pushing distance across erecting a set fitted with tow equipment of
steel-tube truss of Falsework. After the closure, tower trailers delivered to the
deck is not installed the appropriate bridge directly above the pier. Tension and
temporary support towers above the pier, tower tilted upward reversal, installed directly above the pier.

5. Suspension Bridge 

Development of modern suspension bridge started in 1883 with United States Brooklyn
Bridge, as shown in Fig. 3.60. Its main span is 486 m, cross 286 m on both sides.
By the famous engineer John A. Roebling designed. Roebling had already involved in
the design work of several suspension bridges, and in 1854, at wheeling a suspension
bridge that spans the Ohio river disaster after largely influenced his design ideas.
The accident inspired him using other than the rigidity of cable itself has greater
stiffening girder and cable way to make up for the shortcomings of simple suspension
system. At the time of construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, roebling suspension bridge
high-order hyperstatic systems cannot be accurately calculated. But through the component
force between a reasonable distribution, and guarantees that the overall balance
to guarantee against failure of security. 



Fig. 3.59 Elevation of Millau Viaduct. 

In 1931, and completed the construction of long-span Bridge 1000 m—George Washington
Bridge for the first time, as shown in Fig. 3.61. The bridge span arrangement for
186 m + 1067 m + 186 m. The bridge began plans to double-deck, upper pass cars, lower
passing trains. However, due to the great depression in the late 1920 of the 20th
century, the original design was cut, only built upper deck, because this begun to
not actually stiffened girder of the bridge, set only at the deck stringer small
bending stiffness of carriage way. Still, the bridge still has sufficient stability,
this is because bridge uses concrete and dead loads great, while 8-lane bridge the
width as well. In addition, the main span length is less than one-sixth's short side
spans are to some extent compensated for the lack of longitudinal stiffness, increased
cable system of strong performance. Finally, in 1962, built on the lower deck of
the bridge deck is complete. 



Fig. 3.60 Brooklyn Bridge. 



Fig. 3.61 George Washington Bridge. 

Completed in 1937, Golden Gate Bridge main span is 1280 m, span larger than the George
Washington Bridge 20%. But this use of the two main cables, each 930 mm, mainly because
only one layer of the deck of the bridge. While George Washington Bridge uses four
main cables of each 910 mm. In beam high regard, Golden Gate Bridge shows suspension
bridge in a long refinement development direction, height-span ratio of only 1:168.
Space trusses composed of only 3 pieces of plane truss and two vertical and a horizontal
truss-to-truss. Such structure allows the torsional stiffness of truss section is
small, at that time did not fully understand importance of torsional stiffness for
aerodynamic stability. In December 1951, 4 h of winds, the vertical amplitude of
the bridge achieves the 3.3 m, had to shut down the bridge. In the aftermath of the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge wind destroyed, Golden Gate Bridge is in vertical add horizontal
support between the bottom chord of the truss. In this way, contains 3 pieces of
space truss trusses with open sections into contains 4 pieces the closed section
of truss (Fig. 3.62 and 3.63). 

In 1940, of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge main span is 852 m and height-span ratio is
1 : 350. This is due to the large deflection theory is extended to three-dimensional
stress characteristics of the ultimate results. Wind speed wind destroyed the bridge
to 56~67 km/h, far below the designed resistance to most wind speed. However, when
it comes to structural analysis and consider only the static air pressure without
noting beam angle formed by fluctuating wind vortex dynamics. Selection of wind destroyed
the bridge reveals a maximal length of fine design prone to aerodynamic instability.

Fig. 3.63 Front opening space trusses after Reinforcement. 

Tacoma Narrows Bridge after the accident, engineers focused on vibration characteristics
of suspension bridges and air on the dynamic vibration response, established a method
for aerodynamic vibration of suspension bridge design, and this approach has become
to build important part of the design of cable-supported bridges. 

After World War II, other suspension bridge in the west came from behind to form
different from United States-style suspension bridge points. United Kingdom the Severn
Bridge main span was built-in 1966, 988 m (Fig. 3.64), the main span was built-in
1981 to 1410 m of the Humber Bridge is representative. Continental suspension bridges
in the United States for breakthrough in accumulated technology and experience in
the construction of suspension bridges. In order to reduce the weight while maintaining
good aerodynamic properties, continental used set a steel Crossbeam of suspension
bridge cell box girder. Beam shape design is used with a good aerodynamic shape.
From the anti-seismic point of view, stiffening of flexible undertaking only limited
earthquake load, while the bridge relatively rigid Suo Tacheng under strong ground
motions. 



Fig. 3.64 Severn Bridge. 
Severn Bridge uses a flat steel box girder of 3 m (first flat steel box
girders), height-span ratio 1 : 324, similar to that of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge
main span. But by the closed section of the streamline of wind tunnel experiments
and makes wind stability and torsional stiffness
has been very satisfactory.



Fig. 3.65 Great Belt East Bridge. 

Denmark Great Belt East Bridge (Fig. 3.65) is a European Cable Bridge an outstanding
representative of the bridge, which span arrangement for 535 m + 1624 m + 535 m.
Upper structure made of flat steel-box-girder, high 4 m, wide 31 m. The bridge anchorage
structure is unique, by the anchor room, cable saddles as well as between the hollow
knot structure-composition, as shown in Fig. 3.66. 

In Asia, economic power Japan started in in the 1960, of the 20th century built for
long-span suspension bridge larger than 300 m (1962, Fukuoka-Seto bridge main span
of 367 m), to the South like bridge was built-in 1988 (main span 1100 m) put an end
to Asia's non-kilometer TRANS-bridge history. 10 years later, in 1998, the Akashi
Kaikyo Bridge (main span of 1 990 m, (see Fig. 3.67) built, marks a long-span suspension
bridge construction has shifted to Asia. 



Fig. 3.66 Hollow gravity anchor. 



Fig. 3.67 Akashi Kaikyo bridge, Japan. 

In the 1990, of the 20th century, the suspension bridge of China also entered the
development team, in 1995, completed the construction of the Xiling Yangtze River
Bridge (main span 900 m), Humen bridge was completed in 1997, (main span of 888 m).
In 1998, Hong Kong's Tsing Ma Bridge (main span of 1377 m) and 1999. Years of Jiangyin
Yangtze River Bridge (main span of 1385 m, as shown in Fig. 3.68) respectively into
the fifth in a series of long-span bridges in the world at that time and in fourth
place. 452 m Shantou Bay Bridge main span pre-stressed concrete stiffening girder,
span bridge of its kind in the world rank one. Shanxi Hou men bridge main span of
1650 m, 26 m longer than Denmark Great Belt East Bridge. The bridges built, not only
to fill the Blank modern suspension bridges, and to modernise the Chinese entered
the master design, analysis, construction technology of large-span suspension bridge's advanced ranks.

6. The Combination of Cable-stayed Suspension Bridge 

In 1938, Germany renowned bridge designers Dischinger design across the Elbe river
suspension bridge with a main span of 753 m railway time proposed cable-stayed suspension
system different from the Roebling. Its base idea was similar to A. Arnodin thoughts
close to cable-stayed and suspension cable his responsibilities. Unlike Roebling
cable on cable reinforcement ideas, dischinger's system is a true mutual collaboration.
While he established a cable design of the original—Only under very small dips, cables
can be rigid enough to keep the main beam deflection at the lower limit. But because
just after people have come to realise the advantages of structural system of cable
stayed bridge, the bridge out of the outlook of people. 

Given the advantages of cable-stayed suspension, programmes all over the world to
build bridges among this type is frequently raised. In 1998 years, the United Kingdom
of Flint and Neil company and jointly presents Javan Halcrow (Java), Bali channel
meter scale cable-stayed bridge programme in collaboration with cable, as shown in
Fig. 3.69. But this type of bridge is not a very mature type has its own deficiencies.
First, as a cable-stayed suspension bridge that brings together two different types,
then in construction requires two sets of different mechanical device and secondly,
two cable forms and suspension cable of cable-stayed force and deformation characteristics
vary, therefore at the junction there is often a deformation compatibility problems;
and, third, two cable stiffness differ, on load distribution, be very careful. 

In October 1997, China's Guizhou province, has built the world's first combination
Dischinger system cable-stayed suspension bridge, Black River Bridge (Fig. 3.70),
the bridge of long-span 288 m. 

Tongji University in Lingdingyang Bridge connecting Zhuhai in Guangdong and Hong
Kong (Fig. 3.71) scenario, cable-stayed-suspension system construction control of
bridge fatigue control and Sling were studied was proposed for this system is very
advantageous construction methods, and by setting the cross sling and supporting
piers as a way to decrease the sling alternating axial force. Mechanical properties
of cable-stayed-suspension bridges and the chai were studied, and points out that
in terms of mechanical properties, than the loss of height to span suspension bridge
in the role of global design parameters in degraded partial design parameters, while
lifting span is also local design parameters.

7. Self-anchored Suspension Bridge 

Second half of the 19th century, Austria Yuesefu·langjin engineers and United States
engineer chalisi·bende independently conceived from anchor type hanging bridge looks.
Patented Bender in 1867, Rankin's in 1870, in Poland built a small self-anchored
suspension bridge type railway. In 20th century, self-anchored suspension bridge
already in Germany. In 1915, Germany Designer on the Rhine river in Cologne built
the first large—Cologne Dizzle self-anchored bridge, mainly because of the geological
conditions constraints enable engineers chose this type of bridge, the main span
of the bridge 185 m, wood scaffolding support beam until the cables are in place.


Since then, the United States, Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh 3 bridges across the Allegheny
R. and Japan Tokyo-built Ching Chau Bridge under the influence of Diez bridge in
Cologne. Diez 25 years after the completion of the bridge in Cologne in Germany and
built 4 suspension bridge on the Rhine river. One of the most famous Cologne Mülheim
bridge was built-in 1929, the bridge main span of 315 m, although the bridge was
destroyed in 1945, but it so far (2006) still retains its self-anchored suspension
bridge span on record. Initially stiffening girder of self-anchored suspension bridge-production


Steel structures, such as traffic in 1990, Japan the flower bridge, Korea wing suspension
bridges, Estonia muhudaoqiao as well as the United States old gold mountain-Oakland
Bay Bridge, and so on. 

United States San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge main span 385 m, side 180 m, 2007
years to build and is shown in Fig. 3.72. 

Self-anchored suspension bridge construction has just started in China, history is
less than 10, but is developing rapidly, in order to meet the urban landscape requirements.


N-bridge of Zhuji city, Zhejiang Province, was completed in 1999, China's first self-anchored
suspension bridge built by one of the pedestrian bridge. Its long-span 2 × 70.6 m
Dalian jinshitan Golden Bay Bridge, completed in 2002, is the world's first reinforced
concrete self-anchored suspension the bridge, the main bridge span for 24 m + 60
m + 24 m, the main bridge width 12.5 m fushun wanxin bridge of Hunhe river, completed
in 2005, is a double cable planes pre-stressed concrete self-anchored suspension
bridge with a main span of 160 m, TRANS-70 m, anchorage cross 15 m height-span ratio
is 1 : 8. 2007 pingsheng bridge built for a world level and difficulty with single
tower and single-span four cable plane self-anchored suspension bridge, cross the
Dongping waterway, the main bridge span arrangement for (from North to South): 29.6
m + 30 m + 350 m + 30 m + 5 × 40 m + 39.6 m, the main bridge length 680 m, wide 2
m, as shown in Fig. 3.73. Stiffening girder of steel and concrete composite structure,
pylon for the three column gantry-style tower. 



Fig. 3.72 United States, San Francisco—Oakland Bay Bridge. 



Fig. 3.73 Foshan Pingsheng Bridge. 

Compare with cable-stayed bridge, although again without anchorage of self-anchored
suspension bridge, but must be installed on the bracket before main cable main girder
of bridge installed, which cannot be carried out as cable-stayed bridge with pre-cast
segmental cantilever. Generally speaking, in 400 m with the lower span of the river
stream, when the ease of set up and support navigation requirements are not high
when considering this type of bridge. Main cable of large span would bring in the
beam difficulty and complexity of anchor structure, both in production and construction
is negative. 

In terms of structural rigidity, suspension bridges are not as cable-stayed bridge,
rigidity is more prominent when the span is small, sometimes with a tilt hanging
rod instead of the traditional direct-to increase the stiffness of the hangers. In
order to overcome the fatigue problems and responsibilities for inclined hangers
hangers exert pre-loading, main cable shape when you will no longer be a parabola,
and must use exact non-linear finite element determined by iterative calculation
of main cable, whether calculation errors may result. 

Finally, it would be point out that self-anchored suspension bridge structure low
redundancy, once the main beam failure will lead to structural failure disaster consequences.
Therefore, the self-anchored suspension bridge is not a system of excellent performance,
economy and ease of construction. 

8. Low-tower Cable-stayed Bridge 

Cable-stayed bridge with low pylon is the rise in recent years, a new type of bridge
structure. This type of design thinking by France engineers J. Mathivate designed
in France South-west Al Darai (Arre't Darre') viaduct when the alternative is proposed.
The design of the programme, including with the consolidation of low bridge superstructure
towers, pre-stressed concrete uniform box girder of long span 100 m wear leads more
low Tower cable saddle on a pre-stressed concrete cables instead of cable. 

In 1980, designed by Christian Menn's famous Gant (Ganter) bridge (3.74), called
low tower cable-stayed bridge (Drawing), pioneer of concrete box girder of the bridge
made of pre-stressed concrete cable-stayed "suspended" at a very high tower. However,
the bridge received widespread praise not because of its technical innovations, but
because its structure is so beautiful, and the Switzerland mountains perfect knot
hopewell, compliment each other. 



Fig. 3.74 Ganter Bridge. 

In 1994, built the world's first cable-stayed bridge with low pylon—Odawara in Hong
Kong the bridge thereafter Japan and dainan built housing, North bridge, crab purging
bridge, New Tang dynasty TV cabinets bridge and other bridges. To date, Japan built
cable-stayed bridge with low pylon is more than 20 m beam span from the early Odawara
bridge 122 m reached 292 m bridges among the elderly in Hong Kong. 2 m in addition
to Japan, but Manda-Mactan II bridge was built-in 1999, in the Philippines, its main
span is 185 m, the bridge deck width 21 m; Laos was also completed in 2000, Basel
the bridge, which spans 143 m, width 11.8 m, Switzerland in 1998 completed the Sunni
bogeqiao (taiyangshanqiao) five-span continuous low pylon cable-stayed bridge with
a main span of 140 m.

PC cable-stayed bridge. 

Matakina is high-tower cable-stayed bridge with low pylon of the bridge, according
to the results of main tower with the cost of cable-stayed tower height 25~30 m minimum.
Taking into account the pier base foundation engineering and future maintenance and
other factors to finalise the main tower height is 26.5 m China also belongs to the
higher Tower of Xiamen Yinhu bridge 

Mucengchuan bridge (Fig. 3.75) in order to meet the needs of 275 m long-span girder
in main span of 110 m cable-free area in the Middle uses a steel box beam. Connector
located at upper flange pressure positive bending moment within a segment, to improve
the deck's life span. PC with corrugated steel webs refers to the roof beams and
floor using concrete materials, Web plate steel webs, with vitro VIVO cable cable
box girders. Applied cable the axial force acting on the top and bottom all; mainly
with corrugated steel webs under shear stress produced by the bending and torsion.
Compared with the ordinary concrete box girders, PC girder with corrugated steel
webs weight lose 25%~30%. Currently, Himi Yume Bridge is concrete composite girder
with corrugated steel webs main Liang Aita PC cable-stayed bridge (Fig. 3.76). 



Fig. 3.75 Mucengchuan bridge overall schematic diagram (size: m). 

This type of bridge in China started late, in 2000, built Wuhu Yangtze river bridge,
which is China's first cable-stayed bridge with low pylon, as shown in Fig. 3.77.
Built-in 2001, Zhangzhou, Fuzhou bridge is a three-span continuous prestressed concrete
box girder of cable-stayed bridge with low pylon, which is on a highway and urban
road cable-stayed bridge with low pylon. Since then, the Tongan in Xiamen Yinhu bridge,
Lanzhou Xiaoxihu Yellow River Bridge in succession built. Due to this type of bridge
has a good price-performance ratio, in long-span beam bridge with cable-stayed bridges,
between the stiffness high bridge has a strong competitive edge, as well as for construction
of the cable-stayed bridge tower height restrictions, rigidity of multi-tower cable-stayed
bridge difficult to meet requirements, the cable-stayed bridge with low pylon is
also a good choice. 

9. Summary 

Throughout the history of bridge technology, it can be seen that bridges technical
progress from the demands of human civilisation, bridge technical progress achieved
depends on the development of science and technology in human society, including
materials science, theory of computing, structure, construction technology and other
developments in the field, making bridges technical progress can be achieved, so
the bridge fully integrate technological advances in human society in the development
of science and technology. Study the history of technology, contribute to its development
a part of our law will help us to scientific and technological innovation, helps
us to grasp the bridge to technology development and trend.

3.3.2 The Type of Scope and Limits 

According to the mechanical characteristics of the bridge can be divided into four
main categories, namely, warping, arched bridges, cable-stayed and suspension bridge.
After modern times to the present about 500 years of development, as currently known,
scope and limits of various type of modern bridge span as shown in Table 3.11.

In general, each bridge has a span of its most affordable. Under or over this affordable
economical range, although it is possible to build, but is often not economical or
technical difficulties on the other indicator. Therefore, should in principle within
the scope of the economic alternative to competing programs. Main span of 200 m bridge
PC continuous girder bridges, PC continuous rigid frame bridge with continuous beam
bridge, arch bridge of concrete-filled steel tube and steel, steel box arch bridge
and PC cable-stayed bridge (Tower) options and comparisons. Main span of 500 m bridge
steel box arch bridge, a steel truss arch bridge, PC cable-stayed bridge, girder
cable-stayed bridge options and comparisons. Generally, 700 m should choose a lighter
steel deck pavement of bridge deck cable-stayed bridge cable-stayed bridge. However,
due to China's truck out of control, durability of steel deck pavement has not been
properly resolved, paving damage cannot be repaired in a timely manner would cause
fatigue crack of the orthotropic steel bridge deck, affecting the durability of steel
deck. Because this improved performance more reliable structural steel deck and extend
use of composite girder cable-stayed bridge is worthy of consideration. 

Cable-stayed bridge spanning breakthrough kilometers, its economic scope upto 1200
m, 1400 m, plus, stiffness, cable-stayed bridge cable replacement, and does not require
anchorage advantages will be an advantage in competition and suspension bridges,
thus forced back toward the larger span of suspension bridge. Can even be envisaged
within the span of 1500~2000 m, cable-stayed and suspension cable system may be able
to anchor construction easily made of low stiffness and suspension bridge and further
to 2000 m back down. 

According to the development trend of seagoing vessels, the seventh generation of
container ships has reached 400,000 tons, high vertical clearance requirement is
above 70 m. In order to adapt to existing port bridge navigation standard, larger
seagoing vessels would limit height, and continue to grow in width and length show
vertical clearance width will increase accordingly, but will not increase without
limit. We shall continuously improve the lower foundation in deep water technology
and economic level, across the span of a bridge linking the island and the Taiwan
Strait in the future limit at the level of around 3500 m to improve bridge competitiveness
of the beams for the tunnel option. Because as the bridge span increases, and its
cost will rise rapidly, in the face of increasingly sophisticated tunnel DAO technical
and economic indicators, the bridge will be difficult to compete and tunnel scheme.


Finally, it is to be noted that, from the perspective of the development trend of
ship navigation (see Table 3.9) and is currently navigable routes less than 300,000
tons road hole bound navigation time, 2 holes 750 m of multi-tower cable-stayed bridge
has been able to meet the requirements, such as being designed by Germany and Denmark
carries upto 260,000t of Fei Manen Strait between ocean liners, 34 Tower cable-stayed
bridge across 780 m more economic plan would eventually overcome the large-span (5)
suspension bridge even for the future potential of a 500,000 ton lane, 2 × 1500 m
navigation requirements can also be used more competitive multi-tower cable-stayed
bridge scheme, so as to avoid deep water anchorage difficulties. Furthermore, programmes
are more likely to meet the rail cable-stayed bridge for two stiffness requirements
for bridge, especially the advantages of cable can be replaced, durability and total
lifecycle cost of the cable-stayed bridge suspension bridge better than the suspension
bridge. In short, the km over the span of bridge type selection of cable-stayed bridges
should be given priority, and caution on suspension bridge. Unless faced with water
deeper than 100 m and a wide channel, which span more than 1500 m, you must use consecutive
TRANS-2000 m (5) suspension bridge At this point, such as Sham Shui Po anchorage
must be addressed through research and development, anti-sliding at the tower of
the main cable, and rigidity of customs key technical problems and also had to face
the strong competition of the tunnel option. 

Denmark and Germany between instances of the Fehmarn Belt Bridge is an important
revelation: in order to meet 260,000t sea navigation ask, after thorough investigation
and analysis of ship collision risk, recommending three-span bridge program is a
four tower 780 m of truss composite beam cable-stayed bridge, who gave up on large
cross-(2000 m) ICP-suspension bridge, to stay competitive on the tunnel option. 

Since most of the tonnage of the ships below 300,000t, ultra large ocean liners were
just a few of the more than 300,000t. Even if you want to ask at full speed, "freedom
of navigation" porous 1~200 m have been 300,000t to meet the shipping requirements
(see previous Table 3.9), occasionally there are a few more than 300,000t of ultra
large ocean liners pass through, deceleration can be used by "constrained navigation".
In this way, 1200 m long-span cable-stayed bridge is the most competitive Cross-Sea
Bridge. Cable-stayed bridges stiffness, wind resistance performance is good, cables
can be replaced, and avoid deep water anchorage of suspension bridge and across the
main cable saddles of suspension bridge tower problems such as skid-resistance, not
only economy better than suspension bridges, but also has the competitive advantage
of the tunnel option. Therefore, in addition to 5 km-width Super Sham Shui Po (100
m) strait-tower suspension bridge spans must be used (for example, Italy Messina
Strait Bridge), the water is wide (20 km) Strait Bridge should be give priority to
the economic rational scheme of cable-stayed bridge, rather than blindly span breakthroughs,
not economical for large-span suspension bridge scheme and loss of competitiveness
in tunnels. 

3.3.3 Application Scope of the Basic Forms 

Bridge foundation construction technology for development along with the evolution
of the bridge structure, and construction equipment improved, as well as bridge builders
design concept and idea development. 

In General, the current main types of rigid spread foundation of bridge foundations,
piles and column bases, the caisson and bell-shaped bases, sink box foundation and
piles, pipe, bell formed the basis of open caisson, a combination of foundation,
where the oldest and most commonly used in amounts foundation is the biggest pile,
then caisson foundation. Pneumatic caisson construction of foundation for security
and other reasons, this technology in Japan has become less application, instead,
auto pneumatic caisson foundations in the early 1990, of the 20th century, the medium-term,
fundamental developments are mainly tubular column base combined base and bell-shaped
bases and foundation; late in the 1990, of the 20th century, forms the basis of many
other bridges to build, such as locking steel pipe pile, column bases, underground
continuous wall of double tubular column foundation bearing platform, and so on.
At present, with the needs of the sea-cross bridge construction and advances in construction
technology, pre-cast or overall basis set show prospect, which is similar to the
offshore drilling platform design and construction of ultra deep foundation also
received wide attention and research engineer. 

In bridge foundation design, must consider the feasibility of bridge structural system
and construction as well as depth, geology, hydrology and environment many bridges,
such as the natural conditions by analysing and comparing the foundation type selection.
Natural conditions of the bridge is the underlying type determinants of choice. 

For the depth of water is less than 5 m and have exposed bedrock, rigid spread foundation
is the preferred type for depth of 5~50 m range bridges, piles, tubes and caisson
is the underlying type of the applicable, in which 5~20 m depth, domestic construction
technology quite mature; at a water depth of 50~70 m base, the construction is very
difficult, more suitable for installation of pre-fabricated construction of sinking
well foundation and bell-shaped base, in this regard, there are many success stories
abroad; for a water depth larger than 70 m basis, whether in the basic shape type
selection and appropriate construction technology is a challenge, may adopt similar
forms the basis of offshore platforms. 

For the foundation through the overburden thickness, steel piles and pipe buried
near 50 m; 100 m bored pile to soil; open caisson of fitness appropriate range of
35~50 m, maximum 100 m locking steel pipe pile 35~50 m soil depth is more appropriate
based on the underlying type. 

For bridge site geology, such as thick in the river gravel layers greater than 10
m, driven piles, pipe foundation, locking construction of steel pipe pile foundations
have difficult issues. 

If structural basis, ground and river areas are required to have the ability to resist
horizontal force, inclined pile foundation, Shen Jing Ji bases are a good choice.


All in all, a variety of bridge Foundation respectively, to adapt to different geological
conditions and environmental factors, at the location of the bridge superstructure
of requirements and load characteristics, and so on. the following three general
forms the basis of modern times, appeared after the war forms the basis of modern
and 1990s, there were two forms the basis for the development of three new categories
based on their structural characteristics and fit as described in condition. 

1. Basis of Three Commonly Used Forms 

Various types of pile foundation and caisson, caisson foundation is the foundation
of modern forms, respectively, below their technical features and development, applicable
conditions, as well as typical examples. 

(a) Foundation 

Pile foundation of bridge deep water Foundation is the most commonly used and forms
the basis of the most economical. 

Pile foundations are so versatile, versatility, working mechanism varied, so piles
are often based on the material, the degree of impact on soil, construction, construction
method and load conditions as well as the relative position of the CAP, were classified.
Table 3.12 lists components of poles. 

Table 3.12 Post classification.

Relationship pile and bedrock 

Non- pile, rock-socketed pile. 




Compared with open caisson and caisson foundations, in most cases, the foundation
has the following advantages: needed to sink into the depth of pile sinking well,
small caisson sinking depth required; when the caisson, depths of caissons and piles
are equal, pile of material about than the caisson, caisson foundation 40%~60% less
material. Therefore, the cost than the caisson, caisson pile foundation; however,
along with the advantages and disadvantage is: pile foundation stiffness ratio of
open caisson, caisson foundation of small, especially in the case of velocity, scour
depth, diameter scour depth increases as it grows, so that its advantages are gradually
reduced. 

Pile the generally applicable conditions are: 


Low strength and compressibility of the soil covering, or for other such as the ice
heaving soil or expansive soil. 

Unstable soil, and under it in the appropriate depth when there are good supporting
layer of soil can be used as in the quake zone, soil covering is liquid. 

Soil, under which a vibration-resistant stability of soil when Pier Foundation under
horizontal force you want about surface soil covering the punching. 

Brushing effect of large have higher requirements for settlement of bridge Foundation.


Specific site conditions and construction feasibility on pile foundation design options
need attention: 


For sinking piles, RC, PC, PHC pile suitable water depth is 20~30 m, permeable overburden
thickness upto about 35 m, mass for the saturated fine sand, clay, sand and gravel;
compared to the steel pile and pile type mentioned above, as long as the construction
equipment available, which adapt to water depth, covering a wide range of thickness
but 10 cm over gravel layer, containing a lot of the strata of rocks or other obstructions,
the types of sinking piles are suitable for. Similarly, when the surrounding pipelines
or dilapidated houses, are sensitive to soil compaction effect, there is no suitable
use of soil compaction effect of sinking pile foundation. 

Bored pile than sinking piles, piles can be penetrate the hard gravel, cobble and
Boulder, also available through the complex geological conditions cave, construction
equipment, simple, no squeezing effect, construction noise and vibration, suitable
depth and depth greater. Among which the rotary drill hole pile's suitable water
depth upto about 30 m, depth is more than 100 m; impact drill hole pile adjustment
suitable water depth and reach the hole is slightly decreased, but you can use a
variety of ground conditions, especially in karst areas, would be a plus application
of bored pile. 

Considering pile bearing capacity of end-bearing pile applied in soft soil surface
is not very thick, but for hard soil layer in the lower part of the case; brush pile
applied in soft soil surface with a thick, with moderate compressibility of the soil
layer in the lower part, and hard soil depth in a lot of situations. 

For low pile foundation and high pile bearing platform of choice depends on the depth
and ease of construction, typically in the floodplain, or shallow water sets the
low-pile pile foundation. High-pile bearing platform of design should be noted for
the underside and navigable relationships to protect the pile from influence of ship
collision. 

In addition, from the point of use, helical pile than a vertical pile has a strong
ability to resist horizontal force, may ship impact, waves beats and seismic effects
used on the bridge. At present, some latest piling barge equipped with a plug piling
upto more than 82 m. 

Inclination of ±18.5° increased pile capacity; but in the bored pile construction
tilt, limited capacity of domestic equipment, generally only achieved approximately
5° of inclination sloping pile. In contrast, foreign construction equipment more
capable, diameters can be carried out 1.5 m, 40 m length, tilt 1 : 4 bored pile construction,
while form 3 in diameter. 5 m expanded diameter. 

At present, the pile foundation construction technology is very mature, large pile
foundation success stories, too many (as in bridge bored maximum diameter pile has
reached 4 m Su Tong bridge main pylon pile foundation composed of 131 diameter 2.5~2.8
m, 124 m bored pile), Has very good economic effect of piles, on many occasions would
be preferred. Pile foundation design, there are two points it is worth mentioning:
firstly, pile foundation of bridge in the country at present some bias in the application
of the project, seems to be "without piling without foundation" tendencies. However,
in a busy shipping channel, bridge with earthquake requirements, whether with high-pile
foundation bearing platform appropriate is questionable; second, the bridge pile
foundation bearing platform structures are often designed as a solid structure, under
the force of the quake, the high-pile piled foundation piles due to pile more and
more bent, resulting in not meizoseismal bridge's pile foundation design of seismic
control. Thus, measures that could be considered reduced quality in the design, such
as the design of hollow pile cap, set at an angle to reduce small-cap area. 

Example 3.17. Donghai bridge in Shanghai. 

Starting Luchao port in Shanghai Nanhui Donghai bridge across Hangzhou Bay in northern
waters, and Shengsi in Zhejiang Province small rocky islands of ocean mountain Island,
is about 31 km, is the first offshore sea-crossing bridge. Main forms of continuous
beam bridge structure (construction method) and the cable-stayed bridge, sub-structure
for pile foundations (PHC pipe pile foundations, steel pipe pile foundations). 

Seen from the geological conditions, typical geological layer from top to bottom
to grey-brown mud, black-gray silty clay, gray clay, four-story gray-green, sadly,
1 layer of grass and yellow sand silt clay silt, sadly 2 layer of dust and grass-gray
silty (Foundation pile the bearing layer), hydrological conditions and average tidal
range 2.75~3.20 m the maximum velocity of 2.4 m/s, wave height of 3.45 m (NNE) and
2.15 m (SE). 

Considering the tide, tide, wave, wind influence of hydrologic conditions on construction
jobs, as well as the corrosion of sea water on the pile problems in the design of
the original, non-navigable spans of all foundations set to pile in low pier area
high intensity, the compactness of concrete, Cl-penetration resistance performance
is good and relatively cheap cost of PHC pipe pile (1200 mm), by vertical piles and
piles of pile combination (Fig. 3.78 for 70 m to bridge abutment pile layout and
structure). According to the stage of the actual pile of design changes to adjust
the pile, the vast majority of the pile into a steel pipe piles. The main reasons
are the following several points. 


Bridge sea tide, tide, wave, wind, fog and hydrometeorological conditions affecting
the stability of the pile driver, resulting in the missed hammering and thus pile
crushing. 

The bridge pile foundation bearing stratum of soil top elevation is generally high,
and layers thick, and with high sand content in the soil, for Low compression compacted
soil, and SPT blow counts, and not conducive to PHC pipe pile sinking. 

PHC pipe pile tip large section, resulting in large amount of soil compaction and
resistance, is not conducive to the pile sunk. Although construction of the additional
the steel pile shoes, helped sink the effect is not obvious. In the PHC pipe pile
through low compressibility of compacted soil layer is not enough. 

PHC pipe pile with low cost, good corrosion resistance advantages, but the fighting
ability of PHC pipe pile steel pipe piles is poor, and when the hammer more often,
when penetration is smaller, it tube pile easily damaged. 




Fig. 3.78 Cap structure and pile layout schematic (size: m) (a) platform façade structure;
(b) pile layout. 


 5. Pile hammer equipment capacity and length of PHC pipe piles, pile weight and the
pile bearing capacity of an uncoordinated, can't be "Heavy hammers tapping" the pile
requirements. 


Construction of pile foundations of Donghai bridge practice experience is: the choice
of pile foundation of bridge pier foundation should be take full account of environmental
conditions the influence of high strength, torsional behavior of the pile should
be chosen well, hitting resistance capacity of steel pipe pile; offshore waters affected
by seabed scour and deposition, wave impact differs from the geological structure
of the continental shelf seabed geological structure, the design should fully analyse
soils and bearing capacity force of bridge pile foundation in offshore waters, and
upon the request of both vertical and horizontal bearing capacity; whether the waters
off the coast with PHC pipe pile foundations, should be based on comparison and selection
of foundation conditions were reasonable, to control the construction of the total
number of blow and penetration, in order to ensure piling process the pile structural
integrity and durability of structures using. 

Example 3.18. United States, San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. 

United States—San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge East span bridge is a double-deck
all 10 lanes of large-span bridge, with a total 4 km, full-bridge into self-anchored
suspension bridges and viaducts on the sea, on both sides of the approach spans four
parts of wiring, substructure for the pile foundation. 

Foundation design of one of the most characteristic is the use of inclined pile foundation
of high-pile, pile structures in multi-cell box shaped steel frame filled with concrete,
being a concrete-filled steel tube. From the perspective of geological condition
of the bridge, river bed under the soil distribution varies widely, on main bridge
tower is located in relatively shallow bedrock slopes. Most other foundations located
deep in the mud layer. 

Oakland Bay Bridge East span bridge located in the strong earthquake, seismic risk
can cause two major geological fault lines of Sandy Bridge site 12 km and 25 km only.
Requests by two fortification level for aseismic design (normal use and safety features
of earthquake). 

First piers of the viaduct by sea 50 m high bridge pier foundation (Fig. 3.79) as
an example, the pier is located deep in the slime layer shang, pile high 6.5 m, water
2 m, constructed in the form of box-shaped steel frame filled with concrete, to fight
for concrete shrinkage, creep and deformation caused by temperature and reduce the
cracks. Foundation due to earthquake deformation and the size of the cap, and cap
set of 6, diameter 2.5 m, length about slope respectively, 1 : 8, 1 : 12100 m, pile
of steel pipe piles. Design wall thickness along the pile of steel pipe pile long
range, range from 51~68 mm, mainly based on bending bearing capacity of piles, ductile,
corrosion and "scored" based meter. Within the upper two-thirds length of steel pipe
filled with concrete, in order to ensure the transfer of load from the combination
between concrete-filled steel tubular pipe, steel pipe pile (a concrete filled area)
welded onto the inner wall of shear studs, bottom weld shear ring plate. Fig. 3.79
shows the plane and elevation of pile-raft foundation and steel pipe pile elevations.


Construction sequence was: Mencke MHU 1700 hammer for pile foundation construction
and pre-fabricated pile floating and sinking in place, through the internal steel
frame system pile with steel pipe piles and pier reinforcement of internal connections,
and then fill high strength concrete and light-weight concrete, finally setting collision
bezel facilities.

(unit: mm). 

(b) The Open Caisson Foundation 

Caisson is the underlying type of an application has a long history, the earliest
documented's caisson at around 5 m tall wooden caisson (1738), but by the time limit
of construction technology, the caisson were unable to penetrate deep enough to resist
the erosion of soil layer in a long time not used, replaced by a pneumatic caisson
foundation. Until the early 20th century, sink well technique to large gauge die
use, especially in deep water Foundation, such as the United States Oakland Bay Bridge
(1936), depth of 32 m, covering layer thickness of 54.7 m, floating caisson, position
suction sink, base depth is 73.28 m. Now, with the large hoisting, transporting construction
equipment located and seabed drilling-and-blasting and cleaning floor leveling, pre-casting
and installation of open caisson as the main deep water Foundation has been used
many times in real cases of cross-Sea Bridge project. 

Characteristic of sunk shaft foundation embedded depth can be large, high integrity
and good stability, can withstand large vertical loads and water flat load; open
caisson foundation and construction of cofferdam retaining and retaining structures,
the construction process is not complicated. The open caisson foundation disadvantage
is that during a long, fine sand and silt soil in the hole pumping prone quicksand
phenomenon, caused the caisson tilt; under the open caisson sunk in the process of
large boulders, rock or the bottom surface of the trunk tilted too much, will bring
to the construction of certain difficulties. Table 3.13 lists part of the caisson
classification form.

Based on the principle of reasonable strength, construction may, generally in the
following circumstances can the open caisson foundation. 


Load larger, while the extent of allowable bearing capacity of foundation soil on
the surface, spread foundation excavation work, and support difficult, but under
a certain depth (8~30 m under the surface) have good bearing layer using caisson
foundation comparing with other deep foundations, while economically reasonable.


II in the mountainous river, although better soil properties, but erosion, or have
a larger river pebbles and inconveniences pile foundation construction. 

The surface relatively flat and covered with thin layers of rock, but the river deeper,
using construction cofferdam for spread foundation when you are in trouble. 

In depth, wave height, tidal rush of cross-Sea bridge project as a basis for precasting
and installation settings. 


Example 3.19. Air curtain open caisson of the. 

North anchor foundation of Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge
superstructure loads to Anchorage's main function was effectively the main cable
64000 kN forces to the foundation, and horizontal displacement control within the
allowed range; based on geological conditions of anchorage zone of overburden depth
77.6~85.6 m, Clayey and sand layers, respectively (I), fine sand layer (II), and
clay layer (III), fine sand, or gravelly sand layers in (IV), can be used as bearing
stratum II and IV layers, depth of 30 m and 60 m, form the basis of comparison for
diaphragm walls and sinking. 

For underground continuous wall construction broke up and makes the construction
is not a global stress after forming the basis structures to withstand the anchoring
structure outside great water pressure, and at that time the excavation of the underground
continuous wall construction experience 40 m integrated in all circumstances, the
last anchor foundation of choosing sinking. 

Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge anchorage (Fig. 3.80) sunk well of length 69 m, width
51 m, high 58 m, was the world's largest caisson. 

To ensure smooth caisson sinking, elaboration of the general construction plan for
non-wood production for the land, repeatedly sinking, sinking method according to
the specific conditions of drained and undrained sink combination, and auxiliary
air curtains help heavy under water concrete. 

(c) Pneumatic Caisson Foundation 

Difference between pneumatic caisson and caisson foundation lies in its section at
the end of a top cover and top cover plate installed on the well pipes and airlocks
construction Studios. About a century before and during the early 19th century, pneumatic
caisson is a major basic types of bridges. Later because of the size of worker safety
issues, this structure except in Japan has been less used outside. Caisson's great
advantage is to eliminate stagnant water in the basement, the staff can enter the
bottom box Interior to implement barrier removal, substrate Inspection Department.


And other construction work, for a variety of complex geological and hydrological
conditions, basic quality more reliable; main drawback is construction complex equipment
and high construction costs, there are safety issues such as protection of workers
into the enclosure. 



Fig. 3.80 The Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge North anchoring sunk shaft foundation
of air curtain structure (unit: cm). 

To address safety problems, currently Japan auto pneumatic caisson base was developed.
Mechanised mining system in order remote control excavator operations, minimise artificial
the caisson and improves the safety of construction to automatically control information
management system and testing caisson sinking. 

When deep water foundation of bridge to be built-in the large permeability of soil
containing difficult obstacles, or base required special treatment situations, sinking
could not sink, caissons can be used. 

2. After World War II a Modern Basic Form 

In the 1950, of the 20th century, the first Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and successfully
applied to tubular column base, forms the basis of pipe string and its combinations
with other base (such as the caisson) were further developed. 

(a) The Column Base 

String based on the built-in 1953, at the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the first of
a new foundation forms. 

In Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the first and the actual use of tubular column base
due mainly under the influence of hydrological and geological: bridge-bit depth upto
40 m, the maximum water level fluctuation between 19 m and high level long enough;
the river bottom overburden soil to sand, bedrock surface is undulating, scope of
bridge pier foundation rock surface height difference upto 5~6 m, under the influence
of erosion and cover may be washed away some pier is at the rock for toxic gases.
Or detrimental to security and bedrock caisson caisson construction falls bed stability,
such as limiting the use of open caisson and caisson. Moreover, the effect of negative
pile anchor badly and stability. By various analysis and comparison, final adopted
by 35 number of pile, diameter 1. 55 m depth 2~7 m string consisting of rock-socketed
pile foundation. 

At present, the development of pipe pile foundations: the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge
will be reinforced concrete pipe column instead of pre-stressed reinforced concrete
tubing diameter grew to 3.6 m in Nanchang Gan River Bridge, further developed to
5 in diameter 5.8 m. In other countries, the former Soviet Union, Japan and the Europe
and the United States began to use tubular column foundation, and in terms of construction
methods and equipment have increased and improved, among them, Japan on the expansion
of this type of foundation, improving the most powerful, the Yokohama Bay Bridge
tubular column foundation (3.81) tubing diameter 10.0 m. Even more important is the
base string by the scope of River Development Foundation in deep water to the big
wind, wave and tide rush hammer and ice-melting impact larger deep water foundation.


Tubular column base with large diameters or small diameter open caisson foundation
of pile foundations of main difference between column base of the pipe string is
socketed rock. Its main features are: take column base embedded in the rock and pillars
embedded rigid CAP reduced the free length of columns and improves the overall foundation
stiffness of second string forces comprising primarily pre-fabricated wall (reinforced
concrete, pre-stressed concrete or steel) bear, when up by a tube filled with concrete
or reinforced concrete. 



Fig. 3.81 Pipe pile foundation of Yokohama Bay Bridge (unit: mm). 

Pipe column base materials can be divided into reinforced concrete pipe, pre-stressing
force concrete tube, steel tube column, according to the cap position low string
based, high pile bearing platform management foundation. 

Tube base can be used for deep water, tidal influence, the rock face rugged riverbed
without coating or overlay is very thick, are suitable used to close clay and all
kinds of rock, soil, and through caves, boulders supported on dense soil layers or
fresh high on a rock. String base not too applies to regions with serious geological
defects, such as crushing or serious fault loose areas. In general, within sunk pile
appropriate range of application pile foundation tubing can be used. 

Example 3.20. Wuhan Changjiang river second bridge piers, 8th: steel-pipe column
base. 

Wuhan Yangtze 8th pier continuous rigid frame bridge with intermediate activities
supporting pier. Construction during flood period the maximum velocity of about 1
m/s, deep ~ 25 m, the geology is complex, covering layer thickness 23~27 m top to
bottom is silty and fine sand in layers and 0.2 ~ 0.3 m thick round gravel rock surface
elevation about -21.5 m, under which the conglomerate fully strong weathered and
weak weathered and conglomerate fracture zone. 

8th original design for double-wall steel cofferdam for pier foundation bored pile
foundation bearing platform, but taking into account the adverse geological conditions,
the cofferdam resistance water area is large and has little depth, a structure may
vary depending on local soil erosion is difficult to guarantee stability. Comprehensive
comparison of select high pile steel pipe column base (Fig. 3.82). 

The foundation a total of 12 pieces of steel pipe column, column inner diameter of
2.2 m, wall thickness 14 mm, long 49.5 m; hole diameter 1.8 m, drilling deep 14.5~28.5
m double-wall steel cofferdam for outer diameter of 20.6 m, thickness 0.6 m, the
level 22.05 m. 



Fig. 3.82 Sketch of infrastructure (unit: cm). 

Foundation construction, set-provides orientation of steel tubular column with steel
surrounding cage, inserting steel pipe column into the rock surface, steel pipe column
cover mix concrete tube and begin drilling and pouring concrete, all string after
the construction is completed, dismantle the steel surrounding cage, lifting and
sinking waterproof cofferdams, cofferdam sealing concrete pouring pumping building
cap. 

Example 3.21. Canton Railway Zhaoqing Xijiang Bridge: double tubular column foundation
bearing platform (Fig. 3.83). 

Double cap tube on the base is made up of pile caps, pipe columns, consisting of
rock-socketed pile and bored pile under, which is different from the column increase
foundation located under the cap role to reduce the length of string. 

Canton Railway 5 × 144 m of continuous steel trussed girder of Zhaoqing Xijiang bridge,
4th pier is located in the main channel of the Xijiang river in water, double-pile
tube CAP, tube on the pillar base is made up of columns, consisting of rock-socketed
pile and bored pile under. 

Foundation design construction is mainly because: 


base location for extrusion cement limestone bedrock, single axial compressive ultimate
strength of more than 400 MPa, has good bearing capacity; 

the bedrock overburden soil is coarse and gravelly sand, its thickness increase change
hydrological impacts reduction between 10~13 m. When designing a high water level,
local scour of the riverbed extends to rock face, which added the length of the string,
resulting in column design of bottom bending stress exceeds allowable limits design;


from a construction point of view, the pier depth (depth of water into the rock face
at 38 m) covering layer and shallow, it tube column's position in the construction
process and security deposit issue. Therefore, in the design of foundations, taking
into account the structural strength to the full load of rock-socketed pile-supported
piers, do not consider pile cap itself load-bearing function. The cap role only to 
decrease the string length to meet the lateral stiffness of the structure, no basement
drill subjected to bending moment in order to avoid the inadequacy of rocks in tectonic.
All in all, cap is set to replace the eroded under overburden foundation provides
embedding functions more effectively.

(b) Composite Foundation 

In depth very deep and very thick cover or case with complicated geological conditions,
and because of their limited capacity, could not be a single foundation sinking when
the desired depth is reached, can take two different forms the basis, build a bridge
to use the relay to Sham Shui Po, usually called this combination forms the basis
for the foundation. Typical combination is based on the caisson with bored piles,
pipe, bell-shaped bases, combined to form the foundation. While considering the construction
of temporary facilities, and another double-wall steel cofferdam in combination with
piles, pipe forming foundation. 

Example 3.22. Of main bridge of Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, 2nd pier and open caisson
and tubular column foundation (3.84). 



Fig. 3.84 Main bridge of Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, 2nd Pier and open caisson
and tubular column foundation Schematic (unit: cm) (a) sunk shaft with steel Tubular
column foundation structure; (b) level of caisson and Cap hinge. 

Hydrogeological conditions along the pier located at the depth of about 30 m, covering
layer thickness of about 40 m, scour the riverbed of 23 m, based on the technical
conditions to adopt the single string base have difficulties or caisson foundation.
From the caisson and string combinations to form the basis of, it tube embedded within
the bedrock of the lower end of the column, top embedded in the pile of concrete,
concrete caisson bottom sealing and capping the connection string into integer steel
can be used as a guide frame and cofferdam in construction of open caisson, is part
of the permanent structure, enhances the rigidity of the base. 

3. In the 1990 of the 20th Century has two Basic Forms of New Development 

Owing to the harsh water conditions, construction time and quality are difficult
to ensure, on the other hand, pre-casting and installation needed for transport,
cranes and other equipment and technology to further mature, large pre-cast foundation
in deep water or floating installation process as a whole has developed rapidly.


As early as 1939, United States pioneered the Bell foundation in recent years, there
have been new developments and applications. Similarly, underground continuous wall
foundation originated in the 1950, of the 20th century in Europe, alongwith the dredging
machinery and technology development, is another forms the basis of the recently
developed rapidly. 

(a) Install Pre-cast and Pre-fabricated Base (Basis Set) 

Pre-cast and pre-fabricated installation base (also known as the basis set) on the
basic form is divided into two kinds: pre-fabricated caissons, this forms the basis
in Japan and the United Kingdom, and Denmark have been used; another is a bell-shaped
base, United States, and Japan, and Canada are also used. 

Japan as early as 1988, built North and South of great Seto bridge 6 based at sea,
using the float in place, direct placement the whole foundation of open caisson foundation,
followed by pre-cast caisson applied gradually, such as built in 1991, United Kingdom
Thames Dartford-steel cable-stayed bridge over the river, which was completed in
1998. Denmark great belt Strait to the East, Nishihashi and completed the same year
Japan Akashi Strait Bridge has adopted this basic form. 

Clock-based initiative in United States in 1939, on the Yubotuoma River Bridge, at
present, the United States, and Japan, and Canada, and Denmark countries, have been
used in the construction of deep water foundation of bridge foundation form. 

Bell-shaped base compared with the sinking, in addition to structural shape differences,
main difference: sinking in place construction of open caisson is a permanent bearing
structure, is a bell-shaped base in construction of thin shell structure, can be
described as waterproof cofferdam concrete construction forms, is non-wing long structures
only become final only upon completion of cast in place concrete permanent load bearing
structure. 

Technical characteristics are the basis of Bell: first base and part of the pier
on the shore of shape steel plates for welded steel or reinforced concrete, a bell-shaped
thin-shell pre-stressed pre-cast concrete box, and then place this box lifting in
total sound foundations or piles on it. Then, the pouring of concrete of pile caps
and pier at the same time, make it into a whole. (Fig. 3.85) The United States in
1959, St. Mary Stewarthaiwaer bridge built in combination with steel piles forming
the basis of Bell-shaped base. 



Fig. 3.85 American St. Mary Stewart iron bridge built-in Haiwa on the basis of Bell-shaped
pile. 

The clock on the pile-foundation this simple base with less construction materials,
construction methods, construction speed the advantages, but its biggest drawback
is the high technical requirements for construction. In addition, by Yu Zhong-Foundation
for main tower of large span bridge, Pier foundations, foundation load capacity,
high requirements for foundations, built directly on the basis of sometimes requires
the rock stone ground. 

In use, bell-shaped foundation and caisson resemblance, namely, pre-fabricated loading
method and applied to sea-spanning bridge construction. 

Example 3.23. Canada Federal bridge Bell Foundation. 

In 1997 completion of Canada Federal bridge across the Northumberland Strait, for
44 holes of main spans of pre-stressed concrete box girder of long span 250 m, in
order to meet the conditions for offshore operations, it, bell-shaped pier foundation
and upper structure are all using pre-fabricated components, factory pre-fabricated
on shore, use large gondolas for installation on site. Bell-shaped base (Fig. 3.86)
basal diameter of 22 m, based on height to the depth of 10~35 m vary within a range,
base made cone-shaped platform at the top, with the pier closed. Construction used
large floating hanging bell-shaped base lifting sinking into place, then piers pre-cast
foundation crane-mounted directly into the top of the cone-shaped platform, through
the pre-stressed structures both as a single entity. 

Example 3.24. Greece Rion-Antirion Bridge: "reinforced earth base isolation". 

Greece bridge of Rion-Antirion bridge in highly exceptional circumstances, environmental
factors, depth of greater than 2500 m length range more than 65 m, steep on both
sides of the sea bed, accompanied by strong seismic activity (recurrence period of
2000 the maximum peak acceleration 1.2 g) and the tectonic movement (Fig. 3.87).
Gulf shipping request, ship impact force for 180000 t/16 section (section 1 = 1 nautical
mile/h = 1.852 km/h); geological factors (Fig. 3.88), bedrock depth of the bridge
over 500 m, under the sea-bed soil order are as follows: (a) 4~7 m non-stickiness
gravel, (b) rather unstable sand, silty sand and silty clay layer, free (c) 30 m
is a homogeneous layer of silty clay or clay, for the typical soft ground. A 20 m
liquefaction of deep layer is on the north shore. The bridge main controlling factors
on the seismic safety of the design. Apart from the upper structure selects five
outside the floating structural system of cable-stayed bridge span continuous, in
the sub-structure of the processing, diameter 2 m, deep steel pipe piles with 7 of
25~30 m~8 m the spacing of soil and solid, covered with sand, gravel and crushed
stone pile top 3 m thick composed of sand-gravel cushion forming class "Composite
Foundation", which is located on 90 m in diameter formed box foundation for the sliding
of the "reinforced earth base isolation" (reinforced soil foundation) (Fig. 3.89).

(b) Underground Continuous Wall 

Underground pile bent diaphragm wall type, slot type, pre-cast and many other structures
and modular forms, but should be used in bridge foundation structure is mainly made
of grooved-section. In bridge construction in China, the transport sector application
starts when the construction of the Guangdong Humen bridge and research in anchorage
of runyang Yangtze river highway bridge in Jiangsu, was also adopted. 

At present, underground continuous wall of most developed countries are Japan, has
accumulated over 15 million m2 of underground continuous wall built, among other
things is in the application of bridge deep water foundation. Its main construction
in two ways: one is the cofferdam built island in the water, and then in the above
the underground continuous wall construction. Another is used as waterproofing and
resistance of underground continuous wall cofferdam of earth pressure in the surrounding
excavation work within the Weir, arrived at the design elevation in situ perfusion
deep like a caisson foundation. 

Example 3.25. Japan Aomori bridge main pylon Pier foundations of main span (Fig.
3.90). 

Japan-Aomori bridge-tower cable-stayed bridge across the 240 m, through to the caisson,
shaft, locking pipe piles and pile with large diameter diaphragm wall under programmes
such as comparison, selected underground continuous wall for its infrastructure.
Also according to the ground conditions, focus on the basis of support, on the large
flat area (20.5 m × 30 m) and shallow (45 m only), small surface area (12 m × 30
m) and the deep (85 m) two schemes make choices and, finally, according to characteristics,
economic and reasonable structure, construction easier and used the flat shallow
scheme. Also used a similar lock in construction (with gaps of steel tubes and steel
plugs) the new connector.

3.4 TECHNICAL FACTORS AFFECTING ECONOMIC INDICATORS 

Since entering the 21st century, due to the low carbon economy and sustainable development,
the whole-life design philosophy of attention to bridge design follow the "safe,
suitable, economical, beautiful, durable and environmentally friendly" six principles
has become a consensus among members. However, with the Chinese classics increase
of economic development and national investment, the economic principles of bridges
in China seem to get overlooked. Some economic and unreasonable large-span program,
often due to the owner's "over-ambitious" was used and designers blind pursuit of
large-span bridge, technicians mistakenly, that span's breakthrough was "innovation"
is the world leading level of realisation and, to that end, will take a doubled price,
and even cause serious imbalance (span/height ratio), and evil in the vastly disproportionate
to the adjacent bridge. We should encourage the adoption of innovative effort to
reach the best mechanical properties, the reasonable constructional details and the
most convenient construction technology, but also the most cost effective and aesthetically
pleasing bridges, thereby enhancing the reputation and competitiveness of China's
bridges. 

Projects of product conceptual design phase the idea choice, you need to consider
many factors, economics is one of the most important factors. Different bridge-type
has a different economic and technical indicators, and indicators changes alongwith
changes in the condition of building the bridge. Therefore, for special set the conditions
of bridges, project selection to choose the economic programmes are needed; for a
specific bridge, spans of different layouts, section, tower shape, structure, and
will be also demonstrate different economics; construction will affect programme
of the economy; with basis in particular deep water foundation account for a higher
proportion of the total investment, so concept of selection is based an important
task in the design stage. 

3.4.1 Material and Economic Indicators of Bridge Types 

Bridges are an important indicator of economic deck material consumption per square
metre, attaches great importance to this international design contest reflect the
indicators of competitiveness and technology. Due to gaps in the materials industries,
our bridge material grades is relative backwardness. Design of steel box girder,
Europe and the United States, using the HPS460 (Europe)-HPS480 (United States) BHS500
(Japan), high performance steel, even at high stress areas with a small amount of
local HPS560 and HPS690 to reduce thickness board, simplifying construction and manufacturing
difficulties. An S345 steel used mostly in China, but of different thickness steel
plate welders arts and inconvenience, it is also very economical. In terms of concrete
structure, China has mostly C50, and foreign high-performance HPC80 has been commercialised.
Thus, our concrete bridges tend to be relatively clumsy and "fat", but outside the
concrete bridge is much more slender and light (smaller dimensions, wall thickness
is thinner), concrete is also greatly reduced, there is a clear gap. 

Suspension bridge's more expensive, a long construction period, regardless of the
cross-river project in the lower reaches of the Yangtze river, coastal sea island
drive and cross in the mountains of West-Central Valley Project, the priority should
be relatively economical and cable-stayed bridge cable can be replaced or suspension
bridge scheme. Full justification must be provided for suspension must be used, and
is not to replace the main cable control rot should be dealt with seriously, in order
to ensure the durability of their lifecycle. Not only the pursuit of span by ignoring
economic principles when choosing suspension bridge schemes. 

Same bridge conditions, different layout structure and span of the bridge material
indicators, economic indicators are different and, therefore, economy of bridge type
alternatives tend to be conceptual design scheme selection of the most important
considerations.

3.4.2 General Layout of 2 Impact on Economic Indicators 

General features include size, the presence of deep-water foundation, the main beam
with long span cross-section tower of forms and materials, shapes and materials,
economic and technical indicators of the whole bridge, so mastering its general laws,
contribute to overall layout phase fully into account in programme economy, the economy
took the first step for the programme, and a decisive step because the bridge and
the overall layout of the economy is controlling factors of the economy of the entire
programme, once the bridge and determine the layout and is difficult to reduce costs,
only partially, a small amount of to optimise and reduce costs. 

At present, long-span cable-stayed bridge has exceeded kilometers, and there is development
potential in the range of 1200 m-span entirely from anchor angle laqiao of the economy
will be significantly better than suspension bridges. Also, rigidity and wind-resistant
stability of multi-span cable-stayed bridge and construction are superior to many
suspension bridge. For example, France designed by Greece Rion-Antirion bridge, depth
of 65 m, and is located in an earthquake zone, navigable sea of 180,000t round, 560
m said that a very economical and reasonable scheme and new cable-stayed bridge of
reinforced soil-isolated foundation, does not adopt a more cross-suspension bridge
Such as Germany and Denmark Marne Strait bridge between (Fehmarnsund Bridge) programme
selection spans 780 m of cable-stayed bridge to meet 200,000t navigation requirements
for seagoing vessels, is the most economical Cross-Sea project, for the lower reaches
of the Yangtze River in China Cross-River project and the southeast coast of the
island-sea link project has provided an important reference. 

(a) The Span Arrangement 

Increased span, avoid water foundation, also may choose to a conceptual design of
economical and reasonable. 

Example 3.29. The Yangpu bridge, the bridge river main channel on the East Coast,
East of main pier is located on the shore, West pier would be located on land, shore
or in the water, which can be three-span arrangement, as shown in Table 3.17. 

Table 3.17 Yangpu bridge piers plans comparison.

Plan A: Two main piers are located on land, main span is 602 m; 

Plan B: East main piers located onshore, west side main piers located in the original
terminal location, half water, half on the ground, the main span size is 580 m; 

Plan C: East main piers located onshore, west of main piers in the water, main span
520 m. 

These three scenarios, such as plan a main pier foundation construction cost for
1.0, and the shore, the proportion of the cost of in-water pier foundations 1.0 :
2. 1 : 3.3, directly affect the total cost of the bridge. Although cost is directly
related to the size and span of the superstructure, the greater the span the more
expensive. But because the cost of land based and water based differences, resulting
in long span 602 m model a total cost than span B, 520 m and span C, 580 m programmes
were reduced to 6.4 million Yuan and 14.7 million dollars. 

(b) Deep-water Foundation 

Large-scale deep-water foundation of costly, risky, directly affects the economic
effects. To allow for lower construction cost comparison, from several cable-stayed
bridge in engineering, expressed in a lower construction cost and percentage of total
cost. 400~600 m span cable-stayed bridges: main piers located on the shore of the
Nanpu bridge and Yangpu bridge, the geological conditions of main piers located in
shallow water or in low water level for onshore construction when the Chongqing Yangtze
river, lower construction cost of cable-stayed bridge with a total cost of 19%~22%.
When pier located in good geological and topographic conditions, lower structural
costs will be lower, such as Jialing river of Shimen bridge lower construction cost
total 16.4%. When the main piers located in the water when the sub-structure cost
total cost ratio with the hydrological, geological, topographical and change, general
30%~40%. In normal circumstances, decreases with long span, lower structural costs
as percentage of total cost goes rising trend. 

(c) Master Girder Forms and Materials 

Girder bridge is a PC an intermediate form between the steel deck and the deck, its
weight is about 300 kN/m, and PC bridge (500 kN/m) and the steel bridge (150 kN/m).
Accordingly, in the cable-stayed bridge with a large scope of application (l = 200
~1000 m), three decks have the advantage of the most economical and reasonable range
respectively. 

(i) PC Bridge (for l =200~500 m) 

When the length of the cantilever exceeds 250 m, the heavier deck will expose the
weaknesses of PC. To reduce weight, need thinning of box girder wall thickness, and
thus increase the stress level in the construction phase, plus required pre-load
stress against the live load of tensile stress in the future. As control construction
quality problems of improper or, Ningbo Zhaobaoshan bridge appears as "attending"
the passive situation, and even lead to crushing accidents. 

(ii) The Girder Bridge (for L = 400~700 m) 

Girder bridge due to covered with pre-cast concrete bridge decks, deck asphalt pavement
conditions and perhaps the PC Liang Yi achieve, especially at high temperature region
of steel deck pavement technology is still a problem case, selection of combined
beam can avoid later concerns. Composed of composite girder with steel girders and
beams beam line, manufacturing and installation is very convenient, high-strength
bolt connection can be used, the construction convenient, low cost than steel box
girders. In the cable-stayed bridge under 700 m, as long as the inclined plane of
the cables, the open knot beams already has plenty of wind resistance, such as the
main cross 605 m Fuzhou Minjiang river bridge is a successful example. Although knot
deck is heavier than steel box girder deck, cable steel and base quantity increase,
but the broad economic indicator is still better than steel box girder well and are
worth considering. 

(iii) Steel Box Girder Deck (for L = 700~1200 m) 

700 m should select light weight cable-stayed bridge of steel deck. Suzhou-Nantong
Yangtze river bridge, studies have shown that, when used plane and six-lane closed
rectangular box girder flyover, then its critical wind velocity of more than 100
m/s, to meet the world's most wind in areas prone to wind-resistance requirements.
If the side span of cable-stayed bridge has landed, you can choose the side span
PC bridge, main span steel bridge deck mixed forms, rigidity and wind-resistant stability
of bridges will also be further improved. 

Example 3.30. Main navigation span of Donghai bridge bridge program. 

Design of main navigation span of Donghai bridge, for double tower double cable plane,
twin single-cable-plane cable-stayed bridge with steel box girder of concrete box
girder, twin and single cable plane cable-stayed bridge with box girder, double tower
double cable plane cable-stayed bridge I-girder cable-stayed bridge with four programmes
were compared, as shown in Table 3.18. Its span arrangement are as follows: 94 m
+ 111 m + 420 m + 111 m + 94 m, per square meter economic indicators were 23680,
19500, 20940 and 21180. 2% higher than the concrete box girder of steel box girders,
both were higher than the combined beam 13% and 12%.

Example 3.31. Jiaojiang bridge main span 480 m girder structure of the program as
a whole process of idea generation, is in a great deal of information based on the
collection, analysis, test design based on the results of the various concepts, through
the concept of choice, eventually forming the half-closed steel box set beams, a
new concept of composite beams. During the main girder of pre-stressed concrete box
girders, I-beams, fully enclosed steel beam combination beams, box-girder beams,
fully enclosed and semi-enclosed steel box composite beam of steel box composite
beam test design and estimating the investment results are shown in Table 3.19.

Example 3.32. Completed in 1986, Canada Annacis bridge main span 465 m of composite
beam cable-stayed bridge, two main towers, respectively located in shallow waters
on both sides of the river channel and filling sand foundation construction connected
with the bank. According to the proposal (programme for process tuliang coagulation,
option two for composite beams) results: the economic performance of composite beams
with more advantages than the concrete beams, laminated beams has a cost about 20%
lower. 

Example 3.33. Completed in 1984, Spain Luna bridge main span of 440 m pre-stressed
concrete double tower, double cable plane cable-stayed bridge main span across the
water reservoir of 50 m reservoir bottom gravel overburden thickness of 17 m layer,
the bedrock is limestone. Two main tower located on the shore. In early 1980, the
design, and made 22 of the ICP for main girder of steel girders, concrete beams are
superimposed demonstrate the beam, came to the conclusion that: a concrete beam construction
cost. 

Example 3.34. In accordance with China's Anhui Province, preliminary design, detailed
comparisons of Anqing Yangtze river bridge: the main span of 500 m steel cost about
124% of the concrete cable-stayed bridge. Based on domestic economic conditions,
500 m within the main span concrete cable-stayed bridge has a considerable competitive
edge. 

(d) The Tower Type and Material 

Different tower types with the same material, and its cost is different. For the
same type, using different materials, and its cost are also different. Generally
speaking, steel tower of the most expensive, and its cost is 2.5~3 times. 

Example 3.35. Su Tong bridge tower-shaped materials and different economic comparison
Fig. 3.93 for the design of each tower-shaped landscape scheme optimised selection
of landscape renderings. 



Fig. 3.93 Three tower schemes (a) Inverted y-shaped tower (b) Diamond-shaped towers;
(c) A-shaped tower. 

Table 3.20 comparison of different engineering and construction of the tower. Because
the one tower anchor area separation of two towers, tower space is relatively small,
and steel-anchor-box anchorage, other towers of steel anchor box and circumferential
prestressed programmes carried out analysis and comparison. As can be seen from
the table in the use of steel-anchor-box anchorage of the same mode, inverted y-shaped
towers than the diamond-shaped tower JI, Jian province about 1 of 5 million Yuan.
When using circumferential pre-stressed, diamond-shaped tower with a-shaped tower
cost basically the same, and inverted y-shaped towers the most economical. 

Example 3.36. Su Tong bridge tower-shaped materials and different economic comparison
in the preliminary design stages, the tower of reinforced concrete, steel, steel-concrete
combined the three schemes are the same depth of research and compared. 

Tower: The tower height is 297.7 m lower pylon column for ministers at the end of
15 m, wide 8 m, wall thickness 1.5 m chang 8 m, anchor, 8 m wide, wall thickness
1.2 m. 

Cable tower: The tower height is 297.7 m lower pylon column for ministers at the
end of 15 m, 8 m wide, steel plate thickness 40 mm; head of anchor 8 m, width 8 m,
plate thickness 38 mm. 

Steel-concrete composite pylon tower: The tower height is 297.7 m lower pylon column
at the base length of 15 m, width 8 m, wall thickness 1.5 m, anchorage area is steel
structure, length 8 m, width 8 m, plate thickness 38 mm. 

(Note: in the selection of materials section, cross Tower Bridge to the × direction
longitudinal to size for top of tower 8 m × 8 m, bottom of tower 8 m × 15 m, and
eventually selected the top size 9 m × 8 m, 8 m × 15 m at the end of vary, and coagulation

3.4.3 General Layout of 3 Impact on Economic Indicators 

Based programmes had a great influence on the bridge in economic indicators, especially
deep water foundation, tend to invest in full-bridge 30%~40%, and greater risk of
deep water foundation construction, often concerns the success or failure of the
bridge. Therefore, a good concept based gage foundation (including the method of
its construction) must have the construction risk, duration can be controlled and
economical characteristics, and economic design of the foundation is also one of
the highlights of the whole design. 

Example 3.39. Tower of Taizhou Changjiang River Bridge pile foundation and caisson
scheme comparison. 

Rounded rectangular open caisson well plane size is 58.2 m × 44.1 m, fillet radius
7.95 m, to facilitate suction soil sinks, layout of open caisson for the 12 × 12.7
m × 12.7 m large hole. Because of sinking depth deep, surrounding wells is set to
round end shape, Arch formed to resist water pressure, in order to facilitate sinking,
in arch has a diameter of 1.0 m water hole. 

Use rounded rectangular open caisson (Fig. 3.95), the pier scour elevation -19.27
m, scour elevation 59.57 m, caisson bearing layer selection-68.88 m gravel sand layer.
Taking into account the erosion and changes affecting the river, sinking bottom elevation
production -70.00 m, in order to prevent the ship hit the tower, top of sinking well
exposed above the highest navigable water, elevation to + 6.0 m, open caisson high
76 m.

3.4.4 Impact of General layout on Economic Indicators 

Investments in construction methods directly related to the bridge, under normal
circumstances, a certain bridge engineering, construction companies are often will
be based on its own experience and equipment, choosing the most economical solution
construction in order to gain the maximum profit, and owners tend to focus on duration,
project quality, and capital investment. An excellent construction enterprise must
be able to fully take into account a variety of factors, construction innovation,
advanced equipment, security technology, advanced management of quality, technology,
construction and profit in a win-win. 

Construction itself, closely related to design and construction method, a design
may have a number of options for construction method of construction experts in special
studies of needs and optimal construction method. In many cases, the design is more
specific (past construction method can not be applied), or construction requirements
are relatively harsh (a similar construction method where did not have the conditions
imposed), concept design must take into account specific construction methods. 



Fig. 3.99 Caisson Foundation scheme (unit: mm). 

Example 3.41. Construction of Yajisha bridge scheme selection. 

Traditional construction method of arch bridge cable erection method, brackets and
so on, but as the bridge span increases, construction equipment and temporary facilities
costs rising sharply, long duration and high cost disadvantages, and there in the
upper section assembly, welding quality guarantee. Yajisha bridge will have a span
of 360 m, vector 76 m, using traditional construction methods, in terms of possibilities
and an economic rationality, it is not desirable. 

Combination of bridge and bridge of Yajisha bridge features of open space and convenient
sea transport across the Taiwan Strait, of main arch installation puts forward three
lifting, such as Kapyong turn whole floating, vertical construction program. 


The three stage lifting scheme. To meet the requirements of navigation, the main
arch was divided into three segments, segment of each side is 70 m, the field is
204 m. Both segments separately in bridge erection bracket assembly, middle 204 m
Yaji group after a spell on the sand, slip into barges floating transported to the
bridge, vertical lift in place closing (Fig. 3.100). 

The whole floating programme. The programme overall float to the main arch span of
344 m bridge installed, in order to reduce work on the water (Fig. 3.101). By sliding
the track moved to arch the whole barge, submerged barges, each 120 m long, 30 m
wide, mass 15000t. 

The kapyong turn vertical programmes. Considering the condition of bridge site open
space on both sides and reduce Spider-man, the main arch rib-installation production
kapyong turn vertical construction scheme, quality of vertical rotation 2058t, horizontal
rotation quality as 13865t, horizontal rotation quality as the largest Fig. 3.102.

4. The Scheme Selection 

(i) Three lifting and rotation programme various operating conditions calculations
are to meet the design requirements, it is technically feasible. Three stage lifting
scheme of arch bracket assembled on the bridge, bridge alignment easier to control,
middle section of main arch by temporary tie rod alignment adjust shape, while keeping
the structure system transformation is more complicated. Swing construction programmes
take full advantage of the side arches and across half an arch formation self balancing
system, large diameter loop ensures that the balance is in the rotary process, enough
of the factor of safety against overturning and adjustment buckle Suo Lali, can make
the side arches and a main arch during the rotation process in an optimal stress
state, but using high-precision synchronous lifting technique. Whole floating hoisting
transport Fulcrum 53 m vault of 88 m transport system for variable structure, risk
is too big. And because of inadequate treatment, bridge caused a number of residual
stress in the cross section is too large, has obvious flaws in the technology. 

(ii) Three stage lifting scheme of peacetime construction influences on waterway
is small, but because the waterway favour south, scaffolding and construction trestle
occupied main channel waters and waterways, department continues expanding to the
north, and set emergency turn-around bridge upstream and downstream areas, and smaller
ships waiting parking area, in the interest of navigational safety. Middle section
of main arch floating, positioning, lifting both construction procedures need to
cover, such as homework, in order to ensure Hong Kong normal production, requires
two 24 h completed within a climatic ebb and, unable to carry out continuous operation.


Erection scheme of main arch assembled on shore, changed a lot of Spider-man for
the ground operation. Because the clearance under the main arch much greater than
the design navigation clearance, in the process without cover, Swivel, to minimise
the impacts on waterway. 

(iii) Three hoisting assembly bracket and lifting scaffolding upto 60 m, a larger
amount of material, temporarily tied several times adjustable the entire, complex
operation. Due to the side effects of supports on channel, it is necessary to widen
the waterway, while deeper draught barges required for floating van surrounding waters
for dredging, and aerial operations required compensation for the shipping sector,
incurred large costs and difficult to estimate. 

Swing construction programme despite an increase of some agreed temporary works,
and rotation construction requires high-precision synchronous lifting equipment,
but less uncertainty, project cost control. 

(iv) Three stage lifting scheme can be of rotation programme and processes work in
parallel, can shorten the duration. 

Comprehensive comparison, swivel construction plan is safe and reliable, with minimal
impact on waterway, short duration, economy, experts demonstrated many times, review
determined to implement the programme. Swing construction successfully completed
on October 24, 1999. 

Example 3.42. Anchor block of Taizhou Changjiang River Bridge construction method
of comparison with economy. 



Fig. 3.103 Diagram of anchor structure (North anchor) (unit: cm) (a) side facade;
(b) plane. 

Rectangular open caisson foundation programmes: general arrangement to reduce the
overturning moment, anchoring, anchoring base with eccentric reset hole in the back
filling grouting in rock ballast, so that more uniform stress under dead load. Due
to the supporting layer of silty sand North Coast as far South Bank is deeply buried,
so North anchorage of caisson sizes larger than south anchorage. Sinking plane dimension
of north anchor with 52.0 m × 58.8 m sink caisson depth 57 m, floor 1610.8 m × 12.5
m borehole; the South anchor with 50.0 m × 56.8 m, open caisson high 51 m, layout
of open caisson for the 16 × 10.3 m × 12.0 m large hole. Section wall thickness at
the end of 2.15 m, the remaining wall thickness 2.0 m, wall thickness 1.6 m sink
hole section of 10 m for concrete-filled steel and the remaining section of reinforced
concrete. Sealing concrete 10 m, covers an average thickness of 5 m. Steel Q235 steel,
concrete C30, sealing concrete water C30, C40 manhole cover concrete. Knot frame
as shown in Figs. 3.103, 3.104. 



Fig. 3.104 Diagram of anchor structure (North anchor) (unit: cm). 

Underground continuous wall base surface can be arranged into rectangles and circles
in two scenarios. While working with a circular cross-section in construction of
underground continuous wall of reasonable strength, but due to anchor the bottom
section is rectangular, round base with rectangular cross-section does not match
the anchorage, rounded volume large, uneconomic. Underground continuous wall of rectangular
layout is very compact, and longitudinal stiffness, reasonable force as a whole,
the composite diaphragm wall foundation considers only rectangular plan.

					CASE ANALYSIS OF INNOVATIVE IDEAS IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 

					Conceptual design is based on "safety, utility, economy and beauty, durability and
					protection" principle in order to bridge engineering and related disciplines knowledge
					and practical experience on the basis of (large bridges in particular requires a
					multidisciplinary approach), with technical innovation as the goal, make suitable
					natural conditions, to meet with functional design. Concept design is the soul of
					design. 

					Due to the condition of building the bridge is different, it is impossible to copy
					others 'outstanding design achievements, however, we can learn people managed to
					design thinking, grasp its essence, together, become a rich source of our conceptual
					design. Learning, research the innovative ideas and design concepts, as well as successful
					experience is learning to concept design, innovative ideas important ways. 

					For this reason, this chapter from the following view descriptions, analyse the successful
					conception of philosophy and its distinctive design. 


The bridge scheme and general layout ideas. Bridge scheme refers to all kinds of
						bridge the conception and selection, overall including the layout and facades the
						span and cross-section layout, etc., containing the main navigation span settings,
						side spans, towers, piers and girders and other major structures, study on the structure
						and support system, and so on. It is the overall layout considerations and decision-making
						of conceptual design for structure, concept design fully reflects the basis and guarantee
						of six design principles. 

Technical innovation in the bridge program. Mr. Man-Chung Tang, a bridge engineer
						said, if you do not try to in the design of each as much as possible to improve,
						then it does not fulfill the obligation of the engineer. Natural conditions and the
						functional requirements of each bridge vary, provided through research and ideas,
						creating groundbreaking technology solutions and become a technology of conceptual
						design flash points of light, is technological innovation. A bridge program, the
						pursuit of 1~2 innovative ideas, worthy of our bridge technicians work more efforts
						and re-double their diligence. 

Bridge program consideration of landscape. Comparison and selection of bridge schemes
						conceived and is based on the principles of economical and suitable for all bridge
						programme should be accord with aesthetic principles. For the city an important bridge
						to living in the city (region) demand for landscape designers will be become an important
						factor in order to fully meet the needs of landscape functions. This would need to
						be designed to rely on wisdom find a balance point of six design principles and purpose.
						

Records span the right concept: Maximum span of each bridge there is a current record,
						there are also bridges performance and its limitation span of the current material
						properties (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2), and they are developing and changing.
						It is very important task is to establish the overall layout of main navigation span,
						a record span the overall layout of the very important task is to identify the main
						navigation span, a record span of the bridge is the idea of the outcome of the overall
						layout of a "special cases", it's "special" is made up of natural conditions (including
						geology, topography and water depth, etc.) and shipping capability request form.
						Conceptual breakthrough long-span bridge to record programmes, in particular, we
						would like to emphasise the application of economic principles and, establish a correct
						idea of philosophy. 


					Finally won the outstanding structure award will systematically introduce other bridge
					(other award-winning bridge in this chapter, or its he is introduced in the section),
					in order to facilitate the reader to fully understand and absorb their design philosophy.
					

					4.1 THE BRIDGE SCHEME AND GENERAL LAYOUT IDEAS 

					Many factors affecting the bridge scheme and general layout, such as a river, hydrology,
					meteorology, topography, geology, climate, environment, construction conditions and
					high aviation limited, port terminals, landscapes, and so on. In considering how
					under these restrictive conditions, structure think economy, construction convenient
					bridge scheme and layout, we need to have the boldness and innovation capacity. Here
					are a few conceived scheme and general layout of the bridge phase of successful experiences.
					

					4.1.1 Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong 

Design Idea: According to the topographical differences on both sides and side of
					Tsing Yi Road interchange arrangement requested by asymmetric cross, cross-and Ma
					Wan side of tower two-span suspension bridges that span suspension concept is also
					the longest clear span of road-railway suspension bridge. 

					Referring to the benefits of stiffening truss Liang Hang lane Central ventilation
					and closed box section of wind-resistant high effectiveness and low drag co-efficient
					of potential, proposes streamlined cladding of stainless steel with double girder
					design and enclosed double box girder of the central slots combines concepts. 

1. Selection of Bridge Schemes 

					Feasibility studies began in 1978, in detail a series of programmes linking North
					Shore city, and Ma Wan. In order to reach across the Strait, using bridges, sunk
					pipe tunnel and into the tunnel of the three programmes and carry out economic and
					technological to demonstrate and compare three scenarios-building costs were 1.45,
					1.44 and 1.75 billion HK$. 

					Three programmes for across the straits from the design and construction, maintenance
					and operation costs, limit traffic adaptability, flexibility, ring shipping of environmental
					impact and vulnerability assessment in every respect. From view point of numbers
					alone, drilling has been ruled out of the tunnel, which cost significantly more than
					the other two programmes, construction issues, as far as the bridge, under normal
					weather conditions, its construction speed faster than alternatives the Czech Republic,
					especially the sunk pipe tunnel, since the tunnel dug with the shop, but also to
					make some previous discussions and leak-plus works. But under severe weather conditions,
					its building efficiency and far exceeds that of other programmes, because it is outside
					the scope of architecture is separated from outside, so it is not affected by weather
					and environmental influences. Moreover, the suspension bridge finished, due to strong
					winds by reducing its transport efficiency. 

					In terms of flexibility, drawbridge can be said to be the fastest growing one, because
					it consists of the original four-line development to after eight lines, both proceed
					from the bridge itself, just at the right place in building more roads would have
					been enough, but the other two programmes, the need to increase the lane, you must
					be build a new tunnel and, therefore, in terms of cost and time, and should bridge
					the economy. Last used Suspension Bridge. 

2. Overall Layout 

					Tsing Ma Bridge's main span the width of navigation under the bridge, here to hang
					a width of 1200 m, east of the bridge tower was built on the shore, while the West
					Tower was built-in where the water is relatively shallow, and therefore decided to
					bridge the most economical main span of 1377 m, 2160 m (Fig. 4.1). 



Fig. 4.1 Facade layout (size: m). 

					Six-lane separated from the upper deck of the bridge layout is bi-directional roads,
					lower level is a double-track railway lines and two single-lane closures highway.
					

					Side of Tsing Yi Island, steep terrain, severe restrictions on the new highway interchange,
					3rd. As the shore the water is very deep, route plan calls for starting with the
					main line at Lane approach roads from the bridge tower. 

					Depth on the shore of Tsing Yi Island and tower was built on the shore, highway interchange
					lines prevented the side span suspension bridges programme, approach supported by
					four hollow reinforced concrete piers consisting of 72 m long-span, and equipped
					with overhead lines between Anchorage and later cable. Ma Wan side towers built near
					an undersea Continental Shelf offshore 350 m, towers built around an anti-ship collision
					strike protection of Islands, this is final 1377 m inter-and 355 m in Ma Wan side-span
					suspension bridge with two spans of the arrangement. 

					East pylon foundation of reinforced concrete spread foundation, each tower foundation
					for long 27 m wide, 19 m, 7 m, based on coagulation direct placement 7 m deep in
					the rock pit, the top surface flush with the bank, for offshore reasons, based with
					steel rods were painted epoxy resin layer to prevent corrosion. Near Ma Wan Island
					is based on the tower consists of two 28 m long, 20 m width and 16 m high fabricated
					steel made of reinforced concrete caissons. When first put in the water of the seabed
					surface blasting out of rough stone floors, finishing, the tug towed the caisson
					to the foundation office, add water, sinking, sinking it to the design height. Depth
					here is about 10 m, a caisson concrete, forming a giant bridge tower foundations.
					Four weeks plus a stone layer and caisson breakwater, forming an artificial island,
					to protect the tower structure is to damaged of vessels. Fig. 4.2 shows the photos
					of Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong.

3. Study of Bridge Structure 

					Since in the 1940, of the 20th century since the Tacoma Narrows Bridge was destroyed
					by the wind and aerodynamics research shows that surfaces of suspension bridge benefits
					of stiffening truss carriageway with central ventilation, this form of ventilation
					has been reflected in the forth road bridge in Scotland. However, other studies have
					also shown that closed box section of wind-resistant efficacy and resistance co-efficient
					is low. Immediately after the Forth Bridge Design England, Severn Bridge has a main
					span of similar, stiffening girder box-section is used. 

					Nasty windy climate, the Tsing Ma Bridge requires optimal aerodynamic efficiency,
					so the composite study on the forth bridge severn bridge and the main potential benefits
					of performance. The Tsing Ma Bridge, the last of the double box-section truss stiffening
					structure and non-structure edge deck units, streamlined appearance, providing upper
					and lower longitudinal ventilation, to increase stability. 

					Original design, only road and rail link to the airport, and container berths on
					Lantau will go through the Tsing Ma Bridge, the latter this passage has also been
					preserved, for the bad weather. This round-the-clock capability through the lower
					aerodynamic performance good stainless steel case cover rail and two road lanes to
					reach. 

					Section includes two final 6.3 m high longitudinal trusses, 30 m, which supports
					lane cross interaction of orthotropic deck plate provides flexural rigidity, hollow
					horizontal framework supported above the longitudinal diagonal bracing trusses, stiffening
					Liang Hang lane components together. Non-structure 1.5 mm stainless steel baffle
					plate edge of the shell surface, upper deck dual carriageway between 3.5 m wide vertical
					vents spaced railway mainly within the box, located in the central 12 m vertical
					vents on either side are two hidden highway lanes (Fig. 4.3). 



Fig. 4.3 Facade layout (size: m). 

					Aerodynamic testing bridge models to monitor the different arrangement of ventilation
					when the size, position, and orientation of the edge detail bridge surface performance.
					To change the upper and lower ventilation effects separately, while the upper vent
					width from 9.4 m reduction to 2 m, remain satisfied with the critical wind speed
					and amplitude of the Eddy current divergence decreases. When the width of the lower
					ventilation changes, discovered eddy flow divergence amplitudes decrease, needs on
					both sides of the tracks have a short closed length. In both cases, come to a totally
					closed ventilation can lead to a sharp decline in critical wind velocity of conclusions. 



Fig. 4.4 Section space renderings. 

					Cross-section aerodynamic testing to prove there is no divergent oscillation which
					measurement of swirl diverging oscillations. This is what happens when wind speed
					is low, the amplitude size and frequency is acceptable. Due to the lack of actual
					Typhoon air flow pattern near the center of information, so the bridge is at risk.
					Wind deck performance is in a horizontal tilt of ± 7.5º to 5° determination. But
					there should be emphasized under test only, in order to understand the section in
					wind acts include a larger point of view, and does not reflect a projected bridge
					site conditions. Fig. 4.4 shows section space renderings. 

					4.1.2 Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong 

Design idea: according to the terrain and waterway conditions, selected from among
					more than three-tower cable-stayed bridge scheme, which does not use more than more
					expensive rigid tower design, instead of using stable cable and plug in the cable
					tower of steel anchor box and beam, transverse cable, steel-concrete composite beams
					with combined structure, such as a series of distinctive design and construction.
					

					Ting Kau Bridge is the 3rd most important part of the route, the bridge tunnel in
					north main line of country park, across the Rambler Channel South Tsing Yi and Lantau
					Link and can be provide the North-West New Territories to the Chek Lap Kok new airport,
					Kowloon and Hong Kong Island's convenient channel. 

					Bridge navigation headroom requirement is 240 m wide, high 62 m channel. If there
					is a Tower located in the Strait, plus ship collision protection system to guarantee
					total tonnage of vessels of upto 220000 DWT without disturbing the fairway to the
					piers. 250 m continues minimum width of the anti-collision facilities a safe distance
					so that the minimum span between the towers of 300 m, and headroom is limited to
					the bridge towers higher than 220 m, since Hong Kong is often affected by Typhoon,
					bridge design for 3s gusts of 200-year flood event for 300 km/h. 

					Survey results show that at Ting Kau coast, fine grained porphyritic granite are
					in the land of 2~3 m, in Rambler Channel seabed stratigraphic layers for marine sediments,
					rock and alluvium of the original soil, 26 m thick layer of marine sediments of raw
					soil from under the very soft composed of weathered volcanic Tuff and granite of
					Tsing Yi Island, waterway center maximum depth of 25 m. 

1. Tower Cable Stayed Bridge with Three Spans (Main Span of 420 m) 

					In order to facilitate the project bid, the Government commissioned a consultant
					engineer to do a feasibility design, bridge-like facade decorated for 140 m + 420
					m + 140 m tower cable stayed bridge with three spans (Fig. 4.5), pylons as folding
					legs h-shaped, PC box girder bridge is a single room, beam 6 m, a tower pier is located
					shore of Tsing Yi Island, while another pylon located on an artificial island in
					the Strait. 



Fig. 4.5 Twin towers three-span cable-stayed bridge scheme (unit: m). 

2. Single-span Suspension Bridge 

					This design for the cross-river, the advantage is avoiding built piers in the channel,
					eliminating the expensive ship collision with protective facilities built, elevation
					layout for 140 m + 900 m + 140 m suspension bridge (Fig. 4.6), the bridge beams with
					vertical bars of pure-warren truss-free, total thickness 5 m, plus stainless steel
					streamlined oval veneered on both sides, so as to reduce wind resistance. Main beam
					is provided by two main truss elements, because of its resistance to torsion enormous
					stiffness, deck light, construction is easy. 220 m, a-pylon could increase the torsional
					stability of the tower itself, or cancellation in addition to the traditional design
					for main cables of suspension bridge caused by reversing the effect, two steel cables
					diameter of 77 cm, near bridge main span towers one-fourth midspan, two main cable
					connected form for single cable form, thus increasing torsional stiffness and reduced
					the main cables of the bridge tower of torque, would count as a new design. However,
					after the review believes that this is the most expensive option. 



Fig. 4.6 Single-span suspension bridge scheme (unit: m). 

3. Dual-Tower Cable Stayed Bridge with three Spans (Main Span of 900 m) 

					This is the programme instead of cable-stayed bridge of single span suspension bridge
					above, and 146 m + 900 m + 146 m of main tower of three-span double cable plane cable-stayed
					the bridge (Fig. 4.7), the two 146 m there are two auxiliary side of pier, bridge
					towers as a tilted h-shaped deck for the inverted trapezoid, add beam in steel box
					girder of main span is 5 m high, plus streamlined cladding on both sides, while the
					side span for 5 m PC four-cell box girder, increased to reduce the upward tension
					caused by its main span. Cable adopts France Normandy galvanised steel wire beams
					design concepts in parallel, in order to facilitate installation and maintenance.
					This disadvantage is the main span and side spans quite uneven, pull upward at the
					side spans have a great foundation special handling.

4. Three-tower Cable-stayed Bridge 

					Bridge-like facade decorated for 136 m + 450 m + 450 m + 136 m a four-span cable-stayed
					bridge with three towers (Fig. 4.8), on either side across a auxiliary piers. This
					programme compared with the 900 m cable-stayed bridge, except in the middle of adding
					a Rambler towers and cables volume is nearly cut in half. Bridge tower in the middle
					of the sea-bed, happens to have a prominent landforms, natural location used to emplace
					bridges pier. PC girder of 5 m high six-cell box girder, with a balance of on-site
					pouring concrete in construction law, construction of main girder at speeds up to
					daily 1 m. All in all, programmes in terms of aesthetic, economic, construction,
					construction and construction costs than other programmes a plus. This programme
					and final programme is very similar. 



Fig. 4.8 Twin towers three-span cable-stayed bridge scheme (unit: m). 

					In January 1994, the department chose seven qualified companies to carry out the
					"design and construction" methods of bidding, according to owners of existing designs,
					bidders to present their design and cost. Through the commercial and technical assessment,
					the lowest bidders won. Finally, successful programs at 17. HK $ 3.8 billion. 



Fig. 4.9 Elevation of Ting Kau Bridge layout (size: m). 

					Ting Kau Bridge is a four-span continuous steel-concrete composite girder cable-stayed
					bridge with three towers, its span into 127 m + 448 m + 475 m + 127 m, with a total
					length 1177 m, see Fig. 4.9. 

					This design feature is the tower of the bridge structure, long circular section concrete
					column is used, while in the horizontal steel structure and cable to be widened,
					forming width necessary for supporting girders. 

					Main girder of the bridge into a trough steel plate welded open sections of the steel
					beams. Steel channel beam height 1500 mm, flange on the top surface lay 250 mm thick
					pre-fabricated reinforced concrete bridge deck. Steel channel beam and deck are separated
					by 19 mm of high strength bolt (STUD) combined. Girder steel Liang Quangao 1750 mm.
					



Fig. 4.10 Ting Kau Bridge. 

					As a four-span cable-stayed bridge with three towers, the central tower, designers
					turned away abandoned a costly programme of rigid towers, and using an additional
					Tower is stable approach to stiffness of the central tower of the cable required.
					Stable cable on each side a total of 4, is located in between two sets of main beam
					5.8 m free range, stable cable bolted to the top of the tower at the top of steel
					anchor box, anchored at the bottom to set two group on the anchor beams between girders.
					Fig. 4.10 shows the photos of Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong. 

					Tower from Tower Pier of the bridge to the top since the Central Suo Tagao 157.35
					m, the towers of each side is 129.35 m (Ting Kau coast) and 120.35 m (Tsing Yi coast).
					Towers are long circular reinforced concrete column section, central main pylon for
					10 m (portrait) × 5 m (horizontal), towers on either side are the 8 m (portrait)
					× 5 m (landscape). In the soffit, towers and tower columns of horizontal steel beams,
					bracing, transverse cable composed of steel structural scaffold tower widens to a
					total width of 50 m. Two groups respectively in Suo Tachu is supported on the steel
					supporting frame for main girder of steel beam (Fig. 4.11).

					Tower anchorage of cable-stayed, the bridge used in concrete pagoda design of lateral
					anchorage of column of steel anchor box, this can be obligate omitted in the tower
					body, casting anchor link, on the installation of steel anchor box for cable, stretching
					and provides jobs platform, especially for four-cable-plane cable-stayed bridge of
					this bridge, this design shows more advantages (Fig. 4.12), as shown in Fig. 4.13
					construction photos.

					4.1.3 The Tsurumi Channel Bridge 

Design idea: according to the main and auxiliary channel and channel dimension as
					well as the request of the two bridges is arranged in parallel without auxiliary
					piers the maximum span single cable plane cable-stayed bridge concept and increasing
					tower height to improve rigidity and horizontal cable between the taliang and resistance
					to improve the force. 

Condition of building the bridge: Bridge, effective road width of 29 m, containing
					wind up 38 m; main channel of 450 m × 49 m, auxiliary lanes on both sides 200 m ×
					25 m air; deep 12 m, two parallel bridges in urban planning, which 49.75 m; flutter
					testing wind of 74.4 m/s; seismic intensity = 7.8~8.2 level. 

					According to the channel required, cross-cross 510 m, side 254 m. 

					Due to the 1 : 2 of side, cross-ratio, span and cannot be located within the secondary
					pier, side live load deflection in particular, in order to reduce the load reduce
					cable stress and deflection, and require an increase in tower height, dominated the
					economic height of the tower across a span of 0.2~0.25, the bridge takes 0.25, so
					the height from the base of the tower is 180 m at the top (Fig. 4.14). 



Fig. 4.14 Elevation of Ting Kau Bridge layout (size: m). 

					Two bridges is arranged in parallel so that cables may appear chaotic complex, and
					finally decided to adopt the single-cable-stayed bridge. 

					Flat steel box girders, box office, beam height 4 m (Fig. 4.15). 

					Because of single cable plane cable-stayed bridge of torsional stiffness for double
					rope bridge with only one-fifth, which is parallel to the bridge, likely at low wind
					speed chatter and the center barrier needs to be increased to raise the bridge when
					wind resistance. Tower Vase-shaped, lower pylon column size to take in, in appearance
					to increase tower base using pneumatic caisson construction, more than the cofferdam
					relief and not enough spacing between the two bridges tower is less than 3 m (Fig.
					4.15). 

					Tower height, wind loads, the rigidity of main beam and longitudinal beam with horizontal
					elastic rope and spiral damper main beam elastic joint between the tower and reduced
					beam longitudinal and horizontal cable in seismic stability (Fig. 4.16 & 4.17).
					

					Home about 250 m3 concrete ballast beam placement.

					4.2 TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN THE BRIDGE PROGRAM 

					Concept scheme requires in-depth study and understanding of the natural conditions
					and function, through repeated thinking, constantly changes, and more comparison
					and selection, to form the technical improvements and technical innovations of design
					works. 

					Innovation in technical innovation requires designers to establish a correct concept,
					rejection of plagiarism, not content to imitate, not blind pursuit of "firsts" and
					"best". 

					Reflections on innovation from the. As elaborated in chapter 1th, the innovative
					three ask (Why? Why not? What if?) Is shabby, establishing new forms of reasonable
					and prudent technology trilogy. 

					Following the introduction of composite structure bridge also experienced such innovation
					development process, since entering the 21st century, by in concrete bridge and the
					problems of orthotropic steel bridge decks and disease continue to be found to make
					composite structures has been in Europe and America States and Japan bridge area
					recognition and application, the technology has been further research and development.
					

					Explain some of the best technical innovations in the bridge program and its results.
					

					4.2.1 Denmark Oresund Bridge—Steel Truss Composite Girder 

Design Ideas: as one of the largest composite structure with long span bridge, a
					good representation of the composite structure bridges the past half century development.
					The bridge with double-deck structure, upper level concrete slab width 25 m, directly
					supported by the two main truss top chord. Because common cizongliang in the steel
					bridge and beams are omitted here. 

					The Oresund bridge, concrete's role is not only to vehicle load transfer to the main
					truss, also increase the transverse stability, and form part of a closed frame. The
					closed frame is from the lower box-shaped diagonal steel beams, truss and steel truss,
					on holding between chords composed of concrete. 

					Oresund bridge with a total length of 8 km, is likely to be the largest composite
					structure bridge, but it may be surpassed by the Feynman Strait Bridge. The bridge
					between the Taiwan Strait continues to approach spans with a total length of about
					16km. 

					(Referenced above Denmark Professor Ji Muxin as SEI Volume 20, Number 2, 2010 composite
					construction album write introduction.) 

					Full 16 km Oresund Cross-Sea project, made up of three parts, of which 7.8 km bridge,
					4 km road on the island, 3.8 km cross harbour tunnel and the coast extends to 0.4
					km, connecting Denmark Copenhagen and Sweden's third-largest city of Malmo, in Started
					in 1995, was completed in July 2000. 

					Layout 140 m + 160 m + 490 m + 160 m + 140 m = 1090 m main channel bridge of long-span,
					steel truss composite girder rail for two use double-deck, upper level is a 4-lane
					highway, the lower level is double-line railway bridge navigation clearance of 57
					m. Main tower is an h-shaped bridge tower stayed-cable of the harp-shaped parallel
					cable (Fig. 4.18).

					Of stiffening girder steel truss composite girder, upper transverse post-tensioning
					prestressed concrete bridge deck, the lower level is concrete channel beam (Fig.
					4.19) combined with the steel structure as a whole, thereby reducing rail noise,
					improve overall strength, across the trusses transverse forms a seal closed steel
					box. Truss rod's angle of about 30° and 60°, inclination can match the cable inclination
					angle, pull cable anchor solid lies on the same outrigger truss diagonal angle. For

					4.2.2 United States East Bridge of the San Francisco Bay Bridge Earthquake-resistant
					Tower 

Design Ideas: In the landscape need only cylindrical tower of limiting conditions,
					move closer to the gate-tower two towers, beam cut short, the door translate the
					beam flexural yielding shear yielding seismic energy consumption, forming a vertical
					pylon under strong earthquake remain elastic seismic single tower concept. 

					In the mid 1930s, the construction of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, 12.8
					km, is the longest in the world at the time, high technical level of the bridge,
					still to the main line of the East Bay of the San Francisco peninsula, heavy traffic,
					daily traffic nearly 280,000 vehicles. Design earthquake force is small, the east
					bridge (steel truss bridge) in 1989, at 7 on the Richter scale. 1 partial collapse
					during an earthquake, so that construction of the new East Bay Bridge to replace
					the existing bridge, 3.6 km. New deck 25 m wide in each direction, including 5 lanes
					and a light railway. Side of the bridge there are wide and 4.8 M sidewalk, taking
					into account the 1500 year return period earthquake. Final implementation plan "Self-anchored
					suspension bridge" system with a main span of 385 m, side 180 m. 

					General prevailing notion that, at such a high intensity earthquake area, bridge-tower
					should be. In this way, the beams of the tower under earthquake to earthquake energy
					consumed can form a plastic hinge, making vertical pylon remains elastic. Thus, single
					tower was considered unsuitable for the main unit of the bridge, as it is not a statically
					indeterminate structure. 

					During the preliminary design, the gantry tower and a single tower with different
					types of studies were carried out (Fig. 4.24). According to the calculation a single
					tower can be meet current seismic design requirements, but the towers is not a statically
					indeterminate structure, once the plastic deformation will be lead to destruction,
					so that this type is not appropriate. However, despite these concerns, still the
					appearance of single tower exclusive. 



Fig. 4.24 Gate bridge tower scheme selection. 

					Designers draw bridge towers and research how to make it look more like a single
					tower. Move closer to the two towers, beam will be cut short; after beam cut short,
					just not in bending yield but caved in under the cut. Designers and ask, why not
					just make it just under the shear yield? If it doesn't look like the usual tower
					bends bend, but the shear yield how? If multiple towers closer together, the tower
					look like a single tower structure (Fig. 4.25). 



Fig. 4.25 Twin tower column in shear connection bridge. 


					Thus, an innovative single-tower scheme surfaced water surface. Results indicate

					4.2.3 Chongqing New Shibanpo Bridge of Steel-concrete Composite Beams 

Design: Design this a world record span box girder bridge, by introducing 108 m steel
					box girder in the middle of the main span steel box beam segment implements technical
					and economic possibilities. Steel box girder is 1000 m and raw materials produced
					by the Department of Wuhan in Chongqing. It has been designed to barge in the form
					through the three Gorges dam was towed to Chongqing from Wuhan, placed in the main
					cross raised into position below. 

					Old shibanpo bridge was built-in 1981, the new bridge parallel to the old bridge
					is located in the upper reaches of the old bridge. Two bridge-centerline distance
					between 25 m, old bridge the bridge width is 21 m, Shinbashi bridge width is 19 m.
					Spacing between the two bridge deck is 5 m. After extensive research, shipping sector
					must be removed between two main piers, the main span of 330 m, as shown in Fig.
					4.28. 

1. Design Philosophy 

					Taking into account the advantages of concrete and steel is light weight, ultimately
					chose the hybrid structure—the main span of the bridge in the middle used steel box
					girder and the rest using conventional concrete. 800 mm thick concrete slab under
					pressure, C60 is approximately equal to 100 mm thickness and yield stress of steel
					plates for 345 MPa compression capability, the latter is the most commonly used steel
					in China. However, thick concrete slabs construction easier than plates. Therefore,
					close to the pier girder using concrete makes more sense. The middle part of the
					main span steel, steel can be thinner, reducing weight and thus reduce the mid-span
					bending moments, more valuable. Light mix concrete weigh about 60% of conventional
					concrete. Used across the middle weight about conventional concrete box girder of
					steel box girder of 30%. 

					If using span definition, equivalent to all the ordinary concrete beam, and at the
					end have the same moment of consolidation the needed span. Reduced weight for intermediate
					beam, calculations show that when they span the middle one-third with steel box beam,
					330 m hybrid girder span is equivalent of 269 m. 



Fig. 4.28 Span layout of the the old and the new Shibanpo bridge (size: m) 

					Select steel box beam segment length the second consideration is the recommended
					construction method design, entire segments of steel box girders on factory production,
					to barge onto the scene, integral hoisting, such operations are limited. In addition,
					the factory is located in the three Gorges dam downstream, dam ship lock length limits
					the size of steel box girder. After careful study, decided to adopt the middle length
					of the steel box girder 103 m. Total length of steel box beam segment also includes
					2 at each end. 5 m transition section, total length is 108 m, weighing about 1400t.
					

					Ultimate new shibanpo bridge as shown in Fig. 4.29. In addition to the main span
					steel box beam segment in the Middle, and the remaining parts are made of conventional
					concrete. 



Fig. 4.29 Composition of the hybrid girder. 

					Bridge District the highest water levels can be higher than the minimum water level
					of Yangtze River 38 m, so high water flow may be imposed on the pier is great lateral
					forces. Although Foundation located in solid rock, in order to increase the ability
					to resist lateral loads, set ø2.5 m and ø2.0 m short pile of pile diameter Dig-hole
					pile is necessary. 

					Standard cross-section of the bridge to direct Web box girder sections. Bottom width
					9 m, total width of the roof is 19 m, each flanking margin-width 5 m (Fig. 4.30).
					

					Inside the box girder of main span of 330 m, installed a 4 section 27 units of externally
					pre-stressed steel stranded wire. If necessary, by adjusting these steels twisted
					deformation of steel box girders of the stress correction. 

2. Steel Box Beam Transport and Hoisting 

					Steel box girder is 1000 m and raw materials produced by the Department of Wuhan
					in Chongqing. It was designed as a form of barge, two temporarily closed. Through
					the three Gorges dam was towed to Chongqing from Wuhan (Fig. 4.31). And then turn
					90°, below crane placed in the main cross-promotion in place. 

					First to be hoisting the transition part, hoisting one at a time. Lifting these 2.5
					m not very long beam interferes with voyage. Lifting 103 m of box girder sections
					must be completed at 12 h in order to minimise interference with shipping on the
					Yangtze River (Fig. 4.32). Actually lifting only had less than 5 h, but after segmental
					box girder erection in place and fixed with more time.

					4.2.4 Hangzhou Jiubao Bridge, Composite Arch Bridge 

Design: Hangzhou jiubao bridge is 1855 m, is an all composite construction of large
					bridges crossing the river. Non-channel and main channel bridge approach respectively,
					using a combination of large-span continuous arch bridges and composite continuous
					box-girder bridge, arch bridge with box beam using multi-point synchronising incremental
					launching construction. When incremental launching construction of bridge approach,
					85 m-span without a temporary Pier; incremental launching construction of the main
					bridge, 210 m span and only 1 temporary pier. 

1. Bridge Type Design 

					Main channel bridge 3 × 210 m of continuous composite arch bridge main span, covering
					the entire scope of grooved swing and be able to less than 1000 DWT river-trade vessel
					navigable depth requirements. Using V-shape piers of main bridge piers, piers contour
					line along the main arched the line, in order to achieve better visual effects, V-shaped
					piers and girders are actually separated, set bearing (Fig. 4.33). The upper structure
					using beam-arch composite system, consists of a steel-concrete composite structure
					bridge deck and steel arch structure for supporting long-span 188 m + 22 m + 188
					m + 22 m + 188 m of continuous structures. Main Pier Foundation of bored piles in
					a 16 diameter of 2 m. Map of main bridge of Fig. 4.34 bridge steel girder segment
					diagram. 



Fig. 4.33 The rendering of main bridge. 



Fig. 4.34 Schematic drawing of main bridge deck girder segment. 

					In order to reduce the impact on river hydrology, requiring non-waterway bridge rate
					increased span and reduce the Foundation block water as much as possible. Although
					using long-span PC continuous box girder of 85 m, DUN sub-division scheme, can meet
					the requirements, but within this span composite box girder is not only economic
					competitiveness, and the whole structure form of continuous composite box girder,
					combining substructure, base size the decrease, you can be minimise the effects of
					the bridge on the river. In addition, the composite box girder by incremental launching
					construction of steel girders, without need to set temporary piers in the River,
					compared with conventional cantilever casting of PC box girder structure, symmetry
					of traditional structures and construction method, create the conditions for improving
					project quality and reduced impact on the environment. 

2. Push Technology and Equipment 

					Main channel bridge construction in accordance with the general programmes, and the
					erection in the water a lot of brackets, deck and the arch structure installation.
					So violently on the tidal bore of Qiantang River and Riverbed region, is not only
					costly but large workloads, high safety and quality risks. Based on careful analysis
					of environmental and structural characteristics of the construction and judgement,
					design innovation by incremental launching construction method. This design idea
					construction is now in construction on the water to the shore, not only from the
					river in a large number of temporary piers and supports, reduce construction and
					shipping on the environment interference, also avoids the high risks and difficulties
					in assembling the arch rib on the water, in addition, all steel construction on shore,
					in order to improve project quality creating optimum conditions. 

					Non-channel and main channel bridge incremental launching construction of bridge,
					as opposed to domestic common or dragging the slip on the beam at the point of method
					of conventional beam methods often need to be strengthened to meet the pusher and
					stability requirements of local, this will be result in costs far higher than for
					steel beam strengthened by increased costs for new launching technology and equipment.
					For this reason, design and raise sound tow equipment and technology, as well as
					synchronise and balance control technology, mechanical safety assurance structure
					reliable, make incremental launching construction which can be implemented without
					the steel beams were strengthened. It aims to promote the progress of construction
					technology of thrusting, and groups composite structure bridges the total cost of
					the most economical; current progress indicates that not only meets the expectations,
					as well as incremental launching construction technology technology and equipment
					is a key technology of composite box-girder bridge with access to sound economic
					one. 

					Main channel bridge construction in general can be divided into two parts of steel
					structures and bridge decks. Includes deck girder and steel arch of steel structures,
					beam using multi-point synchronising incremental launching construction. When pushing
					scattered in various piers (including the temporary pier) device the lifting, advance,
					apart from the bridge and bridge piers, but each across 3 main span 1 temporary piers,
					set 3 temporary pier at the collector. When pushing in the between deck girder and
					Arch ribs with provisional pole in order to push joint force. Completed per assembly
					 
					1 hole top 1 hole until all 3 holes pushing into place, as shown in Fig. 4.35 and
					4.36. Decking pre-fabricated, cross-wise into 3 pieces, a small beam for segmentation
					and vertical 4.25 m distance between steel beam section. Steel push is complete,
					according to the design the prescribed order, stretching booms and removing temporary
					arch bars, the laying of pre-fabricated bridge deck poured joint concrete, completed
					construction. 



Fig. 4.35 First hole of main thrusting. 



Fig. 4.36 Third hole of main thrusting. 

					Incremental launching construction of arch bridge and 210 m span and only 1 temporary
					pier, is a new attempt. Composite arch bridge removal after the deck, load capacity
					compared to its weight of steel structure with a larger available space. By steel
					arch rib of steel vertical between temporary bars, can effectively play an overall
					carrying capacity of steel structures, both technical and economic features the advantage
					and competitiveness. 

					4.2.5 Uses of High Performance Steel and Concrete Composite Beam Bridge 

Design Ideas: High-strength steels and ultra high performance fibre reinforced concrete
					slab design of new beams. using S460, S690 grade of steel can reduce the weight of
					the superstructure, steel weight decreased to 40%, reducing the total weight of the
					superstructure about 25%. 

					Bridges composed of three 95 m + 130 m + 95 m, a bridge deck total width 21.5 m,
					the four-lane design. Main span span is France to construct the maximum span composite
					beams. 

1. Structure with a Partial S690 

Table 4.1 shows the distribution of steel bridge structures. Support near and Central
					main span uses steel grade S690, because decks will be fully used to provide cross
					sectional resistance. Panels in both vertical and horizontal prestressed, appear
					to resist the serviceability limit state consumer pressure condition.

2. The Ultra-high Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) 

					Board material is used in ultra high performance fibre reinforced concrete. This
					content of high strength steel fiber concrete 200 kg/m3, 20 mm long, 0.3 mm thick
					no need to configure bar, under pressure of 150 MPa. This concrete slab inspired
					by France national project of MIKTI ribbed plate 1 (Fig. 4.37). In this project,
					12 m wide, for ease of transport transmission and divide it into 2.5 m wide units.
					Vertical and horizontal ribs Center spacing is 0.6 m. Deck plate total thickness
					0.38 m, by 0.33 m rib height and 0.05 m plate high mix. Ribbed bottom width of 0.07
					m, ribbed top plate width of 0.10 m. 



Fig. 4.37 France MIKTI Engineering (LCPC in laboratory tests). 

					In this project, due to the four-lane design, board width is very large. Deck width
					is 21.5 m, located on each side of the bridge 2. The 0% cross slope. Main beam distance
					14.3 m, deck cantilever on each side long 3.6 m. Pre-fabricated section 21.5 m, width
					2.5 m. MIKTI bridge panels meet these constraints by increasing the height of the
					ribs. MIKTI total 0 from the symmetry axis. 615 m line changes to free edges 0.4
					m contains 0.05 m high tickness. Other dimensions: ribs at the bottom width of 0.07
					m tension stranded wire is necessary, ribbed top width of 0.10 m, thickness 0.05
					m, these have been local frictional MIKTI project laboratory test for success. Bridge
					deck cross section as shown in Fig. 4.38, and Fig. 4.39 shows the main beam dimension
					detail. 



Fig. 4.38 Bridge deck cross-section (size: m). 



Fig. 4.39 High-performance fiber-reinforced concrete for main girder of transverse
						profiles (size: m). 

					In order to resist lateral bending moment throughout each deck width set 5 rib T15S
					internal pre-stressed steel twisted pair (Fig. 4.38 and 4.39), which has two steel
					stranded wire is not pulled to the outside cantilever sections (Fig. 4.38). In the
					longitudinal direction, set 30 12T15S steel beams and supports 1.2 m high tension,
					provided in the board 14.3 MPa forever compressive stress. In under serviceability
					limit state at any time, can resist pressure suppression effect. 

3. The Construction Phase 

					Similar to the bridge construction and pre-fabricated units, and appropriate modifications
					based on longitudinal pre-stressing requirements. Construction stages: installation
					of steel girders, 2.5 m, 21.5 m wide deck plate element installed, vertical tensioning
					of prestressed, concrete slabs and steel-bonded frame connection (through the hinged
					joints of concrete slab has been poured coupling), internal support tension, eventually
					installed non-structural facilities. It is worth note that surface layer thickness
					of 60 mm and normal strength concrete slab to prevent cracking at the supports have
					to be located 110 mm. 

4. Weight and Cost Comparison 

					Actual price list according to steel structures, structural steel for weight savings
					of 40%, equivalent to 25% cost reduced. In contrast, for in the bridge deck, and
					more expensive than traditional high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete slabs.
					Taking into account the cost of the entire structure, such as fruit prices for high
					performance deck template be borne jointly by several bridges, high performance bridge
					will be a very competitive bridge. 

					Use of high performance materials such as high strength S460 steels and S690, as
					well as high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete in this area out of steel and
					for optimal performance of the concrete structure. European norm is likely to lead
					to more use of combined beam bridge design. In this emphasis state awareness times,
					vigorously promote material savings, particularly for steel piers, concrete savings
					of foundation. This concrete slab context, contains more high-performance fiber-reinforced
					concrete cement, with regard to the environment is more harmonious. High Performance
					Concrete slab (HPC), is available as an option in the future will require further
					study. 

					4.3 BRIDGE PROGRAM CONSIDERATION OF LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENT 

					Landscape in a way that is also a functional requirement in modern cities, a bridge
					in addition to the opening of the meeting, pedestrians and shipping requirements,
					but should be also meet the requirements of viewing, giving the viewer a pleasant
					effect, giving the viewer with beautiful enjoyment. Landscape of bridges, both historical,
					cultural and geographical influences the viewer's subjective requirements also have
					an aesthetic method then, consistent with the environmental condition of objective
					requirements. Programme is to meet the requirements of landscape bridges both organically
					together in order to structure and shape in response to these requests. 

					4.3.1 Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong 

Design thinking: Through the competition and technology, beautiful selection of judges
					the judges, elected by chic, the iconic round chimney type pylons, steel box beams
					and concrete mixing split-beam cable-stayed bridge scheme. 

					Stonecutters Bridge Hong Kong Nineth main part of the route between Tsing Yi and
					Cheung Sha Wan, bridge across the 900 m wide with heavy traffic rambler in the Kwai
					Chung container terminal, main span will be more than 1000 m. Bridge is the most
					prominent part of the whole project, and will be become a major landmark of a metropolis
					like Hong Kong. To this end, the Hong Kong S.A.R. the Highways Department for the
					first time hosted a international design competitions, for the Stonecutters Bridge,
					the landmark bridge provides concept design. 

					This two-stage bridge design contest in November 1999, formally opens, the Highways
					Department through the application of bridge design teams and units prepare participants
					to maximise design record and the team's experience of bridge engineers and architects,
					the examining choose the 16 design teams, inviting them to participate in the first
					phase of the competition. 16 teams by a total of 64 separate companies and the designers,
					and the team's governing body came from mainland China, Finland, and France, and
					Germany, China, Hong Kong S.A.R., Japan the, Norway and the United Kingdom and the
					United States. 

					In the first stage of the game, there are 21 design team submitted two proposals,
					there are 5 teams to submit a programme for a total of 27 design schemes. Of which:
					22 for cable-stayed bridges, 2 suspension bridge and 3 collaboration system for cable-stayed
					and suspension bridge. 

					Participation in the first stage of the programme, in terms of both concept and focus
					there is a big difference. Cable-stayed bridges programme, traditional inverted y-shape,
					such as A-and H-shaped towers, there is also a new chimney, Y-, X-, or horn-shaped
					and so on. Cable aspects also vary, from single to four. Steel box beams have adopted
					a more traditional single-box design, also has adopted a more innovative dual box
					design and central slot of box girders, avoided the traditional h-bridge tower of
					suspension bridge design-to take a special a-shaped or Y-shaped bridge towers, cable
					arrangement is also very special, cable-stayed and suspension system programme mixed
					the two newer concepts of design, and the self-form of anchor, but so is more complicated
					(see Fig. 4.40). 



Fig. 4.40 Collection of various forms of bridge tower. 

					Two review committees in accordance with a pre-determined rating criteria were assessed.
					First by the technical evaluation committee scores, the programme must reaches a
					certain level and then to the beautiful Review Committee score. After two review
					committees to phase one design scoring the Highways Department has selected five
					outstanding programmes, and programme arrangements participants optimise and submit
					more detailed information on the second-order games paragraphs. 

					Five into the second phase of design for cable-stayed bridge scheme with a main span
					from 1000 m to 1019 m, full-bridge with a total length 1600 m, the five designs are
					distinctive (Fig. 4.41). 



Fig. 4.41 Five renderings (a) Programme a; (b) Second plan; (c) Scenario three; (d)
						Programme IV; (e) Programme five. 

					Option one is a a-pylon cable-stayed bridge, a main span of 1017 m, 292 m and 321
					m, respectively, with a total length 1630 m. Cable layout as a semi-scalloped, stiffening
					girder side span and near the main span of the bridge tower 52 m part is a concrete
					box girders, parts for double-box steel box girders. Top of the tower is a steel
					core surrounded by stainless steel cladding. Overall, the programme in the on the
					design and construction is a traditional programme. 

					Scenario two is an inverted Y-shaped towers of cable-stayed bridge. Its main span
					is 1000 m, TRANS-300 m, full-bridge a total length of 1600 m. Cable distribution
					and connect as a semi-scalloped girders on either side, each pair of cables in the
					middle by a deflector cable banded into a anchored to a tower. Girders and pylons
					in recent 100 m part of the tower as a single entity. Stiffening girder side span
					in concrete box girder in main span 800 m is a steel box girders of the central authorities.
					In addition to the arrangement of the cables out, which is a traditional design.
					

					Scenario three is a funnel-shaped pylon of cable-stayed bridge, upper part of the
					bridge tower 112. 5 m is a steel structure under the portion is this concrete slab
					Bridge's main span is 1018 m, TRANS-298 m, respectively. Full-bridge has a total
					length of 1, 616 m, cable with half a pie cable layout as a semi-scalloped, stiffening
					girder side span and near the main span of the bridge tower 24 m part is a concrete
					box girders, with box-beam, double-box steel beam by beam together. Overall, the
					programme both in design and construction for a new beam scheme scenario four is
					a h-pylon cable-stayed bridge, tower when stiffening girder above cross-bar with
					no. The main span of the bridge is 1001 m, full-bridge has a total length of 3001
					m, cable with half a pie cable distribution as a semi-scalloped in two vertical planes.
					Full-bridge are made of steel box girders, joined in a steel box girders of side
					span in concrete to increase the dead load weight to balance the main span. Due to
					the tower from the bridge extra high without beams, both in design and construction
					of the programme seems to be rather special. 

					Option one is a a-pylon cable-stayed bridge, a main span of 1019 m, 280 m and 321
					m, respectively, with a total length 307 m, the bridge has a total length of 1616
					m for cable distribution in a fan-shaped manner, on the anchorage of steel anchor
					box in the tower the upper set, add beam supported by pylons in the vertical and
					lateral directions. Stiffening girder side span and near Tower Bridge main span portion
					of the 89 m and 95 m are concrete box girder and the rest for steel box girder of
					main span, as a whole, this programme in terms of design and construction is a traditional
					beam. 

					Scheme judges voted the Championship programme as the number three, Championship
					consists of the Halcrow Group Ltd (United Kingdom), Flint and neill Partnership (United
					Kingdom), Dissing + Weitling (Denmark) and the Shanghai municipal engineering design
					and Research Institute (China), consisting of design team submissions. Second place
					for plan v, third place for scenario four, while option one and option two is named
					honorable mention. 

					4.3.2 Shanghai Lupu Bridge 

Design ideas: As last crossed the Huangpu river of Shanghai Lupu bridge, Nanpu bridge
					and Yangpu bridge built two oblique after laqiao, the all-welded steel structure
					deck box arch bridge in programmes in cable-stayed bridges, suspension bridges, and
					many scheme selection of the successful bidder, such as this becomes especially landmark
					buildings of the Expo in Shanghai. 

					On the Huangpu river of Shanghai Lupu bridge. Span 550 m, across the river. Lupu
					bridge is not only a means of transport, it should be not only embody the cultural
					landscape, and reflect modern achievements of science and technology. Possible schemes
					for cable-stayed bridge, suspension bridge, arch. In 1999, Shanghai Lupu bridge was
					open for bidding, Arch programmes successful. 

					For the arch bridge, and at domestic level: 420 m span of the Wanxian Changjiang
					River Bridge was built-in 1997, concrete arch bridge (Fig. 4.42). Thrust was too
					large but concrete arch bridge, it should not be built on soft soil foundation in
					Shanghai.

					4.3.3 Chongqing Caiyuanba Bridge 

Design ideas: Want to build a beautiful arch bridge, according to the double-layer
					traffic, navigation, appearance and other general requirements, combined with the
					shape landforms was studied for deck, middle deck and lower deck arch bridge, and
					concludes with a Y-shaped rigid-frame structure and tied-arch composite box-shaped
					arch bridge, the arch of a new system. 

					When beginning the design of caiyuanba bridge, we have a wish: I hope that this new
					bridge is an arch bridge, a special drift light arch bridge. 

					Caiyuanba bridge is located in yuzhong peninsula south of caiyuanba connected yuzhong
					and South Bank. Bridge is a two-tier structure, upper deck has 6 traffic lanes and
					two-sided sidewalk, the lower level consists of a two-line light rail lanes. In order
					to satisfy clearance requirements of light rail track, height of the beam 11 m. Due
					to the requirements for navigation on the Yangtze river, the span of the bridge was
					identified as 420 m. 

					First of all, designers think girder truss structure should be to make light rail
					passengers can enjoy the scenery of Yangtze river. While if the box girder of 11
					m, that appears to be very bulky, and the use of truss structures do not need to
					think about the ventilation of the lower deck design. 

					Arch bridges can be divided into thrust and thrust two. True arch was thrust, caiyuanba
					bridge location, geology condition good, can withstand greater thrust. But if directly
					by the foundation under horizontal thrust arch had to be very low, unable to meet
					the requirements of navigation. 

					Thrust free arch bridge is a tied arch. It could be a deck, middle deck and lower
					deck. Navigation requirements are met before side note, deck-type arch of the bridge
					will be squished, force structure requirements are not met. Through-arch bridge,
					since all deck arch it looks so heavy, unable to meet aesthetic requirements. So
					choose a deck arch bridge. In this place, the main span southern tip of home bias,
					high and low water levels vary greatly. In order to avoid rib struck by ships, designers
					had to arch slightly improved on, using pre-stressed concrete sub-structure, to achieve
					high impact resistant capacity. 

					Arch is the main backbone of arch, arch main is the bar, must take into account the
					vertical and lateral stability. 

					In terms of vertical, due to lower deformation of light rail has more stringent requirements
					on bridge structure must be very strong, as limits distortion. Fortunately, light
					rail length is shorter, only partially affected. Girder is a 11 m high trusses, stiffness,
					this arch stiffness requirements can be reduced. In bridge design, because the hangers
					at different elongation under load is limited, and inspection when you calculate
					the stability of arch bridge with vertical, can broadly be superimposing the rigidity
					of beam and arch stiffness. So, if the beam stiffness large arch stiffness can be
					small. 

					Because the arch is mainly influenced by pressure bars, box-section truss work. In
					terms of appearance, if the main beams and arches are truss bridge shape look too
					heavy, not enough light, Chongqing Yangtze river scenery and pretty disturbed. Chongqing
					is a city beautiful mountain city, her beauty lies in her pretty face. So, between
					the steel box arch and steel pipe truss arch, chose the more slender, 2 m wide and
					4 m high steel box arch (Figs. 4.51 and 4.52). 

					Lateral stability of arch must rely on horizontal poles to ensure its stability.
					However, for aesthetic reasons, struts must be slender, passers-by looked without
					any sense of clutter and closed, according to the local stability of arch rib request,
					decided to use 6 transverse bracing and for overall coordination, these transverse
					braces are box section. 

					Eventually introduced the steel-concrete composite rigid frame structure and tied-arch
					bridge, a new bridge structure of main bridge of Chongqing caiyuanba Yangtze river
					Bridge structural system. Bridge across 420 m and 112 m and 88 m in a symmetrical
					distribution of side span and side spans. The main bridge with a total length 800
					m (Fig. 4.53). 

					In the main bearing structure design of prestressed concrete "Y" shaped steel box
					tied arch bridge of rigid frame with basket combinations to improve the main structure
					spanning ability. On this basis, additional vertical side pier bowstring-cable, main
					body of the bridge (rigid frames and the main arch) forces and lines adjustment and
					control of configuration space (Fig. 4.54).

					Orthotropic deck truss beam integral node of the design has evolved and matured,
					the basis of high-strength bolts and thick plate welding technique above, in the
					first manufactured using festive design, large, hanging festive carriage, large sections
					of the design idea, aimed at quality and construction units to provide more space
					for duration of protection (Fig. 4.55). 



Fig. 4.55 Segmentation and segment plates hanging on the deck gestured. 

					Orthotropic bridge decks in combination with steel truss beam efficiency of increasing
					combination truss suare, hang the level of increased fertiliser speed, better ensuring
					the construction quality. But also design, manufacture, construction, poses new challenges
					and problems. At the level of designing new issues need to be addressed include:
					orthotropic bridge deck joint role with the truss top chord; truss top chord decking
					and decking construction details of the connection of the primary and secondary beams;
					derrick-composite-bottom chord truss beam-tilt hanging rod-lower design and construction
					of track beam design. 

					Making programmatic and technological design problems more, which mainly include:
					modular truss beams cross-decking of the opposite sex basic unit of block-making;
					composite truss beams decking manufacturing base unit connection types of the opposite
					sex; composite truss beams deck deformation control technique of the opposite sex;
					composite truss beam monolithic gusset for a variety of manufacturing processes combined
					large segments of truss beam overall assembly solutions and precision control technology.
					

					4.4 RECORDS SPAN THE RIGHT CONCEPT 

					Records of the bridge span, because of their construction methods and equipment problems
					to be solved, design theory and innovative structural problems and a series of problem,
					which is an enormous challenge for bridge engineers and technicians in order to bridge
					technology and contribute to the development of global attention. 

					With the development of transportation and technology, record bridge span and constantly
					being refreshed. 

					First of all, span breakthroughs must be necessary and reasonable. Such as shipping
					requirements, topographic and geologic conditions and the depth of need when large-span,
					is necessary and reasonable, such a large span matches the height of layout and navigation,
					coordinated with the terrain, which is economically reasonable, on the landscape
					is beautiful. Conversely, blind pursuit of long-span breakthrough, will be only lead
					to the construction of wind insurance and investment wasted. As the navigation requirements
					are not high, and bridge spans golden times wider than the waterway NET, causing
					the span high bridge disproportionately so that both investment and reflects the
					landscape. 

					Bridge design of six principles did not require the designer to pursue breakthroughs
					of the span and number of "first" and "most". Despite all the bridges now span the
					span of the record have yet to reach a viable limit, but we cannot only for the pursuit
					of span first without regard to economic principles. Therefore, bridge engineer must
					put their creativity into innovation, quality and aesthetics three aspects, while
					also attaches great importance to economic indicators, and strive to build a high
					quality, durable and beautiful bridges, to benefit the people. 

					Secondly, there must be a breakthrough in the span of its scientific and technical
					soundness. Span to break, there is bound to run into problems not encountered bridge,
					however, whether these issues have a clear understanding of whether there is a clear
					solution, it is related to this breakthrough is feasible, whether scientific, whether
					conservative issues. Such as the main Japanese Tatara Bridge cross because of topography,
					geology and navigation conditions set for 890 m, then Japan has been completed and
					the name of the Hong Kong Central Bridge 590 m, the French 856 m Normandy Bridge
					began construction on this basis, in order to grasp the main span from original level
					increased to 500~600 m after 890 m of cable-stayed bridge structural properties (e.g.,
					member forces and natural frequency, etc.), how much change, and this change is the
					size and span linear or non-linear relationship, specifically on the 500 m, 890 m,
					1400 m and 2000 m four kinds of main hole span studied compared. 

					Thirdly, a span of breakthrough of technical progress and technical innovation is
					a real "world record", that is, with the development of new technologies, record
					refresh, it has its indelible in the history of bridges "historical status". If just
					span development, the size of the cross breakthroughs do not have or lack of skill
					"gold content", it's hard to become the technical level of "world record". 

					Quoting Mr. Man-Chung Tang "Record spans (Civil Engineering, March 2010)" as described
					in the article view points: construction of record-breaking bridge not only built-in
					a record-breaking, additional costs it takes to break the record must be able to
					bring value, if it is not, we are wasting taxpayers money. 

					Of course, competition is that people are born with the designed bridge record warmth
					is not declining. However, in our efforts to before you record, be sure to carefully
					consider the cost of the project and the resulting value. We must also take into
					account that records will be maintained how long. Today, due to the bridge span records
					regularly being broken, so it's best to spend our energies and creativity on the
					construction quality better rather than bigger bridges with long span. Though several
					years after the Golden Gate bridge would lose record-holder status, but there is
					still like to visit it because it is the rare beauty of the structure. 

					4.4.1 Denmark Great Belt Bridge 

Design ideas: Feasibility phase proposed main span cable stayed bridge with a main
					span of 1204 m and 916 m, and a main span of 1448 m and 1688 m programme of suspension
					bridges, and through surveys of shipping conditions and shipping analog, found that
					the superstructure of small-span bridge cost savings far sub-structure and underwater
					protection measures cost little. Finally decided to adopt the main span is 1624 m
					suspension bridge, bridge design incorporates a mix concrete spandrel frame light
					anchor, using buffer to reduce dynamic displacements of girder of suspension bridge,
					the new design ideas. 

					Denmark's Great Belt suspension bridge links the is land of Zealand and the Philippines
					because of the Great Belt East Bridge Road project, the project includes 8 km tunnel,
					6.8 km East Bridge and Highway 6.6 km west parallel road and rail bridge. 

					In 1987, when you do design scenario, East bridge has made of cable-stayed and suspension
					bridge scheme 1416 m and 780 m. It is clear that 780 m main span cable-stayed bridge
					with large span cable-stayed bridges are built or under construction were many (In
					1986, Canada built 465 m Annacis bridge), and the main span is 1416 m suspension
					bridge was built-in 1981, by United Kingdom Permanent Bill (Humber) River Bridge,
					6 m, be first in the world, and technology across more secure. In 1989, however,
					shipping conditions of survey research shows that 780 m of span is not enough. 

					Feasibility and design stage, presented four different spans of programmes, namely,
					the main span cable-stayed bridge with a main span of 1204 m and 916 m, suspension
					bridge with a main span of 1448 m and 1688 m programme. 

					When the construction of cable-stayed bridge, the greatest difficulties were encountered
					during the construction phase. Cantilever length of cable-stayed main span of 1200
					m free 600 m, to meet the phase stability of the cantilever bridge widened to 6 m.
					In addition, through the shipping conditions of further investigations, in particular
					by shipping simulation found that costs of superstructure of small-span bridge substructure
					and underwater protection measures for savings is far more cost. 

					Therefore, Dong finally decided to adopt the main span of the bridge is 1624 m, and
					sides of three-span suspension bridge scheme over 535 m (Fig. 4.56). 

					The anchorage of the bridge design incorporates a new shape form, because commonly
					used desktop gravity bridge anchorage of suspension bridge with a great body product,
					this suspension bridge and the rest of the incongruous contrast to the slender member.
					So in the design of this bridge anchorage, after careful research and decided to
					anchor is designed by concrete spandrel frame of main cable in anchorage and a bearing
					vertical piers of the bridge (Fig. 4.57). 



Fig. 4.56 Denmark big bear-suspension bridge scheme (size: m). 

					Anchoring in 10 m deep built in relatively shallow water, noted in the bidding plan,
					these vital water component can be used in the sea by doing construction or after
					a temporary cofferdam construction on the wharf. In order to prevent the ship collision,
					anchoring two artificial islands built on both sides. 



Fig. 4.57 Big bear special triangles anchorage of suspension bridge (size: m). 

					Bridges in anchorage and 2 parallel hydraulic buffers installed between beam limiting
					device, as shown in Fig. 4.58, which is the driving force locked and static limit
					of two functional combination of devices. Power lock function Master Liang Zongqiao
					by car, wind-induced vibration the impact movement, adjust lock speed control value
					at 0.01~2 mm/s range, power lock power 5 mn of each device; static limit functionality
					limits the main beam does not meet the temperature slowly displacement displacement
					occurs, whose value is controlled within ± 900 mm and regulation section 200 mm,
					satisfy the range of ±1 000 mm expansion joints, 15 mm static limit, if there is
					no vertical limit device, beam displacement will be 1800 mm.

					4.4.2 Japan Akashi Kaikyo Bridge 

Design ideas: Studies to fit them into the four foundations, particularly the 3P
					Pier (the main pier of the Awaji side) design criteria very tough. 1900 m, 1950 m,
					2000 m, 2050 m, 2100 m, corresponding to the different main span superstructure fine
					contrast. In order to ensure the edges, across more than 0.5 m and each side span
					at 25 m intervals. For comparison with a focus on the wind resistance, vibration
					characteristics, stability, duration and cost, and difficulty of construction. 

					Japan Honshu Shikoku contact line Akashi Kaikyo Bridge Kobe·Naruto online, bridges
					total length for 960 m + 1991 m + 960 m = 3911 m bridge 110 m the deepest waters,
					the maximum velocity is 4.5 m/s Akashi Kaikyo Bridge's steel consumption is: stiffening
					truss sections 90000t of 60000t of steel for cable, Tower of steel consumption 50000
					t, full bridge amounted to 200000t, substructure concrete approximately 1250000 m3.
					

					The construction of the bridge from May 1988 to May 1998. 

1. Selection of Bridge 

					In 1967, Japan Society of Civil Engineers (JSCE) featured vertical rock-water line
					as the choice of Honshu-Shikoku bridges route. In this design, was selected as the
					pier's two shallow: one extending from the side of Kobe's "Takaiso" another is 40
					m depth of ocean elevations "Gazitajo", as shown in Fig. 4.59. Distance between the
					two sides since this line exceeds 5 km, so the main span of the bridge will be set
					upto 1500 m in both sides of the main span and two side spans of about 700 m. 

					In 1970, Honshu-Shikoku Bridge Authority (HSBA) was established, found that before
					the two main Pier "Takaiso" and "Gazitajo" the geographical condition is flawed.
					In addition, including wind tunnel testing of a large number of studies have confirmed
					that suspension limitation span of the bridge is about 1800 m. Study Maiko-Matsuho
					these facts led directly to the start line in this scenario, the main bridge across
					4 km apart on both sides of the Akashi Strait's narrowest width. Proposed road-rail
					combined bridge span arrangement for 890 m + 1780 m + 890 m, it sets the main pier
					at the depth of 40~50 m on the ground. 



Fig. 4.59 Selection of bridge. 

2. Highway Bridge 

					In June 1981, due to the deterioration of financial and political influence on Japan
					national railways re-structuring impact HSBA bridge study programme in place of a
					highway-railway dual-purpose bridge. HSBA conducted a number of studies, including
					design, construction, price estimates, the construction period and the feasibility
					of collecting tolls and so on. Raised road bridge (890 m + 1780 m + 890 m) combined
					bridge the economic feasibility of the same. Programme of highway-railway dual-purpose
					bridge construction costs are relatively high, although the railway bridge section
					to only 41% of the cost, on the other hand, its bridge section has to bear the full
					cost (Fig. 4.60). 

					In August 1985, the building and land Bureau, Transport Department has concluded
					from the report: Akashi Kaikyo Bridge Highway should be used. 

3. Study on Optimal Span 

					Alone, when the highway bridge program was established, compared with the combined
					bridge, which have greater freedom in the design. Combined bridge design, the 3 P
					Pier (Awaji side Pier) is extremely difficult, the trick is by 1800 m may limit the
					span for sure, this problem can also be solved by increasing the span. For optimal
					span arrangement, conducted the following research. 

(a) Based on Location (Fig. 4.60) 

					Before selection of combined bridge piers based on studies to fit them into the four
					foundations. 



Fig. 4.60 Planning and development programme's overall layout (size: m). 


						1A: If the bridge is not set up on the shore, the depth will increase sharply after
						the more than -7 m, so changes of the mooring dolphins will be subject to limit.
						If 1 A fallback, its range at best no more than 110 m, so as not to affect the 2nd
						route and Maiko Park. 

						2P: the original terrain is perfectly flat, Akashi strata of geographical conditions
						and no significant change. But beyond this point. In the Harbour a sudden drop observed.
						If the superstructure of 2 P backward will be increase the cost of 2 P in both directions
						therefore changes are unfavourable. Back through the coast of Awaji side if location,
						depth and tidal flow rates will be eased, and bearing layer, stratum in Kobe become
						slightly lighter. In addition, piers and navigation the hole edge distance would
						increase, this will be increase navigation safety at construction and completion.
						Thus to proper conclusion can be drawn: 3 P position back. 

						4A: because more close to the coast of Awaji, 4 A supporting layer of granite to
						go lighter, 4 A's design and construction Much easier, especially when 280 m is moved
						from a previous location. However, moving above 300 m would be undesirable, because
						the Mainland would be affected. So, in conclusion: upto 4 a backward 300 m. 


(b) The Upper Structure 

					1900 m, 1950 m, 2000 m, 2050 m, 2100 m, corresponding to the different main span
					superstructure ratio. In order to ensure the edges, across more than 0.5, and each
					side span at 25 m intervals. For comparison with a focus on the wind resistance,
					vibration characteristics, stability, duration and cost, and difficulty of construction.
					Some of these conclusions are as follows. 


						Compared with previous programmes Span I, 780 m, deformation and vibration is not
						much changed. 

						In the span, you can use the width is 14.0 to 35 m. The truss stiffening girder of
						5 m to ensure that it will have sufficient wind stability. 

						Three parts, from the perspective of project cost and duration, optimal span should
						be 2000 m. 


4. Final Scheme 

					Side span to main span ratio of 1 : 2, primarily on the basis: (a) by comparing different
					span Division, when the ratio was used, the package, (b) includes upper and lower
					total project cost structure, the most economic and second least impact on navigation,
					(c) for the design and construction of large-span cantilever bridges has accumulated
					sufficient technique. 

The Main Cable: Allowable stress of previous suspension bridge cable 1600 MPa tensile
					strength divided by 2.5, a safety factor equal to 640 MPa newly developed 1800 MPa
					strength of steel wire cable tension due to live load is only quarter of cable tension
					8%, the safety factor is 2.2, the allowable stress of upto 820 MPa. Due to the improvement
					of strength of steel cables, towers, making out stone bridge tower height reduced
					to 30 m. 

The Steel Pylon and Foundation: Tower high above the sea level is about 300 m, given
					the tower during construction or during operation due to wind effects may cause vibration,
					wind tunnel tests were carried out. After wind tunnel testing by selected section
					shape of the tower. In addition, by at the top sets the attenuation of vibration
					damping device, tower wind stability is greatly improved. 

					Pylon foundations of circular caisson of diameter of 80 m, high 65 m. Choose the
					caisson is mainly adapted to ocean climate conditions under, But also can be prevent
					the current impacts and erosion. First in a factory making steel caisson foundation,
					launched by a shipyard, and shipped to the construction site, and then anchor position,
					sink, pouring concrete. From the tower to the base of the largest vertical force
					to 125000t (Fig. 4.61). 



Fig. 4.61 Pylon foundations (left), and the tower of general plan (right) (size:
						m) Note: the 3P in the underlying data. 

Stiffened Truss: The choice of stiffening truss section to, respectively, of the
					modern United Kingdom genre of box a streamlined cross-section and classical truss
					sections are analyzed and compared. Design standards, self-excited vibration critical
					wind speed for 73 m/s above. Wind tunnel test knowledge box girder section self-excited
					vibration critical wind speed of about 60 m/s. In the other hand, the select the
					main beam as shown in Fig. 4.62 section wind-resistant stability to meet the above
					conditions, trussed girder is economical, convenient construction and so on. 



Fig. 4.62 Stiffening truss (size: m). 

Anchorage: Akashi Kaikyo Bridge line force of about 1200000 kN, because suspension
					bridges on both sides of topographical and geological conditions are so Kobe side
					1A (Fig. 4.63) and Awaji side 4 two anchor the shape and size of a completely different.

					4.4.3 Luo River Bridge 

Design idea: According to technical reserves and engineering experience in suspension
					bridges and cable-stayed bridge scheme selection made after the 890 m cross cable-stayed
					bridge scheme; design further research of the hybrid girder cable-stayed bridge with
					side elastic connection between the cross-ratio, cable-stayed bridge in taliang problems
					using large lifting steel beams and tower construction method. 

					Japan Mr bridge at the Honshu Shikoku contact bridge Onomichi—Jzs line, it is a connected
					Islands and ruins island Sea 4-lane bridges. 1973 the planned programme of the bridge
					was built as a traditional-style steel truss stiffening girder-Three-span suspension
					bridge, long-span 300 m + 890 m + 300 m (Fig. 4.64). Beginning in 1987, the above
					plan was re-assessed. As in the 1980, of the 20th century, Japan has been through
					the construction of a large number of steel cable-stayed bridge (such as a primary
					port west across the 405 m bridge, 420 m Black Stone Island Bridge and Rock Island
					Bridge, East of 460 m Yokohama Bay Bridge, 485 m bridge, 510 m Tsurumi channel bridge
					in Kobe, as well as 590 m of Meiko Central bridge, and so on), of large-span cable-stayed
					bridges have accumulated certain experience, plus France 856 m main span of Normandy
					began construction of the bridge, in order to capture maximum of long-span cable-stayed
					bridges in the world title, it decided in 1990, to change the design, such as 270
					m + 890 m + 320 m three-span steel cable-stayed bridge as shown in Figs. 4.65 &
					4.66 main girder section. 



Fig. 4.65 Three-span steel-concrete composite cable-stayed bridge (size: m). 

					Compared with the original proposal under the now programme, instead of cable-stayed
					bridges can be also avoid programmes island shore main cables of suspension bridges
					anchor large excavation and the damage to the original natural environment, wind-resistant
					and have certain cost advantages. 



Fig. 4.66 The main beam section (size: m). 

					The bridge across the main span due to topography, geology and navigation bar such
					relationships as 890 m. But in order to master the main span from the original 500~600
					m levels increased to 890 m, on cable-stayed bridge of knots frame properties (such
					as stress and natural frequency components, etc.) how much big changes, and this
					change is linear with the span size closed systems will also be non-linear relationships,
					so the 500 m, 890 m, 1400 m and 2000 m studies comparing the four-hole span. Research
					shows that the main spans of 890 m structure characteristics generally similar to
					the 500 m found no divergence of non-linear phenomena. 

					Due to the topography of this bridge the two side spans respectively disposed in
					270 m (Island side) and 320 m (the junior side of the island), due to this ratio
					of side and main span of 270/890 = 1/3, 320/890 = 1/2.8. Both ratios were relatively
					too far small consequence on dead load bottom pivot negative reaction and pylon moments
					are too large. To that end, by calculating the comparison study additional auxiliary
					piers and side spans between the end point to the secondary pier counterweight additional
					options, as shown in Table 4.2. Based on the results settings to the auxiliary piers
					and balanced programme on structural characteristics are improved considerably. And
					1.1 and 2.1 and 2.2 compared to span mode is basically the same, so this bridge eventually
					decide on the island uses the 1.1 schema, junior island side 2.1 schema.

					4.4.4 Su Tong Yangtze River Bridge 

Design idea: According to the broad river bridge located in 8 km, a 50,000 ton container
					ship bi-directional navigation and overlay thickness 300 m condition research on
					cable-stayed bridge, suspension bridges and cable-stayed suspension system and other
					programmes, finalization of the main span is 1088 m cable-stayed bridge. Study on
					design of bridge pile foundation stability, nonlinear effects, for large span cable-stayed
					bridge cable vibration, wind-resistant stability and taliang connected system and
					a series of technical problems. 

					Control of Su Tong Changjiang bridge and the main factors affecting the main channel
					bridge of long-span has the following several points. 


						The Su Tong bridge navigable river and seagoing vessels, vessel density, is the busiest
						waterway of Yangtze river. Navigation of the Khumbu reset should be deep water, shallow
						water shallow and porous navigation principle, setting up a two side navigation,
						main navigation span, a special pass air holes and a flood channel. Main navigation
						channel press the single-hole bi-directional navigation standard for design, navigation
						the clearance width of not less than 891 m main navigation span both side edges of
						holes according to the single-hole single navigation standard for design, navigation
						the clearance width of not less than 220 m. 

						According to the evolution of river bed and river regime analysis reports, deep main
						channel at the location of the bridge is 300~350 m the swing range and cross-path
						selection and arrangement should take into account the deep history and possible
						future of the varied sites to fit the bridge waterways may have been a fan wall swing
						needs, provide greater adjustment for the channel space. 

						By 2~3 km formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze river on a bridge axis curve,
						the channel also set it, so span should be selected to navigation there is a course
						adjustment of surplus, for the safe navigation of ships, piers, collision avoidance
						benefit. 

						Bridge site at -20 m isobath width 1000 m, -10 m isobath width 2000 m, the main channel
						of the bridge should be covered by deep water, provide better conditions for navigation,
						and to minimise the number of deep water pier, in order to reduce the difficulty
						of construction. 

						Structure from the channel farther collision probability is small, the ship impact
						force is smaller. Therefore, there is a navigation NET paused in order to reduce
						the probability of main structure of ship impact to ensure structural safety. 

						The main tower base side must exist within the flow area, range about 50~70 m and
						flow velocity variations in the district difference gradient is large, once the ship
						enters orbit around the flow velocity, hit the pier accident-prone, for navigation
						and the safety of navigation is not lee and the voyage should be avoided. Therefore,
						the main span of the selection should ensure clear width than unilateral navigable
						surplus of about 50~70 m, in order to avoid the area around the stream. 


					Under the control and influence factors of main channel bridge of Su Tong bridge
					main span should at least meet the following requirements:
						
(a) Navigation clear width
					requirements: not less than 891 m;						
(b) The tower base and facilities against dash
					size: according to the design plan, flanked by a total of 55~85 m;						
(c) Navigation clear width
Fully considered of main importance, in order to ensure its better navigation conditions
						under any circumstances, taking into account the cable tower foundation flow around
						a sphere of influence on the side size: unilateral 50~70 m gauge, flanked by a total
						of 100~140 m. 

					Comprehensive consideration of, main span of span fetch 1088 m. 

					For construction of Su Tong Yangtze River Bridge conditions, combined with the current
					level of actual bridge construction at home and abroad, research and proposes four
					main bridge type scheme (Fig. 4.69). 



Fig. 4.69 Chart of main bridge layout (size unit: cm). 


						A main span of 1088 m tower cable-stayed bridge scheme, side spans two auxiliary
						piers, span arrangement for: 100 m + 100 m + 278 m + 1088 m + 278 m + 100 m + 100
						m = 2044 m. 

						Main span cable-stayed bridge with three towers of 650 m programmes, set up an auxiliary
						piers, span arrangement as follows: 96 m + 164 m + 2 × 650 m + 164 m + 96 m = 1820
						m. 

						Suspension bridge with a main span of 1510 m of the twin towers three-span suspension
						programmes span arrangement as follows: 453 m + 1510 m + 453 m = 2416 m. 

						A main span of 1510 m cable-stayed-suspension bridges programme, span arrangement
						as follows: 120 m + 188 m + 1510 m + 188 m + 120 m = 2126 m Rough layout of main
						bridge type is shown in Fig. 4.69. 


					Main span suspension bridge has been completed and the maximum span at 1385 m and
					1991 m, building 1510 m suspension bridge, its mature superstructure design and construction
					experience, adaptability of the navigation better. But because of Su Tong Yangtze
					River Bridge, the river width wide, deeply buried basement bearing layer of soft,
					so anchor foundation not only can put in the water, and the scale is huge, a number
					of deep water foundation leads construction difficulties, long duration, higher construction
					cost, South anchor foundation on the local river still needs further research. In
					addition, its poor wind resistance capacity and wind-resistant safety. Investment
					estimation shows that suspension bridge with a main span of 1510 m project cost than
					main span 1088 m high-tower cable-stayed bridge scheme of about 900 million dollars.
					

					For main span of 1510 m cable-stayed-suspension bridges program study showed that
					large-span cable-stayed-suspension bridges building is technically possible, but
					now spans more than 500 m there is no engineering, due to the complex can take design
					and construction experience, the technology is immature. Compare with comparable
					suspension bridges, due to poor geological conditions at the bridge, anchor Ikari
					is still quite large and put into construction equipment and its technical superiority
					not obvious. 

					Because the main span cable-stayed bridge with three towers of 650 m scheme in Sham
					Shui Po to set up more large structure, adaptability to shipping and poor ability
					to prevent ships extremely prejudicial impact, impact on the river as well. And it
					spans the size of three towers cable-stayed bridge is also first in the world, also
					has a great deal of difficulty in their technology. 

					Tower cable-stayed bridge, Japan in 1999, opened the Tatara bridge span had reached
					890 m, main span built in 1995, was more than 856 m of France in Normandy bridge,
					a main span in the world at that time-span the largest cable-stayed bridge, construction
					of a cable stayed bridge with a main span of 1000 m international technology matures.
					Su Tong bridge main span of 1088 m tower cable-stayed bridge scheme, because of the
					relatively few large structures in Sham Shui Po, had met with main span two-way channel
					width summation the main channel the possible range of oscillation, influence on
					the river is relatively small, project cost is reasonable. 

					After workers stage a bridge program and the study on key technology of bridge, consolidate
					the views of the experts, you can come to the conclusion that: 

					According to the requirements and characteristics of building of Su Tong bridge,
					a main span of 1088 m tower cable-stayed bridge scheme, although the deposit certain
					technical difficulties, there are lots of research on the key technologies needed
					to be deepened, but according to the current level of bridges and the practice, by
					deepening the study and the necessary scientific experiments and absorbing international
					advanced technology, in the design, construction, materials, equipment, management
					of works are feasible, technical problems can be solved. 

					4.5 OUTSTANDING STRUCTURE AWARD-WINNING BRIDGE PROFILE 

					International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering (IABSE) since 2000
					to establish Outstanding Structure Award in recognition of the most significant (remarkable),
					the most innovative, one of the most creative or both wise and exciting (stimulating)
					the new structure, but does not pursue maximum span or height. Outstanding structure
					award by the awards from application projects for the year, the Committee selected
					one to three bridges or structures in the outstanding works of the project, from
					2000 to 2009 in 10 years, has comments on 20 projects have been selected, including
					11 in structural engineering and 9 in bridge engineering 2008 Shanghai lupu as the
					first Chinese project won the outstanding structure award. 

					Bridge conceptual design below introduces one of 4 bridges. 

					4.5.1 Switzerland Sunniberg Bridge 

1. Special Conditions of Bridge Design 

					More than 20 years ago, Switzerland the Government envisaged building a highway in
					the Alps regions, because the line would will have an impact on the environment and
					encountered strong opposition, more consideration of environmental factors on the
					basis of the number of the original design was amendments, thereby making lines most
					of the tunnels. In 1993, a new way to through the town of Klosters has finally been
					decided, is the most important structure in the channel length is Gotschna tunnel
					of 4.5 km, directly connected with the tunnel is the shengniboge bridge, the bridge
					and flowing in between Rand Kuat River Valley obstacle clearance height is about
					50~60 m. Shengnibo Geqiao is the most notable building of the Davos channel, bridge
					conceptual design mainly depends on three conditions, namely, bridge structure shall
					be must meet high aesthetic requirements as well as integration of the scenery at
					the bridge site, caused by the adverse weather conditions are not normal maintenance
					high durability requirements, must attach great importance to the protection of natural
					environment factors during the construction of the bridge. 

2. Integration Into the Landscape Design-led Concept 

					Shengniboge bridge is located in the town of Klosters, is Switzerland Alps area one
					of the largest bridges. Taking into account the bridge-building capacity at that
					time, even though the bridge difficult topographic and geological conditions and
					is located on a curve segment, two hard questions, and build a bridge of this size
					will not be much difficulty. However, the bridge is in a highly visible, bridge integrates
					with the surrounding landscape is the biggest design challenge. In the valley in
					the open countryside, shengnibogeqiao was the only man-made structures. From a distance,
					this bridge is prominent, it is in Klosters resort around the landmark building.
					Although the height of the bridge with striking across the valley, but it was not
					overwhelming dominate the landscape of the valley. Taking into account the situation
					on the ground, the bridge must be designed with this rich rustic fusion in silence,
					maintaining beautiful bridge building itself. Meanwhile, tourists arriving through
					the railway or highway, the bridge for their show should be bridge technology with
					unique architectural landscape. 

					In view of the aesthetic design of the bridge was unusual, so select a cable-stayed
					bridge design (Fig. 4.70). The programmes that bridge has four towers, three-span
					larger main span and side spans of two smaller spans (Fig. 4.71). Considering this
					bridge is flat curved bridge, at both ends of the main beam not set abutment and
					main beam joints but overall continuous structure. 



Fig. 4.70 Landscape design. 



Fig. 4.71 Facade layout (size: mm) (a) Elevations; (b) Plans; (c) Cuts; (d) P2 Pier.
						

					Such structure allows the main beam in longitudinal and lateral movement of the piers
					is constrained, and by acting on the main beam in bridge piers load bending moment
					caused by decreased from pier to pier bottom line. 

					Pier sizes reflect the variation of the bending moment in the pier. Taking into account
					the bending sections of bridge deck clearance requirements, bridge tower slightly
					outward tilt. Due to the continuous change of vehicles crossing a bridge on both
					sides of the landscape, the cable is vertical routing style choices as simple as
					possible harp arrangement. Deck consists of a panel, on both sides of the plate edges
					have a relatively long rigid components design schemes. Cost about 14% higher than
					traditional cantilevers programme costing at least. But considering the plan design
					enable this striking bridges located in the sensitive landscapes of unusual beauty,
					is well worth the additional investment was considered. 

3. Technical Design Overview 

(a) Pier 

					Along the vertical piers of the bridge showed a parabolic cone, its width is also
					changed. The horizontal width of the pier the bottom 8.8 m to the main beam at the
					13.4 m. Therefore a solid cup-shaped piers of the silhouette. Towers, were like partitions
					and high deck 15 m. Along the bridge longitudinal plate on the main girder of bridge
					tower from the local effect of vehicle load caused by the bending moment. Because
					the line is curved in the horizontal plane, on both sides of the cable forces of
					cable-stayed in different. Horizontally, the towers on both sides due to large transverse
					bending moment of tension arising from the different. Anchorage in built-in central
					pylon of cable-stayed steel plate. Bridge tower tighten to get main beam set a huge
					beam on the lower surface, passing on two great transverse bending moments in the
					tower, making the two pillars of the pier shaft different pillars bear some 60% on
					the inside of the curve, approximately the outer side of the pillars bear the 40%.
					

(b) Master Girder 

					Width of main girder section contains 12.1 m plate and two side beams. Bridge transversal
					thickness 0.40~0.32 m. Lateral beam setting removable inclined cable anchorage points.
					For static reasons, thickness along a bridge longitudinally to the pier increased.
					Due to the method of construction, formed entirely of boundary beams using tensioned
					pre-stressed components. In the main beam part due to compensate because of the tension
					force of cable-stayed main welded connction axial force arising from falling, the
					department imposed vertical pre-stressing increases. 

(c) The Cable 

					Cables are wrapped with polyethylene, rigid sets of parallel wire strands form. Each
					cable consists of 125~160 diameter 7 mm structure of galvanized steel wire, wire
					rope use stress to meet the. σp,adm = 0.50 ftk. Because each of these is a separate
					anchorage of cable-stayed, so it can be free to adjust cable-length. Cable anchorage
					has been specially designed so that it can be a great deal of variation of load.
					

(d) Process 

					The bridge's construction started in July 1996, to the end of October 1998. Nearly
					2.5-year construction period need to fine planning of the construction process. Using
					the balanced cantilever construction method of bridge, the first phase of the No.
					0 block, 13 m, after continuous construction of beam length is 6 m, use a pair of
					specially constructed traveler for main girder erection. At every stage of construction
					only current segmental beams of concrete and pouring of concrete on the veneer of
					a segment. Hanging basket prior to the move, cable-stayed cable-hanging cable and
					anchoring. Construction of four main towers on both sides of the suspension arms
					are made of 7~9.6 m length of main girder segment composition. 



Fig. 4.72 Bridge photo. 

					The bridge won the 2001, international bridge and structural engineering drive association
					outstanding structure award, first won the outstanding structure award the bridge
					project, and is considered to be "sensitive scenic areas a refined structure of the
					arts initiative", the bridge is shown in Fig. 4.72 after the completion of the photo.
					

					4.5.2 The Miho Museum Bridge 

1. Special Conditions of Bridge Design 

					Miho Museum in Japan state Midwest Shigaraki mountains in a remote, wooded valley.
					The wood has been used in the valley near NARA temple building. Now, the area has
					become a nature reserve, therefore, the construction very strict regulations in the
					area of control. Miho Museum entryway—Miho Museum bridge, is a need bridge of the
					harmonious combination of aesthetics and technology. Local beautiful mountain views
					of the bridge and transition between galleries, visitors will concrete will pass
					through a tunnel and across a canyon to get to the museum. 

2. The Concept of Harmony between Aesthetics and Technology Leading Design 

					Miho Museum bridge and other parts (a reception pavilion, gardens, two tunnels, and
					an Art Museum) together form a complex. Designers expected visitors to walk over
					the bridge to art galleries, but the bridge was still being asked designed to withstand
					the total wheel weight two-lane loading of 12 kN. The bridge even allow occasional
					higher rounds of heavy loads, such as dignitary guests use when visiting armed vehicles.
					Most visitors car park in the reception pavilion is located in the bottom of the
					steep slopes, the department also the bus get off point for tourists. Visitors before
					entering the tunnel need to be started by the walk along winding Canyon road, out
					of the tunnel once located on Miho Museum bridge, visitors at first glance at this time the entrance to the museum (Fig. 4.73). 



Fig. 4.73 Arch and tunnel portal. 

					Out of consideration for seriousness and spectacular, the appearance of the bridge
					and structure was carefully studied. The bridge spans the valley without using intermediate
					supports, makes ecological impacts to the minimum. The main steel truss girder height
					of 2 m, post tension cable in concrete tunnel to dangling roots. While the design
					and construction of the bridge forms the transition between architectural and structural
					design. Bridge. Structural engineer mainly responsible for bridge basic design tasks,
					and design consultants who are evaluating the bridge was raised by many of the lean
					fine views. 

3. Technical Design Overview 

(a) Structure System 

					Bridge design respectively in the post-tensioning pre-stressed bridges, cable-stayed
					bridge with cantilever bridges and other innovative design ideas in the system, so
					that the a visually beautiful and efficient structure of the bridge. Figs. 4.74 and
					4.75 respectively in four main parts: tunnel exit, ring of steel truss girder, and
					post-tensioned cable-system. Because the bedrock is of better quality, so choose
					the tunnel as a cantilever span valley roots. The space at the bottom of the tunnel
					of axial pressure in truss rod and bolted to the top of the tunnel portal of post-tensioning
					cable the axial torque caused by bringing the main beam to the cantilever effect.
					Space truss with the bottom surface of the tunnel structure is continuous, cables
					interconnected with post-tensioning tendons in the tunnel wall. Therefore, gravity
					and lateral forces acting on the bridge together use the tunnels is mainly influenced
					by bending rather than pulling. 

(b) Space Truss 

					Because bridge restricted the traffic bridge on the aesthetic perception of conditions
					and light permeability is better than thick concrete structure, to select a steel.
					In may cases, studios and pre-fabricated tunnel within the range allowed by the steel
					members. Bridge 2 m only the height of the space of main girder steel truss. Most
					of steel pipe truss bar and cross-sectional triangle truss structure made in 7.5
					m width of the driveway within the distribution of the three top chord, as well as
					a bottom rod (Fig. 4.76). Horizontal, vertical and inclined plane of truss consisting
					of diagonal supports the complete section. Best truss rod's diameter is 267 mm. Rod
					direct size was selected to represent the poles distribution levels; rod diameter
					at specific levels remain unchanged, while the wall thickness of steel, with the
					load performance changes. Members generally use financial penetration welds between
					tubes and tube connections. Bridge cover, flange bolting method suitable for site
					consolidation. 



Fig. 4.74 Facade layout (size: m). 



Fig. 4.75 Truss floor plan (size: m). 

					The top chord of the bridge between the cable and screw anchor, the castings of the
					truss and screw set are interconnected. These castings to simplify connection detail
					of highly exposed and easily adapted to cable angle at each connection point. 

					Museum-side 6 m at the bridgehead of high gravity type bridge pier. Restraint systems
					are installed at the bridge to live load resistance by cross-bridge girders ends
					upwards. The gravity type bridge pier of the restraint system is installed, constrains
					the beam under three piers direction of rotation, but allowed the main longitudinal
					elongation and shortening, while also allowing seismic beam under the action of lateral
					and torsional movement. 



Fig. 4.76 The main beam section (size: m). 

(c) The Cable 

					One end of the cable and laid in the tunnel wall of post-tensioned pre-stressing
					steel cross anchor, through and at the mouth of the tunnel is a skew arch. The arch
					feature class similar to the vertical pier in the cable-stayed bridge. Cable by inclined
					arches was spread out to hanging truss girder per 2 m setting on a connection point
					has been to cross in the girder. Using these cables in post-tensioned beams to provide
					upward support force, in order to balance live loads on the bridge. Post tension
					jacks when only in deck anchor homework and arch and the anchor end of the tunnel.
					Another set of cable systems and steel truss girder beam set attached to the pillars
					of the free ones (Fig. 4.76). These post-tensioned cable-provided upward force and
					deflection control of both functions and arrangement of curved pre-stressed reinforcement
					in post-tensioned beams are alike. Beam setting you can adjust the screw fittings
					of the pillars in order to increase its length, vertical jacks mounted on pillars
					of cables can be done later. Backbone cables and two sets of cable-arch of the bridge-tunnel
					cable reduces the bending moment of steel beams together, making the bridge with
					the same compared to the non-prestressed bridge span, you can use smaller height
					of the girder and pipe diameters. 

					Space of cable wound on the surface of galvanised spiral, diameter 22.4~60 mm a total
					of 6 different diameter steel wire rope structure composition. From arch-to-arch
					cable diameter, wire diameter also increased, resulting in a very high structural
					efficiency and beautiful style. In addition to these aesthetic considerations, wire
					diameter is not controlled by the structural strength, stiffness and more by can
					control. 

(d) About Arch 

					Arch tunnel side of the bridge can be significantly reduce the cable diameter, axial
					pressure of the main beam. In a horizontal direction began, arch between the plane
					and the tunnel portal of the deviation angle of 45°. Along the direction of the longitudinal
					axis of the bridge, by combination of steel box section arch shape consisting of
					a smooth parabola. Arch cross-section changes with the curve, this curve takes into
					account the structural and aesthetic requirements, high efficiency of arch ring structure,
					visual perception the United States. Skew and rotation is not constrained by spherical
					bearing pin. By post-tensioning cable stress caused by fixing the arch on the spherical
					bearing. 

					Miho Museum bridge on both aesthetic and functional balance benefits to reflect grandeur
					and symbolism of the Museum. For several years, it design of novel structures and
					forward-looking as visitors to Miho Museum provides a sturdy and attractive entrance
					(Fig. 4.77). 

					The bridge won the 2002, international bridge and structural engineering outstanding
					structure award, considered to be built lightweight transparent structure highlights
					build beautiful and artistic charm and perfect protection of the landscape under
					the bridge.

					4.5.3 United Kingdom Gateshead Millennium Bridge 

1. Special Conditions of Bridge Design 

					In the United Kingdom, Central District of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Gateshead there six
					bridges have been built over the river, three of them with important history and
					drive meaning respectively, built-in 1849, by Robert Stephenson designed double-decker
					highway-railway dual-purpose bridge, completed in 1876, armstrong designed rotating
					bridge-bascule bridge opened in 1928, and designed by David Anderson looks like the
					Sydney Harbour Bridge two-hinged steel arch bridges, the three bridges represent
					the latest technological achievements and outstanding engineering innovations. In
					the mid-1990s, gateshead City Hall puts on the redevelopment of the river and the
					nearby abandoned zones and with the Tyne Newcastle terminal connection plan, launched
					a collection spanning the Tyne bridge design contest, the contest attracted of the
					47 teams from around the world to participate in, in which 6 teams passed the qualification
					examination and were invited to submit designs. 

					Major design conditions of the bridge is to be a landmark structure in the city,
					and ensures 25 m high vertical clearance empty and terminal junctions around just
					a scant 4~5 m. 

					2. Open Innovation-led Concept Design 

					In order to not only ensure navigation 25 m clearance and meet the requirements of
					terminals only high out of the water around 4~5 m, the only selection optional is
					the bascule bridge. From the bascule bridge has built, mainly by four forms, namely,
					vertical rotation, horizontal rotation, horizontal movement and vertical promotion,
					as shown in Fig. 4.78. After a full consideration of these traditional ways of opening,
					Gateshead Millennium Bridge was created to give a new open format, that is, in the
					direction perpendicular to the vertical plane—the so-called fifth-degree rotation
					space, rotation of the fifth dimension concept design is shown in Fig. 4.79. 

					The bridge program is an innovative and adventurous design, it is a reversible form
					of bridge, consists of a pair of slalom composed of steel arch Hat elastic Fulcrum
					turns on. The opening of the bridge can be compared to a motorcycle helmet helmet
					goes up, or is man the eyelids open. Gross weight bridge 800t can rotate and open,
					making ships pass under the bridge, and in this regard it is the unique and convenient.
					Open systems is the use of hydraulic jacks pushing plate below the fulcrum, so as
					to achieve overall the purpose of rotating bridge. Pontic opened position, play a
					connecting role slings are horizontal, these slings will be tight this steel arch
					associated with key.

3. Technical Design Overview 

(a) Arch Rib 

					Parabolic steel arches by tapered in plan and elevation of kite-shape composition
					(Fig. 4.80), which is mainly composed of thick 35 mm plate assembly, and internal
					use of the longitudinal and transverse stiffening, anchor arch box toward cable-stayed
					plane. Outside of the arch, steel wire cable is used to connect the traditional opening
					of the fork-shaped tank, connections on a rib handle installed in the dome-shaped
					alcove with arch in the clapboard and stiffeners connected. 18 cable made up of galvanized
					steel wire, in junction with deck has an adjustable anchor, cable through an internal
					cylindrical cavity embedded anchor plate. 



Fig. 4.79 Fifth-dimensional rotating concept design. 



Fig. 4.80 Rib section. 

(b) Deck 

					Deck elevation for parabolic, plane is curved, it illustrates one of the most complex
					geometric shapes. Steel box junction frame is the main unit from the graphic point
					of view, from the quayside to the river center, steel box gradually narrowed. Box
					profile for anchorage of cable-stayed for space and anchor bolt from the bottom surface
					of the arch into the oval concave interior, steel box the size of the cable from
					its current location to restore the complex stress. Steel box on the surface to be
					coated non-slip epoxy coat. Horizontal steel beams suspended from a steel box about
					3 m pitch and along a curve outward, which supports lightweight aluminum deck plate
					as bike lanes. Along the long bridge to the bike path constant width and 300 mm lower
					than the nearby sidewalk, which has different demands a high level of pedestrian
					fence and guardrail adjustment of a uniform height on the same section (Fig. 4.81).
					



Fig. 4.81 The main beam section (size: m). 

(c) Machinery 

					The bridge needs a system that can be open the bridge, which could push pull, because
					in the process of opening the main center will be through fulcrum. Sufficient to
					operate the wind conditions, the process engine loads from 10000 kN thrust into 4500
					kN pull of the bridge which set out clearly in the system fails to run or, conversely,
					under the condition of different emergency response procedures and requirements.
					River bank mechanical systems with synchronisation to ensure the structure is reversed
					reversing and control equipment to maintain distance between the two sites do not
					exceed 25 mm is extremely important. 

(d) Decoration 

					Aside from the strong visual impact of the bridge outside the general form, become
					bridges decorated with most direct contact part. Bike path is a series of connections
					of aluminium alloy section bars. Aluminum has excellent service diagram surface provides
					bike good grip, but it is also a light structure, which as the main cantilever part
					of its outermost is very important. With its lightness, a bridge deck also has a
					certain degree of transparency, when bridge tilt opening, soffit when fully opened,
					the bridge is particularly spectacular. Sidewalk bridge formed by the epoxy aggregate
					paving. 

					At different heights one-by-one between sidewalks and bike paths and benches of metal
					barriers. Benches are available for people to stop down to rest and finish the bridge,
					enjoy the surrounding scenery than internally by the welding on the frame consisting
					of perforated stainless steel sheet fence in windy environments, can provide some
					degree of protection designer. Set up a series of doors on both ends of the bridge
					in order to ship crowd control when ship navigation. Two stretch into the river next
					to the bridge flow, concrete structure with a glass shell, one is charged room, and
					another prepared as favourites in the future exhibition purposes. 

					The bridge won the 2005, international bridge and structural engineering drive association
					outstanding structure award, considered to be "a two arch ribs using a unique way
					connecting footbridge in a graceful curve and by rotating the opening to be able
					to satisfy the navigation requirements" (Fig. 4.82).

					4.5.4 France Darius Milhaud Bridge 

1. Special Conditions of Bridge Design 

					Darius Milhaud is a main bridge in Viaduct is on the A-75 motorway, connecting Northern
					Europe and Spain East. Milhaud city is located in the confluence of the Tarn and
					Dourbie rivers, two rivers in the ancient Massif central plateau is formed on two
					deep canyons. By the viaduct must be from the North Highlands across the broad valley
					of the 600 m 720 m of the Larzac plateau to the South, road route is not an easy
					task, not to mention but the Foundation due to instability caused by the clay in
					the soil. 

					Follow the principles of bridge length choose bridge location, based on 601 m high
					in the North and South of 675 m even in a straight line, this line of about 2.5 km,
					straight line from bottom of the Tarn river, about 275 m (4.83), apparently high
					pier is a big challenge, the design of the bridge condition can be simply expressed
					as length of 2.46 km and high 275 m valley features a multi-span slim beautiful bridges,
					and adopt appropriate construction methods. 



Fig. 4.83 The main beam section (size: m). 

2. The Concept of Reasonable Hole Leading Design 

					First of all takes more than 200 m across the Tarn river span larger pier height
					and span the lower adjacent bridge across the size and pier height is also quite
					closely, had little to do but others span and high pier of bridge. In the pursuit
					of architectural effect you should first think span bridges, and most traditional
					equal spans and high-pier continuous rigid frame bridge is generally continuous rigid-frame
					bridge spans 150~200 m, even the largest 342 m of long-span continuous rigid-frame
					also needs to set up 9 per cent of the high pier. In order to minimise the number
					of piers, bridges span must be increased, and will be span breakthrough 300 m must
					stay or suspension structures, this is in 1990, Michel Virlogeux first 7 Ta 8-span
					cable-stayed bridge scheme of basic ideas (Fig. 4.84). 



Fig. 4.84 Bridge photo. 

					And span bridge is established, must also take into account local conditions and
					construction methods. Traditional methods of construction of cable-stayed bridges
					are on cantilever construction method, which means about the bridge to proceed concurrently
					or successively in the 8 towers face 16 and 9 closure points of complex construction,
					so many separate construction sites, construction quality control. Adhering to the
					French romantic nature, stiffening of beam with a tower and part of the cable and
					the intermediate provisional pier reduce the span from both ends toward the middle
					of incremental launching construction method (Figs. 4.85 and 4.86), and creatively
					solve construction problems of adjusting measures to local conditions. 

3. Technical Design Overview

					wide and two 3 m wide emergency parking strip. Emergency parking area outside on
					the wind up, specially designed to reduce lateral wind speed wind barriers in order
					to improve air traffic safety.

(b) Pier 

					Pier design must be take into account cross-asymmetric live loads caused by the longitudinal
					unbalanced forces and temperature at different heights on the box influence of cross
					section. In order to resist the bending moment due to extreme high, piers on the
					broad power of box-section, but on the most ends vertically into two forks in the
					90 m range (Fig. 4.89). Vertical pre-stressing of the deck using two pinned to the
					pier on fork bearings, then tack down the inverted v-shaped tower. Under extreme
					asymmetric live loads, each bearing can withstand 100 MN vertical loads. 

					Two top high piers of 245 m and 223 m respectively, with tower cranes, you can reach
					275 m heights. Because this is necessary for construction of tower cranes in every
					step, fixed to the piers. Each bridge pier foundation consists of four 4 in diameter
					consisting of open caisson of the deep ~5 m, 9~16 m. 

(c) Pushing System 

					Steel box girder deck push-starting from both ends, at the crossing of the Tarn river
					closure in the middle of the pier on both sides. In order to reduce the span, in
					addition to closure across the Tarn river in addition to temporary Pier in the middle
					of the set consists of a steel tube truss structure (Fig. 4.86). In order to control
					the largest cantilever length does not exceed 150 m, staging two piers spanning 12
					m fulcrum. Push jobs each cycle is equivalent to 171 m, take 5d time under favourable
					weather conditions. When the weather forecast when wind speed is greater than 37
					km/h, you must stop pushing homework. 

(d) Bridge Tower 

					On May 18, 2004 after the Tarn river span from factory pre-fabricated bridge components
					were transported to the tower each tower position (Fig. 4.89), fixed rear suspension
					installed and tensioned cables, the finished construction. 

					The bridge won the outstanding structure award of 2006, International Association
					for bridge and structural engineering, and is considered to be "a fly in even the
					two deep beautiful slender bridge Canyon heights, creative technology of incremental
					launching construction of bridge construction has been driven into advance."

					DISASTER PREVENTION AND DURABILITY OF BRIDGE STRUCTURES 

					The design of concept is the early stage of project design, relying on the thorough
					study of the natural conditions of the bridge site, bridge function and the surrounding
					landscape and a series of basic data, concept creation and selection of work reflect
					the designer's unique understanding of design objects, design tasks, the specific
					control and overall grasp of design goals. Meanwhile, conceptual design must be follow
					a few basic principles, such as early 3E principles abroad, namely, efficiency, economy
					and elegance, the early "utility, economy, where possible care for beauty" construction
					principles, China's current "safe, suitable, economical, beautiful" principle, the
					21st century international bridge "safe, suitable, economical, beautiful, durable
					and environmentally friendly" six principles. 

					With the rapid economic development of society, the bridge built by ever-larger,
					systems become more complex with more and more functions, internationally known as
					"superstructure" (super infrastructure). Common characteristics of these projects
					are: huge investment, technologically complicated, severe environmental impacts,
					with increased probability of disaster (including heavy winds, earthquakes, tsunami,
					boat crash, terrorist attacks, etc.), and maintenance, repair and reinforcement are
					very difficult. Being confined to structural features, single level seeking structural
					safety, as used to be, is not enough, it must also be aimed at disaster prevention
					design of bridge structure and durability design set. From the 1970s, on the basis
					of lessons learned at home and abroad, in addition to continued emphasis on the structural
					design and construction safety durability, reliability, component interchangeability
					of different bridges structure and analysis of the disaster grade, level of risk,
					proposed the prevention design and durability design of new concepts. In real terms,
					disaster prevention design of structures and structural durability design to solve
					the problem is the economy, reasonable working life issues, namely, structural lifetime
					issue. 

					Bridge structural durability and disaster prevention design in conceptual design
					has three main objectives: first, to learn about damages disasters may impose on
					the bridge, as well as the durability of bridge structures shown on the main issues
					so that at conceptual design stage fully estimate the severity of these disasters
					and problems; secondly, master the design of bridge structures to resist various
					disasters and durability basic principles of design, methods and effective means
					in conceptual design phase has prepared structural disaster prevention and durable
					plan and measures; third, to introduce the bridge structural durability design of
					prevention and advanced concepts, practices, and successful experience of pioneering
					economic, rational, comprehensive and innovative prevention and durability of design
					ideas. 

					This chapter's bridge structure disaster prevention focused mainly on wind-resistant,
					anti-ship collision with bridge and bridge aspect, coupled with resistance of bridges
					durability, and consists of four parts, focusing on bridge conceptual design stage
					of design concepts and methods in these four areas, in hope that bridge engineers
					can, from concept design, fully and seriously deal with prevention and durability
					problems bridge structure design. 

					5.1 BRIDGE WIND RESISTANT DESIGN PHILOSOPHY 

					For bridge structures, particularly large-span bridges, flexible structure, in addition
					to the necessary design and static analysis, you must also be carry out wind-resistant
					analysis and design. Design and analysis of wind-resistant behaviour of long span
					bridges include theory analysis and wind tunnel test and numerical simulation and
					field test, but in bridge conceptual design stage, generally technology, time and
					money do not allow refinement of the design and analysis of wind-resistant, so wind-resistant
					design of the bridge is especially important. In order to establish a wind-resistant
					design of bridges, first of all, one must master the mean and fluctuating wind characteristics
					and wind resistance bridges of the basic principles, which will be introduced in
					the first part of the wind resistance of bridge; secondly, you need to understand
					the concept of wind resistant design in reducing wind loads of bridge, part II, mainly
					from the point of view of bridge structure component—main girder and arch ribs, pylons
					and piers, main cables and so on—introduces briefly reducing wind load practices
					set forth, and one still needs to understand the concept of wind resistant design
					in reducing wind-induced vibration of bridges, the third part is about flutter from
					the main beam, and galloping, vortex-induced vibration of main beam and arch ribs,
					rain-wind induced vibration of stay cable, a brief introduction of engineering practice
					of reducing vibration hazard and experience and methods. Finally, one also needs
					to know when the wind-resistant properties of the bridge structure itself cannot
					meet wind resistance requirements, which can be used to control measures applied
					to improve wind resistance performance, part four introduces flutter control of main
					beam and main beam or arch ribs of vortex-induced vibration control of cables wind
					and rain vibration control of aerodynamic measures. 

					5.1.1 Wind and Bridge Wind-Resistance 

					Wind is a natural phenomenon on the surface of the Earth, human society's history
					of quantitative estimation of wind-induced effects began with "the first civil engineer
					"John Smeaton in 1759, who published the famous paper on mean wind load calculations;
					120 years later, in 1879, when the world's longest railway bridge—the 84-well United
					Kingdom Firth of Tay—were destroyed by strong winds the event advanced the wind load
					calculations to new era that fluctuating wind loads or wind loads must be considered;
					more than 60 years later, in the autumn of 1940, in the United States, Washington's
					second large-span suspension bridge in the world—Tacoma bridge which was completed
					just over 4 months ago, under the action of force of winds underwent strong vibrations
					and collapsed completely. This event ended the era when human simple considering
					the static effect of wind load times. Modern wind engineering started from investigation
					of wind destroyed the Tacoma bridge accident, and has, over more than 60 years, especially
					in the past 30 years, made great progress, forming principles and norms of bridge
					and structural wind-resistant design. 

1. The Wind Characteristics 

					Human settlements are surrounded by a layer of the atmosphere as thick as 1000 km
					on Earth, the orbit around the Earth's atmosphere from the top to the next can be
					divided into hot layer, a middle layer, the stratosphere and the troposphere. Among
					them, the troposphere is about 10 km above Earth's surface, within the atmosphere
					that human activities carried out mainly in the troposphere, such as airline flight
					in nearly 10,000 metres up in the sky, the Earth's tallest mountain—the height of
					Mount Everest is 8848 m. Due to the uneven distribution of solar radiation at the
					Earth's surface and the Earth inhomogeneity of the surface land and water distribution,
					the level of distribution as well as the rotation of the Earth result in the Sun's
					uneven heating of the surface of the Earth, both temporal and spacial and the uniformity
					of tropospheric air temperature distribution in space and time, resulting in horizontal
					and vertical convection of air flow and thus the wind. Simply put, the wind is the
					movement of air relative to the Earth's surface, mostly because of the spatio-temporal
					heterogeneity of heating of air by the Sun. When the air cools, its weight will be
					increase to sink when air gets hot its weight is reduced, it moves up. Hot air rises,
					cold air flows around to fill vacancies and thus forms wind. 

					Air flow forms wind, due to the Earth's surface topography and the impact of various
					obstacles, the flow of wind near the surface of the Earth (referred to as close to
					the wind) dislays disorders. From the anemometer records it has been found that wind
					velocity time-history curve in the package contains two components: one is the period
					is greater than 10 min the long-period average wind components, general description
					in terms of random variables; the other is a period of only a few seconds or less
					short-period pulsating wind component, in accordance with the general stochastic
					processes to deal with them. The average size of the wind is usually divided into
					0~12 or a total of 13 grades according to the English Beaufort grading, it is based
					on objects on land, sea and fishing boats and wind speed the height of 10 m above
					the sea level, wind detailed registration is seen in Table 5.1.

2. Wind Induced Disasters 

					Storm is one of the most frequent and severe natural disasters, year after year,
					it has brought to our society great loss of life and property and caused a lot of
					structural damage and destruction, serious impact on our economic and social activities.
					Cyclone has characteristics of high frequency, secondary disasters (such as rain,
					waves, storm surges, floods, mudslides, etc.), duration, etc. In the second half
					of the 20th century statistical results showed that among the top ten worldwide natural
					disasters storms occurred most frequently, accounting for 51% of the total number
					of disasters; death toll caused by the storm, about 41%; economic loss caused by
					the storm, about 40%. Among 2005, World top ten natural disasters are two storms,
					of which the United States "Katrina" Hurricane caused damaged houses, collapsed bridges
					and inundated city, traffic disruption, leading to direct economic losses of about
					2000 people were killed and economic loss upto more than $ 200 billions. 

					China is one of the world's handful countries worst affected by the cyclone. Our
					country is located in the West Coast of the Pacific North-west, the whole world.
					Most severe tropical cyclones typhoons are mostly generated in the Pacific North-west,
					and North-west or West along the path, had direct hit China's Guangxi, Guangdong,
					Hainan, Taiwan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Tianjin, Liaoning,
					more than 10 coastal provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, and that hurricane
					frequency high average annual Typhoon that landed in China's coastal areas is 7,
					6 Severe storm surge causing disasters. In 20054 of the top ten natural disasters
					in China are storms, causing a direct economic loss of 55.1 billion Yuan, accounting
					for about ten two-thirds total losses from natural disasters. According to the World
					Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Typhoon Committee 1985~1997 annual report,
					China's average economic loss caused by a hurricane is 7.3 times that of Japan, 10.2
					times of Philippines, 12.3 times Korea, 22.3 times Viet Nam; the average total number
					of casualties and missing due to the Typhoon is 7.6 times that of the Philippines
					19.3 times of Vietnam, 42 times of Japan. 

					On 7 November, 1940, the United States main span of 853 m completed in just over
					4 months, Washington (then the world's second largest span) the Tacoma Narrow Bridge
					was vibrated in gale with wind speed less than 20 m/s wind-induced vibration, the
					bridge has experienced increasing amplitude 70 min of torsional vibration, and ultimately
					result in broken bridge structure fell into the Gorge frame as shown in Fig. 5.1.
					The terrible accident of winds destroying the bridge of Tacoma strongly shocked bridge
					engineering and air mechanical industry, and opened a comprehensive study on wind-induced
					vibration of long span bridge and Aero-elastic theoretical exercise. However, accident
					investigation gather historical information about bridge wind destroyed for reasons,
					people are surprised to find, from 1818 onwards, there have been at least 11 bridges
					destroyed by strong winds, and witnesses described scenes of wind damage can be clearly
					felt that much of the cause of the accident was caused by a wind strong vibration,
					although the mechanism of wind-induced vibration was unknown.

						vibration; (b) Deck break fall. 

3. Wind-resistance Principles 

					When the wind encounters structures it converts some of its kinetic energy to external
					forces acting on the structures of power, this force is so-called wind loads. When
					the wind around generally non-streamlined (bluff) section of the bridge structure,
					generates vortices and flow separation, forming the complex of the air force. When
					the bridge span is small (200 m), when the stiffness, the structure is insured stationary,
					air acts as only the force of static, or static wind load, which includes average
					wind and pulsing wind load; and when the larger span of bridge structures (200 m),
					the less the stiffness makes it easier for structural vibration excited, this static
					characteristics of species not only has the effect of wind and dynamic characteristics,
					or dynamic wind loads. 

					Wind dynamics inspires bridge vibration, the vibration of the bridge, in turn, affect
					the flow of air, change air force formation of wind-structure interaction mechanism.
					When the vibration caused by air force small, air force as a force, leading to finite
					amplitude forced vibration of bridge structures, including vortex-induced vibration
					of bridge buffeting and bridge when air force under the influence of strong vibration,
					the air force subject to vibration feedback structure is characterised by a self-excited
					force, resulting in divergence of self-excited vibration of bridge structures, including
					flutter and vortex resonance. Effects of wind loads of bridge structure and its classification
					can be represented by Fig. 5.2. In addition, the cables of the cable-stayed bridge
					in the wind or rain occurs in different forms under the action of vibration, vortex-induced
					vibration of stay cable for example, parameters such as vibration, the vibration
					of wake galloping and rain. 



Fig. 5.2 Effects of wind loads of bridge structure and its classification. 

					According to the code for wind-resistant design of highway bridge (JTG/T D6001-2004),
					and wind-resistant design of bridge structure compliance with the following principles:
					may be appear in the bridge's design life of maximum wind speed, structure should
					not ruin a divergent self-excited vibration in the most adverse design wind load
					combinations together with the other functions, should have the required strength
					and stiffness of structures and static instability should not occur; non-destructive
					wind-induced vibration of amplitude of the structure should meet safely, driving
					comfort and fatigue strength requirements of structural wind-resistance by aerodynamic
					measures, structural measures and measures to improve it. 

					Wind-resistant design principles in order to carry out, in conceptual design of bridge
					structure while there is no need for a wind tunnel test method or simulation evaluation
					of wind-resistance performance test results and overall, but still can be arranged
					through the structure and components of fully embody the idea of wind-resistant design,
					chief among them included decrease static wind loads and wind-induced vibration and
					additional control measures. 

					5.1.2 Reduce the Static Wind Load 

					Any object immersed in flow are affected by airflow, airflow to bypass the usually
					non-streamlined or bluff-body section bridge structure, generates static wind load
					of the three components, as shown in Fig. 5.3, the FD or static wind load resistance
					components FH and the static wind load lift component FN or FL MT and static wind
					load lifting moment components, it can be expressed as follows: 







					In the formula: 




ρ =
air mass density, 1.225 kg/m3; 

u =
 design wind speed (m/s) average wind load average wind speed, gust loads calculated
					using gusts; 

B, H =
 vertical and lateral projection width (m); 

CL, CD  =
 lift and drag co-efficients in the axial direction; 

CN, CH =
 lift and drag co-efficients body in the axial direction; 

CM =
 lift moment co-efficient. 


					Structure defined by the above three formulas three components of the static wind
					load, and design wind speed, cross-sections and dimensions of the three factors.
					Design basic wind speed, wind speed is determined by site conditions such as roughness
					and the height from the ground. In order to reduce the static wind load, bridge site
					should be an area with small base wind speed; under the same basic wind speed, the
					greater the surface roughness, smaller average wind speed, wind speed/gusts greater
					average wind speed increases with height above ground, but wind speed decrease with
					increasing height off the ground. Section types and dimensions of static wind loads
					according to the main beams and arches ribs, piers and towers, main cables and cables
					and other components were also be discussed. 



Fig. 5.3 Wind and body axes coordinates under static wind load. 

1. The Main Girder and Arch Ribs 

					Section size and structure of main girder and arch ribs have large effects on static
					wind load . From a general point of view, section close to streamline smaller the
					static wind load and vice-versa section which is similar to a bluff body, greater
					the static wind load. Effect of static wind load set out the main structural dimensions
					are width and height of the main beam or arch rib section, the aspect ratio is greater,
					smaller the static wind load, on the contrary, width and height smaller than static
					wind load greater. 



Fig. 5.4 Pouring of concrete box girder. 

Figure 5.4 shows the six commonly used concrete girder, in which, as in Fig. 5.4(a)
					minimum static wind load in the form, as shown in Fig. 5.4(f) Secondly, since the
					aspect ratio is a large, close to streamline; as in Fig. 5.4(b) maximum static wind
					load in the form, as shown in Fig. 5.4(c) second, because the small ratio of width
					to height, near bluff. 

Figure 5.5 shows the six solid web steel girder, among them, 5.5(a), (b), (c) and
					(e) forms of static wind load, as in the latter vertical webs close to the bluff
					body; 5.5(d), (f) form of static wind loads small, streamlined skew web better. 



Fig. 5.5 Solid Web steel girder. 

Figure 5.6 shows four types of steel box girder, in which 5.6(b) form of static wind
					load minimum maximum height-width ratio. 

Figure 5.6(a), (c) forms of static wind load followed, both are similar, because
					the beam is large, but you have set the long wind up, which although not set the
					wind up, but small beam; 5.6(d) form of split-type steel box girder and static wind
					load is slightly greater than the above three forms, but wind-induced flutter stability
					of performance is especially. 



Fig. 5.6 The main beam section (size: m). 

					Arch typically have two or more than two tablets of arch rib, rib-section section
					compared with the width is much smaller. Role in each arch can be ignored as the
					static wind load on components of lift moment, leaving the drag and lift components
					depends primarily on the most lateral arch and its high profile, and each piece of
					the arch rib of the drag and lift forces is not the same. Reduce the static wind
					load is mainly increase lateral arch outline consisting of aspect ratio, or the use
					of arch rib section angle measure application of section to streamline. 

2. The Piers and the Bridge Tower 

					Piers and the bridge tower are usually vertical components: on the one hand, this
					kind of vertical component along the vertical section change of wind speed size is
					changed, so static wind load along the height variation is more complex on the other,
					this kind of vertical cross-section of the aspect ratio compared with the main beam
					is small, lift and the lift moment components can generally be ignored, so the static
					weight resistance to wind loads considering only a relatively simple as that. Piers
					and towers of static wind loads generally refers to a high component of wind resistance,
					simple geometric shape section of bridge pier and Tower of wind drag co-efficient
					can refer to Table 5.2.

					When piers or height of the bridge towers static, wind load will be very large, sometimes

3. The Main Cable and Cable 

					Of suspension bridge main cables and slings and cables in cable-stayed bridge, although
					generally possess a streamlined circular section, but they are still affected by
					static wind load effect, as with piers and towers, has only resistance component
					need to be considered. 

					Modern parallel wire strands of long span suspension bridge main cables are generally
					made from steel wire, wire harness unit consisting of (strand), and consists of several
					beam unit into a main cable. With preformed parallel wire beam unit method (PPWS)
					beams tend to follow a regular hexagon line, common types of steel wire unit number
					61, 91, 127, 169, composed of hexagons of shape stability. This arrangement can be
					facilitate beyond construction, you can also minimise the beam unit with the beam
					between the strands of the void, aim to reduce the cross-section diameter of the
					rope. Wind resistance co-efficient of main cables of suspension bridges in general
					constant, single main cable can take the value 0.7, so the outer diameter is smaller,
					static wind-resistance the smaller, proportional relation between them. 



Fig. 5.9 The main types of cable-stayed bridge (a) steel cable; (b) parallel wire
						strands; (c) strand clue; (d) single strand. 

					Is used in cable-stayed bridge cable general cables must be made with high strength
					reinforcing bars, steel wire or strand. Main cable type high-strength steel cables,
					parallel wire rope, PC strand thread, single strand, as shown in Fig. 5.9. At present,
					in large-span cable-stayed bridge parallel wire strands, and are most commonly used
					in steel strand leads two parallel wire strands of smaller voids, so the outer diameter
					of the same intensity less wind-resistance is relatively small; conversely, strand
					leads voids larger, so the large outer diameter, wind resistance is relatively large.
					Due to the influence of Reynolds number effect and cable than static wind-resistance
					co-efficient of main cables of suspension bridges, and general range of 0.8~1.0.
					

					5.1.3 Reduce Wind-induced Vibration 

					Bridge structure due to different bridge, span and materials, and produces various
					forms of wind-induced vibration of its main components, large-span girders of cable-stayed
					and suspension bridge would be flutter, galloping, buffeting, vortex-induced vibration
					and wind-induced vibrations, long-span arch bridge arch rib of a bluff body truncated
					vortex-induced vibration is raised, steel pylons for cable-supported bridges may
					be easily lead to galloping and vortex-induced vibration and long wind-induced vibration
					of cables of cable-stayed bridges and weather exciting possibilities, suspension
					bridges and wind vibration of arch bridge suspenders also has problems. 

					Above wind-induced vibration and flutter, galloping is self-excited vibration of
					two divergent, according to wind-resistant design principles must be completely avoided,
					and vortex-induced vibration is a large amplitude vibrations, both a self-excited
					vibration and forced vibration characteristics of bridge wind-resistance design principle
					calls for stiffness requirements; rain-wind induced vibration of cables is a self-induced
					vibrations of large amplitude, it should meet certain strength and stiffness requirement;
					else buffeting and vibration is non-destructive forced vibration of finite amplitude,
					will not cause the bridge broken bad, as long as the traffic safety and driving comfort
					and fatigue strength. 

					Bridge conceptual design stage, in order to improve wind-resistance performance implement
					the concept of reduction of wind-induced vibration, mostly on the main beam or beams
					flutter, galloping, vortex-induced vibration of arch ribs, cables, such as rain-wind
					induced vibration of divergent or self-excited vibrations of large amplitude, and
					other limited vibration non-destructive forced-vibration sites can be taken into
					account in the subsequent design stages. 

1. Main Beams Flutter and Galloping 

					Flutter is a destructive torsion or bending and torsional coupling divergent self-excited
					vibration when it reaches a critical wind velocity, vibration girders moving by air
					feedback continue to absorb energy to overcome structure damping results in increase
					of amplitude gradually until the structure destruction, flutter can occur in almost
					any form of girder, just flutter critical wind velocity of different sizes. Galloping
					is a destructive horizontal divergence of self-excited vibration of the bending in
					the wind, was mainly caused by the lift curve slope, galloping occur in non-circular
					side-length ratio is less than 4 blunt body similar to the rectangular components,
					seldom in the long-span bridges this height-width ratio of the main beam. 

					Judge flutter instability of bridge, or the standard is whether bridge flutter testing
					wind speed is greater than the critical wind speed of flutter, which is design basis
					multiplied by the correction factor of wind speed wind speed and safety factor of
					a standard, the latter generally use segment models or full bridge model wind tunnel
					test and theoretical calculation method to determine flutter. Bridge conceptual design
					phase typically can be used code for design of highway bridge wind (JTG/T D60-01-2004),
					the estimation formula of critical wind speed of flutter of a preliminary the evaluation,
					which also contribute to the analysis of main factors affecting the critical wind
					speed of flutter. 



					In the formula:




b =
half-bridge width, b = B/2; 

ft =
 bridge torsional vibration frequency (Hz); 

m, Im =
 bridge of equivalent mass (kg/m) and the mass moment of inertia (kg · m2/m);


ηs, ηα =
 section shape co-efficient, effect co-efficient and angle of attack, and
					can refer to the values in Table 5.5.

					Estimation formula of critical wind speed of flutter (5-4) showed that flutter critical
					wind speed effect of section shape factors (including the damping ratio), angle of
					effect factor, main beam and mass moment of inertia and torsional frequency, and
					so on. Among them, the damping is relatively large, streamlined good section, has
					a higher flutter critical wind speed; -3° or +3° attack angle flutter critical wind
					speed of less than 0° angle of attack increases main beam equivalent mass or mass
					moment of inertia can be help improve flutter critical wind speed, but the effect
					is limited, just a relationship of one-fourth power increase reversed the fundamental
					frequency of bridge, flutter critical wind speed can improve. 

					Bridge conceptual design phase, in addition to judging by these four factors or improving
					flutter stability of bridges, you can also use bridge has been completed and the
					performance of dynamic characteristics and chatter, a simple comparison to design
					bridges or contrast. Tables 5.6 and 5.7 respectively 10 has built structural properties
					of a typical cable-stayed and suspension bridge the natural frequency and vibration
					critical wind speed of flutter, concept design for long-span bridges.

2. The Primary Beam or Arch Ribs of Vortex-induced Vibration 

					Airflow typically blunt body when sections of bridge structural members, separation
					and re-attachment flow formation of vortex shedding occurs, resulting in alternating
					the vortex force, when the vortex shedding frequency is close to or equal to order
					natural frequencies of a structure, it will be bring out the structure of the vortex
					vibration, called vortex-induced vibration. Vortex-induced vibration will not cause
					the entire structure like a flutter, galloping on divergent vibration, resulting
					in dynamic power failure, but when the vortex-induced vibration frequency is close
					to the natural frequency, also appears larger amplitude, formation of vortex-excited
					resonance, this combination of characteristics of self-excited and forced vibration
					comfort and driving problems caused by light, severe cases may be cause deformation
					of the structure is too large, even strength. 

					Vortex-induced vibration in lower wind speed range of limited amplitude. When wind
					speed is low, frequency of vortex-induced vibration less affected by vortex frequency
					and flow velocity has a simple linear relationship between as the wind speed increases,
					vortex frequencies and amplitudes step-by-step increases when the vortex frequency
					is close to the natural frequency, amplitude, reach the vortex-excited resonance
					states, at this moment, vibrational state, in turn, controls the frequency of vortex
					makes a range of wind speeds change cannot change the vortex frequency, which is
					characteristic of vortex-induced vibration the frequency of "locked", the corresponding
					wind speed range, called vortex-induced vibration lock the wind speed. 

					Evaluation of vortex-excited resonance occurs there are three main indicators: first,
					the vortex-induced vibration lock the wind speed, the vortex-induced vibration velocity
					only if vortex-induced vibration lock the wind speed is less than the required design
					wind speed into account vortex-induced vibration problem for large-span cable-supported
					bridges, vortex-induced vibration locked wind speeds generally between 5~20 m/s;
					maximum amplitude of vortex vibration, which corresponds to a maximum amplitude of
					first order modal, highway wind-resistant design code of bridge (JTG/T D60-01-2004),
					vortex-excited resonance amplitude estimation formula is given, but it is recommended
					to segment model wind tunnel test as the standard, specification of vortex-excited
					resonance amplitudes are presented simultaneously allowed values, must-ensure that
					the maximum amplitude is less than the acceptable third, vortex-induced vibration
					frequency, which is associated with the economic indicators, theoretically speaking,
					if the vortex-induced vibration lock the wind speed less than design basic wind speed,
					and vortex-induced vibration of maximum amplitude is greater than the allowed value,
					it is necessary to consider the vortex-induced vibration control measures, but considering
					use of vortex-induced vibration control measures have to pay the economic price,
					recent advances show that can happen based on the vortex-induced vibration frequency
					analysis on bridge design reference period first vortex-induced vibration frequency
					and the cumulative time in vortex-induced vibration of two indicators to determine
					the need for vortex-induced vibration of control measures. 

					According to the main girder of cable-supported bridges and latest progress of the
					study on vortex-induced vibration of long-span arch, based on theoretical analysis
					and model test and field measurements have been found to have varying degrees of
					vortex-induced vibration of famous bridges: Denmark Sea Bridge suspension bridge,
					Stonecutters Bridge in Hong Kong stayed Shanxi Hou bridge suspension bridge, boat,
					Shanghai Lupu arch bridge, and so on. 

3. Cable Rain-wind-induced Vibration 

					Long cables in cable-stayed bridges under wind and rain conditions vibration that
					occurs, called rain-wind induced vibration of stay cable, causing the vibration main
					cause is rain on the cable surface forming a line or the rain or rain up and down
					line. At present, the specification is still not on this type of vibration clear
					provisions on the issue. Cable section model wind tunnel test results show that the
					cables in the wind and rain conditions vibrations than the dry wind (no rain) under
					the condition of vibration is much more intense. 

					According to the latest research advances, influence of rain-wind-induced vibration
					has three main factors: first, the cable orientation may generally be represented
					by inclination and declination, although in 25°~45° inclination and declination of
					amplitudes have some differences, but all have been, and this inclination and declination
					range cannot be avoided by the vast majority of cable-stayed bridges and, second,
					size of cable, which includes diameter and length, wind tunnel tests showed 80 mm
					diam, 200 m rain-wind induced vibration can occur above the length of the cable,
					the range of diameters and lengths are the vast majority of large-span cable-stayed
					bridges (400 m span) must be face the third, vibration of wind and rain conditions
					generally been represented by strong winds and rain, wind tunnel test results show
					that the wind speeds and rainfall intensity of 5~15 m/s and 5~60 mm/h caused by rain-wind
					induced vibration of cables, the wind speed and rainfall intensities are also often
					occur in the majority of rainfall. Therefore, large long rain-wind induced vibration
					of cables of long-span cable-stayed bridge's problem is a common bridge designers
					have to face wind resistance performance problems conceptual design phase should
					be considered as early as possible counter measures. 

					5.1.4 Additional Control Measures 

					According to the code for wind resistant design of highway bridge (JTG/T D60-01-2004),
					and wind-resistant design of bridge structure requirements of structural wind resistance
					by aerodynamic measures, structural measures and measures to improve it. Aerodynamic
					measures mentioned here mainly refers to change components of cross section shape
					or attach can alter air flow pattern around the appendages, such as stable plates,
					deflectors, skirt, wind nozzles, slots, because this method of structural change
					is small, lower economic costs, commonly known as the first choice for additional
					control measures; knot frame measures mainly refers to the increased rigidity of
					the structure or the quality and structure of external or internal constraints such
					as approach, which generally require pay a larger price, in conjunction with structural
					changes when considering the overall programme; mechanical measures refers to adding
					damping includes passive dampers and active damper and semi-active dampers, such
					as main beam of vortex-induced vibration and wind-induced vibration control of bridge
					tower passive dampers, lasuofeng TMD vibration control of semi-active damper, internal
					or external cable rain-wind-induced vibration control of magnetorheological fluid
					dynamic dampers. Will focus on the following main beam flutter control of main girder
					of aerodynamic measures, or arch ribs of aerodynamic measures and vortex-induced
					vibration control of cables vibration control of aerodynamic measures. 

1. The Flutter Control of Main Girder of Aerodynamic Measures 

					To illustrate the necessity of flutter control of main girder, presented in Table
					5.8 currently has completed 10 of the world's largest cross-suspension bridge, 5
					of bridge flutter or a vortex-induced vibration problem has arisen. According to
					recent study on wind-resistance of long-span bridge and building established practice,
					irrespective of streamlined steel box girder is steel truss beam with good ventilation,
					the traditional ceiling flutter stability of long span suspension bridges about 1500
					m, when even close to this limit is exceeded, designers must consider used flutter
					control measures improved aerodynamic stability; Flutter control of aerodynamic measures
					stiffening girder of suspension bridge main central stable boards, slotted or split
					box girder, stabilising plate and slotted combined, these measures can be guarantee
					suspension bridge main span of 5000 m flutter critical wind speed is high enough
					to meet the world wind in areas prone to wind-resistance requirements.

2. The Flutter Control of Main Girder of Aerodynamic Measures 

					With the increase in recent years of large-span bridge span, in addition to the main
					beams flutter problems, main beam or arch of vortex-induced vibration problem more
					and more, previously mentioned in the vortex-induced vibration problem of several
					famous bridges 
					in the world. In fact, the typical bridge vortex-induced vibration reasonable solutions
					to their problems, and eventually settled on pneumatic control measures in the future
					has a good model of vortex-induced vibration control of long-span bridges used. For
					this reason, Fig. 5.11 depicts several bridges the vortex-induced vibration of pneumatic
					control measures, for example, Denmark Sea Bridge and Hong Kong stonecutters Bridge
					is using principles similar to the spoiler, Zhou Hou men bridge deck wind barrier
					measures have been adopted in Shanxi, Shanghai Lupu bridge baffle wall plate is used.

3. Vibration Control of Aerodynamic Measures 

					As the main cause of rain-wind-induced vibration of stay cable is cable surface form
					the rain line, thus changing the cables was originally non-streamlined circular section,
					so rain-wind induced vibration of cables of the most effective methods of control
					should be the formation of rain can damage the surface line measures. After a great
					deal of wind tunnel test and field test, mainly through pneumatic controls there
					are two, that is wrapped on the cable surface around the Helix (5.12A) or engraving
					irregular pits (5.12B), these two methods can effectively reduces the amplitude to
					allowed values (L/1700) range. 



Fig. 5.12 Vibration control of aerodynamic measures. (a) Winding spiral; (b) Engraving
						irregular pits. 

					In addition to rain-wind induced vibration of cables using aerodynamic measures of
					control, auxiliary cable for cable measures can effectively reduce rain-induced vibration
					and other vibrations, such as the Normandy bridge, but the measures are rarely used,
					mainly because the secondary cables and cable connections difficulties. In addition,
					if you can improve the cable damping can achieve the purpose of vibration control,
					increase the lasuozu can be used based on different mechanisms for damper, oil damper
					and viscous shear damper and friction damper, high damping rubber damper and electricity,
					magnetic dampers. 

					5.2 BRIDGE WIND RESISTANT DESIGN PHILOSOPHY 

					As with wind-resistant design of bridges, bridges including theoretical analysis,
					seismic design and analysis and shaking table test and numerical simulation of earthquake
					damage investigation, but at the concept design stage, generally does not allow for
					refinement of the seismic design and analysis, so build bridges located meter idea
					is particularly important. In order to implement the concept of seismic design of
					bridges, first, I had to learn the basic characteristics of earthquake ground motions—Magnitude
					and intensity, Bridge Seismic damage and aseismic design method, which will be introduced
					in the first part of the earthquake and seismic; Secondly, the need to be familiar
					with a variety of bridge seismic design principles, part II briefly introduces four
					beam bridges, arch bridges, cable-stayed bridge, a suspension bridge kind type of
					structure dynamic characteristic and seismic response characteristic and aseismic
					design principle, and requires an understanding of domestic and international bridges
					case studies in order to draw them in the conceptual design, and application and
					development of, and the third part focuses on the structure, load-bearing structures
					and foundation case; and, finally, two vibration reduction measures to understand
					the common—dampers and bearings, part IV including damper and vibration reduction,
					locking device and buffer supports. 

					5.2.1 Earthquake and Anti-seismic 

					Earthquakes are the results of crustal rocks sudden rupture due to tectonic stress
					concentration accumulated in the Earth's crust, earthquakes can be graded with magnitude
					of intensity and size. Earthquake particularly strong results for bridge damage is
					enormous, which generally included on earthquake damage to structures, support and
					ancillary facilities such as earthquake damage and earthquake damage to structures
					in the lower part. Learn bridge seismic design code for various types of bridge seismic
					design principles, mastering various types of bridge seismic analysis results and
					on the basis of experience, can help us in read design, clear requirements for fortification,
					on consideration of seismic performance of more focused conceptual design. 

1. Earthquake 

					Earthquakes are a natural phenomenon caused by the Earth's internal structure movement.
					In strata movement, more dramatic break bad sport, can cause tremors, on above-ground
					or underground buildings in different levels of earthquake damage, and led to loss
					of life and damage to property. 

					Size of seismic vibration can be described by two indicators, namely, their magnitude
					and intensity. The former is a measure of earthquake size indicators, usually with
					the maximum amplitude (Table 5.9) or source release of strain energy (Table 5.10)
					to represent, whereas the latter is used to indicate seismic degree of impact on
					surface and building, it not only with the release of seismic energy, depth and distance
					from the epicentre, and engineering geological condition and seismic wave propagation
					characteristics of a building and so on, the rules of the seismic design of highway
					bridges (JTG/TB02-01-2008) provides seismic fortification intensity of relations
					and horizontal design Basic acceleration of ground motion as shown in Table 5.11.

					2. Earthquake Disasters 

					Earthquake disasters have been recorded in history as early as there is a record
					of strong earthquakes often cause surface changes, such as topography, and landslides
					and liquefaction facility damage and fires, floods, pollution, disease and other
					secondary disasters caused by human or animal casualties and socio-economic loss.
					

					Bridges without the reasonable seismic design will be lead to serious damage in the
					quake. Turns out, both at home and abroad because of the number of bridge structural
					damage caused by the earthquake, far more than by storms, ship collision damage caused
					by other reasons such as. For example, in China in the 1975, haicheng earthquake
					in China, 618 bridges in earthquake regions in the 193-seat suffered varying degrees
					of damage, accounting for about 31% in the 1976 Tangshan earthquake, suffered earthquake
					damage of railway bridges accounted for 39%, Tangshan earthquake disaster of highway
					bridge 62%, earthquake damage to highway bridge in Tianjin 21%; in the 2008 Wenchuan
					earthquake, there are 6 different types of bridge-more than 6000 square beam structure
					subjected to earthquake disaster, about 10% of them were badly damaged or collapsed,
					needs to rebuild after demolition. According to bridges disaster investigation, seismic
					damage of main bridge structure is reflected in various parts of the structure, and
					can follow the structure from top to bottom is divided into earthquake damage to
					structures, support and ancillary facilities such as earthquake damage and earthquake
					damage to structures in the lower part. Earthquake damage to superstructure, bridge
					or arch bridge upper structure subjected to earthquake damage and destroyed rare,
					often by other parts of the bridge structure damage caused by breakage of the girder
					and arch, such as caused by adjacent girders colliding beam end and deck structural
					damage in the vicinity of the department, and so on. When sliding displacement of
					earthquake damage beyond the pier when the bearing surface, it would have been serious
					the falling beams (Fig. 5.13). 

					The earthquake, bearing of Bridge Seismic damage is extremely popular and has long
					been considered a weakness on the seismic performance of bridge. Damage was mainly
					for pot bearing anchoring bolts were pulled out, cut or shear failure of the bearing
					itself, plate bearing is pushed out, cut or cut-out damage (Fig. 5.14). In addition,
					bridge ancillary facilities block masonry shear or cut-tension-bending damage joints
					horizontal shear failure occurs, vertical or horizontal tension and compression shear
					failure damaged railings can also occur lateral deformation, deformation and failure
					of the vertical or horizontal tensile failure, and so on. 

					Substructure or the serious damage of bridge pier and abutment is mainly due to soil
					liquefaction, ground subsidence and slope slip or break causing, the main earthquake
					damage included bridge abutment pier cracks, cracks, joints cracked, serious results
					in pier collapse (Fig. 5.15).

3. Bridge Aseismatic Design Method 

					The seismic design of highway bridges regulations (JTG/T B02-01-2008) earthquake
					provisions according to the various types of bridges categories and their corresponding
					target for fortification, as shown in Table 5.12. The bridge seismic design category
					in the table are as follows: type a, 150 m extra large bridge with single span; Class
					b is a single-span span no more than 150 m on the highway, highway bridges span no
					more than 150 m of single span bridge on secondary roads, bridges; Class c is a secondary
					Highway in the bridge, bridge, single span diameter not exceeding 150 m of category
					IV road, bridge, bridge; d Category is the category IV Bridge, the bridge on the
					highway.

					Set forth in the rules for the seismic design of highway bridges using the principle
					of two levels of fortification, two-stage design. The first phase anti-seismic designs,
					the elastic seismic design; the second phase of the seismic design ductility seismic
					design methods, and capable of protecting designs principle. Through the first phase
					of the seismic design, which correspond to E1 earthquake seismic design can achieve
					similar levels and original specifications earthquake fortification level. Through
					the second phase of the earthquake-resistant design of the corresponding E2 earthquake
					seismic design to ensure the structure adequate ductility capacity, by checking to
					ensure structural ductility capacity is greater than the ductility demand. Design
					by introducing the ability to protect the original then, ensure that the plastic
					hinge in the selected location appear, and there is no shear damage failure modes.
					By aseismic measures set meter, ensure that the displacement of the structure with
					sufficient capacity. 

					The seismic design of highway bridges rules according to the complexity of dynamic
					response under earthquake excitation, bridge structural dynamic response calculation
					of bridge structures subjected to earthquake-resistant design and verification will
					be divided into two broad categories, namely, rules bridge rules and non-bridge.
					Among them, the rules of bridge beam is the largest single span is less than or equal
					to 90 m, and Pier height is less than or equal to 30 m bridge, bridge seismic rules
					must in strict accordance with the rules in addition to all the other bridges, including
					do not satisfy the conditions of beam bridges, arch bridges, cable-stayed bridges,
					hanging bridges and other bridges are non-rules, rules only irregular bridge seismic
					design principles are given, including seismic concept design provisions. 

					5.2.2 Bridge Anti-Seismic Principles 

					While bridge because of its span, scantlings and based in a different form, exhibit
					different seismic response, however, the same type of bridge exist in dynamic characteristics
					and seismic response of some rules to understand these rules and characteristics,
					it helps in conceptual design by doing some basic judgement. In addition, knowledge
					of bridge seismic design principle, during the conceptual design phase is also very
					important. 

1. The Beam Bridge 

					Bridges can be divided into irregular bridges and bridge rules, but no matter what
					kind of dynamic characteristics and seismic response of bridges are familiar with
					the. Seismic design concerned may be refer to the rules for the seismic design of
					highway bridges, among them, the most important thing is should try to use a symmetrical
					structure, connections between superstructure and substructure construction be as
					symmetrical as possible. 

2. Arch Bridge 

					Arch bridge is a compression arch rib of component—as a major component of the bridge,
					and so determine the span cannot be very large, structure stiffness is very small.
					Structure dynamic characteristics and seismic responses in the light of the rules
					for the seismic design of highway bridges are analysed. The most important anti-seismic
					design principles are important: built in areas of seismic fortification intensity
					8 or 9 degrees of long-span arch bridge, the torsional strength of main arch ring
					should be used good stiffness, the overall cross-section; when using reinforced concrete
					arch, and must strengthen horizontal links in the lower deck and arch wind support
					should be set, and the beam rigidity should be strengthened. 

3. Cable-stayed Bridge 

					Frequency and vibration mode characteristics of cable-stayed bridge and its rigidity
					and quality-related, such as closed-box girder with vertical deflection frequency
					of open cross-section height. The others under the same conditions, of harp-type
					cable arrangement of vertical deflection frequency will be lower for radial arrangement.
					Large span cable-stayed bridge is a long-period structure, its first mode—floating
					vertical vibration on seismic response of main tower along the bridge to the tribute
					offering an absolute advantage. Floating structural system of cable-stayed bridge
					in the largest contribution to the transverse seismic response of the tower is the
					main tower vibration modes (transverse vibrations of transverse vibration of symmetric
					and anti-symmetric). 

					From the seismic requirements, wish to structure flexible. Vibration of flexible
					structures because long seismic response of a smaller, but the displacement reactions
					great and should be attract attention. Built on the seismic fortification intensity
					8 or 9 degrees of cable-stayed bridge should be a priority in the area of floating
					system; floating system resulted in large beam the nodal displacements, we should
					use the tower, elastic or damping constraint system. 

4. Suspension Bridge 

					Due to the suspension, bridge is a flexible structure, with floating structural system
					of cable-stayed bridge as the basic cycle is very long and is thus subject to earthquake
					load control can be small. However, the vertical earthquake component on stiffening
					girder, effects of bending moment of beam main tower, tower, the effects of axial
					force of piles shall be pay attention to. Relative displacements between the girders
					and beams is another characteristic of flexible structures. Ensure the role of expansion
					joints, located reset the block, damping bearing, are better measures for reducing
					relative displacement, to prevent falling beams. Main load-bearing structure, the
					towers should be choices helps to improve the structure and volume of ductile deformation
					capacity and avoid the occurrence of brittle failure. 

					5.2.3 Anti-seismic Design Success Stories 

					In areas of high seismic intensity and seismic response factors that tend to control
					the design of the structure, so, in concept design, the overall vision of the structure,
					structural system, forms the basis of planning must take into account its seismic
					behaviour and seismic system, easy access to good structural performance; on the
					contrary, is not conducive to seismic system, in order to meet the seismic loading
					carrying capacity, sometimes takes a huge price. Therefore, the conceptual design
					is of course due to the earthquake on seismic performance of structures needed innovation
					plays an important role in the concept. 

1. Select the Seismic Favourable Structural System 

					Most of the mass is concentrated in the upper part of the structure of the bridge,
					and seismic inertial forces are also concentrated in the upper structure. The upper
					structure of seismic inertial force through connections between superstructure and
					substructure construction (support) to the pier, and then passed by the pier to the
					base foundation. For example, three-span continuous girder bridge with large span,
					under normal circumstances, a pier supporting system, able to cope with temperature
					degree, required for normal use such as vehicle loading and deformation, however,
					seismic response, massive beams of the seismic data stress transfer to the pier and
					foundation of a pier appears unreasonable and uneconomical in bear, from conceptual
					design ideas would like to have such a system: normal use is a pier supporting system
					for when the earthquake struck, four piers shared beams seismic reaction forces.
					This similar concept of problems will require design-time to think and find a solution.
					

Example 5.1 Greece Rion-Antirion Bridge: "reinforced earth base isolation." Design:
					vertical and transverse floating cable-stayed bridge system. 

					The bridge (Fig. 5.16) connecting Greece Mainland and Peloponnese peninsula, between
					the Gulf of Corinth. Bridge is located in bedrock depth ultra 500 m, 2000 year return
					period earthquake with maximum peak acceleration of 1. 2 g, and the peninsula of
					8~11 mm, the rate float away land and seismic safety is the most important controlling
					factors. 



Fig. 5.16 Rion-antirion Bridge (size: m). 

					In order to avoid displacement of great earthquakes and Taki, selects five of the
					bridge span continuous floating structural system of cable-stayed bridges, superstructures
					for girder bridge, between the pier and beam transverse directions how to connect?
					If you like float system cable-stayed bridge, between the transverse taliang replaced
					by wind-resistant connection, Tower's Foundation during the earthquake forced to
					fail. If this connection is released, main beams and the top horizontal displacement,
					cable tower base forces were too large. Finally, the taliang transverse direction
					is set between five additional mechanical device when an earthquake occurs allowing
					the middle insurance limit device in a certain damage under earthquake loads, and
					the remaining four dampers will be play the role of damping to protect the bridge
					tower security and main beam lateral seismic displacement constraint. Usually, side-wind
					effects, insurance limit device to ensure that horizontal and pylon of the bridge-solid
					will be connected together (similar to the wind resistant bearings), guarantee that
					no master Liang Hengqiao rock. Beam installed adaptive main beam vertical limit of
					displacement, lateral damping devices installation schematic in Fig. 5.17. 

Example 5.2 Main channel bridge of Su Tong bridge. 

Design: integrated static, wind and seismic analysis results, eventually adopted
					dampers (wind time) connection. 

					Su Tong bridge on the damping limit restriction system, a hydraulic buffer (power
					locked) limiting constraint system and the elastic system static and seismic response
					analysis of results, and compare responses of floating system, as shown in Table
					5.13 below. Table of seismic response of two number values are: North beam (Tower)/
					Liang Dynasty (Tower). Can be obtained from Table 5.13 to the following conclusions:
					longitudinal seismic damping constrained systems reaction is slightly larger than
					the lock binding system, much less than the float system, floating system of 40%;
					in the system of four structural damping constraint system of longitudinal shear
					force and bending moment at the end of minimum locking restraint system the largest
					damping constrained system of vertical bottom shear is a floating system of 86%,
					locking constraint 68%; damping constrained system of longitudinal tadi moments is
					a floating system of 76%, lock 66% restraint system (average of the North and South
					towers).

2. Improving the Load-bearing Structure Seismic Performance 

					As the main load-bearing structure of the tower, piers and arches can be designed
					with ductile deformation capacity of structures, resulting in earthquake energy dissipation
					through component under, such as sacrifice part of its detailed structure, achieve
					the goal of avoiding brittle failure. 

Example 5.3. United States San Francisco new Bay Bridge. 

Design idea: The seismic ductility design of Tower column. 

					San Francisco Bay Bridge East of the original bridge damaged in the 1989, earthquake
					in Montenegro, the Municipal Government decided to build a tower to meet seismic
					requirements of the new bridge. "Self-anchored suspension bridge" system with a main
					span of 385 m, tower height 180 m. Current concepts general prevailing notion that,
					at such a high intensity earthquake area, bridge-tower should be. In this way, the
					beams of the tower under earthquake to earthquake energy consumed can form a plastic
					hinge, making vertical pylon remains elastic. 

					During the preliminary design, the gantry tower and a single tower with different
					types of studies were carried out (Fig. 4.24). According to the calculation a single
					tower can meet current seismic design requirements, but the towers is not a statically
					indeterminate structure, once the plastic deformation will be lead to destruction,
					so that this type is not appropriate. However, despite these concerns, still the
					appearance of single tower therefore, studying how gantry tower looks more like a
					single tower. Move closer to the two towers, beam will be cut short, beam cut short,
					it not in bending yield but caved in under the cut. We asked ourselves, why not make
					it just under the shear yield? Such as make it just under the shear yield? If it
					doesn't look like the usual tower bends bend, but the shear yield the tower look like a single tower structure 



Fig. 5.18 Tower anti-seismic conceptual. 

					Thus, an innovative single-tower scheme surfaced, as shown in Fig. 5.19. Results
					indicate that this structure under earthquake action loaded with good performance,
					as shown in Fig. 4.26. In fact it is more excellent than conventional gantry tower,
					because now we can as needed in the two tower set between different positions more
					shear, thereby significantly increasing the frequency of bridge tower of statically
					indeterminate. 



Fig. 5.19 Towers-shear keys. 

3. The Design Earthquake Benefit of Bridge Foundation 

					First is passed from the base to the entire structure of the earthquake, so, for
					high intensity area, designed in line with geological conditions meets the water
					conditions, in line with the upper structure needs, in line with the basis for the
					construction equipment is not enough, it must also be based isolation capacity, keep
					a good shock, shock absorbing the first hurdle. Different forms, exhibit different
					reactions, how to enable the foundation to seismic responses of weakened or separated,
					sometimes addressing earthquake issues would be more effective in the superstructure,
					economy is more obvious. 

Example 5.4 Greece Rion-Antirion Bridge: "reinforced earth base isolation". 

Design: Reinforced earth, base isolation. 

					In order to avoid strong earthquake forces, Greece Rion-Antirion selection five-span
					continuous bridge full of floating structural system of cable-stayed bridge and high
					65 m, Pier and base diameter upto 90 m at the end of circular bridge piers in f 2
					m diameter, depth 25~30 m steel pipe piles with solid and topped with 3 m thick mat
					composed of sand, gravel and crushed stone layer, formed relative sliding of "reinforced
					earth base isolation" (reinforced soil Foundation), which is the Foundation of an
					innovative form, which is based on isolation as shown in Fig. 5.20. 



Fig. 5.20 Greece Rion-Antirion Bridge: "reinforced earth base isolation". 

					5.2.4 Common Seismic Mitigation and Isolation Measures 

					On the whole, considering the conceptual design of seismic resistance requirements
					and performance, in relation to meet seismic requirements must be have better performance,
					but, in many cases, the security situation and structural characteristics of, you
					also need to consider some of the needle anti-seismic measures relating to seismic
					response to some general or localised weaknesses, improve the conceptual design.
					Should be presented in conceptual design targeted measures and programmes. 

1. Dampers, Locking Device and Buffer 

					Structure or additional damping ductility of earthquake energy consumed, in order
					to reduce the loss of the main structure of the bridge. This form of shock-absorbing
					technology ever used in Su-Tong Yangtze River Bridge, in Greece the Rion-Antirion
					bridge has a similar device. Damping device of many types, from the relation of the
					output damping force and displacement curves are generally divided into viscous damping,
					friction resistance nepal, elasto-plastic damper and visco-elastic damping four,
					here's more application of viscous damping devices in recent years. 

Figure 5.21 shows the United States Taylor produced the viscous damping device schematic.
					



Fig. 5.21 Viscous damping devices. 1—piston rod; 2—cylinder; 3 and 4—compressible
						silicone oil; 5—accumulator tank; 6—seal rings; 7—polyvinyl resins; 8—room A; 9—damping
						hole live plugs and 10—room B; 11—control valve. 

					The output equation for viscous damping devices: 



					In the formula: F = damping force; 

C = damping coefficient; 

					α = speed index: for the bridge project, α 0.4~0.5 for low intensity earthquake area,
					α-2; to resist the wind-induced vibration of bridges, α 0.5~1. 

					Ideally this damping devices damping ratios range from 10% ~45%, damp from the 0.5~80
					MN, the journey from 25~1500 mm. 

					Locking device is a special damping devices, its locking force and velocity equations
					with damping devices similar to the device lock rated locking force is defined as
					the output of the transmission speed, and its value is less than the structure due
					to earthquakes, caused by wind-induced vibration velocity, speed is greater than
					the thermal displacement induced by locking speed mm/sec magnitude. 

					To lock the device in Fig. 5.22 comparison of damping and damping device output force-response
					curve, abscissa speed (in/s), ordinate for the output damping force (×103lb) and
					locking device locks the output equation: F = 40 × 106v, when v = 0.005 in/s, rated
					locking force, damping force equation is: F = 45730 × v0.4, v = 40 in/s, rated damping
					force as can be seen in the similarities between. 

					(Note: 1 in = 25.4 mm,1 lb = 4.448 2 N). 

					Here when the two constraints of the single particle vibration displacement curve
					description locking devices from conceptual difference and damper, Fig. 5.23 for
					the damping ratio is 32.6% single particle vibration displacement time history curve,
					Fig. 5.24 for the single particle under the effect of damping, lock set the pace
					for 30 mm/s of displacement time history curve. It can be seen that locking device
					for structure acts as a quick stop role of dampers for structural movements play
					a role in energy consumption and vibration attenuation.

2. A Variety of Seismic Isolation Bearings 

(a) Laminated Rubber Bearing 

					Laminated rubber bearing by alternating with thin steel plate and sheet rubber, and
					binding steel plate on lateral deformation of the rubber sheet, increased vertical
					stiffness of rubber, because of a hierarchical set of reasons, deformation of laminated
					rubber bearing level can greatly increase added system flexibility, improve cycle,
					but its rubber materials for special preparation, increase material viscosity, which
					absorbed energy and achieve the aim of cushioning. In the 1980s~90s, in the construction
					of small-span continuous beam bridge, laminated rubber bearings were widely used
					commonly, but with the increase of age, aging of the rubber bearings in the natural
					environment of restriction of its bridge applications. 

(b) Lead Rubber Bearing 

					Around the middle or center of rubber bearings vertically into the purity of 99.9%
					lead-on the formation of lead rubber bearing (Fig. 5.25). Support poured into the
					lead rods can be improve the bearing at the center of the early stiffness, to control
					the wind and against the foundation's micro-vibrations favour. The other hand, due
					to the lower yield strength of lead rods and elastic-plastic deformation conditions
					with good fatigue resistance the performance, which has a strong energy dissipation
					capacity. Although lead-bearing combines the characteristics of laminated rubber
					bearing with lead damper, seismic excitation has a lower level of stiffness and damping
					characteristics of the larger, but quite a number of applications showed that low
					frequency characteristics small amplitude excitation may be cause the amplification
					of the seismic response of lead-bearing system. Bridges with more flexible piers,
					its isolation effect is not very good. 



Fig. 5.24 Single-particle damping lock displacement time graph. 



Fig. 5.25 Lead-rubber bearing. 

					In China there are already using lead rubber bearing isolation buildings and bridges.
					But in the LRB's works application, the current design of indicators and parameters
					are reference architecture specification, while the actual application of bridge
					engineering environment structural harsh lead rubber bearing in bridge structure
					are often in a very hostile environment, such as high temperature, low temperature,
					large temperature changes, poor atmospheric corrosion, erosion and the long-term
					repeated creep deformation, shock and vibration, and so on. Because of this, their
					poor fatigue and limited carrying capacity, durability is insufficient to meet today's
					bridge of long-span and heavy loads and long life requirement. 

(c) Steel Energy Dissipation System 

					Steel consuming bearing consists of a series of circular arrangement of the C-shaped
					(or E-shaped) steel units of energy (Fig. 5.26). Transverse force under the action,
					through C-(or-E) deflection of steel itself to provide movement and damping. Its
					design should be pay attention to all section face in the same direction of movement
					stress, was able to achieve a good effect energy consumption, design and processing
					is very difficult. Also, this class bearing belongs to the material energy system,
					it shall ensure that energy-consuming materials in elastic and plastic deformation
					zone has a good set of fatigue, which has high elongation and low hardenability and
					that is connected with the energy unit, and supports key components (such as PIN)
					is better with higher strength and fatigue resistance. 



Fig. 5.26 Energy of C-shaped steel supports connection (size unit: mm). 

(d) Black Elastic Sliding Bearing 

					Elastic sliding bearings consist of a group of overlapping and slide against each
					other by placing perforated PTFE sheet rubber, and a Supporting Articulated material
					central core, a number of satellite rubber core. This friction slider isolator is
					a rubber core provides a link to the equilibrium position of the restoring force,
					while controlling oversized on the displacement and friction between layers of rubber
					and PTFE sheet Chrome plated steel spherical to burn off energy. Adjustment between
					PTFE the co-efficient of friction the diameter of the central rubber nucleus can
					be achieve good isolation properties. But this isolation bearing structure is more
					complex, because of its reasons for using rubber, there are aging, poor durability.

(e) Friction Pendulum Bearings 

					Friction pendulum bearing (Fig. 5.27) works like a pendulum: middle-tier sliding
					block formed by pressure resistance of high-strength materials, the sliding surface
					of the slider below when seismic displacement structure, due to the gravity of the
					superstructure and circular-arc the bottom sliding surface design, can be always
					point to the equilibrium position of the reply force, but throughout the course of
					the earthquake by friction between the slider and sliding surfaces dissipation of
					energy. On the other hand, due to the rotation of the slider on the surface and cover
					closed contact upper structure always remains horizontal. This support meaning is
					clear and concise design, simplicity, durability and with self-recovery capability,
					in the United States, and Canada and other countries of the bridges and isolation
					to the epicenter has been widely applied and achieved good economic efficiency lean
					and very good damping effect. 

(f) Structure and Work Principle of Double Spherical Aseismic Bearing 

					Mainly consists of double spherical aseismic bearing seat plate, plate, bottom plate,
					spherical stainless steel spherical under skateboarding, stainless steel PTFE under
					PTFE on skateboards, skateboarding, skateboards, shear pins, secure the screws and
					sealing device consists of several parts, of which four fluorine PTFE under skateboards
					and skateboards using fragmented mosaic of filled PTFE composite laminated skateboards.
					Bearing structure as shown in Fig. 5.28.

						2—guide plate; 3—shear pin 4—security screw; 5—seat plate; 6—dust seal unit 7—sphere
						stainless steel skate board; 8—PTFE skateboards; 9—seat board. 

					Double spherical aseismic bearing is based on general ball-bearings developed, through
					the use of large-diameter spherical friction takes a common ball-type bearing flat
					friction pair, and limit restraints designed F (x) (Shear) a new bearing. The bearing
					using a pendulum KP mechanism to extend the natural vibration period of bridge can
					be provided through the deck weight reset capabilities needed to help x (Relative
					displacement) bridge superstructure to its original position. 

					Of double spherical aseismic bearing isolation works: when an earthquake occurs and
					horizontal lateral force exceeds a predetermined value, limited the shear pins and
					safety device cutting off screws, bearing the transverse limit restriction was lifted,
					large-diameter spherical transverse of friction slide freely through friction gradually
					consumes energy. Thus, prolong the earthquake cycle, achieve the effect of damping
					and earthquake; after the earthquake, structural weight and re-silience can be formed
					so that bearing reset. Bearings hysteresis curve is shown in Fig. 5.29.

					5.3 BRIDGE WIND-RESISTANT DESIGN PHILOSOPHY 

					Due to cruise ship-bridge collision accidents often occur of bridges and caused great
					damage to life and property and, therefore, from the bridge beam concept design phase
					begins to take control of ship collision design has gradually developed a consensus
					among members, and engineers in the span of the bridge layout stage of economic comparison
					of navigation requirements and span selection problem in a new light. In order to
					carry out the protection of ship collision design idea, the first, you must have
					fortification standard and design principles of the protection of ship collision,
					it will be told in the first part of the fortification level and design principles.
					

					Conceptual design on the ship collision-resistant function of structures considering
					the ship collision prevention concept and the fortification level, bridge and bridge
					axis selection examination considering the factors of ship collision, conceptual
					design to structural considerations, conceptual design of ship collision-resistant
					function of ship collision-proof measures of four bars contents. 

					Conceptual design for structure of ship collision prevention performance considerations,
					conceptual design work is an important group in multiple areas of expertise assembly.
					

					5.3.1 Fortification Standard and Design Principles 

					Ship or Driftwood collided with the bridge structure is very complicated, when environmental
					factors (waves, climate, waters and so on), ships characteristics (type of ship,
					vessel size, speed, loading, and the bow, the strength of the hull and deck and the
					newly and so on), bridges (bridge component sizes, shapes, materials, quality and
					resistance characteristics) and the driver's reaction time factors is very big, therefore,
					accurate determination of ship or Driftwood-bridge interaction is very difficult.
					

					According to the characteristics of the navigable waterway and traffic characteristics
					of a ship, that need to be taken into account of ship-bridge interaction inland waterway
					and prevailing sea river divided into two broad categories. On behalf of the former
					mainly for river cargo barges, one to seven levels inland waterway tonnage, respectively,
					corresponding to the 3000t, 2000t, 1000t and 500t and 300t, 100t, 50t. Prevailing
					sea channel with seagoing vessels as representing ones. Collision with the bridge
					structure of the two mechanisms differ results are also quite different. 

1. Ship-colliding Fortification Level 

					Bridges should be used according to their function is divided into A, B, C three
					ship class. Among them, the class a refers to the Bay, Grade on the approaches to
					the bridge; Category B refers to the II~IV on the approaches to the bridge; Category
					C refers to the V on the approaches to the bridge. General Bridges shall be determined
					according to Table 5.14 ship security performance objectives.

Note: The ship hits the fortification level L1 is a 100-year return period, L2 1000
					return periods. 

2. Prevention of Ship Collision Design Principles 

					Combining bridge vessle bumping fortification level and performance goals, according
					to the navigable levels and tons of ships, must be adhere to the following three
					control ship collision design principles. First is avoidance or isolated concept,
					bridge or conditional increase of particular importance for long-span bridge (added
					span economy were better than the increased span and setting the anti-collision facilities),
					or ship's tonnage is greater than 50000 DWT fairways, avoiding or isolation of the
					pier and the ship concept; the second is the collision idea, not increased-span bridges
					(increasing the span of economic deterioration in does not increase the span setting
					the anti-collision facilities), or tonnage of the vessel is greater than 3000 DWT,
					less than 50000 DWT fairway collision energy dissipation measures and pier-resistant
					combination of ideas; the third is: resistant concept, for long-span bridge, or tonnage
					of the vessel is less than 3000 DWT waterway, crashworthiness and anti-collision
					measures as a supplement to Pier's philosophy. 

Figure 5.30 is analysis on anti-collision concept conceptual design schematic diagram,
					x-axis is abscissa navigable spans of the bridge, y-axis is investment tendered for
					the bridge construction, curve j bridges (excluding requirements of ship collision
					prevention facilities and substructure of ship collision force) construction investment
					and long-span relation, curve i is included in ship collision proof requirements for facilities and infrastructure effect of ship collision with bridge investment. It can be seen that for most of the big long-span bridges, AB intervals
					span substructure design included influence of ship collision
					force and rarely hardly increased lower investments, also may be subject to large ships impact the
					pier, according to pier's own ability to withstand impact, the location and appearance
					of the pier, flow rate, water level and speed of navigation collision of ship types,
					and factors for bridge crash (energy) infrastructure design. Therefore, the collision
					idea, its structural safety, crash risk and Economics is acceptable



Fig. 5.30 Analysis on anti-collision concept conceptual design schematic. 

					For large-span bridge, interval greater than b in the figure, due to the high class
					of waterway, ship impact force and design of bridge substructure ship collision force
					controlled ship combination may be much greater than other load combinations, and
					will be lead to the bridge construction investment has increased substantially. This
					needs to count collision effects in a relatively small span with increased span,
					avoid collision or substantially reduce the risk of collision scenarios economic
					comparison chart, invest the same points C and D, but the span increased a lot. Same
					points C and E span, by taking into ship collision force and facilities against dash,
					investments increased significantly. In the context of DE, we can access increase
					the span of avoiding ship collision or drop optimal scheme of low ship collision
					risk. 

					Due to bridge technical restrictions (limitation span of cable-stayed and suspension
					bridge, deep foundations, etc.), cannot be obtained by increasing the span economy
					better programmes, only a substantial increase in collision avoidance measures (such
					as independent impact structure separate from the bridge collision hit protective
					structures, Pier regardless of ship impact force), or piers considering the huge
					ship change the force of the impact Foundation, increased base quantities, then in
					case of ship collision with energy dissipation devices and other measures. These
					two programmes will be eventually lead to a substantial increase in total investments.
					

					For the average span bridges when the span is smaller (less than 100 m), horizontal
					impact force resistance of the structure itself is bad, need to increase the amount
					of bottom structure and foundation engineering to satisfy the anti-ship force requirements,
					which will be lead to increasing bridge investment, as shown in Fig. F point and
					the G spot, the same span structures considering greater investment in shipping after
					the force of the impact. Therefore, increasing general bridges (such as non-navigable
					spans of the bridge beam) span, increasing the impact resistance of the structure
					itself, can achieve good economic efficiency, and reduce the risk of ship collision
					accidents. 

					5.3.2 Rational Selection of Bridge Site and Bridge Axis 

					Axis of the bridge and the bridge site should be selected taking into account navigational
					safety, and meet the following requirements: 


						Bridge upstream and downstream waterways and ports development and planning, as well
						as utilisation of the shoreline. 

						The bridge should be selected in channel straight River, deep grooves and the riverbed
						or seabed stability, water depth and flow condition on the good leg, bridge water
						bed (seabed) scour and modest. 

						Bridge should avoid the bends, branch road, Rapids, segregation and concentration
						port anchorage, port operation area, such as, the distance should be able to guarantee
						safe navigation of ships. 

						The bridge axis should be perpendicular to the current trend and orthogonal design
						routes if possible, water flow and bridge axis normal angle should not exceed 5°.
						


					In fact, route straight bridge is the case, or drifters crashing head-on with the
					bridge of the ship will be very small, more oblique collision of bridge piers and
					abutments. Oblique impact angle of less than 45°. When the skew bridge and waterway,
					the regular to oblique impact of piers and abutments are possible. Moreover, when
					the axis of the bridge have a greater angle between the normal and mainstream, will
					produce to impede the safety of navigation of bad water. As the flow angle and bridge
					axis normal to not meet the requirements, you should consider increasing across the
					span of the bridge to ensure the safe navigation of the ship. 

					5.3.3 Anti-ship Collision Design Success Stories 

					Bridge conceptual design of ship collision-resistant function of bridge structure
					considering, in structure, consider the ship collision and economic basis on this,
					the type of the macro issues such as piers, span arrangement, the water research,
					conceptual design ideas, to ensure the knot construction safety, marine safety, and
					economic goals. To this end, the following gives some anti-ship collision design
					success at home and abroad cases, including fully meet the requirements for navigation,
					select the appropriate type of bridge piers and span arrangement, set up in the water
					sample, for reference. 

1. Fully Satisfy the Navigation Requirements 

					From maritime safety and ship protection impact perspective, bigger the better bridge
					span, bridge away from the ship, but here it may be to increase long-span bridge
					and waterway isolation and meet the channel setting collision under the conditions
					of facilities both economic analysis and comparison. 

					In general, appropriate to increase the span to make the piers on shore or away from
					the Sham Shui Po District are a more economical option, which is the concept of avoidance.
					In contrast, to make the piers out of the water and multiplied spans is not desirable.
					

					When there are no conditions across the river, for high level route, ship impact
					force is huge, bridge structures and separation of ship method is also commonly used
					and available, which is the concept of isolation. Isolation concept common measures
					through the artificial islands and independent impact structure to stop the ship
					from the force of the impact to the bridge structure. 

Example 5.5 Denmark Sea Bridge. 

Design: Select the bridge span by shipping studies, on the channel axis alignment
					adjustment, the structure of the selected ship can withstand impact anchorages and
					piers used artificial islands protected, establishing vessel traffic management system.
					

					The bridge a total length of 6.8 km, across the sea strait between Zealand and sibolaogendao
					to the East. During the initial design phase, had considered the channel span down
					to 780 m, which according to the results of study of ship collision, and the bridge
					program and comprehensive study on span, coupled with adjustments to channel axis
					alignment finally chosen as the main span 1624 m. This alignment adjustment the sailing
					angle relative to the axis of the bridge changed from 68° to 78°, so that the axis
					of the bridge on both sides of the fairway bending distance of 2300 m. Fairway center
					line vertical clearance of 65 m width of the channel is 750 m, all structures that
					are struck by ships in accordance with established collision avoidance model designed
					to withstand the impact of the selected ship, ship chosen by 2000 DWT 250000 DWT,
					which collided with a pier of the maximum impact force of 673 MN. Anchorage and some
					foundations are made of artificial islands protection, and establishing vessel traffic
					management system. 

Example 5.6. France Normandy bridge. 

Design idea: The South Tower Pier was built on the land and, after pier at about
					25 m, the north side of the pier was built in the North of the low embankment outside
					set and bull island. 

					Normandy bridge is used to create a world record of 856 m long-span cable-stayed
					bridge, in 1995, opened to traffic, the bridge with four lane, across the river Seine
					in the Bay area, the navigation clearance of 50 m, the original design of the bridge
					span as a 510 m, the north side of the pier close to the fairway, and there are four
					piers in the river. In the early 1980, reports about ship collisions and related
					damage of many bridges, Influenced the decision of adopting from the left bank of
					the river to the end of the North breakwater of the pier are not required in programmes
					across the Nar, R., thus separating the north side of the river and the marshes,
					on the South Tower Pier was built-in the land, at the dock behind 25 m office, which
					would not have been in actual navigable ship collision, the north side of the pier
					was built-in the North of the low embankment outside nearby, this keeps the span
					without adding too much. However, the pier was built at this location will be the
					basis of deadweight tonnage upto 130000 DWT ship slammed, so they decided on this
					basis built around a special type of protection structure. The bridge's main span
					spans end up 856 m than in the design of cable-stayed bridge, whether it's design
					or span is a great leap forward (Fig. 5.31). 

Example 5.7. United States Houston ship channel bridge. 

					Fulaiteha took off across the Houston ship channel Pullman (Fred Hartman) cable-stayed
					bridge is a pair of steel-concrete composite deck, frame as shown in Fig. 384.6 m,
					5.32. Navigation vessels can be upto 228 m (according to the statistics made by general
					cargo ship, over 65,000 DWT). Double diamond side pylon arrangement on a man-made
					island in the middle, to prevent the collision of ships on the other tower Pier Set
					on the East Coast.

2. Select the Appropriate Type of Bridge and Span Arrangement 

					Bridge type selection, according to water depth and predictable water level change,
					fully meet the channel width and headroom requirements avoid embezzlement waterway,
					especially when selecting a deck and deck-type arch bridge, should pay special attention
					to the ring of ship impact risk. If needed, may be appropriate to enlarge span, near
					the arch ring of arch away from the waterway clearance. 

Example 5.8. Sweden old Tjörn Bridge. 

					Sweden old Tjörn Bridge (Rong Qiao) across 278 m filled steel tubular rib arch bridge,
					in January 1981, the thousands of tons of the Netherlands Freighter collision steel
					pipe Arch of bridge base, resulting in steel tubular arch collapsed, collapse of
					the superstructure in the sunken ship, killing more than 10 people, Fig. 5.33 new
					bridge design drawings, Fig. 5.34 for ship collision accident photos, Fig. 5.35 for
					the new cable-stayed bridge. 



Fig. 5.33 Sweden new Tjӧrn Bridge design drawings (size: m). 



Fig. 5.34 Ship collision accident. 



Fig. 5.35 A new cable-stayed bridge. 

					In most cases, due to the width of the water causes (such as Suzhou-Nantong Yangtze
					river bridge the river width upto 8 km), the bridge cannot be implement a design
					of crossing the river, and hydrology of river conditions, such as water depth, scour,
					elusive DUN ship quarantined (artificial island or independent impact structure)
					programme, pier must be able to resist the ship collision with power, and the use
					of ship collision with energy dissipation devices, to protect bridges and ships,
					reducing the role of ship impact force. 

					Due to the bridge span and resistance to impact, waterways and ships there is some
					inherent relationship between impact force and channel high level of ship impact
					force and large-span bridges, pier and tower structure, and strong horizontal impact
					performance, and vice-versa. This collision idea has economic rationality. Of course,
					it should be removed from the two special cases: one is the huge ship, bridges difficult
					or costly to bear; the other is due to various reasons the owner cannot accept any
					ship collision risk, to be adopted take DUN ship quarantined. 

Example 5.9. Ship collision prevention design of Su Tong bridge. 

					Su Tong bridge design-time consideration of ship impact force as shown in Table 5.15,
					and energy dissipation were specially designed protective devices.

Crashworthy Structure Features: 


						The anti-collision facilities main function is, when designing a ship collision,
						to facilities damage amount of dissipation; avoid ship protrusive parts direct impact
						drilling pile and pier, tower structures reduce the damage length. 

						When serious collision occur, the anti-collision facilities through its own kinetic
						energy of deformation and failure to fully absorb the shipping to reduce pier the
						force of the collision, when relatively minor collision, the anti-collision facilities
						of sufficient strength and resistance to deformation, use of facilities around the
						baffle box energy absorber to protect the overall integrity of the structure of facilities
						subject, while reducing the impact the ship's damage. 

						Under normal conditions, the anti-collision facilities with full-floating ability,
						flexible, easy to use water ballast makes the anti-collision facilities keep good
						floatation; after being damaged due to collision, and can limit the extent of damage
						to certain areas within the buoyancy of the anticollision facilities remains must
						be and the necessary buoyancy without sinking, easy fix. 


					The anti-collision facilities primarily: facilities dimension is based on the actual
					possibility of impact conditions, calculate the length of the damaged facilities,
					determine the facility should have a width. Vulnerable to collisions between facilities
					on the side width: 12 m, determined by the 50,000t 4 m/s was hit. Facilities side
					and rear width: 6 m, determined by the 50,000t 3 m/s was hit. 50,000t ship's draught
					depth 12.5 m, the first vertex distance balls contains watermark, 7 m, in order to
					avoid the anti-collision facilities was lifted by ball, facility draft is 8.2 m.
					Freeboard is 4.3 m making facilities have plenty of buoyancy reserve, the anti-collision
					facilities were first ships pressed into the surface of the ball, while facilities
					damaged cases have a reserve of buoyancy. 

3. Reasonable in Setting Water Pier 

					Both navigable and non-navigable water pier, it is necessary from the point of structure
					to increase impact resisting ability of piers and reduce ship collision risk. Especially
					the non-navigable spans of the bridge pier, generally not considered or taken into
					account in the design of a small ship in the event of ship collision accidents, often
					a severe loss of life and property. 

(a) To Minimise in-water Pier Number 

					In-water pier in particular DUN usually spans a smaller non-navigable waters, Pier's
					performance against horizontal force is low, it is sometimes necessary to and increase
					the number of piles and cross connect two pieces of bridge sub-structure as a whole,
					against ship collision, and this design in addition to ship against the wind insurance,
					a structural design itself was also uneconomical. Therefore, appropriate more navigable
					and non-navigable spans of the bridge span and river hong, navigation, road safety,
					but also increase the crashworthiness of the pier. 

(b) Under-water Pier Should be Placed in the Shallow Water as Permitted 

					According to the marine casualty investigation and analysis, impact the number of
					incidents of non-navigable spans of about of main navigation span for impact twice
					as long. Therefore, should be come via navigable bridge reasonable cross, to set
					the non-navigable spans of the bridge piers in the water as much as possible in the
					shallow water, but to avoid a large number of the anti-collision facilities of non-navigable
					spans of the bridge. If the depth of non-navigable spans of bridges still can meet
					the general small cargo ships sailing, its role in pier design must be taken into
					account when the ship crashed into. When necessary, to take ship collision prevention
					measures such as the floating block units. 

(c) Piers Constructed in the Water should have a Certain Degree of Redundancy 

					In water pier constructed forms have a certain degree of redundancy, avoid rapidly
					collapses on impact. As a tri-pillar box after the pier a pier was hit, the remaining
					two piers still constitute a vertical load-bearing system, avoiding the full-bridge
					collapse. When you must be in single-column bridge piers, should properly enlarge
					pier cross-section dimension and strengthen its impact resistance. 

(d) In-water Pier can Withstand Ship Impact Force 

					If the piers in waters without independent facilities against dash, ship collision
					load must be considered in the design of piers, ship collision specification or identified
					through the case studies. Even taking into account a certain amount of protective
					measures, such as adhesion-type energy dissipator, box device which, although these
					facilities can be part of the energy consumed, but also residual impact energy is
					absorbed by the pier and foundation, and the facilities to carry energy of varying
					ability and generally not high, so the pier and foundation must be considered in
					the design of ship impact force. 

Example 5.10. Completion of Canada Federal bridge across the Northumberland Strait.

Design: Pier can afford to ship impact force, compulsory pilotage. 

					Confederation Bridge, 13 km, lies between Prince Edward Island and xinbulusiweike,
					was opened in 1997. The bridge is double lane road bridge, the main bridge by 43
					spans, each 250 m, piers for pre-cast concrete pier, central part of the main bridge
					with a through navigation, clear width of not less than 200 m, the clear height of
					not less than 49 m. Specified in the initial performance requirements for engineering:
					both sides of the channel close to the main pier and the pier artificial island facilities
					against dash should be used to protect other neutral line on each side of the 500
					m range piers island or piling the anti-collision facilities should be used to protect
					it. The final design of the bridge did not use artificial islands, or pile in your
					anti-virus facilities, but the design show: channel side of the bridge must be able
					to withstand 37000 DWT ship within 4.2 m/s speed bump strike force (37000 DWT ship
					impact force by United States Code, equivalent to 100 MN); two adjacent piers with
					must be able to withstand a mean high 50 MN shock; all other piers can withstand
					8 MN shock. 

					5.3.4 A Variety of Ship Collision Prevention Measures 

					Bridge design engineer in addition to the bridge structure is designed to have a
					certain amount of resistance to shock loading of ships outside, you should also consider
					the buffer device and protection system, change the direction of ship impact load
					or reduce shock loading of the pier, its destruction to minimise the extent and also
					reduce the loss of ships and the destruction of the anti-collision facilities, namely,
					anti-collision design referred to in the "three is not bad" principles. In accordance
					with the anti-collision facilities and bridge relationships, passive collision avoidance
					system is divided into independent collision avoidance systems, integrated impact
					cafe attached collision avoidance systems in three categories. In addition, in accordance
					with the anti-collision facilities structure can be divided into floating protective
					systems, gravity system, posts protection system, shield protection system. 

1. The Floating Protective System 

					Arrays, used to anchor the rope floating buoys and anchored to the fence and other
					protection systems, drifting the prow of the vessel embedded cable NET or anchor
					buoys suspended due to gravity anchor end of coastal towing. Floating protective
					system for the protection of deep water bridge piers is a viable option (Fig. 5.36).
					The main advantage of this protection method is: (a) can absorb a great deal of momentum;
					(b) ship injuries limited; (c) the system can be installed in deep water and work.
					Main disadvantages are: (a) it around Bridge take considerable space; (b) it withstand
					storms and ice floes in waters which made durability a question; (c) major collision
					repair cost higher (d) long-term maintenance cost obviously depends on the scope
					of anti-corrosion measures and results.

						The bulbous bow may not cross brake system; (c) Tilt the bow may over braking system;
						(d) Flat end of the bow may become more brake systems (e) Floating protective system
						photos. 

					Another floating energy dissipating the anti-collision facilities by installed around
					the main pier cofferdam or pontoon, using materials such as steel and rubber to achieve
					the goal of energy dissipation. Energy dissipation steel structure main body of the
					anticollision facilities of floating deck structure, platform, structure, floor
					structure, vertical and horizontal bulkheads, inner walls, perimeter wall, horizontal
					truss elements, such as, at the same time external wall form multiple watertight
					compartments and ballast tanks, on the inner wall set the rubber parts of the anti-collision
					facilities can be improved contact with the pier bearing platform can. Floating the
					anti-collision facilities under the advantages of buoyancy along the pier move up
					and down so that it can adapt to the change of water level, range of the protection pier; disadvantage is that complex, Pier and pile cap shape required.

					2. The Floating Protective System 

					Piers in the water or gravity bridge protection pier protection. Protection pier
					by the lattice into the steel sheet pile structure, fill in boxes with stone and
					concrete cover, protective pier and recoverable using pre-cast concrete piles, protection
					pier by net quality low energy barge towing collision resistance, but when high energy
					collisions, tends to the rotation, deformation, thereby tends to impact damage. This
					method is suitable for low and medium energy used in the ship collision incident,
					is more economical effective. The main advantages of this system are: (a) it is an
					independent system, before the ship reached Pier deflected or absorbed collisions
					energy it can be reasonable, cost effective installation in medium-depth water; (b)
					aim at long-term maintenance costs are relatively low. Main disadvantages are: (a)
					can absorb kinetic energy is limited to middle level; (b) ships had significant injuries;
					(c) the high cost of repair after a major collision.

					shield shapes can make bias or floating vessel steering, only pier with moderate
					damage. Main disadvantages are: (a) is not valid for high energy collisions; (b)
					building costs relatively expensive; (c) valid only in medium-depth; (d) after a
					major collision repair costs are relatively high.

4. The Shield Protection System 

					This system has been applied in a variety of forms in United States and Germany on

					frame, they are a common form-oriented shield is to guide ships through the narrow
					little plays an important role in this oriented or protective plate can only have
					a protective effect on low-energy collisions, exert protective effects on high energy
					collisions, it is usually the original based on the outside ends of sheet-pile-supported
					by bollards (Figs. 5.40 & 5.41). The main advantages of this system are: (a)
					shield configuration or to help navigation of ships through the narrow route, thus
					helping to avoid collisions; (b) in the construction of bridges, this system takes
					the proportioned cost; (c) piers supporting grid configurations, it can float the
					boats go stray; (d) fire proof take friction surface. The main disadvantage of this
					system are: (a) is not valid for medium or high energy collisions; (b) after major
					crash repair costs are quite high; (c) aim at long-term maintenance costs, and even
					very small ships bump after its logs should also be replaced.

					5.4 BRIDGE WIND-RESISTANT DESIGN PHILOSOPHY 

					From the 80's of the 20th century, Europe and the United States found that corrosion
					of pre-stressed cables in cement pipes pulp of severe corrosion in the pipe, causing
					the international bridge community's attention, and raised the issue of durability.
					In 1989, the international qiaoxie conference on the Lisbon "structure durability"
					as its theme, was devoted to how attached to the structure's durability during the
					design phase, so as to avoid early deterioration due to pay high costs of maintenance
					and strengthening. In order to implement the concept of durability design of bridges,
					first, we must clarify what is the durability of bridges to ask questions, durability
					of concrete bridges and steel bridge's main problem is, this will be the first part
					of the structure durability of agency shaoxing; second, you need to be familiar with
					existing principles of bridge durability design, part II briefly involved in structural
					durability design detectable resistance, repairable and replaceable nature, health,
					controllability and sustainability; then, you need to understand durability analysis
					case studies in order to draw them in the conceptual design, and application and
					development of, and the third part focuses on the structure, load-bearing structures
					and durability, choose durable materials and durability design of main girder of
					cases; and, finally, to understand the common structure durability assurance measures
					part four introduces the sacrificial protection, detail design, interchangeable,
					easy maintenance measures, inspection and conservation facilities. 

					5.4.1 Structural Durability 

					Refers to the bridge to resist natural weathering durability of bridge structures,
					chemical, mechanical abrasion and other degradation processes of invasion capacity.
					A good steel or concrete structure durability when exposed to normal conditions will
					be remain outside of its original components quality and service features of form
					and structure. Our current specifications, the bridge structure durability or life
					span of 100 years, but load bearing actually there are often certain flaws, resulting
					in bridge structures within the prescribed period had to be re-built, some bridges
					to demolition and reconstruction is required in the expected half life. But the lack
					of durability of bridges, often in use during the first table showed durability problems
					such as cracking, deformation, deflection, which, the cracking of the concrete cable-stayed
					bridges, concrete girder bridges under torsion and orthogonal different study on
					fatigue crack of steel bridge deck durability is the most common and most issues
					need to be addressed. 

1. Concrete Cable-stayed Bridge Cracks 

					Since 1975, construction of cable-stayed bridge in China, and to date has been built
					over more than 200 cable-stayed bridge, over 80% production using pre-stressed or
					reinforced concrete girders, concrete cable-stayed bridge. 

					In all large-span concrete cable-stayed bridge, about 20% of concrete beam crack
					appeared, and crack like, it's concrete cable-stayed bridge to encounter the most
					serious durability problems. Numerous studies show that cracked concrete cable-stayed
					bridge there are four typical forms, namely, roof cracks, cracks in floor, cracks
					and partition of the Web. Table 5.16 lists 8 typical cracking concrete cable-stayed
					bridge, where the girder webs and there has been a lot of cracks, the useful life
					of these bridges from 11 to 27 years, the average life span of 19 years, far less
					than the life expectancy of 100 years of bridge structures. 

					Durability of concrete cable-stayed bridge cracking causes of problem generally boils
					down to two major reasons: including design, construction, materials and subjective
					error factors of cracks caused by construction and by including overload, temperature
					load, shrinkage and creep of concrete and objective contact factors causing cracks.
					Although a large number of field surveys and case studies, also used to explain the
					individual bridge crack specific reasons, but still it is difficult to draw general
					conclusions of the crack of concrete cable-stayed bridge. In the Jinan Yellow River
					Bridge cracks motor as an example, longitudinal cracks in roof and partition of vertical
					cracks due to the absence of transverse pre-stressing force and thermal stresses
					in roof and floor plate distribution caused by cracks in a plate and webs due largely
					to frequent overloads and shrinkage and creep of concrete.

2. Concrete Girder Bridge Deflection 

					Concrete girder bridge in China is widely used in medium-or large-span bridges, mainly
					in pre-stressed concrete continuous girder bridge and pre-stressed concrete continuous
					rigid-frame bridge with two forms, both bridge types suitable for 100~300 m long-span
					bridges, the latter being more bigger than the span of the former. China has nearly
					60 long-span pre-stressed concrete beam bridge of 200 m in span, although the Wuhan
					Yangtze River Bridge main span of double-line bridge of up to 330 m, but it has a
					steel beam, which belongs to the steel-concrete composite beam, maximum span concrete
					beam bridge should be completed in 1997, Deputy channel bridge of Humen large bridge
					main span of 270 m. 

					For large-span pre-stressed concrete girder bridge, maximum durability problems is
					excessive deflection of the main span, and this deformation causes of concrete beam
					crack-related. Structure deflection will be cause cracking of box girder with floor
					more, thereby lowering knot frame stiffness and eventually have greater deflection,
					creating a vicious cycle. Table 5.17 shows 9 domestic and foreign large-span pre-stressed
					concrete bridges, there are 3 of them and 6 abroad are produced across the deflection
					of phenomenon. Under torsion, lasting from 3 to 28 years ranging from 11 years on
					average, far less than the bridge's design life of 100 years. Research results show
					that concrete continuous beam bridge main spans and concrete continuous rigid frame
					bridge under torsion is not China-specific issues, but the problem of universal from
					the structure design, construction and maintenance point of view it is difficult
					to avoid the occurrence of deflection, mainly to control the mode by setting the
					camber, for example, Norway according to the span of 0.5% is the deflection; once
					scratched after is hard to take steps to restore, for example, the United States
					had deflection occurs after the restoration of strengthening construction of cause
					of the bridge collapse accident.

3. The Fatigue Crack of Orthotropic Steel Deck 

					As compared with the heavy concrete beam bridge panel or orthotropic steel deck plate
					is a lightweight construction system, so large-span suspension bridge and cable-stayed
					bridge in China, orthotropic steel bridge deck pavement using more common, there
					have been some fatigue cracks. Completed in 1997, the Humen bridge, the orthotropic
					steel bridge deck asphalt pavement was found shortly after the opening question,
					by 2007, is exposing stepped in at the plate and welded longitudinal ribs crack problem,
					seriously affected the normal passage bridge, also in the Chinese bridge beam sector
					attracted great attention. The bridge deck is an example of an orthotropic steel
					deck, steel box girders of the total width is 35.6 m, beam depth is 3.0 m. As an
					orthotropic steel box girder roof panel thickness of 12 mm, and the spacing is 620
					mm, thickness 8 mm U-shaped rib for stiffening. Currently found in the orthotropic
					steel bridge deck a lot of fatigue cracks, the crack sewing can be divided from A
					to E, 5 types as shown in Fig. 5.42. Among them, A crack appears on the roof, roof
					and weld of vertical U-shaped ribs; Type B cracks on webs in the U-shaped ribs along
					the roof and vertical U-shaped rib connector, and much of that in the U-shaped rib
					bending; Type C U-shaped ribs crack appeared in the seams between segments; Type
					D cracks in U-shaped rib of webs, located in the welding at the foot of the cross
					connection; E-type A cracks on the diaphragm, in the D U-shaped ribs connected to
					welding B E at the foot of this cracks along the C diaphragm from the U-shaped box
					hole water spread flat or inclined, or along a seam spreads.



Fig. 5.42 Observation of fatigue crack types. 

					Preliminary analysis shows that cracks in fatigue of orthotropic steel bridge decks
					frequent overloading was the main reason, including vehicle density and axles two
					aspects of weight. To this end, the first traffic statistics analysis of daily traffic
					increasing from 14928 vehicles in 1997 to 2008, 62439 vehicles, increased by growth
					factor of 4.2, which in the past 11 years, the six-lane bridge has withstood the
					role of 1.55 billion unregistered trips, the average per lane bear 2.58 million vehicles,
					far more than the fatigue strength. Then the axle statistical analysis of the heavy,
					showing three axle load peaks, 50 kN, 150 kN and 400 kN, respectively, and bridge
					design is 200 kN, almost half of the axle load exceeds design axle load. Final field
					surveys and experimental studies have found that these cracks occur mainly in heavy
					trucks driving on both sides of the driveway, because the trucks are overloaded and
					traffic density is high, steel deck plate with thin, after the destruction caused
					by pavement roughness of asphalt paving, increasing impact, precisely because of
					these combined factors led to the opening of the orthotropic steel bridge deck in
					less than 12 hours because of repeated overload and produce severe fatigue cracks.
					

					5.4.2 Durability Design Principles 

					Since the 1970s, on the basis of lessons learned at home and abroad, in addition
					to continued emphasis on the structural design and construction safety, durability,
					reliability, component interchangeability have been considered, and based on different
					bridges structure analysis of the disaster grade and level of risk, prevention design
					and durability design were proposed as new concepts. In essence, structural durability
					design to solve the problem which is economical and reasonable service life problems,
					namely, structural problem in life-cycle. 

					A large bridge to serve 100 years or even longer, for investing huge super long span
					bridge or sea-crossing bridge, life period should be taken into account to 150~200
					years, taking into account the rapid development of modern science, the economy,
					and during the life of the structure, in addition to knot outside the frame itself,
					the aging and decay of internal, external factors change is big. For example, the
					usage requirements of the bridge structure to be predicted years, developed various
					standards of design is hard to achieve. However, the engineer should be able to make
					structures adapt to change, adopt with various measures for the structure to provide
					additional "stamina" opportunities. In order to achieve this goal, in design-time
					architecture must have six characteristics of checking resistance, repairable and
					replaceable controllability nature, health, and sustainability. Engineers must recognise
					that the overall structure of the lives and the various components is not exactly
					the same, such as service life of rubber bearings for more than 20 years, cable sheathing
					tho life for 10~20 year life of up to 40 years, cable wires, steel structure paint's
					maximum life-span is 20 years, and so on. These parts whose life span is below the
					design life of the structure components must be able to be tracked, repaired, replaces,
					and can be strengthened. In external changes cases, the structural deformation in
					structure of "manageable", that during the operational phase for bridge maintenance
					and reinforcement work, so as to ensure the durability of the structure. 

					In order to ensure the safety and durability of bridge engineering implementation
					of the design concept, the first job was to develop the design, construction and
					maintenance specifications, procedures, standards and guidelines. In fact, normative
					and standard-setting also reflects a country's construction level. During the 1923-1963,
					year the allowable stress method, and after 1963 to 2003, year of limit State method
					from 2003 since developed countries have committed to performance-based design specifications
					(performance-based design code) designed to improve infrastructure especially major
					infrastructure design and construction standards. Developed and compiled based on
					durability requirements, whole life insurance design and sustainability of performance-based
					bridge engineering design codes and standards should become a 21st century bridge
					engineering one of the most important tasks. 

					5.4.3 Structural Durability 

					How to bridge design began to study bridge, general layout, it introduces the idea
					of durability, take fully into account the special the environmental conditions and
					other factors, such as what kind of main girder form durability to meet specific
					environmental, what kind of main girder form help maintenance, what kind of cable
					tower model need to use steel, what kind of cable tower model available and high
					performance concrete and component layout consider the need to not need to be replaced,
					can change, for example, replacement must be set aside for replacing the space, these
					are bridges to ensure durability initiatives, are major factors for durability, compared
					with other external measures, they are more important for bridge life-cycle maintenance
					costs and durability and play a decisive role. 

1. Structural Redundancy Design 

					Structure using a redundant design helps us to better face the problems that might
					arise, and that the increased costs of tend to be very small or even zero. For example,
					since the Portsmouth Bridge designed in the early 1980, of the 20th century, it always
					has to take into account in the design of cable-stayed bridge cable the possible
					broken truck collision. Carefully designed cable configuration such accidents can
					be the bridge to withstand shocks without interruption caused by traffic on the bridge.
					

					Opposite example is the early tied arch bridge in China, and used boom suspension
					crossmember, installed on the beam longitudinal decking suspended deck system design,
					this kind of system, such as hangers by accident, fracture, will cause the beams
					and decking to collapse significant fall occurred. 2001 Yibin in Sichuan province
					Xiao Nan men bridge collapse was due to the boom of durability issues caused by suspended
					deck system design make deck non-redundant design, boom broken, the bridge collapsed.
					This system also needed to replace suspenders it is difficult to replace. 

2. Construction and Durability 

					In many cases, construction method and arrangement of bridge-type are inextricably
					linked. Therefore, concept design, according to environmental conditions, research
					of bridge layout and materials durability requirements, and appropriate construction
					methods. 

(a) Construction Determines the type of Bridge 

					Study on structure of main bridge of Suzhou-Nantong Yangtze River Bridge the early
					research 110 m + 300 m + 1088 m + 300 m + 110 m five-span programmes, side 120 m
					length of main beam using pre-stressed concrete box girder structure. Such an arrangement,
					side effect, cable stiffness, helps to improve the main span rigidity. However, the
					resulting problems must be taken into account, that is, concrete beam segment of
					Jiang Shi work methods: pre-cast erection due to lifting weights is difficult to
					achieve, stent placement, supports in the river in flood season and the usual anti-collision
					problem resolved, more important is that supports in-situ concrete quality control
					in the river, weighed, design group believes that the main structure of a durable
					must ensure, under control. So, finally gave up, hybrid cable-stayed bridge scheme.
					

(b) Full Cross-section Integral Construction 

					Can cause severe corrosion of the environment of the region, such as bridge or cross-Sea
					Bridge in coastal areas, such as, at the design stage, avoid violence show large
					type steel structure of component surface area requires special maintenance structure,
					such as an open-beam or steel tower; eliminates choice requires a lot in field (coastal
					or maritime), pour concrete, making it difficult for concrete quality control and
					eventually structural durability, such as on-site pouring piles and pre-stressed
					concrete box girders, etc., avoid using partially prestressed b parts and component
					with cracks, affecting its durability, such as continuous pre-stressed concrete beams
					and pre-stressed concrete bent cap; avoid using a surname sewing and assembling,
					durability of the gel influences the durability of the seams. 

					Composite beam section forms a lot, generally speaking, although the steel I-beams
					with section advantages of simplicity, ease of construction, but box-shaped composite
					beams is a combination I-Liang bi exposed steel surfaces, paint maintenance workload
					is relatively large, box-shaped composite beams the outer surface is easy to maintain,
					facilitate the use of dehumidification system inside the box, box at the durability
					of the coating is guaranteed. Of steel and concrete composite technology, pre-cast
					concrete panels, installation, wet joint pouring after's approach stresses of steel
					and concrete can be full, however, used bridge deck durability of lap it is easy
					to become weak links, and first concrete bridge deck on the steel girder segment,
					and then overall segment installation of steel and concrete composite technology
					solves durability problem of steel-concrete combined surface and, of course, the
					lack of technology affect the steel and concrete of the two materials can give full
					play to their dominant performance, therefore, required under the environment category
					and grade, choosing the right combined process. Figs. 5.43 and 5.44 are two kinds
					of process engineering. 

(c) Pre-fabrication and Pre-casting of Segments 

					If water conditions permits, large crane to hoist girder is the excellent solution
					to beam quality and installation, also is a preferred solution, however, when circumstances
					in depth does not permit, such as beaches, only the use of movable frames, segmental
					processes of segmental seams for durability issues need to be addressed. 

					Pile caps piers and pre-cast problems for a growing cross-Sea Bridge, Pier poured
					in place concrete pile caps and Pier shafts will shadow casting quality and duration,
					pre-cast method is a common method of choice, but how to avoid assembly joint impact
					durability and problems, in addition to the adopting some good performance sealed
					materials, must ensure the durability of these joints on the design details, such
					as the joints of pile caps and pier concrete, pier over seams in the splash zone,
					and in a state of compression and so on. 



Fig. 5.43 Composite beam segment technique of casting concrete (a) steel box beams
						of Donghai bridge; (b) Greece combination girder of Rion-Antirion bridge. 



Fig. 5.44 Pre-cast concrete combination girder construction. 

					Using rectangular hollow section of Donghai bridge, vertical prestressed with high
					strength reinforcing rebar, concrete cross-section under design load does not arise
					under tensile stress. Pre-cast the pier shaft the whole section. Seams of high pier
					located in the splash zone or above, outside seal the deal on the inside cast in
					place concrete reinforcing and improving structure durability. By closely matching
					method of pre-cast pier. Set new concrete pier, to avoid assembled rubber joints,
					make sure that the connection parts durability requirements. Pre-fabricated site
					arrangement in Shen Jia Wan, island of 300,000 m2 prefabricated field, which two
					pieces of pier precasting yard, a venue precast pier of the 60 m span from "venture"
					floating crane for lifting installations. Another piece of venue precast pier of
					the 70 m span, make them ourselves, "erecting one barge" lift installation, as shown
					in Fig. 5.45.

						floating crane; (b) "erecting one barge" Pier installation vessels. 

3. Preference for Durable Materials 

					According to environmental conditions, conceptual design to structural material properties
					used by targeted requirements, and discusses their use of reason, material technical
					characteristics and application purposes, as well as from the total life-cycle cost
					analysis shows that the use of durable materials economy. Selection of durable materials
					are conceptual design for structure durability of concrete is considered one of the
					most important aspects. 

					Stonecutters Bridge design comes from the concept of a bridge design competition
					winner works, its appearance is very beautiful, how can design features to be durable
					without the need to take a very expensive maintenance costs is an important design
					consideration. In Hong Kong, the bridge is designed to generally live for 120 years.
					Environment for those who are taking a toll bridges, formulate a scientific, rational
					and economic durability the case is definitely a major challenge. 

					The Stonecutters Bridge design competition award-winning design of the upper part
					of the tower is a round steel, is of a design feature. The design add a modern element
					to this bridge built-in 21st century. On optimisation of design process, in order
					to improve the bridge aerodynamic performance and maintain the appearance of the
					bridge towers, the upper half of the tower to a steel shell and inner wall of concrete
					composite structure. In the concrete construction of the tower is not using the common
					method of pumping to avoid early-age shrinkage cracking. And mixed with Silica fume
					(Micro-silica) as well as the outermost layer of stainless steel reinforcement, reduced
					to chloride ion penetration, increased corrosion of reinforcement, can be said that
					the maintenance of durability of concrete towers and pay greater attention to service
					life of 120 years. Shell is not stainless steel shell instead of ordinary carbon
					steel, to further improve the bridge tower design and enhance the durability of metal
					finishes, without new surface coating for steel structure on a regular basis. 

					Extending bridge main span and side spans of 49.75 m long section of steel box beam
					structure, two girder beams together, in the main cross-section spacing is 18 m,
					and the side spans part of the pitch was 15 m. Air humidity are controlled within
					the deck box, provides relative humidity lower than 60% environment. This will-effectively
					prevent inner corrosion in the steel box, thereby reducing the outer layer with precision
					anti-corrosion measures needed. Dehumidification system operating in the deck are
					expected to cost less than a new paint layer of costs. 

4. The Durability Design of Main Girder 

					Our bridge engineering is increasingly concerned about the structure durability of
					concrete cable-stayed bridge. Taking the Ningbo Yongjiang bridge as an example, the
					original design of the bridge is a long-span concrete cable-stayed bridge of 468
					m, [Fig. 5.46 (a)] as shown in the tendons concrete bilateral main ribs. In the preliminary
					design review, expert review committee does not support the bilateral section of
					the main rib bridge programme, is a major reason why it existed had durability problems
					found. According to experts recommendations of the CRIC, the design from the original
					concrete combination deck to deck, that is, two steel box girder with prestressed
					concrete slab, as shown in Fig. 5.46(b) shown below. Obviously, mixed beams of concrete-filled
					steel box girder to completely avoid cracks in the breast, abdomen and diaphragm,
					and prestressed concrete bridge deck slabs for the roof though may crack, but it
					can be replaced in the future, this greatly improves the durability of the structure.
					

					5.4.4 Structural Durability Measures 

					Concept design should consider structural durability measures and the maintenance
					care after bridge completion, take necessary steps against key parts of structures,
					and form the basic ideas of the conservation scheme. 



Fig. 5.46 Ningbo Yongjiang Main beam cross-section (size: m) (a) originally concrete
						bilateral main rib section; (b) eventually steel box girder and concrete composite
						beams. 

1. The Sacrificial Protection 

					For structural components (such as pile and foundation) in a periodic inspection
					and maintenance inaccessible concerned, they add a layer to the sacrificial protection
					is a good idea under certain circumstances, at the expense of the protective layer
					will persist a certain time so that before the protective layer structure members
					do wear from external erosion. 

					Piles are a classic example. Most of the pile can't close inspection after the construction
					is completed. We have concrete, the outer bread with a layer of expense of the steel
					shell, Acosta Bridge, Florida (Acosta Bridge) is one such example. Similarly we can
					also be coated with a layer of steel pile under environmental erosion protection
					layer to withstand a certain period. In San Francisco, Oakland Bay Bridge eastern
					section , this kind of sacrificial protection was used on the surface of steel pipe
					piles. 

					Currently steel pipe wall thickness epoxy powder coating is mostly used as anti-corrosion
					measure to guarantee service life. 

2. Design Details 

					Design details include: 


						high durability concrete, reinforced concrete compaction, increase their ability
						to resist breakage; 

						strengthen the bridge surface drainage and waterproofing layer design, improving

3. Replacement Measures 

					Not every bridge structural unit of life and as long as the bridge's design life.
					If we gave every structural unit life expectancy and the bridge's design life of
					the same, costs may be very high. Design in general, as a matter of routine, in certain
					structural elements can be replaced after a certain time. Supports, expansion joints
					and wearing course fall into this category structure. It can be seen that structural
					unit of easy substitution becomes very important. Any traffic would increase maintenance
					costs, although the costs and life-cycle costs are not an order of magnitude. One
					takes far too long to maintain nearby commercial projects often troubled by serious
					damage. 

4. Ease of Maintenance Measures 

					Ease of maintenance is extremely important and accessible is the first step toward
					maintainability. Caused by human behaviour, and hard to reach compare with invisible
					part, accessible and visible parts can often be checked more frequently and more
					thoroughly. Due to the need of maintenance surface is limited, small box girder beam
					or truss is preferable. Box girder can be formed inside a closed space through machinery
					and equipment to provide ventilation, controlled humidity and temperature. 

					Another way to help achieve the maintainability issues is to display a warning sign
					before a problem actually occurs. For example, there are two types of cable-stayed
					bridge cable methods of changing colour, either use a coloured thin layer over a
					black base layer of double-layer PE pipe, or wrap on top of a black tube with a layer
					of colored PVF, in many cases, the latter is better because wrapped taping for PE
					tube provides a layer of coat, if there is damage, coats get stripped, attracting
					attention for maintenance and repair. 

5. Inspection and Maintenance Facility 

					Tower conservation and repair lifts, ladders and simple platform setting, should
					be available in cable tower, and equipped with lighting and fire setting device,
					towers should be reserved for laying cables on embedded parts for repair, replace
					the corresponding facilities, as necessary to reach the site and channel should be
					set ladder and guardrail repair. 

					Closed flat streamlined steel box beam structure, stiffened a lot inside the box,
					if the paint anti-corrosion, maintenance painting work and because of the steel box
					beam inside a closed environment, difficult volatile solvents for paints and construction
					and maintenance personnel's working environment is very inferior. Corrosion of the
					steel box girder internal layout dehumidifier light are commonly used as antiseptic
					and protection system, internal requires steel box girder the humidity is less than
					50%. 

					In order to facilitate the operational phase of the bridge maintenance and construction
					of steel box girder of steel box girder of circular seam welding, large steel box
					girder bridge beams are required to set the maintenance vehicle. Maintenance vehicle
					based on the main girder structure, are commonly used as cantilever-mounted crane
					programme, namely, driving through steel wheel poured into I-steel track, trusses
					are connected by a door frame and drive mechanisms. Driving mechanism of general
					electric and manual. Electric one requires sliding transmission line , its price
					is higher than a manual one.

BRIDGE STRUCTURE SYSTEM AND KEY MECHANICS QUESTIONS 

6.1 BRIDGE STRUCTURAL SYSTEM 

6.1.1 Bridge Structure System and its Classification 

Architecture is a structural unity of function, shape and stress pattern. 

Structure and function of architecture is the first hierarchy, such as function of
the building structure is for the living space of the form must be primarily surrounding
structure; bridges function is for people to cross the obstacles and objects (rivers,
valleys, etc.), main span structure. 

The second structure is a hierarchy system, according to the structure, the bridge
structure can be divided into four basic system: beam, arch-suspension bridges, cable-stayed
bridge system. Forms can also be further sub-divided under the same bridge, such
as the tower's few cable-stayed bridges can be divided into single-tower cable-stayed
bridge, twin and multi-tower cable-stayed bridge with cable-stayed bridges and so
on. When among the various systems in combination with each other, but also derived
the cable-stayed suspension system, cable-stayed continuous rigid frame-continuous
beam or collaboration system. 

Loading form is the third level of the structure system, stress patterns include
delivery of loads within the structure and its internal forces status on balance,
it is the kernel of structure. Even within the same form of bridge system structure
loading remains very diverse, its most influencing factors can be categorised into
three areas: external constraints on the structure, such as the structure is statically
determinated the temperature, support sink on the effects of structural systems;
connections between main load bearing structures (transfer) forms, such as the tower
of cable-stayed bridges, connection of beam, pier will be affect the structure transmission
of loads; stress distribution between the main components, such as the arch flexible
beams, arches, rigid beam and flexible arches divided into rigid beams. 

From the above three levels to define the structure and system of bridges and other
structures can be distinguished, and systems to bridge the outline and basic mechanical
properties, but also lays the groundwork for systematic study of bridge structure
system. 

According to the above definition and hierarchical relationships, bridge structure

Study of bridge structure system is to find out its mechanical properties in order
to carry out system of bridge structure and apply to practical engineering according
to local conditions. 

6.1.2 Evaluation Standards for Bridge System Quality 

A certain bridge structural system corresponds to its unique mechanical properties.
But the same structure used in different occasions may be good, or it may be bad.
Therefore, clear criteria for judging quality of bridge structural system is particularly
important. 

First the reasonable structure span. Each bridge has its range of reasonable span,
simply-supported beam cannot exceed 100 meters, otherwise it is uneconomical or impossible;
vice-versa, unless for special requirements such as landscape, it's hard to imagine
long-span suspension bridge system is used in bridge with a span of only dozens of
meters. Any approaches or exceeds the span record in the system will be require careful
assessment, a system beyond the record in general is more expensive and difficult
to implement in the short term. 

Secondly, the system must adapt to the geological and hydrological conditions at
the location of the bridge. Force structure the first aspects to which it corresponds
the outside world structure system constraints. Such as: soft ground area should
not be resist horizontal force, hence the thrust arch is generally not reasonable
options, foundation bearing capacity under the condition of high in the mountains,
have thrust arch tend to also be the best programme. 

Furthermore, the system internals transfer effectiveness is also important, it corresponds
to the force structure forms the second aspect of internal connection forms between
the components. For example, the large-span cable-stayed bridge in the form of talianglian,
hope floats under temperature effect to release the temperature stress, while in
vertical static wind load consolidation system wants to reduce tower loading, system
selection selection should be based on the situation at the bridge, and find out
the principal contradiction, can overcome the principal contradiction of the system,
and for a variety of spears shields are more prominent, main beam limiting device
is used in the project, in the context of a given can be freely modified, to displacement
limits to become consolidation system, a reasonable solution under a variety of loading
force demand contradiction. 

Also, the collocation rationality of rigidity of the system may reflect their strengths
and weaknesses. This corresponds to force form the third structures: stress distribution
between the components. In a good architecture system, not only all the structural
components share optimal stiffness distribution but also bear mechanical load in
a balanced manner, although it is impossible to reach the ideal state of equal strength,
but at least it should guarantee the mechanical safety components differ. 

To sum up, no absolute standard for evaluation of bridge system. Determining bridge
system must be combine the requirements of integrated considered, and finally make
the best choice. 

Following Tianjin guotai bridge design in the system of selecting, for example, illustrate
the applicability of bridge evaluation criteria mentioned above. 

Guotai bridge, a bridge across the Haihe river in Tianjin, 4 internationally renowned
design firms compete, truss arch bridges (Fig. 6.1) standard, successful units with
arch system (Fig. 6.2), the study shows that key has the following problems: 


For soft soil ground in Tianjin, and arch not only horizontal force on the basis
of the system, there is a large bending moment, seismic and long-term load effects
were negative, and this is the principal contradiction in the system and condition
of building the bridge; 

In order to reduce the annual effect of temperature on the structure and need to
set a Corbel arch-beam, horizontal thrust long level pull cable under deck setting
you want multi-channel expansion joint, makes the structure of complex, and driving
comfort; 

The bridgehead buildings you pass arch winding tension, under complicated stress
and poor seismic performance of the system. 




Fig. 6.1 Tianjin Guotai bridge. 



Fig. 6.2 Fixed end arch architecture diagram (unit: mm). 

Analysis and research on the basis of the programme, the principal contradiction
is grasped, determine the structure of the new system: the middle three-span thrust
free arch-beam composite system (Fig. 6.3). Fully preserves the original scheme of
the system's function and landscape modelling, by changing the connection mode of
outside constraints and internal components of the system, improve the behaviour
of structure: 



Fig. 6.3 Sketch of girder and arch combination structure system with three-span non
thrust design (unit: mm). 


modification became hinged arch at the foot of solid, release the horizontal constraint,
based only on vertical and horizontal girders bear; 

structures freely in the horizontal direction, so annual range of temperature has
less influence, arch-beam used in consolidation, deck without increasing expansion
joints; 

the bridgehead building separate from the main structure, landscape and ballast only,
system performance is much improved. 


Two structure such as shown in Table 6.2, after optimisation, mechanical performance
will be significantly improved not only the structure and make the whole engineering
cost reduced.

6.1.3 Mechanical Properties of Various Systems 

As mentioned earlier, bridges are classified as beam bridges, arch bridges, cable-stayed
bridge, a suspension bridge with four basic system, each system has its special some
mechanical characteristics. 

Warping (Fig. 6.4) is a vertical structure of anhydrous rehabilitated under the action
of load, because the force is exerted and axis of the structure nearly perpendicular,
so compared with other structures of the same span, bridge bending moment within
the maximum usually takes tensile properties of materials used to build it. 



Fig. 6.4 Beam bridge. 

Arch bridge (Fig. 6.5) the main load-bearing structure is arch or arch. Traditional
arch bridge under the action of vertical loads, piers and bridges the horizontal
thrust and piers provide arch with a pair of horizontal force, the basic offset within
the arch is composed of horizontal force load moment, so arch is the main structure
of stress. Compared with equal-span beams, bending moment, shear force and deformation
of arch a much smaller, can take full advantage of good tensile properties and compressive
properties of masonry materials (stone, concrete, etc.). In addition, beam bridge
differences before closing lower because of failure to maintain balance and thus
must rely on the support, in the construction of arch bridge cable-stayed cable of
auxiliary support measures. Thrust arch built-in the ground conditions are not appropriate
for cases, or you can build the horizontal thrust of the horizontal bar withstand
thrust free arch bridge [Fig. 6.5(d), (e)]. 

Cable-stayed bridges (Fig. 6.6) consists of the foundation, the main tower, girder
and cable composition. Main beam of inclined cable tension to provide more flexible
support, and passing girders bear the load to the main tower, and then spread to
the base of the tower. Tower is basically dominated by compression. Large master
girder works like a multi-point continuous beams with elastic supports. Because of
the horizontal force of cable-stayed, girder foundation the force character is eccentric,
Yu Liang-type bridge, girder size greatly reduced structural weight significantly
reduced, greatly improves the diagonal laqiao's crossing ability. In addition, towers,
cables and main beams form a stable triangle, greater structural rigidity of cable-stayed
bridge. 



Fig. 6.5 Arch bridge. 



Fig. 6.6 Cable-stayed bridge. 

Suspension bridge (Fig. 6.7) is a powerful main cables suspended between the towers
on either side as the main load-bearing structure. Vertical load on the bridge by
Suspender cables under a lot of tension, in anchorage in suspension bridge main cable
at both ends. In order to withstand the huge main cable pull anchorage structure
is normally required to do very big (gravity anchorage), or rely on the natural integrity
of rock to withstand the horizontal force (tunnel anchorage). Relative to the former
system, suspension stiffness is a flexible structure. Under external loads, the suspension
bridge by larger variants in order to achieve the balance of forces. 

For a variety of system, its mechanical feature naturally inherited the basic mechanics
characteristics of systems. For example, cable-suspended collaboration systems in
different parts of the structure mechanics characteristics of cable-stayed and suspension
bridge, respectively. Combination systems are concentrating on is how to implement
a different system of "seamless connectivity", that is, at the junction of different
systems, great properties for its change shall be monographic study and adopt structural
measures to solve related problems. For example, cable-stayed-suspension system side
sling struggles labour has attracted the attention of scholars, arch girder and arch
combination system of complex stress states shall take special countermeasures in
the design. 



Fig. 6.7 Suspension bridge. 

6.1.4 System Innovation 

Bridge structural system of innovation is fundamental to meet the specific conditions
of building the bridge structural system change, group, or its innovative work on
change of force patterns. Because of system innovation, there is a bridge between
today's rich and varied structure. Structural changes can radically change the structure
of the system of mechanical properties, so as to break through the bottleneck of
the structure itself. 

Because of its traditional arch bridge arch at the foot of horizontal force, it can
hardly be applied in soft soil foundation greatly hampered its development. In order
to avoid the influence of arch the thrust on the basis, developed part of thrust
and thrust free arch bridge (Fig. 6.8). 

Selections below are to introduce several of bridge engineering system innovation
success stories. 

Example 6.1. Beam bridge system double-line bridge of shibanpo Changjiang River Bridge
Chongqing. 

Chongqing Shibanpo Yangtze River Bridge (Fig. 6.9), built-in 1981, with a hanging
beam of pre-stressed concrete T-shaped rigid frame bridge long combined span of 86.5
m + 4 × 138 m + 156 m + 174 m + 104.5 m. To meet the traffic demand in existing old
bridge build a new continuous rigid frame bridge of double-line bridge of Shibanpo
Changjiang River Bridge. By channel experts argues that the main span of the new
bridge will be 292 m waterway must clear width. Taking into account the new bridge
and old bridge pier locations corresponding to requirements, only the 156 m and get
rid of 174 m between the two main span piers, so the main span of the new bridge
span to 330 m, breaking the steel girder bridge span in the world record—300 m, box-girder
roof and floor will be become thicker, creating difficult and economically reasonable;
the new bridge span also break concrete girder bridges span the world record 301
m, light weight concrete must be used, but the aggregate imports economically unreasonable,
domestic conduct their own testing is expensive and time consuming. 

Therefore, changing the material composition of the main beam, main span uses steel
girders replacing the lightweight concrete plan would eventually be adopted. By calculation,
330 m adopt steel box girder for main span of one-third makes the top of pile under
negative bending moment decrease about one-third, which is about the domestic implemented
270 m pier of long span concrete beam bridge bending moment, so at the current level
is suitable under some conditions for this scenario. 



Fig. 6.8 Bridge diagrams (a) thrust system; (b) part of the thrust system; (c), three-span
continuous lift system; (d) simple support without thrust system. 



Fig. 6.9 Double-line bridge of Shibanpo Changjiang River Bridge. 

But this does not mean that the steel beams in the middle period of the longer the
better. In terms of cost, steel box girders is more expensive, their length, greater
the difference larger in terms of construction, hoping to integral lifting of steel
box beam segment, both in weight and has some limitations. After overall consideration,
determine cross-beams in a length of 103 m, plus the ends of the steel-concrete combined
sections, the whole cross-beams length is 108 m, weighs 1400t. 

In addition, double-line bridge of Shibanpo Changjiang River Bridge a total length
of 1103.5 m, as shown in Fig. 6.10. With Master Liang Gu knots side Pier will be
bear too much horizontal force for this system as middle using a combination of rigid
frame, side pier of continuous girder system. 



Fig. 6.10 Double-line bridge of Shibanpo Changjiang River Bridge in general layout
(size: m). 

Double-line bridge of Shibanpo Changjiang River Bridge in the main span without use
of lightweight concrete, but breaking with steel beams instead a concrete beam, through
material changes in the composition of main girders, to vary the winner Liang Heng
load distribution, thus opening up the steel-pre-stressed concrete continuous rigid-frame
bridge this bridge, on economy, safety, durability and so on to meet the premise,
solution summary of continuous rigid frame bridge of long-span 300 m problems. 

Example 6.2. Arch bridge system of Chongqing Caiyuanba Yangtze River Bridge. 

Chongqing Caiyuanba Yangtze River Bridge is the first orbital dual-use of King Road,
city of steel and concrete composite rigid frame structure and tied-arch bridge (Figs.
6.11 & 6.12 ). 



Fig. 6.11 Chongqing Caiyuanba bridge. 



Fig. 6.12 Overall layout of Chongqing Caiyuanba bridge (size: m). 

Because it is public rail-cum-road bridge, decide to beam must reach 11 m, rigid
beam, Liang Rou arch system is used. Before This, almost all of deck tied arch bridge
in side span all columns to support the weight of the beam [Fig. 6.13(b)]). But in
the vegetable garden dam bridge, rigidity and side spans only 102 m, so the primary
beam can span the entire side without column support, side span became very open,
light weight of the bridge presents its elegance. 



Fig. 6.13 Comparison of supporting tied side arch span with or without pole sets
(a) Caiyuanba bridge across no pole; (b) common bridges across any vertical poles.


After removing the post, side spans of arch ribs no longer subjected to vertical
loads, and can be made into a straight bar, arch bridge structure can be used at
the lower portion of the Y-shaped the concrete structure, under the continual fluctuations
in water level do not require special conservation as well as steel. Three pole pieces
large y-shaped structure seems solid, steady, and increase impact resistance capacity.


In this way, in terms of structure, caiyuanba bridge consists of three elements:
a Y-shaped pre-stressed concrete rigid frame on each side and the steel box tied
arch bridge in the middle (Fig. 6.14), the calculation so as to allow the centre
of bowstring arch span is reduced from 420 m to 320 m and improves overall efficiency
while reducing a key substructure design more difficult. 



Fig. 6.14 Y-shaped rigid-frame structure and tied-arch load path diagram. 

Compatible with the three independent units, this bridge has also been used in the
design of vertical isolation system tie rod, vertical tie bar divided into cross-tie
bar and side span bow string, and anchor its independence. On this basis, and additional
vertical tie bar at side pier. Three sets of independent tie rod systems are available
in the implementation process of the main body of the bridge (rigid frames and the
main arch) force and the adjustment of the linear space control: under constant load
by adjusting the frame on each side of the tie rod and the tail end of the vertical
cable, rigid rod bending torque to reduce and regulate the bowstring cable force
of arch in the middle, perfectly balanced horizontal thrust, only vertical forces
on both sides of the Y-shaped rigid structure. At constant load under three separate,
and consider this to achieve an optimal stress. Since then, under the live load action,
tied with other the longitudinal member according to the level of stiffness distribution
of force. But due to live load accounts for only a fraction of the total load, there
would be no essential impact on the system as a whole. 

In short, Caiyuanba bridge through structural innovation in the system, separate
tie rod using active control technology enhanced material efficiency rate, saving
a lot of permanent structural steel. 

Example 6.3. Cable-stayed bridge system—Greece Rion-Antirion Bridge. 

Rion-Antirion Bridge (Fig. 6.15) across Greece Corinth isthmus, composite girder
cable-stayed bridge of main bridge for more tower bridge continuous, using floating
five-span structure, span consists of 286 m + 3 × 560 m + 286 m (Fig. 6.16). 



Fig. 6.15 Rion-Antirion Bridge. 



Fig. 6.16 Overall layout of Rion-Antirion Bridge (size: m). 

The bridge construction is very complex, requiring bridge can handle upto 2000 years
of seismic, the maximum peak ground acceleration 1.2 g the bridge can withstand maximum
2 m of vertical and horizontal fault displacement, as well as 180,000 DWT tankers
to 8.2 m/s velocity of impact force and strong winds. 

Apparently, the site conditions suitable for the construction of a suspension bridge,
but the geographic conditions eliminated the suspension bridge scheme in the conceptual
design phase. In order to make the bridge is feasible, and the overall cost can be
received, select bridge beam and gaps must limit the number of piers in the middle.
Finally chose to have 3 across all of 560 m, 2 side spans of 286 m cable-stayed bridge
as designed. 

Found great difficulty in the design of cable-stayed bridge pier foundation. Foundations
at depths greater than 60 m, while resisting a huge the seismic forces, where bad
scope 20 m deep sea bed soil mechanical properties, so you must take special bridge
pier foundation structure. 

Main bridge tower foundations ultimate structure is shown in Fig. 6.17, using 90
m in diameter of circular reinforced concrete raft foundation. To improve the performance
of soil, took 25~30 m, diameter 2 m steel pipe based on 7~8 m spacing, soil reinforcement,
each under a pier, there are about 250 steel piles. To allow sliding between the
foundation and the foundation laying on the pole 50 cm with filter sand, laying on
the thick and 2 m in diameter for 10~80 cm pebble layer, the top lay thick gravel
layer 50 cm. In this way, bridge foundations are put gravel on the total thickness
of 3 m above, connections between the foundation and the gravel is weak, may be produced
when the earthquake up left and right to move (But in the operational phase and small
earthquakes without sliding), plays the role of isolation, which formed the basis
of an innovative for the sliding of the "reinforced earth base isolation" (reinforced
soil foundation). 



Fig. 6.17 Rion-antirion isolation base diagram. 



Fig. 6.18 Pier damping system layout diagram. 

Due to seismic requirements, the bridge incorporates a five span continuous structure
of floating. Because the cable is not the main beam to provide effective lateral
support, so the floating system must exert some lateral restraint and reduced live
load and lateral displacement due to temperature. Final installation of an intermediate
connector (fuse restrainer) at each pylon to allow force 10 MN, can be adapted to
the vertical displacement of the bridge 1.6 m in transverse direction is almost not
moving, so when the lateral load does not exceed the design when the ability to hold
the main beam and the lower structure rigidly connected in transverse. Additional
4 sets of viscous damper, each allowing for 3,500 kN adaptable beam tower 1.3 m addendum
modification. When the intermediate connection piece under the action of earthquakes
or storms after the failure, the main beam in viscous resistance free swing under
control, as shown in Fig. 6.18. 

Rion-Antirion Bridge features a "reinforced earth base isolation" and transverse
dampers, couplings, has created for cable-stayed bridge a new system. 

Example 6.4. Suspension bridges system—United States New San Francisco Oakland Bay
Bridge). 

San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge is located in the United States in San Francisco,
East of main bridge for steel cantilever truss bridge in 1989, San Francisco decided
to re-build after the earthquake. 

San Francisco Bay areas, poor geological conditions in the Bay area, the ground surface
with a soft, sticky thick layer of soil covering layer, the seismic stability of
bridge when you become the controlling factor of bridge design. 

Under the current common sense, in the earthquake zone construction of suspension
bridge tower gantry structure should be. When the earthquake came, at Tower cross
can form a plastic hinge at the beam to change lateral stiffness of the structure,
reducing the seismic responses. 

But over the Oakland Bay Bridge project discussions, bay area residents do not want
to build another bridge, the gate tower, and fond of single-column pylon of the programme.
Meanwhile, the owners also demand that the bridge could resume traffic immediately
after an earthquake, requiring bridge due quake damage at repair can go without disrupting
traffic. In the form of the then existing structure, this basic is unlikely to meet
requirements. 

Engineers are under study, breaking the existing concepts, the concept of developing
a shear key. In fact, this idea is a variant of gantry tower. The principle was to
have the tower columns of two in a gate-tower closely placed together (Fig. 6.19).
On the tower beam is very short, became—under the shear yield shear keys, instead
of the usual tower beams in bending yield. And because the two tower is placed within
only a short distance, shear key and doesn't have a problem with a few more, increase
the redundancy of the Tower, strengthening the security of bridges, and instead added
more beauty. 



Fig. 6.19 Changes of bridge tower form. 



Fig. 6.20 Main tower section. 

Meanwhile, further improvements, the tower is divided into four legs, and connected
them with shear key (Fig. 6.20), outside the tower appears to be single column tower
(Fig. 6.21), but also have excellent seismic performance and design requirements.
In fact, this design's mechanical characteristics are superior to the gantry tower.


San Francisco New Oakland Bay Bridge Towers by changing the connections within the
form, with shear key structural measures effectively resolved seismic problems of
the single tower, its design is very innovative. 

Example 6.5. System of partial cable-stayed bridge without backstays—Kunshan summer
driving River Bridge. 

Summer driving bridge (Fig. 6.22) is located in Kunshan development zone, planned
recreational area at the location of the bridge, so the bridge landscape demand is
higher. 



Fig. 6.21 New San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge. 



Fig. 6.22 Kunshan summer driving River Bridge. 

This bridge spans over the river of with the width of about 50 m, there is a certain
navigation requirements, and therefore determines the span of the bridge in 60 m.
Bridge types to choose from including girder and tied arch bridge, and so on. Main
span simply supported beam of 60 m goes beyond reasonable span; mains even across
60 m continued beam to match the side spans of length 35 m, uneconomic; there is
already more than a dozen tied arch, landscape, and people are not welcome. Therefore
cable-stayed bridge without backstays could be considered. 

The world's first cable-stayed bridge without backstays are designed Alamillo bridge
by Santiago Calavtrava, (See Fig. 6.23). 

Only single tower cable-stayed bridge without backstays lateral funiculus, if mechanical
analysis of bridge tower were taken separately, its mechanical performance of cable
force for cable and of a cantilever beam under the action of gravity, relying on
body weight the overturning moment of torque balance cable. Consolidation with tower,
girder, piers, main beams hinged at the other end, full-bridge for a statically indeterminate
system. 

Cable-stayed bridges without backstays overall balance as shown in the schematic
is shown in Fig. 6.24. Wt is the weight of main tower, lt the distance between tower
gravity center and tower-solid beam end , Wd weight of main girder of, ld the distance
between gravity and the end of tower-solid beam. 



Fig. 6.23 Spain Alamillo bridge. 



Fig. 6.24 Sketch of overall balance of cable-stayed bridge without backstays. 

Cable main beam on the overturning moment of Ta Liang Gu node Md = Wd ld, Tower weight
resistance torque Mt = Wt lt, tugend under dead load, bending moment M = Mt - Md
= Wt lt - Wd ld, to ensure the pylon roots dead load in axial compression state,
Wt lt = Wd ld. In this case, only the main tower structure under live loads and load
moments. 

It is clear that conventional cable-stayed bridge without backstays often towers
self-weight and stiffness are large. Weight is generally used for main girder light
beam in order to reduce the tower's weight, but makes the whole bridge cost increases,
is rarely used in actual projects. 

Summer sail a River Bridge with pre-stressed concrete girders, and by changing the
structure of the internal components of the force, without back-stays partial cable-stayed
bridge system, namely the main girder pre-stressing endured after the load is divided
into two parts: Wd = Wd1 + Wd2, Wd1 tower weight balance by stayed cable transmission
to the leaning tower; Wd2 borne by the main beam (Fig. 6.25). And greatly reduces
the weight requirements, tower light weight, ease of construction, and take full
advantage of the main beam of material, reducing the cost. 



Fig. 6.25 Conventional cable-stayed bridge without backstays and sketch of loading
at non-backstay section. 

Driving medium within the span of the bridge through the river in summer to adjust
the component of force distribution within the structure, using the pre-mix concrete
girders, with a leaning tower of auxiliary forces, while ensuring economic performance
good aesthetic effect is obtained. 

Example 6.6. System of the new structure of super long span cable-supported bridges.

Traditional super long span cable-supported bridges—a cable-stayed bridge [Fig. 6.26(a)]
and suspension bridge [Fig. 6.26(b)] two systems have emerged in recent years cable-stayed-suspension
system [Fig. 6.26(c)] and partly anchored cable-stayed bridge [Fig. 6.26(d)]. By
studying the above systems, one may conceive partly anchored cable-stayed suspension
system [Fig. 6.26(e)]. It is not difficult to imagine, the system will both parts
of main girder of cable-stayed bridge with reduced axial force and anchored cable-stayed-suspension
advantages of cooperative system spanning large and become a more long-span van restricted
bridge could be considered.

(b) suspension bridges; (c) cable-stayed-suspension system; (d) partially anchored

Separately, there is already a multi-tower cable-stayed bridge [Fig. 6.27(a)] and
multiple-tower suspension bridge [Fig. 6.27(b)], can be conceived multi-tower cable-stayed-suspension
system [Fig. 6.27 (c)] based on total anchored suspension bridge [Fig. 6.28(a)] idea,
conceived two series of common anchor system, one for "combo" system, as shown in
Fig. 6.28(b)and (d) shown in second for "mutual combination" system, as shown in
Fig. 6.29(a) and (c) as shown, and continues to expand. This structure for super
long span cable-supported bridge offers a variety of options and new ideas.

Through the above described can be seen: clear structures and contents, and lay the
foundations for bridge structural system; analysis of bridge structural system of
force, force transmission route, can be provide clear direction for rational selection
of bridge structure system, may also be looking for method of bridge structural system
innovation; system for optimising the force structure, reduction of construction
investment, construction convenient, reduced maintenance costs, and meet the needs
of engineering, extending the applicable conditions is very important meaning for
the construction of the bridge. And bridge system space is vast, systems change can
bring new life into this ancient engineering of the bridge. 

6.2 IMPORTANT DESIGN PARAMETER OPTIMISATION AND ADJUSTMENT 

6.2.1 Classification of Design Parameters of Bridge Structures 

Design parameters of bridge structure can be divided into general layout parameters
and system parameters. General layout parameters primarily deal with structures description,
the main span and side spans of cable-stayed bridges, high towers and the cross-ratio,
beam and cross-ratio and wide-span ratio is in the design of cable-stayed bridge
indexes. System parameters refer to the same type of bridge with different loading
systems, such as external constraints, internal connections, etc. Different bridge
structures differ greatly in structural design parameters. Bridge design parameters
not only reflects the structure of the bridge structure system external form, but
also reflects the bridge structure under load forces and their stress response. Table
6.3 shows the four basic types of the main structure of the bridge design parameters.


Various parameters of bridge structures (General layout of system parameters and
parameters) interact with each other. Structure parameters determine the shape of
the structure, load, resistance and stress patterns. Meanwhile, adjust and optimise
the structural parameters, can be changed. Variable structure properties, the mechanical
properties of structural and economic performance status.

6.2.2 Effects of Design Parameters on Structure Loading 

1. General Layout Parameters Affect the Structure of 

Parameter change form has different structural shapes, and affects the structure
of the force. Such as tower cable-stayed bridge to span ratio changes that will be
affect the force of cable-stayed bridges. 

Example 6.7. A cable-stayed bridge with a main span of 1400 m programme, the towers
span ratio, respectively taken as 0.21 and 0.16, compared with its mechanical properties.
General layout as shown in Fig. 6.30. 

Fig. 6.31 shows results of analysis of the main beam constant load axial force. 

Main beam buckling under various load safety factors are shown in Table 6.4. 

Tower height and span of the bridge (Tower) by 0. 21 to 0.16, the reasonable finished
dead state of cable has increased 26%, the bridge towers mounted on the main beam
axis increased by 34% (Fig. 6.31); live load tower under the action of horizontal
displacement 21% and a main span of vertical displacement 22%, column, beam, cable's
internal force increases in about 40%; tower height reduced, stability of pylons
is clearly improved, but the stability of main beam was significantly reduced (Table
6.4). Cross-ratio decreases and cable angle decreases and cables on the main beam
with elastic supports weakened, resulting in the aforementioned force sensitivity
reactions.

(size: m).

This shows that the towers and the cross-ratio is one of the most important parameters
of cable-stayed bridge in cable-stayed bridge design should take a reasonable height
ratio. 

2. Effects of General Layout Parameters on Structure Loading 

Similarly shaped structure by changing system parameters, will be produce different
patterns of force, from external constraints, internal company joint stiffness distribution
of these three aspects of the mechanical effect of system parameters on the structure.


(a) External Constraints 

External constraints implemented through structural supports, different support forms
of influence on the behaviours of structures are different. [11] three supported
forms of main bridge of Chongqing chaotianmen Yangtze river provided a detailed comparative
analysis of results as shown in Table 6.5.

2. The Components Connection 

Internal connection of components is an important system parameters, it changes the
same mechanical form of bridge structure can be changed. Large span taliang cable-stayed

Comparison results can be seen from the Table 6.6: compared with float system, Ta
Liang Gu pairing in the primary beam vertical stiffness effect is large, but significantly
increased the longitudinal stiffness of the structure. Floating system frees up horizontal
forces caused by temperature, but longitudinal wind and steam tower of the vehicle
braking force bending moment at the end is 1.9 times and 4.8 times larger than the
consolidation system. Set a certain bridge tower vertical elastic constraints with
certain rigidity, on the one hand by live loads can be reduced, and vertical wind
turbine and tower of automobile braking force taliang and bending moment at the end
of the horizontal displacement. The other hand, compared with the consolidation system,
released system significantly effect of temperature stress on bottom bending moment.


Some of the more typical engineering tower cable-stayed bridge, the beam pattern
is shown in Table 6.7. 

Arch system, connections within the structure of influence of loading form is very
obvious. Fig. 6.33 shows the same arch of reamless arch and single arch, two-hinged
arch, three-hinged arch under the same load bearing forms.

(b) single hinged arched; (c) of two-hinged arch; (d) three-hinged arch. 

3. The Stiffness Distribution 

Component stiffness type also have an impact on the structure patterns of force.
Through simple support girder and arch combination system, for example, analysis
showed that uniform load acting on the flyover, vault, beam, Derrick's stiffness
on structural mechanical behavior effects are as follows:

Alongwith increase in bending stiffness of arch rib, increased uniformity of suspender
force and suspenders to one-fourth across the nearby boom pulling force reduction,
small suspender force increased bending rigidity increase of arch ribs, arch spans
the central axis decreases, moment magnification, bending moment decrease when Earch
Iarch/(Earch Iarch) changing between 1~10 and structure changed a little, but when
Earch Iarch/(Earch Iarch) >10, arch rib axial forces significantly decreased,
in cross-bending moment increases sharply. 

With the increase in bending stiffness, arch passes the load decreases, tie beams
transfer loads increased beam span moment magnification, and arch rib in the axial
force and bending moment decrease; when Earch Iarch/(Earch Iarch) at 0.1 to 10 when
the structure changes small, but when Earch Iarch/(Earch Iarch) >10. Trans-axial
forces significantly decreased, beams in bending moment increases sharply. 

Boom axial stiffness on structural properties of available hanging suspendershanging stiffness parameter  to reflect beams, suspended
when  in 1~1 000 changes, Derrick obviously rigidity, stiffness
of the system increase. Tie beams uniformly distributed load, trans-axial force increases, and arch ribs and bending moment decrease when  after Derrick stiffness decreases, can basically be ignored. When hanging EAhang

the side hangers axial stiffness, can significantly improve the inhomogeneity of
suspender force.



Therefore, a reasonable percentage change major component stiffness of structural
system and structural performance can be optimised. 

6.2.3 Design Parameter Optimization and Adjustment 

During the conceptual design phase, how to determine if bridge's main structure parameters
and component size, or in determining the structure detected after an item index
not upto design requirements (including do not meet the requirements), how to adjust
parameters to improve indicators of concern are two very important questions. 

Relationship between structural parameters of bridge and structural response is complex
and difficult to describe a specific function. Beginning of bridge design, designers
always seek to meet the conditions of the structure parameters and structure parameters
of a reasonable solution, but the not a direct, intuitive, but repeated, complex.
Is the search for reasonable design parameters of design parameters optimisation
and adjustment. 

Primary goal is to make the design of design parameter adjustments meet the requirements
of the code, namely, strength, stiffness, fatigue and durability, economics of demand,
while meeting various external constraints. Design parameter's ultimate goal is to
seek to meet design of optimal parameters of structure parameter optimisation. 

Under a pedestrian bridge to illustrate methods of optimisation of design parameters.


Example 6.8. A hingeless arch footbridge spans the 70 m rise 8 m rise span ratio
1/8.75, design effect is shown in Fig. 6.34. 

The arch bridge design of concrete filled steel tubular structures, pipe 20 mm outer
diameter, 800 mm wall thickness, padding C40 concrete, as shown in Fig. 6.35. By
the analysis of the following issues: (a) on the bridge was constructed in soft earth
foundation under horizontal force great; (b) using concrete-filled steel tube arch
rib structure increases the weight, but also increases the horizontal thrust of arch;
(c) bridge self-vibration frequency rate is small, cannot meet the pedestrian bridge
design specifications. Optimization of design parameters of the bridge. 



Fig. 6.34 Pedestrian arch bridge design renderings. 



Fig. 6.35 Design cross-sections (unit: cm). 

While maintaining the original bridge design based on mechanics characteristics of
reamless arch bridge, reducing weight is to reduce the horizontal thrust efficient
way, but also improve the frequency key. Optimisation scheme using an empty pipe
section of the bridge, and dimensions of the pipe cross-section the most optimal
solution. Following typical mathematical model is constructed as follows: 



In the formula: X = variables; 

gi(X) = constraints; 

f(X) = the objective function. 

Main arch ring of outer tube wall thickness and diameter Ds Ts as a design variable
structure self-vibration frequency and maximum stress as mainly around bundle conditions
with total weight of steel as the objective function. 

Results for the diameter of 1.2 m, 18 mm steel wall thickness as the final solution,
optimised bridge structures safe and suitable for general premise, steel consumption
at least, integrated its cost optimised solution is superior economy. 

In design, as the parameters of the diversity and complexity of the objective function,
you seldom work directly with structural parameter optimization method to determine
design parameters, more of a design method of adjusting parameters. Parameter adjustments
can be summarised in three ways: the experience method, analytical method, the parameter
analysis method. 

1. Experience Method 

Experience is established on the basis of experience in the design, use sum engineering
statistics, identify design parameters of a reasonable range of values to guide the
design of the new bridge. This method of bridge structures with regular system is
the most convenient way. 



Fig. 6.36 Uniform radial load of uniform cross-section circular arch. 

For example, we design high beam, girder how big is it? Experience has shown that
its height-span ratio in the range 1/15~1/30 are feasible, but often controlled within
1/18~1/20 to the design, which is proven by the reasonable, economic height-span
ratio. 

In Article 6.4.2, the reasonable scale of conventional bridges described is the value
of experience in conceptual design of the structure parameters. Because this approach
is based on completed projects, and new complex structures and bridges are not necessarily
effective. 

2. Analytical Method 

Analytical method is through theoretical mechanics obtain design parameters and mechanical
values of relationships, a methods used to make adjustments to the design parameters.
This method requires designers have good mechanical skills and deep understanding
of the structural system. 

For example, we want to improve radial load lower sectional arch (Fig. 6.36) of the
in-plane buckling factor analytical method can be used to export its critical load


Expression: , where K and rise span ratio  and arch hinge
related to the number, as shown in Table 6.8.

Table 6.8 data indicated that decreased with increased number of hinge the stability
of arch; various arches of critical loads in ξ is 0.3, maximum, this is because the
ξ-hour arc length is short but high pressure, pressure at large ξ is small but the
arc length is longer. 

Therefore, the formula derived by analytical method, methods of improving qcr increasing
EIx, strengthen internal and border around harness changing the ratio of height to
span. What specific measures can be determined according to the actual situation.


3. The Parameter Analysis Method 

For more complex power relationships, parameters and structural response, analytic
expression is very difficult, you can use numerical analysis to complete parameter
adjustment. 

Parameters analysis is conducted through the bridge design parameters of quantitative
parameters, and each parameter and structure the numerical relations of the response,
which can curve a graphical representation or expression values. 

Example 6.9. In designing some of the anchored cable-stayed bridge with a main span
of 1400 m (Fig. 6.37) the time required to find the ground anchor main beam length
range. To main beam length of anchoring segment for parameters, analysing the impact
of changes to the force structure. The length at 0~1400 m changes between (0, 200
m, 400 m, 600 m, 800 m, 1 100 m, 1400 m), end span also makes a corresponding adjustment.
To main beam length of anchoring segment for different computational models can carry
out a detailed analysis of live load effects, results are shown in Fig. 6.38. 



Fig. 6.37 General layout scheme of cable stayed bridge with a main span of 1400 m
(size: m). 

Results showed that anchor main beam length is increased, the principal bending moment
decrease, main beam length of anchoring segment for more than 400 m changes flattens;
main beam stress in axial force decreases tension increases; bending moment decrease
main tower, main beam length of anchoring segment for more than 600 m changes flattens;
main column axial force changes little; main pylon of main beam displacement and
displacement, main beam length of anchoring segment for more than 600 m changes slowly.
Therefore, a main span of 1400 m partially anchored cable-stayed bridge anchor section
main beam length in the 400~600 m is reasonable. 

If you want to further optimise the mechanical indices, you can refer to the trends
of the curve obtained, the main beam length of anchoring segment for minor adjustment.

6.3 CONSTRUCTION METHOD SELECTION AND SAFETY IDENTIFICATION 

6.3.1 The Construction Method of Bridge Structures 

Design and construction of bridge structures are inextricably linked, and in order
to do a design, designers must have conventional construction methods and new construction
technology. 

Common construction methods are: overall construction method of cast in situ and
pre-cast-install method by span construction method of cantilever construction method,
turn construction method of jacking construction method, shifting method, lifting

6.3.2 Relations between Construction Method and Structure Bearing 

Constant load stress of bridge structures and construction methods are closely related.
Construction methods, dead load stress is different. Below is a case study of continuous
girder bridge and illustrate the use of dead load stress in different construction
methods (Figs. 6.39 and 6.45). 

Framing in situ method is used during the construction phase I dead load and dead
load effect in terms of once full continuous bridge structure on the building, main
girder structure at this time is the ultimate system, superimposing these two will
get the final construction phase of the internal forces of constant load use simply
supported. Continuous construction method, a dead load on the system of simply supported,
two dead loads acting on the continuum, each segment without stress superposition
with the construction phase, will be eventually constant load; when using span-by-span
construction method, a period of constant load distribution in framing between casting
method and the method of simply supported-continuous, internal forces of each construction
stage stack getting a constant load, phase II constant load the same way as simple
supported-continuous; when using incremental launching construction, changing structures
in the process of thrusting, so girder has been changed, a period of constant load
is pushing the structure in place of the internal forces, two dead loads acting on
the final row on the system using balanced cantilever construction method, internal
forces of cantilever construction produced by the constant load distribution close
to the force on the cantilever bridge state, cantilever bending moment of beam span
the negative moment of the transfer as a fulcrum, greatly improving the bridge span.

Fig. 6.42 Cantilever construction of continuous beam constant load internal forces
diagram. 



Fig. 6.43 Incremental launching construction continuous beam ridge pivot bending
moment diagram. 

Creep effects after the bridge, re-distribution associated with construction methods
and duration, and live load stress condition and construction of structures has nothing
to do. 

The construction and design of bridge structure has a very close relationship, on
the different structures used in construction of bridge structures methods can be
different, the same structural form may use different construction methods. During
the conceptual design phase, must take full account of construction methods, through
proper construction techniques ensure that the design is achieved. Meanwhile, development
of construction technology of the bridge, in order to achieve bridge design, offers
a flexible and powerful tool, as well as increased span, improved structure and the
use of new materials, provided the necessary conditions. Therefore, the design and
construction are complementary, mutually binding. 



Fig. 6.44 Cantilever construction of continuous beam constant load internal forces
diagram. 



Fig. 6.45 Incremental launching construction continuous beam ridge pivot bending
moment diagram. 

Bridge system is complex, and often fail to press the picture and complete the construction,
and need to go through a number of structural system of transfer change. Therefore,
when considering design, taking into account the possibility of construction, economics
and rationality. 

With vertical pre-stressed reinforcement of continuous beam configuration below to
illustrate the relationship between design and construction methods. 

Layout of vertical pre-stressed reinforcement of continuous beam under different
construction methods are: sub-paragraph continuous reinforcement, reinforcement,
and so on. 

1. Continuously Reinforcement 

Construction of cast in situ continuous beam, longitudinal pre stressing tendons
in accordance with distribution in all parts of the force requirements of the bridge
beams. Usually quantity in the line up of the parabolic trajectory. As Fig. 6.46(a),
as l1 l2 l3 l4 shown in the side across and are made up (a) of multi-section parabola,
and anti-between inflection points of the curve. Reinforced concrete according to
figure 6 layout can be considered as in Fig. 6.46(b)) shows, which close to the fulcrum
by negative bending moment area turned to positive bending moment areas, while the
bending point of view slightly (b) weakened, but near the fulcrum cross-section shear resistance is greatly improved.




Fig. 6.46 Continuously reinforced rib layout. 

2. Fragmented Reinforcement 

Piecewise is cantilevered construction of reinforcement and construction of simply
supported-continuous continuous most commonly used reinforced concrete beams. 

Cantilever construction of continuous girder bridge, is starting from the pier to
the symmetrical cantilever construction, in order to support girders and construction
of self-weight load set out in cantilever construction of pre-stressing requirements.
System when tensioning forces reinforced and complemented other positive moment required
to use phase quantity, this quantity is also called secondary tensioning bars or
late bar. Fig. 6.47 shows the cantilever construction continuous beam bridge reinforcement
general construction, where solid gluten is tensioned reinforced during the construction
process, dashed line is reinforced later in the system conversion stretching tendons.




Fig. 6.47 Sketch of sectional reinforcement of cantilever construction continuous
beam. 

Installation consists of simply supported-continuous construction of continuous girder
bridge, which is adopting the sectional reinforcement of prestressed tendons Fig.
6.48. Pre fabrication pre-fabricated components based on force and consider lifting
must be secured with tensioning, simple installation levels, this secondary tension
reinforcement of pier site layout, then the secondary tensioning.



Fig. 6.48 Sketch of sectional reinforcement of cantilever construction continuous
beam. 

To sum up, portrait of pre-stressed concrete continuous beam bridge stress reinforcement
layout are many and varied, which is used by builders and has a close relationship.
Different methods require different kinds of pre-stressed reinforcement layout, while
the number of prestressed reinforcement depends not only on the force structure in
using also depends on the structure during the construction phase of the force. 

6.3.3 Selection of Construction Method 

Due to construction methods and stress are inextricably linked, in the conceptual
design phase to select the construction method. 

Construction method selection principle should be practical, safe and effective.
First according to the type of structure, the span of the bridge, piers low height,
base depth, and overall size, it puts forward some feasible methods of construction,
and then fully into account location natural environment, topography, geography,
geological and hydrological conditions and transportation conditions, weigh the various
construction methods applicability of filter. 

For example, to complete the construction of a deep foundation, and the construction
method can be guarantee before the floods came out of design flood water levels,
even taking into account if the flood comes ahead, with or without remedial construction
method can guarantee the safety of du Hong. If you are not guaranteed, you want to
consider other options. 

Advanced construction methods generally have good benefits, for speeding up construction
progress, reduce material consumption and improving project quality volume is an
important way. In order to determine the inclusion or exclusion, and also lack of
experience should give full consideration to adoption of new technologies can bring
a certain amount of risk. 

Bridge construction period requirements, sometimes will have a larger selection of
construction method, to determine impact. Such as pre-constructed segment of construction
speed is much faster than the cast assembled, and beam quality is assured, and repeat
for the construction of the overhead bridge more economy. 

Social and environmental impacts are also factors that must be taken into account
in the choice of construction methods. Should be given to the construction on the
environment pollution, destruction of the landscape, the interference of traffic,
as well as the impact on the surrounding ecosystem. 

In the choice of construction methods, influence of various factors must be taken
into account, through the comparison and determine the best builders in order to
save investment, shorten, improve construction safety, advanced construction techniques
could be appropriate, on the reduction of low construction costs, ensuring the quality,
accelerate the construction schedule and safety are very important. 

Example 6.10. France Millau bridge. 

In France across the Tarn Gorge in southern Millau bridge (Fig. 6.49) is a consecutive
seven-tower cable-stayed bridge span into 204 m + 6 × 342 m + 204 m. Their deck to
the highest point is 270 m, the equivalent of 90 stories high, pier 2nd cable highs
reach the height from the ground 343 m. In such conditions, conventional framing,
sized cantilever or assembling difficulty completing tasks. 

In order to ensure the smooth construction of the bridge, research a set of suitable
cable-stayed bridge incremental launching construction method: select P2~P3 as closure,
the steel box-beam push from both sides to closure. In order to push closer to 150
m, the middle span erecting a set fitted with tow equipment of steel-tube truss of
Falsework (Fig. 6.50). In the process of pushing for reduced cantilever base bending,
thrusting structure on both sides of the front beam guiding beams are installed,
install a bridge tower closest to the end and 6 on cable, and push the process of
adjust tension by adjusting the internal force of girder (Fig. 6.51). After the closure
of the bridge, trailer to transport other pylons to the corresponding position and
rotation in place (Fig. 6.52). 

Thanks to these advanced construction techniques, makes this a special bridge (Fig.
6.53) possible, but also saves construction costs.

6.3.4 Construction Safety Identification 

Bridge construction is a complex and dynamic system, with the construction phase
of the advance, the main structure of gradually increasing structural resistance
power and the structural response is time-dependent, its boundary condition and structural
system with changing process of construction. Under normal circumstances, the most
dangerous stage often occurs during the process of construction. So that during the
bridge construction, you must be ensure that each application stages of security.


In the conceptual design should be pay attention to in the construction of four kinds
of extreme conditions: 


each construction stage of bridge structure's ability to resist wind damage and flooding
accidents; 

the stress state in the control section of the most unfavourable construction phase;


the displacement of the cantilever end state; 

the structural stability of the construction phase. 


Paying particular attention to floods and typhoons in the conceptual design, ship
and other unsafe impact on structures. In General, within sunk pier foundations before
flooding beyond the design flood water level. Actual projects upstream flood crest
early arrival, construction equipment does not feet factor caused the accident are
many examples of such accidents. Will also encounter a similar situation in the bridge,
that can not be ignored due to an accident the consequences. In upper structure construction
is also possible accidents resulting in significant financial losses. To bridge this
concept should be considered in the design. 

Concept design should also focus on constraint pouring of large and complex structures,
the most disadvantaged, cables and pre-stressed cantilever construction stage pull,
system conversion and other stages, designed to leave in safety. 

Conceptual design phase, also through the construction phase to determine the bridge
during the construction phase of the security risk assessment. 

6.4 ESTIMATION OF BRIDGE STRUCTURE AND RECOGNITION OF ADVANCE 

Design of bridge structure is: development of structure member sizes, through the
calculations to verify the safety and legitimacy, then adjust the original estimate
to optimize the structure of alternate process. 

Advances in computer technology and software, putting us on a size of bridge structures
that have been identified are essential accurate analysis possible. However, when
we begin conceptual design, the size of these structures must be based. 

Meter personnel to develop. Early size should be within a reasonable range, otherwise
it would gut the entire design. The bridge's advanced nature is the embodiment of
technological progress, but also guarantee the competitiveness of the important guarantee.
Bridge's advance, must begin at the concept design stage. 

Therefore, during the conceptual design phase, estimation of main stress components
of the stress state of the bridge, and prepare its size appears to be particularly
is very important. 

6.4.1 The Estimation Method of Bridge Structures 

Estimation of bridge structure is in the case of component dimensions unknown, using
a simple method to estimate the size of its main component, and pile stress. Therefore,
you must explicitly load status, structure, construction of a bridge method and boundary
conditions. 

Loads are diverse in the bridges, but during the conceptual design phase are estimated
dead load (weight), the live loads (cars, people) role. Statically indeterminate
structures should also be considered generalised loading effects such as temperature,
bearing displacement. 

Dead load has been built according to the structure and architecture experience to
estimate dead load can be determined early. Live load can be reduced to distributed
load, will be analyse the most disadvantageous position as an important section.
For some of the load bearing structure or structures, live load reduction turn into
dead load multiplied by a scale factor, merged with the dead load analysis. 

Estimates, the calculation mode to try to simplify the structure, spatial plane and
complex structure simplification, while also taking into account the effects of construction
process on structure loading. 

Following a single-span suspension bridge, for example, indicates that structure
estimation methods. 

Example 6.11. Design a 1000 m programme for steel box girder of suspension bridge
main span, height-span ratio is one-tenth, the live load for road-I level, the two-way
six-lane. as shown in Fig. 6.54. Estimated dead load, live load and size of main
stress components of the bridge under the internal forces. 



Fig. 6.54 Scheme of steel box girder suspension bridge with main span of 1000 m.


The main component of this bridge are: main cables, slings, main tower, steel box
girder, after determination of main cable of anchorage design loads can also be also
be determined. 

1. Loading 

(a) Constant Load 

According to the established six-lane suspension bridge with steel box girder, assume
that the width of the bridge is 34 m (taking into account the reserve and emergency
parking lane), beam height 3.5 m. Steel box girder and suspenders weight is assumed
to be 500 kg/m2, which can be used to estimate their weight load is: 500 × 34 ÷ 100
= 170 kN/m. Set weight of bridge deck pavement and crash bars around 50 kN/m. 

(b) Live Loads 

According to specifications, six-lane traffic loads through vertical and horizontal
reduction, and consider improving the eccentric load factor 1.15, then the concentrated
live loads for 6 × 360 × 0.55 × 0.93 × 1.15 = 1270 (kN), uniformly distributed load
of 37.35 kN/m. 

Loads can be adjusted according to the actual situation as above, as a basis for
estimation. 

2. Estimation Analysis 

(a) Estimation of Main Cables 

The main cable is the main load-bearing components of the bridge, dead load borne
by the main cables of the construction phase, bridge with stiffening beam to share,
but in long-span bridges, the stiffening girder of sharing part is negligible. 

Main cable curve approximation for the parabolic line cable horizontal force (two
cables together, the same below) as follows: 



Maximum force of main cable (at the top) is: 






In the formula: l = main span; 

gd = per linear meter weight of slings, stiffening and paving; 

gc = cable per linear meter of weight; 

q = uniform live load; 

P = focal live load; 

f = rise of the main cable; 

φ = saddles bridge main cables and horizontal angles. 


Stress capacity of cable material is γc is located = 78.5 kN/m3, cable material design
strength σs = 1670 MPa, factor of safety γ0 = 2.0 (project value at 2.0~2.5), the
gc to γcAc = γc γ0 Tm/σs in place, can be found across primary horizontal force of
the cable as follows: 



Maximum force of main cable (at the top) is: 



From which the main cables area can be deducted : 



In accordance with the principles across the horizontal force of the main cable of
the same approximate, using Ta = Hm/cos φa side span cables can be further evaluated
the great pulling, where φa is the saddles edge across the angle and the horizontal
line of the main cable. Across the main cable curve is a catenary, estimates still
put aside curve approximation. Side span of la = 300 m, loose saddle point to control
point of the main cable saddles of a vertical distance h = 140 m, side spans rise
fa ≈ 5.152 m, then: 



from which the main cables area can be deducted: 



(b) Sling Estimation 

Spacing for hangers developed for 15 m, 2 pieces on each side. Sling maximum internal
forces occur when the load is shown in Fig. 6.55. Concentrated load P born by the
30 d d stiffening girder and may be viewed as uniform load within this range , where d is the stiffening beam height. At the maximum Internal forces the hanger
bears the cable within the spacing range with length of λ, stiffening and weight
gd paving, uniformly distributed live load q and concentrated live loads such as
. As the bridge has two cable facades, and each sling consists of 2 cables,
so the load value is one-fourth of full-bridge load. 

Maximum internal force of Th is: 



If Derrick safety factors γ0 = 3.0, the area can be deducted as follows: 





Fig. 6.55 Maximum internal force of hangers loads. 

(c) Estimation of Main Tower 

At constant load, horizontal force at the top of the main cable is balanced, the
tower only vertical forces generated, whose value is as follows: 



Under the live loads, vertical force is: 





Fig. 6.56 Tower top displacement under live load model. 

Due to the little impact of tower top displacement on main cable, if first assuming
fixed on the top, then under the live loads across the main cable horizontal force
increment is . Under live loads resistance of main tower
can be ignored under rigidity, this tension increment will be determined by cross
the elastic elongation of the main cable to the resistance, as shown in Fig. 6.56.


Set top displacement as . In the formula, Eeq is cable of
equivalent elastic modulus, calculated by the Ernst equation get

 

Aa is the area of side span of cable from the side maximum force Ta to get  = 504571 mm2. From thin one can work out tower top displacement: 



If tower vertical cross section moment of inertia It =300 m4, total height of the
tower from the bottom surface of the ht = 180 m, C50, concrete is used, main tower
of bottom bending moment weight is negligible, the bending moment at the end of may,
according to calculation mode of a cantilever beam subjected to forced displacement
as: 



(d) Estimation of Main Beam 

Set the moment of inertia of the beam I = 3 m4, A = 3 m3, Professor of internal force
of girder can follow Brandon in 1941, equivalent beam method estimates the equivalent
diagram of the beam is shown in Fig. 6.57. Where Hd is under dead load cable tension,
Hl is loading the additional tension of the main cable, g is the dead load, q(x)
is the live load intensity (including concentrated loads). The method is based on
the line deflection theory derives, which ignores the load cable tension on vertical
load provided by the resistance. 



Fig. 6.57 Sketch of equivalent beam method. 

Below using live loads on the main span as an example, calculate the main beam bending
moment. For ease of calculation, will treat the live load as uniform live load. Thus
in Fig. 6.57, q = 38.27 kN/m, g = gb + γc Ac = 257.61 kN/m, Hd =  = 322012kN. And Hl is unknown here, cannot be solved by equivalent beam method, therefore
needs to be supplemented by a main cable compatibility equations. 

Since the horizontal projection of the total length of the main cable is constant,
it is easy to deduct cable compatible equations as follows: 



In the formula: η = stiffening girder deflection 

φ = stiffening angles. 

η, φ can be obtained by the fundamental solution of the bending beam, full span of
bending beam load basic solutions as shown in Table 6.11. 


Table 6.11 Fundamental solution for bending simple support beam.

Note:  

Combining Table 6.11 and main cable compatibility equation, after a simple iteration
Hl and η can be obtained, resulting in stiffening beam bending moment. The steps
are as follows: 

1. Assumed that the initial value of Hl, according to precision requirements step ΔHl.

2. To determine the value of Hl, is given in Table 6.11 η(ξ), φ(ξ) formula η and φ.

3. Simpson quadrature formula is used to calculate two integral equations compatibility,
compatible function f(Hl). 
4. Use Hl iteration value is calculated: 







In the formula: Hl, i = Hl current value of; 

Hl, i + 1 = Hl New iteration of the values. 


5. Repeat steps (b)~(d) until f(Hl, i) fully close to 0, satisfy the accuracy requirements,
get the Hl and η which is the theoretical value. 
6. Using mid-span bending moment calculation formulas in Table 6.11 to obtain stiffening
beam bending moment. 


The Iterative process of this case is shown in Table 6.12, calculation formula step
size set as ΔHl = 100 kN.

6.4.2 The Rational Scale of Conventional Bridge 

Conventional bridge (mainly beam bridges, arch bridges, cable-stayed and suspension
bridge) dimensions are typically determined by comparing with existing similar designs,
so to speak, it is both an empirical formula and the results of design optimisation.


1. The Pre-stressed Concrete Beam Bridge 

Set the pre-stressed concrete beam bridge main span as L, beam height h, the high
beams of a reasonable range is: 

Simply supported girder bridge with 

Bridge with uniformed height continuous beam , common

Continuous rigid frame 

For a railway bridge or road and bridge in soft soil areas or large temperature difference
between the environment, h value should be set at the maximum. Table 6.14, Table
6.15 give beam height or plane thickness in part of the simply supported uniformed
cross-section beam, as well as beam height in variable cross-section continuous beam
and continuous rigid frame.

3. Cable-stayed Bridge 

As for two-span cable-stayed bridge with single tower, side-to-across ratio is usually
0.5~0.8, with the majority being 0.6~0.7. For twin towers three-span cable-stayed
bridge, side-across ratio is 0.3~0.5, with the majority being 0.4. Tower height above
the deck and the cross-length ratio is typically between 1/4~1/7, mostly about 0.25.
Beam height and main span-length ratio in early thin cable systems is generally 1/5~1/70,
in dense cable system generally 1/70~1/200.

4. Suspension Bridge 

Completed suspension bridges, side-span ratio is mostly between 0.2~0.3, United States
George Washington Bridge has the smallest side to span ratio of 0.174, whereas the
largest side-span ratio is the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge of 0.482. The vertical cross-ratio
of suspension bridges is 1/9~1/12, heavier suspension bridges adapt bigger vertical
cross ratio in order to limit the increase of forces, such as the great belt East
bridge, vertical cross-ratio is 1/9; box lighter beam may have small vertical cross-ratio
to increase the stiffness of suspension bridge. Bosphorus bridge vertical cross-ratio
is 1/12; self-anchored suspension bridge has greater vertical cross-ratio than ground-Anchored
suspension bridge, generally about 1/5.

6.4.3 Conventional Bridge Materials Index 

As with conventional bridge component scales, material consumption and economic indicators
are also vary within a certain range, beyond which a design may be innovative, advanced,
and also can be dangerous and wasteful. Conceptual design phase, one should have
an objective assessment of the design's economic indicators and compare it with that
of the conventional bridges.

6.4.4 Identifying Advances 

Any actions with thorough thought during construction to increase security, lower
costs, improve and beautify the structure and environment, improve structure durability
and environmental design, or through the introduction of new materials, new technology
and new equipment to simplify and shorten the process of construction, overcoming
difficulties that cannot be solved by conventional methods are all advances. In contrast,
raise costs, increase the risk of work for the sake of innovation should be regarded
as backward. identification of advance must start from the concept design. 

Security is an eternal topic, pose a security risk has two major factors: natural
and man-made disasters. Natural disasters are mainly seismic, wind, mudslides, floods
and snow disaster and so on. Man-made disasters include overloaded, traffic accident,
collision, etc. 

In order to withstand the earthquake disasters, ensuring great structural safety
under seismic forces, Greece bridge Rion at conceptual design stage base isolation
is used, placing the steel caissons on gravel cushion, allowing relative slip between
the Foundation, which guarantees the safety of tower columns. 



Fig. 6.58 Facade layout of three arch bridges (size: mm) (a) Thrust steel arch bridge
(b) Dead load thrust-free prestressed concrete arch bridge, (c) Thrust of reinforced
concrete arch bridge. 

"Economy" is a relative concept, economy at stake of security, be could not attend.
In the mid-1990s, many bridges are built very economical, but these bridges low safety
factor, ability to withstand overload is also low, cannot be said to be advanced.
Similarly, materials indications listed in the previous section lists reflect bridge
economic performance from a certain angle. 

A bridge with real advances in the economy can be reflected in the land system, material,
functional structures, construction and other aspects. 

In downtown Kunshan Lou Jiang adjacent three newly built arch bridges, main span
is around 40 m, as shown in Fig. 6.58. Fig. 6.58(a) is a thrust steel arch bridge,
the ratio of height to span 1/10.3, the main bridge span 44.87 m; Fig. 6.58(b) is
a bridge of constant load without thrust pre-stress concrete arch bridge with a main
span 36 m; Fig. 6.58(c) is thrust of reinforced concrete arch bridge, with a height-span
ratio of 1/9. 

Kunshan is a soft soil area, bridge programme is not economical. But in order to
beautify the city bridges, arch bridges is also an option. On soft ground, in order
to overcome the horizontal thrust base will take a large economic cost. And horizontal
thrust and structures are related. Fig. 6.58(a) thrust for the bridge arch, using
steel arch bridge, light weight, relatively small horizontal thrust. Fig. 6.58(b)
bridge constant load without thrust, only horizontal force live load and temperature.
Fig. 6.58(c) bridge with large weight has the largest basic horizontal thrust. Therefore,
from conceptual design stage we can decide which economic b > a > c of three
bridges, three economic indicators listed in Table 6.27 illustrates the point.

Improving and beautifying the structure can also reflect the bridge's advance. In
the concept of the United States Oakland Bay Bridge, in order to satisfy residents
taste for single-column pylon and the demand that the bridge can immediately restore
traffic functionality after the quake, structure of multi-column shear tower was
proposed. The Tower look like a single tower structure Fig. 6.59 is a single-column
and portal bridge tower scheme selection.

Beam bridge construction can also embody its advanced nature. France Millau bridge
incremental launching construction adapted to local conditions is an example. 

Improve the durability of the structure can also reflect its advance. Stonecutters
Bridge in Hong Kong achieves the theoretical design life of 120 years, in the choice
of materials, structural design, sacrificing protection, dehumidification systems,
maintenance equipment, special considerations have been made. First of all, the bridge
concrete tower with a high strength grade concrete, water/cement ratio was 0.35,
added fly ash and 15 L/ m3 35% nitrous inhibitors of calcium, and stirrups and outermost
vertical reinforcement uses stainless steel and, secondly, due to the lower part
of the tower structure long immersion in high-chlorine environments, protective layer
of thickened more than 60 mm; and, third, tower top section steel enclosures were
used as sacrificial protection, in order to prevent the air from the chloride ions
on corrosion of the tower four, in order to prevent rusting, the main beam not only
go through layers of paint to protect, has also set up dehumidification system inside
the box the last check maintenance to guarantee the durability of the structure has
a very important significance, therefore, Stonecutters Island Bridge tower, both
inside and outside of main girder installation maintenance equipment, such as tower
top set the hanger deck has the following settings maintenance platform in the lower
part of the tower [Fig. 6.60(a)], set inside a box girder of repairing the shuttle
[Fig. 6.60(b)], externally mounted portable maintenance hanger [Fig. 6.60(c)], and
can also be installed on the cable maintenance vehicle [Fig. 6.60(d)]. 

All in all, finds bridge's advance, must start, from concept design concept design
principles. After completion of the bridge temporary summed up the "innovation" generally
does not mean that advanced.

6.5 IMPORTANT MECHANICAL CALCULATION IN CONCEPT DESIGN PHASE 

During the conceptual design phase, the main purpose of structure analysis is to
verify whether the establishment, including strength and stiffness (distortion or
image stabilisation qualitative) fatigue of overall control meet code requirements,
simplified methods or empirical formula is often used to estimate. But when confronted
with complex structure, numerical methods are used. Numerical model is crucial in
determining whether numerical analysis is correct. 

6.5.1 General Method for Structure Analysis 

Structure analysis purpose is mainly to effect structural change as the structure
of responses. These responses at the structural level include displacement and stability
of enclosed, at the component level includes force and stress, and so on. Structural
analysis mainly consists of solutions analytical, numerical analysis method and semi-analytical
method. 

Analytical method generates ease to-use analysis models through simplifying actual
structure, established the relationship equations between the mechanical values ,
and finding the answer via., analytical solution. 

Numerical analysis is discretisation of complex differential equations with boundary
value problems, and obtain approximate solutions using algebraic equations. Commonly
used numerical analyses are divided into two categories: represented by the finite
difference method and represented by finite element method. 

Semi-analytical method is by introducing parsing functions obtained from analytical
method, in combination with numerical analysis method. Relative to finite element
method it requires less computation work. Finite strip method is often used in semi-analytical
method. 

Conceptual design, structural analysis is designed to ensure that the programme is
viable. So you can use a simplified analytical method (estimation) or a simple model
of the finite element method. 

6.5.2 Strength Calculation 

Strength-test is the assurances for structure and components to meet the ultimate
and serviceability limit. 

Ultimate loading limit states corresponds to structures or structural elements to
achieve the maximum load capacity or to not fit to continue bearing load without
deformation. When a structure or structural component appears when one of the following
States, the ultimate limit State should have been reached: 


The entire structure or portion of a structure as a rigid body lost balance (capsizing);


Damage to the components or connections because of the stress exceeds the material
strength limit (including fatigue), or due to excessive deformation and unfit to
continue bearing load; 

Structure transformed into mobile; 

The structure or structure lose stability; 

Foundation lose bearing capacity and gets damaged. 


Serviceability limit states correspond to structures or structural elements to achieve
the normal use or durability of a provision limiting value. When a structure or structural
component appears one of the following states, the ultimate limit state should have
been exceeded: 


Affect normal use or the appearance of deformation; 

Partial damage affecting the normal use or durability (including fractures); 

Vibration affecting the normal use; 

Other specific status that affect normal use, such as relatively large settlement.



Through analysis of structure, each component can be obtained under the most adverse
combination of responses. Usually on structural components according to load bearing
limit state, followed by calculation of deformation, crack width, anti-crack, etc.,
based on serviceability limit State. 

Bridge design specifications of components for ultimate limit state calculation using
the following formula: 






In the formula: γ0 = The importance factor of bridge structure; 

S = Effect of composite design values; 

R = Design value of bearing; 

fd, ad = Material strength and geometrical parameters of the designed value. 


The above formula is a basic expression , giving in detail the bridge bending, compression,
tension, torsion, punching shear, local pressure component calculation method of
bearing capacity design values, no longer listed here. 

During the conceptual design phase, because there are a lot of options, each type
of bridge layout, structure is not stable, this can only be preliminary calculations.
For example, for a continuous beam bridge, at the concept design stage, because you
haven't configured the general reinforcement or pre-stressing reinforcement, and
therefore cannot check the structural strength and can only be computed structures,
previous work experience, preliminary judge whether or not the section size may be
reinforcing success. Therefore, the conceptual design stage of structural strength
check is mainly holding structure size is appropriate. 

6.5.3 Rigidity and Stability Calculation 

Stiffness is the object's ability to resist deformation under force. Stiffness calculation
corresponds to specification in the serviceability limit state requirements for the
deflection under load and span ratio. 

During the conceptual design phase checking stiffness is very important. Calculation
by finite element method, you can easily structural deformation curve and find the
maximum structural displacement value. Some basic structure can also be based on
the simple theory of deformation and calculation formula estimation of maximum displacement
structure. For example, the simple architecture of several sections such as maximum
displacement calculated as follows. 

1. Simply Supported Beam 

Mid-span deflection under a concentrated force: 

Full uniform mid-span deflection under load: 

2. Cantilever Beam 

Mid-span deflection under a concentrated force: 

Full uniform mid-span deflection under load: 

3. Simply Supported at one end, Consolidation Beams at the Other end (Akin to Continuous
Girder Side Span) 

Full uniform deflection under load: f = 0.00541  (at a distance from simple-support
end 0.422l). 

4. Fixed end Beam (Akin to Continuous Beam of the Cross) 

Mid-span deflection under a concentrated force: 

Full uniform mid-span deflection under load: . 

Comparing with control code for modification one can determine whether the structural
rigidity of the structure meet the requirements. For example, the highway reinforced
concrete and pre-stressed concrete bridge design code (JTG D62—2004) provides as
follows: reinforced and pre-stressed concrete long-term deflection of the flexural
members, after long-term deflection of eliminating structural weight, warping the
maximum deflection of primary beam should not be more than 1/600 of calculating span,
cantilever length not exceeding 1/300. The highway cable stayed bridge design rules
(JTG/TD65-01-2007) states: main beam lane loading (no impact) under maximum vertical
deflection of concrete beam bridge shall not be more than l/500, steel beams and
composite beams in the main hole using steel beams shall not be more than l/400.
The highway cable bridge design code (approval) in the provision of: stiffening girder
of suspension bridge by vehicle load (regardless of the impact) of the maximum vertical
deflection should not be greater than the span of the 1/250 and fiftieth ~ 1/300;
in high winds (deck car-free) maximum lateral displacement should not be greater
than the span under the influence of 1/150. 

Stability includes two aspects: static stability, including stability and regional
stability as a whole; wind-induced stability, including flutter instability and static
wind instability and so on. 

Static forc, structural stability of cable-stayed bridges, arch bridges and other
issues are more prominent, thin-walled structures such as thin-walled steel box girder,
bridge tower local stability is more prominent. During the conceptual design phase
primarily concerned with the overall stability of finite element method can be easier
to first class stability analysis of structures and stability safety factor meets
the requirements for testing. Local stability in terms of rods stability ensured
by limiting slenderness ratio, stability of stiffened plate structure measures adopted
as assurance. 

On mechanics, for large-span bridge at conceptual design stage only preliminary estimates
according to the formula, the highway bridge specification for design of wind resistance
(JTG/T D60-01-2004) are detailed in the static wind stability, galloping, flutter
stability test calculation formulas and specific requirements. 

6.5.4 Dynamic Characteristics Calculation 

The inherent dynamic properties of structures mainly refers to the natural frequencies,
mode shapes, damping, etc. They depend on the quality structure and rigidity, quality
and distribution, support conditions, and other factors. Structure dynamic analysis
is the basis of calculation of wind and earthquake resistance of structures. In addition,
bridge live load impact co-efficient associated with the structure of the fundamental
frequency; for special-purpose bridge, footbridge, its fundamental frequency there
are certain requirements. Therefore, is necessary to perform structural dynamic characteristics
calculation. 

During the conceptual design phase, dynamic characteristics of bridge structure can
be directly estimated using the approximate formulas. Refer to the existing bridge
specification and related research results, bridge the fundamental frequency estimation
formulas are as follows.

6.6 MODELING METHOD 

6.6.1 Method for Model Selection 

Bridge structural analysis must be based on analysis and requirements, select suitable
numerical analysis model and structure the dynamic abstraction, simplifies, and discrete,
and based on program requirements, the discretized structure with the corresponding
computer language statements, such as data files, describe them. Rational and accurate
modeling and numerical simulation of bridge structural analysis is the key to success.


1. The Plane Model and Spatial Model 

Force main bridge structure in the vertical plane, and transverse dimensions is vertical
small, so the general line bridges or flat and curved bridge inconspicuous simplified
into flat structure in the vertical plane, model was called model established at
this time. In the two-dimensional plane, finite element model of nodes in general
only the DX, DY, RZ, three degrees of freedom. If the bridge is located within a
clear plane curve, the transverse dimensions or components relative to the vertical
must not be ignored, or structure under a large transverse loads (such as wind load,
earthquake load, and so on), and planar structure is simplified as it does not reflect
the structure of space, in which case in three dimensions space calculation model,
called the spatial model. In three dimensions, a node usually has 6 degrees of freedom,
namely, DX, DY DZ RX RY RZ. Thus, plane models and model selection of main space
is based on characteristics of the structure itself. 

Under normal circumstances, using space model can be achieved than plane stress state
is closer to the actual structure of the model structure in response, but due to
space model for data entry, programs, data processing and other links are far more
complicated than flat-panel models, so you must the relation of the trade-off between
accuracy and workload. Because in the conceptual design phase one is typically concerned
with the overall structure of mechanical behaviour there is no need to get very accurate
results, so simpler plane model is used as much as possible. 

2. Unit Type Selection 

By geometric characteristics and element types, structural model can generally be
divided into frames ("line" structure), plate and shell structures ("surface" structure)
and entity structures ("body"). Truss component is characterised by scaling in one
direction than the other two parties to scale, truss rods, beams, cables and other
wire unit, such as lengths much greater than the height and width of the beam section.
Plate and shell structures is characterised by a scale much smaller than the other
two directions of scale, as a flat plate-like objects called plate structures, if
surface shape is called a shell, plate and shell elements, respectively. Entity structure
refers to the three directions of scale at about the same levels of structure, corresponding
to solid elements. 

In the conceptual design phase, due to high precision requirements the calculation
result is not, in general, one can use framed structures. If rod components are not
subject to bending moment, use rod element or cable element (can only sustain tension);
if subjected to bending moment, beam element is used. When beam unit length is greater
than 15 times of section feature dimensions, commonly known as slender beams, one
can ignore the effect of shear deformation. 

With the upgrading of computer processing speeds, at the concept design stage, for
geometry more complex structures one can also consider adopting shell or solid elements
to build more elaborate finite element model. It must be noted that inside is a truss
element model results from the shell or solid models can be the result of stress
and strain, such as demand forces more difficult. 

6.6.2 Geometric Description 

Geometric description of a task is to describe a real bridge structure in finite
element calculation of node, element, provide node position, and to determine how
to connect unit between nodes. Through the positioning of node provides structure
position information, described by the unit knot extension of frame component. 

Architecture modeling is the process of a logical process. The first step is to choose
a reasonable simplification of modeling mode. At conceptual design stage if the choice
of plane frame models, spatial effect of live load transverse distribution co-efficient
and co-efficient of uneven load can be used to express; to calculate space loading
(wind load, earthquake load, etc.) under the action of static response, generally
using space truss model, as shown in Fig. 6.61. In Space truss model, simulation
is a key technology for main girder. Closed box beam free torsional stiffness can
adopt the single main beam model; with separated half-open section of box girders,
especially for free torsion stiffness with solid edge beam of plate opening section,
double girder models can be used; half-open the main beam section or open the main
beam section three-beam model can be used. 

The second step of modeling is the discretization of the structure, nodes, unit systems.
In the finite element analysis, proper discretization of the model is the key to
economical and reliable structural analysis. Different unit size analysis sometimes
has a great influence the accuracy of the results, which must balance the unit number
and the model efficiency, models usually have to sacrifice high accuracy model analysis
of the cost in time and the overall efficiency of the model. Analyst must determine
whether a sub-division unit necessary based on engineering judgement. 



Fig. 6.61 Space truss calculation model (a) girder bridge (b) cable-stayed bridge.


For framed structures, a unit corresponds to two end nodes, of nodes and cells boils
down to determine node location, in general the following principles should be followed:



the structural anchor should set the node; 

in order to deal with the relationship between structure and discrete model, in accordance
with the construction process, phasing in natural settings node; 

longer natural block should be appropriately sub-divided; 

the pre-stressed cable-endpoint sections should generally set the node; 

section should set the node where the focus on internal forces and displacements;


at supporting parts node should be set. 


6.6.3 Materials and Sectional Properties 

To receive the correct structure, one of the most important factors is determining
structural elements and section properties of the material. Material properties elastic
modulus, Poisson's ratio, density, cross-section area, bending moment of inertia
and torsional moment of inertia are considered. 

Structure calculation of bridge structure is built on the theory of homogeneous material,
actual materials and section features can be used. Theory of material properties
have values, more precise measured data can also be obtained on a test. Section property
can be calculated using section dimension. 

In the linear model, and section properties of the material are generally the same,
but in dealing with material non-linearity problems need material special treatment
or section properties. 

For non-linear materials only through testing or the actual detailed theoretical
analysis to the material properties can be simplified inelastic model to simulate
the expected component behaviour. According to the complexity of material properties
change, you can use bilinear or a much broader linear material models. If degradation
of materials considered in the analysis, you can use the Takeda model. 

For non-homogeneous material, sometimes by changing the section properties to consider
their non-linear properties. Such as reinforced concrete, solid object, you may need
to modify the section properties: elastic analysis, if the goal is to strength, concern
only calculation of knot, as long as the relative stiffness of the various components
is correct you can; when you target the displacements and deformations, each member
calculation of cross-section must be accurate, and beyond a certain deformation when
the cracks in the concrete, you must also modify the section properties to reflect
the effective stiffness of structure. 

6.6.4 Boundary Conditions 

Another key step is the correct description of the structural analysis of successful
systems outside the constraints, boundary conditions. Boundary conditions include
force boundary conditions and displacement boundary conditions. For the conceptual
design stage of the overall structural truss unit mode type, normally only displacement
constraint conditions exist, under bridge's practical constraints can easily determine
its finite element model type of boundary conditions. 

When determining the boundary conditions certain construction assumptions are usually
needed. For example, in static force Analysis boundary conditions are often described
using simple supported rigid (fixed, hinged, rolling moving or sliding), without
consideration of deformation sub-structure and foundations. However, for the need
to take into account certain static analysis of ground displacement (such as considering
the slow displacement of suspension bridge anchorage) and dynamic analysis (such
as seismic response analysis), describing the deformation is very heavy, Non-linear
spring/ damper model can be established at this time (Fig. 6.62). Structural engineer
and geological engineers can work closely together correctly determining the nature
of soil spring and sometimes need to pass set up a small model or manual checking
of the required parameters is acceptable. 



Fig. 6.62 Non-linear spring/damper model. 

6.6.5 Quality 

When calculating the dynamic characteristics of structure should be given quality,
mainly refers to the components of the translational mass and moment of inertia.
Translation quality of centralised or distributed approach, and the moment of inertia
is way depending on the simulation of the floor system is different and can be automatically
form or according to the actual sections of the mass distribution calculations input.


6.6.6 Loads 

Bridge structures need to withstand various loads, such as temporary loads, dead
loads, live loads, wind, any temperature and load. These loads consist of a series
of load exerted on the structure model of express or analog, each load included a
series of concentrated loads (section point loading) or distributed load. Range relative
to the extension unit can use smaller loads concentrated loads simulation, and vice
versa with a distributed load simulation. 

Dead load refers to the weight of the structure, the size according to the size and
density of the material and the acceleration of gravity is calculated. General description
the distributed load, but sometimes also attach some concentrated loads, such as
truss continuous girder beam weight is concentrated in the model force simulation.


Temporary construction loads on the structure has been built mainly of temporary
stacking loads, and hanging baskets, and so on. Interim stacking load can be simulated
based on equivalent in the form of concentrated or distributed load. Simulation of
hanging basket is relatively complex. General cantilever hanging baskets can be fixed
with a virtual rod unit and structure has been built-in several equivalent concentration
on simulated basket moves, you can fold the unit at this stage and concentrated force
dismounted to move before the next stage of the unit and focus. Fore-cable-stayed
bridge basket required to simulate the tension in its construction and process value
calculation method can be used to simulate. 

Live load can be directly illustrated using the standard load calculation, and record
transverse, longitudinal reduction factor. 

Static wind load on a structure shapes, wind speed and the Pontic of bridge site
structure related to the height of the load. When calculate one can refer to code
for design of highway bridge wind (JTG/T D60-01-2004), the estimation formula of
critical wind speed of flutter. For important large-span structures, first through
wind tunnel tests to determine its major components of the three-factor (curve),
then calculate the corresponding equivalent static wind loads on structures. Flexible
structures and sometimes even structural posture change causes changes in angle of
attack of the wind effect of static wind loading. 

Other static loads, such as ship and ice loads, and also calculate the equivalent
load applied to the corresponding position in the model. 

In some cases, especially in high seismic intensity area, many dynamic load-controlled
bridge design parameters. At this point, understanding dynamic loads of the nature
of the responses of bridges under such loads is very important. In the districts
of high intensity, Thong common multi-modal response spectrum analysis to calculate
the dynamic response of bridges. In this case, usually with a given structural damping
periods and under acceleration, velocity and displacement relationship between response
spectrum load. In some cases, especially for complex bridge structures, and time
history analysis method is usually used when needed at the border when applying a
group ride on the nodes load (usually expressed as time or time-acceleration-displacement
curve). 

Example 6.12. According to the conceptual design, shown in Fig. 6.63, and full-bridge
(156 + 180 + 300) m + 1400 m + (300 + 180 + 156) m of 7-span continuous structures.
main beam is made of flat steel box girder, beam height 4.5 m, the full width 41
m (including wind mouth). Pylons uses "A" shaped concrete towers, set the beam at
the bottom anchor, set the lower beam girder. Tower height is 357 m deck above 287
m, the tower is a hollow rectangular section. Cable total 38 × 4 × 2 = 304, specifications
for PES7-211~313(1770 MPa), single cable maximum length of about 750 m. Floating
structural system for the whole system, and try to model this structure.

According to this knowledge, can be modeled according to the following steps for
this solution: 

1. The choice of plane and spatial model: Conceptual design for similar configurations
of cable-stayed bridge in Planar structures, but large-span bridge, in transverse
direction (lateral) loads of established controls, so using spatial models. 
2. Unit type selection: Using truss structures, and the selection of tower column of
main girder beam elements, cable select space beam element. 
3. Description: Main beam and column have access to all the nodes in the corresponding
section of the tower at the centroid of the girder set the principles of the nodes
is: beams, on end, cable cranes, tower junction set node, insert a niche between
adjacent points; the main tower sets the node's principles that is: Tower, bottom
set, beams, cables anchoring points are the endpoints node, the tower columns and
beams a long rod is properly sub-divided so that the unit length has differ; cable
setting the node's principles are: both ends of the cable are set the node and with
segmented rods method test taking into account non-linear effects of cables SAG,
so each of these cables are inserted at the dividing point 7 nodes. Full bridge element
and node the connection information is as follows: along its axis of beam, towers,
cable connection between adjacent nodes as a unit, cable section corresponds to the
lower point and main beam increased rigidity beam element, namely the main girder
of single-beam mode "fish bone beams" model. 
4. And section properties of the material: The main girders, cables for steel components,
pylon for the concrete components, elastic modulus of the material is already known.
Geometry calculation of sectional properties according to the corresponding section.
Beam elements needed to calculate the area and around three axes: Moment of inertia,
the main beam, the main tower in the typical cross-section is shown in Table 6.30,
typical between each cross-section curve can be approximated by a straight line interpolation;
Element need only enter the cross-sectional area, area corresponding to each cable
as shown in Fig. 6.64.

structure, nodes at the bottom of Tower column for consolidation of constraint; main
girder for floating junction structure constraint only two end nodes and the auxiliary

through computers.

SOLVING NEW PROBLEM IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 

					A good bridge engineer should be try to make your own design work reasonable, including
					maximum possible meet the requirements, try to adapt the natural conditions of bridge-site,
					minimise construction costs, and bring beauty to bridges. To achieve these goals,
					we must continue to break through the existing technical limit. Bridge design and
					structure selection cannot be separated from some key details of the bridge idea.
					Sometimes innovative bridges programme, structural systems depends on a new frame
					details, the invention of the new method, as well as the application of new materials
					and technologies. Conversely, innovative structural details, innovative methods,
					new materials, new technology research are driven by the constant pursuit of a more
					rational structure. In this chapter, starting from the analysing and achieving a
					more rational structure, introduced innovative structural details, method, new material
					and how new technology of bridge design is generated based on the special needs.
					

					7.1 TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF REALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE DESIGN IDEAS 

					Bridge engineer continuously challenge the limits in design for the bridge structure
					meet the requirements or to make the structure suitable. According to different bridges,
					these limits may be greater span, higher carrying capacity, more economic and more
					resistant longer, more beautiful, more resistance to extreme events, and many other
					aspects. To achieve these objectives, in addition to the bridge engineer rich experience
					in engineering and mechanics of ingenious ideas, reasonable knowledge structure system,
					it also requires the following specific technical safeguards. 

					First of all, innovation in critical structural details. The overall bridge structure
					is made up of different components, different components in structure plays a different
					role. When structure when the overall breakthrough for structural requirements increased,
					but not structures all the details of the design points. Overall innovation ultimately
					materializes in key construction details, some successful solve critical structural
					problems are sometimes so that the structure's overall performance is greatly improved.
					

					Secondly, the innovative construction method and corresponding equipment guarantee.
					In addition to the ingenious design of bridge structure, construction technology
					is the key to success. High quality bridge design requires a high level of construction
					technology to be realized. The progress in bridge construction technology offers
					a flexible and powerful tool, as well as increased span, improved structure and the
					use of material provided sufficient conditions, in some cases, bridge designs of
					innovation depends entirely on the innovative construction method. While innovative
					methods must have the appropriate equipment to achieve, and sometimes equipment development
					determines the success or failure of the method. High precision application work
					cannot be completed by human hand-operated, there must be precise control of construction
					equipment, construction must be rely on automation, smart large equipment. 

					Application of advanced materials and high-tech innovative bridge design requirements.
					Construction technology of modern bridge exhibition can be said to be result of engineering
					material advances. Development of modern smelting technology provides high strength
					steel, which is born reinforced concrete and pre-stressed concrete. Over more than
					100 years, the achievements of modern bridge engineering is based on steel and concrete
					implementation. Modern materials has created a large number of advanced materials
					other than steel or concrete, these strong materials high unit volume light weight,
					durability, but the application also has some advanced material in civil engineering
					technology and economic barriers. Modern bridge engineers design bridges, is no longer
					a traditional apprentice imitating the master model, but using systems engineering
					knowledge to create. Therefore, the timely application of high-tech innovation can
					be greatly boost structure innovation in the design of bridge. 

					Finally, the complex bridge construction key process of technological innovation
					is the safeguard to implementing the design. In the complex hybrid or a special bridge
					construction process, process of bridge-building engineers often encounter before
					without problems, in response to these needs in the design and construction of special
					studies, the successful resolution of these problems on the construction of the bridge
					play a key role, and solutions also provide ideas for similar bridges construction
					in the future. Successful solutions will have an impact bridge construction technology
					in the future development of new constructs described earlier in detail, construction
					methods and materials is via., a bridge, the engineers creative daring the attempt,
					but proved to be more social and economic benefit, and become a bridge technical
					safeguards. 

					7.2 IMPROVEMENT OF STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF STRUCTURAL DETAILS 

					Overall structure is made up of numerous details structure. Modern bridge design
					is achieved through mechanical knowledge function as a bridge to the technical requirements,
					from the traditional mode of operation of the apprentice legend. Therefore, engineers
					can use the knowledge to create a structure that was never designed. In particular
					the application of the computer, so mechanics can be parts available to engineers,
					so they can be calculated completely by means of mechanical devise never before imagined
					a unique bridge scheme. But mechanical engineering abstract theoretical knowledge
					in practice, when applied to the design of new bridges must restore entity structure.
					

					For example, the mechanical bridge is supported only in a simple hinge joint or hinge
					point of the swing, and bridge abutment you must have a certain bearing strength
					and can meet the displacement requirements of different components of the entity.
					If an agent is only designed bridges beam structural system, ignoring details such
					as the support structure will not be able to bridge that is consistent with mechanical
					system design. And structural details are also changed with the development of bridge.
					Early bearing of bridge using steel bearing force for clear advantages, can well
					meet the requirements of bearing and deformation, but the high cost of production
					and maintenance of steel bearing. Alongwith the awareness of the mechanical characteristics
					of the structure and development of material industry, there has been a rubber support.
					Rubber bearing the same to meet the force requirements, has a certain durability,
					but manufacturing and maintenance costs dramatically, so soon is the bridge application.
					While rubber support also provides flexible support condition, reasonable force to
					provide new means for a structure, so in order to get a different force structure
					effect of rubber bearings and different types are derived. 

					It can be seen from above the development of bridge support, structural details are
					necessary to achieve the conception design, at the same time, based on the innovational
					design of mechanical theory is also promoting advances in structural details. 

					7.2.1 Innovation of Structural Details 

					Innovation of structural details from the structure of the requirements according
					to the characteristics of bridge design method, primarily through mechanical model
					of structural measures outlined by the design of the bridge. Construction and replacement
					of the structure also on structural details of design proposed new requirements.
					To sum up several aspects include the following: 

					1. Reasonable Force Structure Requirements Varied Boundary Conditions 

					Boundary conditions are important components of force calculation of bridge structure
					models, the same structure in different border makes great a change in structure
					of the force. For example, as it is a single-span beam bridge, simply supported beams
					with single-hole-shaped frame bridge moment distribution is totally different. Simply
					supported beam produced only positive moment, and single frame girder is at the same
					time produce positive or negative bending moment bending moment. 

					Bridges on the border generally in addition to supporting role, must also be able
					to adapt to a certain displacement. In order to adapt to the above requirements,
					will require innovative design. Especially for complex structures or large bridges,
					requirements under different operating conditions, using different boundary conditions
					can also be receive better mechanical performance, so raises can be designed in different
					working under the conditions of different requirements for connecting effects support
					member. 

					2. Fully Utilize Material Characteristics of Structure Components 

					Bridge structural artifacts bear force such as tension, compression, bending and
					bending can be decomposed into tension and compression area. Among the commonly used
					building materials, steel both tension and compression, but the price is high, long-term
					maintenance costs and high resistance of concrete high compressive strength and low
					tensile strength, but cheap. Therefore, if the two materials combine to form composite
					structures can have large economic benefits. The bridge engineer with a broad scope
					for innovation. 

					3. Reliable Connections between the Different Components and Different Materials
					

					Reliable connection between bridge components is key to ensure the normal use of
					the bridge, these connection parts often bear a great deal of force, for example,
					tower column of main girder and cable connections, how to guarantee the reliability
					of connection is also a challenge to bridge engineer. For the same reason using combined
					structure, connections between different material structures bear a great deal of
					stress, how to guarantee connection under high stress conditions reliable, is also
					one of the design challenges. 

					4. Meeting the Dynamic Needs of Disaster Equipment 

					Bridge over the natural disaster conditions, will produce devastating damage, where
					the vibration generated by external factors will have dynamic amplification, so that
					internal forces of structures subjected to far much larger than static, reduction
					or structure designed to isolate vibration of continuous effort one of the direction
					of the force. 

					5. Improving Construction Required by Structure Durability 

					Bridge to reach the design life, must carry out the necessary maintenance. Due to
					component life expectancy varies, if necessary, to replacement of some components.
					In bridge design one should take into full account the possible actions in the future,
					reserved on the structure of future replacement support measures. 

					7.2.2 Boundary Conditions Structure Meeting the Requirement of Different Force Requirements
					

					In order to meet the bearing and deformation under different loading conditions,
					supports and telescopic component needs to be set. The most common such component
					are the bridge bearings and expansion joints. In addition, in order to achieve some
					special support structure and deformation, depending on construction of reality for
					innovative design. Equivalent bearing, meet special activity direction of deformation,
					in different operating conditions can be adjusted boundary condition is one of several
					ways. 

					1. The Equivalent Bearing Condition 

					In exceptional circumstances, had simple support conditions is not easy to achieve,
					or after long-term operation of the bridge will pose a security risk, can be equivalent
					to the mechanic design equivalent conditions. 

					Former Yugoslavia (now Croatia) in the KRK bridge (7.1) is a bridge crossing the
					Adriatic Sea to mainland and the island of KRK, dual-use pipe concrete arch bridge,
					built-in 1980. Full bridge by span 390 m (mainland to island, KRK-I) and 244 m (St
					Koh Kho Khao to Krk, KRK-II) consists of two reinforced concrete deck arch bridge,
					the two bridges are 235 m apart, connected with a 96 m long highway on Koh Kho Khao.
					Deck width is 11.4 m, under the bridge deck laid oil pipelines, water pipes and industrial
					piping, a total of 17. Arch is a single box three rooms section, with units from
					the ends of pre-cast segmental cantilever until closure. 

					To coordinate two bridges arch line, and not much higher than arch bridge II and
					lower road profile, it must place the 390 m bridge's arch I at below sea level. Adriatic
					sea is highly corrosive, leaching having a serious affect on the durability of the
					arch in the sea. Therefore, equivalent to the mechanical design of this bridge, arch,
					the original force of arches under vertical load and functional separation of the
					horizontal thrust, the vertical force borne by hinged struts and arch ring and the
					horizontal load consolidation of horizontal Struts and Arch ring passed to the mountain.
					Due to the assumed vertical load of the vertical struts and arch ring hinged and
					the hinge is set above the water surface and avoids the risk of water erosion prone
					to cracking of arch, and because section strong horizontal bar and consolidation
					of arch ring, play a role in non-hinge arch.

					2. Meet the Requirements of Special Activity Direction of Deformation Structure 

					In bridge, you typically need to set expansion joints, usually in the setting expansion
					joints are hinged. For example, the beam and the adjacent junctions of main girder
					or main-beams at the articulated hinge. Sometimes, however, in order to improve the
					rigidity of the structure, mechanics theory hope can only be freely and no hinge
					at the expansion joints of beam, you could pass the bending moment, which broke the
					previous making joints in the frame requirements. Such as the construction of multi-tower
					cable-stayed bridge to span a wide surface, in order to improve the rigidity of the
					structure, main beam of hope is the continuum and consolidation of girders and pylons.
					However, this poses a problem, after so many years under the action of temperature
					difference effect the beam vertically retractable tower column constraint, which
					would have a huge moment in the towers, at the same time causes additional tension
					or pressure in the main beam. In order to solve this problem, the best main beam
					can be freely, but the hinge does not reduce bending stiffness, therefore, German
					Professor Schiliesh raised the sliding beam structure envisaged to achieve that function,
					as shown in Fig. 7.2. 



Fig. 7.2 Retractable passing moment of structure. 



Fig. 7.3 Hinge passing elastic bending moment. 

Figure 7.3 is another assumption, shown above is usually cross-hinge method, shown
					below, is both a retractable flexible hinge of the passing moment. 

					In Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, Dubrovnik Bridge (Fig. 7.4), is a composite girder cable-stayed
					bridge in collaboration with the connection of pre-stressed concrete rigid frame
					bridge, built in 2001, bridges total length 481 m, which combines a beam bridge part
					337 m, pre-stressed concrete box-girder frame section 147 m, a main span of 304.05
					m, is the largest span in the world alone multi-tower cable-stayed bridge composite
					cable-stayed bridge with pre-stressed concrete rigid frame bridge with box section
					connection point on the use of the above slide fixed beam structure, effectively
					improve the stiffness of the cable-stayed bridge with rigid frame bridge section
					and at the same time allowed between two bridge girders vertical scaling. 



Fig. 7.4 Franjo Tudjman Bridge. 

					3. Adjustable Boundary Condition—Position Limiting Device 

					In long cable-stayed bridge or suspension bridge design, the forms of tower and main
					beam column connection include floating, articulated, rigid etc., bridge span is
					smaller a form generally selected according to specific design conditions. But for
					large-span cable-stayed bridge, or Span cable-stayed bridge, hoping to improve the
					stiffness of structures under live loads or wind, which want the main girder and
					pylon hinge, in small earthquakes loads of girder and tower column of main girder
					on seismic force evenly spread over several towers. However, upon articulation, the
					main beam under the long-term temperature effects of lengthening and shortening will
					make the towers bear a great deal of bending moments, so using a floating system
					is more reasonable. This requires under different conditions different boundary conditions
					in order to achieve better loading state. According to the above request, the lock
					is set in between the tower and the main beam damping device of the ideas put forward.
					Fig. 7.5 is the principle of viscous damping devices. 

					Viscous damper works with a small hole in piston moving within a viscous liquid-filled
					pipes. When the piston movement speed, there is resistance and—slow movement offers
					very little resistance. Application of this principle can be implemented in different
					conditions requirements of different boundary conditions. Live load or deformation
					under wind action is faster transient deformation of damper produces a great deal
					of resistance of main girder and the tower is similar to the hinge between the columns
					or piers, year-round temperature disparity effect distortion were slow, so resistance
					is very small, it's like sliding between the main beams and columns or piers. 



Fig. 7.5 Viscous damper construction principle. 

					Damper's damping force through viscous liquid of characteristic physical characteristics
					and pistons small holes to adjust, damping size matches the natural vibration characteristic
					of bridges, structural vibration dampers can also consume energy to vibration control
					role. 

					China's Su Tong bridge main span is 1088 m of super long-span cable-stayed bridge
					design set a maximum displacement limit damper when displacement damper of smaller
					working principle is similar to the above, but when the displacement of more than
					750 mm, the damper spring steel sheet will work, flexible connections, limiting power
					of upto 10000 kN, elastic stiffness for the 100 MN/m. Fig. 7.6 is the layout of Su
					Tong bridge damper. 

					Greece's Rion-Antirion Bridge across Greece city and boluo ran sub-peninsula, between
					the Gulf of Corinth, was a 286 m + 3 × 560 m + 286 m span continuous girder cable-stayed
					bridge of four towers (Fig. 7.7), the main beam length of 2252 m, is the world's
					longest main girder of cable-stayed bridge, completed in 2004. Sensitivity, and building
					on the strong seismic belt, in order to accommodate the live load, temperature, wind
					loads and degeneration under seismic effects, floating in the whole system of main
					girders with tower, girder and pier between cleverly arranged joining condition.
					In design, pier and beam, beam locally increased small stringer, to decorate the
					connection of pier-beam damping device. In order to ensure stability against wind
					and reduce operations due to live load and temperature in vertical and horizontal
					displacements, each tower is equipped with a four linkage between dampers allow for
					it about 1000 kN, along the bridge to the limit 1.6 m, transverse nearly motionless.
					When strong earthquake occurs, damp damage beam movement can be connected to the
					tower of four damper under the influence have been greatly eased, displacement up
					to ± 1.3 m. Both ends of the main beam and bridge junction, under the live loads,
					vertical displacement can be up to 2.5 m, beam supports with high 14 m, can withstand
					the vertical load and longitudinal displacement of the beam of steel frame, between
					steel frame and main girder dynamic dampers were installed. Fig. 7.8 illustrates
					the damper of the bridge signalled. 

					Above are specifically designed according to the specific requirements for bridge
					border some examples of components, these components have in common point is, by
					means of special construction, makes the overall structure of the force status more
					reasonable and reliable, in design played a key role. 

					7.2.3 Innovative Construction Composition 

					Utilising material strength is an effective way to save construction costs. From
					the micro-structure of material damage consists only pull, compressive and shear.
					In general, materials with high tensile and compression strength of unit price is
					relatively high, such as steel high compression strength materials with low tensile
					strength and are relatively inexpensive, such as stone and concrete. If use completely
					steel can make bridge structure light, but the price is high. And if built entirely
					out of concrete bridges, although the material prices are low, but in addition to
					basic compression arch bridges, no other types of bridges can be built. Therefore,
					in the tension zone of steel at the same time in the compression zone concrete, is
					a bridge set up low cost compromises, which formed a composite structure. Fig. 7.9
					is reinforced concrete beam shape and perspective, reinforced glass is shown in Fig.
					7.10. 



Fig. 7.6 Layout of Su Tong bridge damper (unit: cm). 

					Composite structure of reinforced concrete and pre-stressed concrete is the most
					basic, their invention is the modern civil engineering exhibition of the most important
					achievements. Steel bar tensile, compression of concrete, and also protect re-bar.
					Reinforced concrete and pre-stressed concrete. Main weaknesses are the big weight
					of the concrete, it is difficult to fully control the crack of concrete construction
					site require large equipment and more artificial, and long duration. Fig. 7.11 shows
					the serious corrosion of steel bar in concrete has lost the protection of function.
					

					In order to overcome the defects of reinforced concrete and pre-stressed concrete
					structure, built entirely of steel tension only in compression zone built with concrete,
					commonly referred to as steel and concrete composite structure is formed. As some
					of the sections using the steel structure, so Widget reduction in weight, in the
					crack-prone location is in steel, avoiding concrete cracks cannot totally control
					problems erection of light steel structures part can also save the concrete construction
					of the bracket or large lifting equipment. Therefore, composite structure bridge
					engineers increasingly with a large number of innovations. 

					Composite structures can be combined into composite section structure and architecture.
					Former members within a section built with different materials, which built structures
					in different sectors with different materials. 



Fig. 7.7 Rion-antirion bridge base deflection (a) Rion-antirion Bridge shape (b)
						Seismic changes front and rear axle position within possible terrain. 

					Application of composite bridge there are still some hurdles to jump, mainly the
					following issues: 


						concrete creep and shrinkage strain led to stress between steel and concrete in large
						weight distribution; 

						need a reliable connection between steel and concrete; 

						complicated technology and high cost, we must fully cost competitive advantage. 


					In Europe, America and Japan for many years efforts have been made, composite structure
					in bridges already have a wide range of applications, while also the corresponding
					industry standards and specifications. In contrast, composite structure bridges in
					China has just started, there is no industry chain, currently do not have design
					specification. 

					1. The Combined Cross-section Structure 

					Composite section with the most intuitive principle is steel and concrete structure
					in tension zone, so you can play steel good tension performance of steel, good compression
					performance of concrete. 

					Early years, part of composite section beam with small span steel girders of many
					smaller beams, so you need to set more reinforced ribs, increases the complexity
					of construction. In order to reduce the cost of composite section beams, simplifying
					structure is a direct route. The current trends is the use of large I-steel to minimise
					the stiffener and horizontal linkages, while the beam section directly by steel rolling
					shape, which greatly reduce the workload of bridge construction site, although the
					steel consuming, but overall effectiveness is still high. A narrower bridges (10~12
					m wide) may use either a larger I-beams, only a small number of horizontal linkages.
					Fig. 7.12 shows the composite section beams, two steel girders formed by large I-steel
					from a split in the middle of the web, carefully designed cutting line connection
					between steel beam and concrete, and significant cost savings. 



Fig. 7.8 Rion-Antirion Bridge damper schematic drawing. 



Fig. 7.9 Reinforced concrete hollow slab beam shape and internal reinforcement. 

					Over a wide bridge, in order to increase the torsional stiffness of the bridge, there
					has been a combination of box-section beams, usually composed of groove consisting
					of steel beams and concrete roof. Bridge of Donghai bridge over main navigation 420
					m for long-span cable-stayed bridge, in order to resist the dominated by container
					truck load of eccentric loads, using channel section of main girder box beams (see
					as shown in Fig. 7.13). 

					If it is a continuous beam, in order to resist the pivot plate pressure caused by
					negative bending moment stresses at the pier near the base plate can be poured concrete
					in order to improve the stiffness of composite beam smaller, roof and floor beams
					can also be built with concrete, webs of steel structures, steel webs can effectively
					avoid webs easy to crack under tensile stress of concrete problems. Top and bottom
					setting can be the same as in concrete beam in the concrete pre-stressing tendons,
					to resist bending tensile stress. If you need to layout curved pre-stressing, can
					take the form of externally pre-stressed. Fig. 7.14 is France's La Ferte Saint-Aubin
					bridge, Web is made of 12 mm thick steel plate. 

					In addition to simple-supported beam, beam in the other bridge types is likely to
					take different directions in different sectors of the moment, such as continuous
					beam across sectors bear the positive moment, while the middle pier near Liang Duancheng
					charged moment, which made it possible for both upper and lower beam flange pulling
					force. Prevention of crack in the tension zone of the concrete in tension becomes
					the key to the design. Solution to this problem is in the concrete pre-stressed plate.
					Pre-stressing in several different ways, direct approach within the board or boards
					by pre-stressed reinforced, after bent steel beams can also be poured concrete slab
					and then release the Pre-flex pre-stressed indirect approaches.

					However a greater shrinkage and creep of concrete, if the direct placement of concrete
					in the compression zone, started by a force, coagulation soils can bear the stress.
					However, over time, larger shrinkage and creep of concrete (contract value of approximately
					310~529 μ, the creep co-efficient value of approximately 1.28~3.9), this results
					in a cross-section stress redistribution between the steel and concrete. Compressive
					stress of concrete will be transferred to the compressive flange of steel girders,
					which will make the beam flange in compression zone yield. This is the reinforced
					concrete need to address one of the problems of composite section beams. 

					Reduce the shrinkage and creep of concrete is one way to solve this problem. Thus,
					compression zone of concrete slabs, pre-fabricated stored for more than 6 months
					after, then erected on a steel beam, after watering or watering hole after using
					shear studs and beams connected. During storage the shrinkage of concrete have completed
					most, meanwhile, loaded due to age-long concrete total SEO variables will also be
					reduced (smaller values of the creep coefficient). Fig. 7.15 shows a composite girder
					cable-stayed bridge of main girder erection process. Concrete bridge decks was built
					on top of main beam, connecting with steel beam through post-casting gap. 

					In addition, erecting steel girders of steel beams can also take advantage of characteristics
					of light weight and easy to set up, bridge erection is relatively easy to set up
					steel beam erection of concrete plate bracket, saves the construction cost. Fig.
					7.16 shows a Switzerland composite continuous beam bridge (Vaux Viaduct) construction
					process, ranging through the valleys of the bridge part is 62 m + 130 m + 16 m +
					130 m + 62 m + 45 m un-uniformed span continuous beam, light variable-height steel
					girders set to the bridge using incremental launching method , on top of which pre-fabricated
					concrete bridge deck pavement was then installed. Because it is a continuous beam,
					stretching in the middle pier top of concrete has longitudinal pre-stressing to resist
					the negative moments pre-stressed concrete slabs and steel beams stretching before
					you connect. 

					Between steel and less concrete due to shrinkage and creep of concrete stress re-distribution
					is the another way, through the gauge steel can withstand shear and longitudinal
					freely, without impeding the shrinkage and creep of concrete, eliminating stress
					distributions. Corrugated webs of beams under this is the design of the product.

Figure 7.17 is the France Cognac bridge. It is a continuous box girder bridge, the
					top and bottom was pre-stressed concrete, and webs were converted wave shape steel
					web plate. Because quality steel hummocky, with almost no longitudinal stiffness,
					but can take on shear, it exerted on the beam all by in vivo and in vitro on pre-stressed
					concrete, and long-term creep will not be cause between steel and concrete, should
					re-distribution of gravity. In addition, the transverse stiffness of corrugated webs
					than steel, so it can be without stiffener, drastically reduces the effect work intensity.

					Is a commonly used form of an overloaded bridge with large span truss beam, in order
					to be able to bear overload can also use steel truss and concrete composite beam.
					Fig. 7.20 shows the Denmark and Sweden between which the resund bridge, is a highway-railway
					dual-purpose bridge, the main bridge of 490 m cable-stayed bridge with multi-span
					continuous girder of approach span 140 m span. Main girder of cable-stayed bridge
					and continuous girder of approach spans are all used steel trusses concrete slab
					composite section. 

					Steel industry is one of the major forces driving the development of composite structure,
					together with engineers, they produce suitable for shaped steel beams of composite
					section beams and accessories, thus greatly lowering the cost of steel parts manufacturing.
					For example, the wave plates, large beams and so on. As shown in Fig. 7.21 Japan's
					engineers worked with Mills to develop specialised in the production of composite
					beams of steel, such as steel pipe, grooved girder. By contrast, there are no steel
					mills in China to develop such product. 



Fig. 7.21 Composite beams of steel (a) pipe; (b) u-channel steel. 

					In addition to the composite section beam, pillar can also be use the composite section.
					Main steel casing filled with concrete piers cross-section. The advantages are: on
					the one hand, column surface plate can effectively resist tensile stress to prevent
					cracking of concrete on the other, steel housings can be used as scaffolds and templates,
					save on construction costs. Fig. 7.22 is the towers of the Akashi bridge and selection
					programme, which section is divided into many compartments of the steel casing filled
					with concrete to form a composite section. 

					Most of cable-stayed bridge tower for eccentric compression member, can be built
					with concrete, but at the top of the tower cable anchorage area, in addition to vertical
					under the pressure, but also bear the main span and side spans of cable horizontal
					force on the pull. This concrete tower columns, use negative, there are two ways
					to take the level of tension. One is the main span and side spans of cable pylon
					cross, horizontal tension transformed into compression, the benefits of doing so
					are tower anchorage zone of volume can be reduced, unfavourable place is the primary
					span and side spans of cable transverse does not meet at a single point, towers assumed
					local torque and bolt-head is exposed. Another way of dealing with is the use of
					hollow towers, inclined cable anchorage in the transverse direction of towers and
					walls. Advantage to this is the main side spans of cable anchor fixed on the same
					plane, bridge overall reasonable strength, disadvantage is, ask for installed in
					the tower stayed, poor construction, the Tower post jamb to bear pulling force. Resist
					the pull of the tower within the walls, there are two methods: one is the tower walls
					arranged in circumferential pre-stressed, the parties law pre-stressing loss in the
					tower there is the risk of cracking and another method is the use of steel and concrete
					composite sections, borne by the concrete vertical pressure, inflict horizontal force
					on steel.

Figure 7.23 shows the Nromandie bridge, France pylon anchorage zone structure. The
					main span of the bridge is 856 m, embedded in the concrete wall undertake longitudinal
					tension of steel anchor box, the vertical force passing through shear studs to tower
					on a concrete, towers and concrete in the transverse direction is divided into two
					pieces of steel anchor box and tower configurations within circumferential pre-stressing
					of concrete to cover of steel anchor box passed over by shear studs vertical pull.
					

Figure 7.24 is Rion-Antirion Bridge bridge pylon anchorage zone structure, its construction
					principle are the same as Nromandie bridge. 

Figure 7.25 shows China's Su Tong bridge constructed of steel anchor box, full of
					steel anchor box embedded in a closed hollow concrete towers columns, analysis showed
					that, due to the rigidity of steel anchor box is not infinite, under the action of
					horizontal forces of cable-stayed, transverse to the tower wall side will produce
					a horizontal force, under the most unfavourable conditions reach the level of concrete
					cracking, for overcoming the cracking of concrete failure profit impact tower configuration
					with more conventional bars in concrete walls to spread the crack, crack width control
					in a certain fan within the surrounding.

Fig. 7.25 Of Su-Tong bridge of steel anchor box structure. 

Figure 7.26 is Hong Kong Ting Kau Bridge pylon anchorage zone, being a 4-cable-plane
					cable-stayed bridge, steel-anchor-box symmetric protrude from concrete outside of
					the towers, horizontal force entirely shouldered by the steel-anchor-box while the
					concrete bear vertical force. Because steel anchor box is on the outside of the tower,
					so after using manufactured on the sides, lifting craft, erection of steel anchor
					box in place, reperfusion tower anchorage of steel anchor box of concrete, assisted
					by tensioned circumferential pre-stressed beams. 

					The design is to use the outer steel tubes confinement on concrete-filled steel tube
					to form triaxial compressive stress of concrete, thereby increasing the compressive
					strength of concrete. Concrete-filled steel tube, first in foreign countries have
					been proposed, but due to the confinement of the outer tube the mechanism is not
					clear, so not many examples of engineering applications. In current engineering practice
					in China, concrete-filled steel tube arch bridges are widely used, mainly due to
					the construction of facilities. Pipe has lighter weight in the process of assembling
					arch and high tolerance for tensile or compressive stress (high tolerance). Eliminating
					the arch, so there are some economy. Often arch design of concrete-filled steel tube
					arch bridge does not take into account the confinement of concrete-filled steel tube
					effect, but simply as a general section design of the conversion, even carrying capacity
					limit state is not considering the effect of pipe, consider only the compressive
					strength of concrete.

					In addition to forming of steel and concrete composite section outside and other
					tensile properties of materials can also be combined with a concrete section. Fig.
					7.27 shows the Brazil of a form of composite section beams and concrete log bridge,
					bridge of long-span 12 m. Fig. 7.28 shows the connection structure of wood and concrete.
					As Brazil is rich in wood, it is a bold attempt.

					2. Combination of Architecture 

					Structure of the different sections with different materials, can achieve weight
					reduction, cost savings, speed of construction purposes. 

Figure 7.29 is the layout of vertical and cross-section of the bridge of France Normandy
					bridge. Main span 856 m span of was the world's large cable-stayed bridge across
					the Seine river, straddling the river, a condition of small-span bridge, so the side
					span of cable-stayed bridge and the main from the towers out of 116 m concrete span
					section, middle main span of steel box girder. This reduces cross-main beam weight
					(beam 9 t/m, if we adopt the concrete beam 45 t/m), save cable costs, while reducing
					the side span length, not only saves the cost side, more auxiliary supporting piers
					also greatly increases the stiffness of the main span. To section integration one
					side span concrete beam and steel box girder of main span is selected the same shape.

					Chongqing shibanpo Yangtze river double-line bridge of shibanpo Changjiang River
					Bridge in old in order to coordinate needs to build 330 m of main span continuous
					rigid frame bridge. Large-span pre-stressed concrete continuous rigid-frame bridge,
					due to the weight of main girder set degree, will produce a great deal of bending
					moments and shear forces, previous bridge built, there have been many cracks. In
					order to avoid these problems, Mr Man-Chung Tang in the cross-section of steel beam
					scheme span weight sets in due to the decrease of 330 m master looked back only the
					equivalent of 270 m of long span continuous rigid-frame span bending moment of pre-stressed
					concrete continuous rigid frame and the 270 m long-span pre-stressed concrete continuous
					rigid frame is built of precedents, so programme set up as shown in Fig. 7.30. 

					Chongqing caiyuanba Yangtze River Bridge Is a span of 88 m + 102 m + 420 m + 102
					m + 88 m supporting system arch bridge, due to terrain features, has selected a span
					across the main channel of the programme. Side span on river banks and in shallow
					water area, reducing the span can reduce costs, and eliminates side pillars, aesthetic
					values. In order to balance the weight of the main span of the bridge above the main
					arch with steel box section, below the side spans and bridge main span arch using
					concrete cross-section, as shown in Fig. 7.31.

					7.2.4 Structural Connections between Different Interface 

					1. Force on the Connection Requirements 

					Neither composite section structure nor the combination of architecture, must be
					connected between different materials. How to apply different material together is
					the key to form a uniform cross-section or structure. For composite beams, different
					materials need transmission mainly is the shear force and bending moment of composite
					architecture needs to be passed between different materials. Connections between
					different materials typically weaknesses in the structure, apart from satisfying
					the normal stiffness and strength requirements, fatigue is often the design control
					factors, as well as to construct designed also to ease of construction. 

					Transmission of forces between different materials is not enough to rely solely on
					adhesion between material, you must take certain measures, which measures increase
					the connection area, increase mechanical pre-stressed occlusal function, and so on.
					

					2. Composite Section Member Mainly Based on Transfer of Shear Joint Structure 

					In the composite section member, with transfer of shear between concrete and steel,
					uses connections with stud connections, steel connections, steel connections, perforated
					steel plate connections. 

					Stud connection is widely used in the steel and concrete composite beams in the form
					of its principle of operation is vertically welded in the tension zone of steel plate
					shear studs on concrete adhesive, in addition to the bond between the concrete and
					shear studs, there are mechanical forces. When the number of shear studs enough,
					failure mainly around shear studs, concrete is crushed, as concrete, strength that
					could cut nail. When the bond between concrete and steel plate failure, shear transfer
					depends entirely on shear studs, so in between steel and concrete there is a slip,
					also known as the flexible connection, as shown in Fig. 7.32(a) shown below. 

					Rebar connecting through steel plates welded bent into various shapes of reinforcing
					steel bar and concrete form of connection, when steel-tired gauge length is long
					enough, the bond between reinforcing steel bar and concrete enough to make steel
					and concrete work. The strength of the connection depends on in between steel and
					steel plate welding strength and yield strength of rebar. Reinforced connections
					are well suited to bridge construction site operations steel bending in the form
					of a ring, spiral-shaped, as in Fig. 7.32(c) shown below. 

					Steel connection in steel channels and angles, such as welding on steel and concrete
					with the connection, it works with the same principle as that of shear studs. Due
					to steel and steel plate stiffness of connection, even in the absence of bond between
					steel and concrete, steel plate and mix slip between the concrete is very small,
					so called rigid connection, as shown in Fig. 7.32(b) shown below. 



Fig. 7.32 Connector structure (a) Cylinder head Stud connectors (b) Grooved steel
						connectors (c) bent steel connectors. 

					Perforated plate is the use of steel concrete between steel and concrete in the hole
					forces a new connection forms along the steel beam vertical connecting plates can
					be set through holes on steel, can also do not set through steel bars. This connection
					is first proposed by Leonhardt and others in 1987, Japan got a lot of research and
					applications. Study shows that holes in the mix concrete has great dowel action and
					its ultimate destruction is the hole in the shear failure of reinforced concrete,
					and are not subject to the effects of fatigue. At present, specification is basically
					not open cell provide for the shear capacity of steel plate calculated basically
					based on test an empirical formula. 



Fig. 7.33 Shows the shear plate and concrete bolted connections with perforated sheet.
						

					3. The Passing Combination of Bending Moment and Shear Force Structure of Connection
					Points Structure 

					Combined system of structural connections between components of different materials,
					transfer request is complicated, passing some major moments, some to transfer of
					shear to be passing moments. Connections between different components the construction
					convenience is a major factor must be taken into account in the design of these factors.
					

					Resistance of shear connections can still use the above forms, bridge of steel-concrete
					composite joints many openings plate form, in addition to passing moments, to be
					configured in the concrete and steel members connections pre or pre stressed bars.

						perforated steel plate (c) connect steel beams install. 

					Chongqing Shibanpo bridge of steel-concrete composite joints made of perforated steel
					plate connections structure with pre-stressed joint. Because in the middle-section
					of steel beam from a major, if the steel beams cantilevered cast-suspended in the
					air and concrete connection, a long time, the operation is difficult. Steel beam
					end connection section is separate from the main production, fixed on a concrete
					cantilever and hoisting of steel girders in place connect directly with welding,
					so that after hoisting into place the field connection workload has been greatly
					reduced, ensuring the safety and quality of construction. Fig. 7.34 is slate slope
					construction and connection of steel beams of the bridge connecting hole on plate.
					Perforated steel embedded in concrete connections steel beam connections with perforated
					steel plate welded and tensioned, main hoisting of steel girders in place welded
					to steel beam connections. 



Fig. 7.35 Nanjing Changjiang third bridge tower connection parts. 

					Nanjing Changjiang third bridge tower following sections of bridge deck concrete
					towers and steel towers above deck. Connecting parts mainly transmit axial force,
					in order to make the junction shape smooth, general connection with flanges structures
					is not used, instead axial force was transformed into shear force through perforated
					plates connecting steel columns and concrete pylon. Fig. 7.35 shows the connecting
					point structure. 

					In building structures and steel bridges, based on different loading behaviour, can
					be combined with reinforced concrete column and steel beam, Fig. 7.36 shows the construction
					of a pre-stressed bolt connection, which greatly reduces the workload of the field.

					4. Innovation in Making the Connection with a Simplified Structure 

					Connection structure between the different materials is difficult in bridge construction
					and durability locally, so that an attached structure simplified, stress clearly
					is effective for improving connection reliability pathways. 

					Pylon cable-stayed bridges mostly built of concrete, which can give full play to
					concrete good strength characteristics, usually towers on either side of the cable-stayed
					for while anchoring at the tower, rather than is continuous across the towers, mainly
					because the cable is thicker, small radius cannot be used through the tower. Pylon
					pylon is the anchoring problem in addition to bear vertical force, also bear the
					horizontal force, the same tower requires a larger size to decorate when two anchorages
					and tensioning. 



Fig. 7.37 Glass City Skyway main Bridge facades (unit: mm). 



Fig. 7.38 Glass City Skyway main bridge tower facades and cross-section (unit: m).
						

					Located in the United States city of Toledo, Ohio, Glass across the Maumee river
					City Skyway Bridge is a two-span 186.69 m single-cable-plane cable-stayed bridge
					with single tower, bridge width reaches 38.814 m, as shown in Fig. 7.37. In order
					to make the bridge a new landmark of the city, and aesthetic requirements bridge
					scheme is one of the main factors to be considered when, so choose a simple, single-cable
					multi-tower cable-stayed bridge. Due to large, cable forces of cable-stayed, the
					maximum cable required 156 root 7Ø5 steel wire Fig. 7.38. If the pylon anchorage
					cable on both sides, the giant large horizontal force would make the Tower size increased
					a lot. To solve this problem, the design continuously through the pylon of cable-stayed
					bridge saddles, saddle structure as in Fig. 7.39. Saddle consists of a series of
					small diameter 25 mm stainless steel tubes, each pipe through a steel wire, all the
					small pipe wrapped in a big stainless steel tube closed at both ends, filling in
					the casing strength 34.5 MPa cement slurries, as strand completely in parallel through
					the tower, successfully resolved the hawser asks not bending with small radius problem.
					Due to this critical structures, towers using solid cross-section tower size was
					greatly reduced, and because tower anchorage zone stress is very small, the reinforcement
					is greatly simplified. Simple anchoring provides conditions for the area is decorated
					with glass towers. 

					7.2.5 Structural Measures to Mitigate Failure 

					1. Reduce Failure Requirements and Approaches 

					Special loads such as seismic, wind, ship collision with power amplification of common
					features, but the probability is very small. If bridge is fully equipped with the
					ability to resist these load of peaks, bridges need to be designed to be very powerful,
					which will make the project cost greatly increased. How small the price conditions
					enabling bridges to resist these little probability of special loads, bridge design
					is not off the pursuit of the objectives. Appropriate structural measures to be taken,
					you can reduce the load of these power amplification causing the destruction of the
					bridge. 



Fig. 7.39 Glass City Skyway main Bridge facades (unit: mm). 

					Effect of cyclic loads on the bridge is mainly reflected in the vibration caused
					by fatigue and dynamic amplification sides. Dynamic role in addition to loads itself
					with relations, also associated with the natural frequency of the structure. When
					the structure of the natural vibration frequency cyclic loading of frequencies or
					frequency multiplier with the outside world came near, the resonance structure occurs,
					power amplification is more obvious, and even dynamic instability. Therefore, the
					reduction of dynamic characteristics of the destruction of the bridge from the following
					two aspects: one is to change the structure of vibration characteristics, so that
					it is not easy for the outer resonance excitation effect; the second is increase
					passivation measures, reduce the destruction of the dynamic load capacity. 

					2. Change the Structure Vibration Characteristics of Structures 

					For relatively light structure or structures are prone to periodic external vibration
					under load, may be controlled by design factors. Most likely vibration of cables
					of cable-stayed bridge is bridge members. There are two factors causing vibrations
					of cable-stayed: one is the parametric oscillation, and second, the vortex-induced
					vibration under the action of wind and rain. 



Fig. 7.40 Principles of the parametric vibration of cables. 

Fig. 7.40 is basic principles of parametric vibration. When cable's main beam vertical
					bending vibration transverse vibration period and cycle close, cable vibration will
					be more obvious. 

					In the Normandy bridge design, because the primary beam span upto 856 m, bending
					vibration period of 4.0 s, the longest cable vibration period of 4.5 s, parametric
					vibration of cables in order to prevent, in the cable is designed for connecting
					cable Fig. 7.41. Due to the cable settings, will be the longest natural period of
					vibration of the cable, down from 1.25 s, other cable, which effectively prevents
					the parametric vibration of cables. 



Fig. 7.41 Normandy bridge cable. 

					3. Energy Dissipation Damping (Earthquake) Construction 

					Damping will be eliminate the vibration energy and, therefore, increased damping
					to reduce vibrations caused by knots effective measure to frame failure. Increase
					the damping is the most direct way to set the dampers, and stayed increased cable
					damper design has become a usual cable vibration reduction measures. Simple damping
					is to fill rubber damping material between the cable and the girder sleeve through
					which the cable runs. Currently focused on the design of hydraulic damper in cable
					has been widely, hydraulic damper of damping ratio can be set as desired. Fig. 7.42
					is a hydraulic damper and its installation on the cable. 



Fig. 7.42 Hydraulic damper (a) hydraulic dampers; (b) position on damper in cable.
						

					If yield would also eliminate the vibration of structure, in the traditional concept
					of structure is not allowed to succumb, even under the earthquake forces as well.
					But if fruit intends to make some minor component at design time in the strong earthquake
					occurred while yielding to remove earthquake input of energy, you can protect the
					main structure, and these secondary structures after earthquake can be replaced.
					This is a design under the performance-based seismic design idea. 

					New East San Francisco Bay Bridge is to replace the existing San Francisco East Bay
					Bridge self-anchored suspension bridge, east of the existing bridge is a steel truss
					bridge, the 1989, San Francisco earthquake partially damaged it, according to estimates,
					the bridge could not meet a future anti-earthquake requirements, and reinforcement
					of cost is very high, so to build a new Bay Bridge. East San Francisco Bay Bridge
					Fig. 7.43 is a single-tower self-anchored suspension bridges, with the main span
					of 385 m Bridge is based on conditions across the deepwater channel decision, due
					to the aesthetic requirements of the local population, they do not want portal pylon,
					but single-column. Huge deck suspended on a single column, in the earthquake zone
					pylon seismic requirements it is difficult to foot, so designer Mr Man-Chung Tang
					limited destruction dissipation solution. 

					The whole tower is divided into four branches, and shear plate connection between
					each other. Battened usually tower of limbs even as a whole so that they work together
					to resist the live load moments. And under strong earthquake forces, these panels
					will surrender, to the Council the role of protecting the main structure of full
					bridge was destroyed, as shown in Fig. 7.44.

					Canada Confederation Bridge was built-in the North Atlantic Winter sea ice, ice floes
					in spring alongwith the currents hit the pier, to prevent crashed ice bridge becomes
					the key to bridge design. Resist ice impact directly through strengthening the piers,
					but it will greatly increased. Designers through thematic studies and designed the
					ice structure. Ice shield is set in sea-level location on the pier slope, when ice
					floes rammed into a pier at sheet lifted, under the action of gravity, crushed ice,
					eliminating the impact of ice energy, as shown in Fig. 7.45. This is a unique example
					of a design of energy dissipation.

					7.2.6 Structural Measures Ensuring Structure Durability 

					Durability is an important parameter for evaluating structural design, life span
					is 100 years of bridge design, bridge master structure must meet this requirement,
					generally cannot be replaced in the design life. But in the bridge structure exposure
					to nature, while also experiencing the repeated actions of vehicle loads, how to
					guarantee the durability of bridge engineering a big problem. Bridges the widespread
					use of outside material, in addition to concrete, steel corrosion (especially the
					corrosion of high strength steel), issues such as the aging of rubber from the material
					itself is not easy to solve, enhanced durability generally use two methods: one is
					to enhance the protection measure; the second is on long-term protection of members,
					reserve replacement measures in the structural service life period. Now common in
					bridge-free guarantees durability throughout the lifecycle and requires multiple
					replacements of components are: high strength steel cables, suspenders, rubber or
					steel made of timber supports, expansion joints, and so on. Durability of building
					materials cannot yet be predicted at present, this requires that in the course of
					shall carry out regular checks of bridges, especially those known vulnerable component,
					must be regularly checked. Therefore, in bridge design examinations, operations,
					space should be reserved in the course, wearing component construction, inspection,
					can be replaced. 

					1. The Corrosion of the Reinforcement Measures 

					Corrosion is the weak point of durability of reinforced concrete structures, particularly
					chloride ion permeability rather serious situations, such as environment of the marine
					environment and the northern winter road salt, corrosion in these environments is
					essential. 

					Corrosion protection there are at present several ideas: the first is to strengthen
					the protection of concrete, and the other is in steel add extra protection protective
					measures, the third is to improve resistance to corrosion of the steel itself. 

					Rebar is mainly chloride ion corrosion reinforcement in the environment, to the reinforced
					concrete blocks to chloride ion penetration, time increased chloride ion penetration
					into the steel becomes effective means of protecting reinforcing steel bar. There
					are two steps to achieve the above objectives: Is to increase the thickness of the
					concrete cover, and the other is the compactness of concrete. National specification
					for reinforced concrete protective layer thickness generally determined depending
					on the structure of the office environment, for example, in reinforcement protection
					layer thickness of bridge design specifications according to the reinforcement category,
					component in the structure determines the location and structure of the office environment,
					I kind of superstructure of main reinforcement protection layer thickness in the
					environment is 30 mm, while in the III, IV class environment of substructure reinforcement
					protection layer thickness of 60 mm. Under the environment of salt in the ocean or
					the North, with the exception of thickened layer, but also called for greater strength
					of concrete to improve its compactness. In the East China Sea Bridge, bridge construction
					of bridge pier and splash zone maximum thickness of concrete cover for 70 mm, for
					because it is a cast-concrete, concrete cover thickness 90 mm, add slag and superplasticizer
					using high density compaction of marine concrete with chloride ion penetration to
					slow speed. 

					In the rebar can be increased with additional protective measures are: added rust
					inhibitor in concrete, rebar added corrosion-resistant coating, reinforced implementation
					of cathodic protection. Add a rust inhibitor in concrete, can form a passivation
					layer of protective film on the steel surface, thus effectively blocking to prevent
					erosion by Harmful ions on the steel bar. Inhibitor is relatively cheap, the operation
					is simple, just mixing in concrete, has been widely used in China. Tidal zone pile
					caps of Hangzhou Bay Bridge and piers of the splash zone areas as a mixed-type inhibitor
					additional measures to guarantee the durability of concrete structures. Increased
					corrosion protection coating on the surface of the steel is also an effective reinforcement
					of protection measures Shi, widely used epoxy-coated surface by electrostatic spray
					bars, abroad, starting from in the 1970, of the 20th century bridge is already in
					widespread use in the marine environment. Our country has been able to produce epoxy
					resin coated steel bar, and the enactment of production standards, some application
					in port engineering. Application of epoxy resin coated steel bar key is in the process
					of shipping, processing, assembling not to damage the steel surface coating. If the
					local coating is damaged, it accelerates corrosion of the tear, hence, damage must
					be repaired on site, increases the difficulty of construction. In the splash zone
					of Hangzhou Bay Bridge Piers cast-concrete epoxy resins used in coatings reinforcement,
					practice has shown that, under China's construction technology, easily damaged coating
					application is difficult. Cathodic protection by effectively the establishment of
					an external anode, turning the bar into a cathode to prevent loss of iron, in order
					to achieve corrosion protection. External anode can lower than that of steel materials,
					or realized by impressed current. Hangzhou Bay Bridge bearing platform of main piers,
					the tidal zone and the splash zone to try impressed current cathodic protection measures
					have been adopted to ensure RC 100 years without being eroded, and the entire system
					imported from abroad. 

					Protective measures, the third is to improve resistance to corrosion of the steel
					itself. Stainless steel main alloy constituents of chromium and nickel, has a high
					chemical stability in oxidizing medium to generate a dense tough film. When the chromium
					content of more than 11.7%, can make the whole gold electrode potential of significantly improved, so as to effectively prevent the further oxidation of the alloy. Currently
					not in concrete structure stainless steel rebar is austenitic steel and duplex stainless
					steel, the chemical composition and mechanical properties as shown in Table 7.1.

					Application of stainless steel reinforced concrete was as early as 1937~1941, year
					construction-project is Mexico Yucatan Progresso Harbour project, 2100 m length of
					reinforced concrete piles with sea water corrosion of type 304 stainless steel to
					resist serious. Projects put into use 40 years later no related news was heard in
					1970, testing began on the corrosion research, which lasted 20 years, results show
					that its corrosion resistance performance is good. The project services for more
					than 60 years, without much maintenance, so stainless steel was widely used notices.
					Stainless steel application problems mainly in the areas of: stainless steel smooth
					surface, and the behaviour of the concrete was wrong, so need more anchorage length;
					stainless steel electrode potential is high, if mixed with carbon steel use will
					accelerate carbon steel corrosion, therefore, when used in the two structures must
					be electrically isolated; more important is high prices, increase in engineering
					material costs. In recent years, abroad to study the properties of stainless steel
					reinforced concrete, studies have shown that material prices increased despite an
					increase in one-off costs, however, due to low maintenance costs, total life cost
					was still better than the steel reinforced concrete structure. AO Shi Kanshi, connecting
					Hong Kong and deep Hong Kong section of the Shenzhen Western Corridor in Western
					bridge, use about 1250t stainless steel type 316 and type 2205 bars as the lower
					part of the bridge's Pier Outer layer of reinforcement, Stonecutters Bridge in Hong
					Kong using type 304 stainless steel wire as the lower part of the tower's outer steel
					to ensure bridge 120 years of service life. In mainland China there is no use of
					stainless steel reinforced concrete in bridge records. 

					2. Ease of Construction 

					Ultimately to be achieved through the construction of bridge design, construction
					quality depends to a large extent on the ease of construction, must fully take into
					account the difficulty of construction of complex components to ensure reliable operation.
					

					Construction technology of inclined cable fully reflects the ease of application
					development requirements. Early parallel wires of cable-stayed bridges in applying
					on-site production, wire wears into the PE sleeve anchor head is installed, completion
					of cable tensioning sleeve grouting cement slurry. Because on-site production, pouring
					cement in hard dense near the anchor head, causing cable durability is greatly reduced.
					Some of our cable-stayed operating for 10 years or so, only had to replace the bridge
					cables. In order to solve the problem of construction of cable-stayed, Japan engineers
					invented the hot extrusion PE sleeve, semi-parallel wire cables. On the factory floor
					by hot-extruding PE sleeve wrap in wire, so quality of wire corrosion greatly improved.
					In order to facilitate transport from factory to construction site of cable, parallel
					wire twisted 7°, make cables in elastic modulus case of not more than the amount,
					you can pan in the roller. This cable has become mainstream. After further increases
					as bridge of long-span, inclined cable diameter and weight increased significantly,
					even if it is difficult to transport in the roller. In order to solve this problem,
					France freyssinet company has invented a single-unit parallel tensioning steel strand
					cables. PE sleeve is first installed in the cable position and comes with PE wrapping
					the steel strands one-by-one, into the scene PE sleeve and pull and then filling
					in the sleeve preservative, antiseptic liquid can be replaced during operation. This
					not only solves the problem of transport and long cable tension, and improved anti-corrosive
					measures, than the early filling water mud corrosion reliability is greatly increased.
					Fig. 7.46 for the construction of Qingzhou Minjiang bridge in the cable. 

					Forming technology of post-tensioned, pre-stressed pipe to improve ease of application
					examples. Pullout difficult extubation process, and pipe friction losses, and thus,
					invented the process of formation of metal corrugated pipe, pre-stressing pipeline
					construction difficulty is greatly reduced. Easily leakage of metal corrugated pipe
					plugging, to reduce the reliability of pre-stressed and piping grout is not easy
					compacting. In order to solve these problems, plastic corrugated pipe was invented.
					Plastic corrugated pipe heat welding long pipe except at the ends, completely sealed
					and this will be greatly reduce the problem of pipeline leakage, but also makes it
					possible to vacuum mud. 

					3. Ease of Inspection 

					Bridge component is not yet quantified the relationship between influencing factors
					and durability, so used to periodically check necessary measures to ensure durable
					security. Durability is the main controlling factor for the bridge components, such
					as steel components, cable anchor head, base, telescopic devices, must be checked
					frequently, so that should be considered when designing the future convenience of
					checks, reserved check condition. 

					For steel girder bridge, in order to facilitate corrosion inspection and using stage
					additional coatings, conditions should be set up in the breast can be moved check
					the platform. 

Figure 7.47 is the Hong Kong Ting Kau Bridge cable connection to the steel-concrete
					composite girder structure. Cable through the ear plate of steel and steel beam connections
					anchor layout above deck, exposed to make inspection engineers can directly see the
					anchor, but also easy to check operation.

					Early concrete cable-stayed bridge cable, tie-bar arch bridge suspender using prestressed
					anchor head first method of protection, anchor embedded in concrete. However, as
					some cable-stayed bridge and tie-bar arch bridge suspender rust accident happened,
					cables and cranes rod corrosion check of a great importance. Operation found buried
					in concrete in the anchor head is difficult to check, thus, the designed cables or
					lifting anchor head is exposed and protection sleeve design, protective cover removable
					for easy checking.

					bridge with steel hinge, for ease of maintenance, support week edge design are taken
					into account in the operating room.

					4. Replacement Measures 

					Expected component needs to be replaced during use must be set aside for replacement
					measures, apart from the detachable component itself, but also to reserve replacement
					operation of points and space. 

					Cables and Suspender cable supported bridges due to fatigue and corrosion problems,
					you must in the use of a certain number of years after the replacement, so in addition
					to cable replacement must be considered in the design of bringing mechanical problems,
					would also like to reserve some operational measures. Fig. 7.49 is Runyang bridge
					hang Sola Panel, set on plate for use temporary suspender suspenders bolt holes.

					Rubber bearing for bridge life-cycle components must be replaced, (JTG D62-2004 of
					reinforced concrete and pre-stressed concrete bridge design regulations D62-2004)
					9.6.6 requires that, when using rubber bearings, and pier between the breast and
					bearing replacement should be reserved to the desired position and space. This requirements
					are generally achieved by setting a certain altitude bearing pads stone. Rubber bearing
					thickness is generally only a few centimeters to more than 10 cm2, pier capping beam
					top surface usually sets the support cushion stone to spread the concentrated force
					of the support and levelling supports to the base. Early design bridge beam pads
					stone height 10~15 cm only, only clearance between the top of piers and abutments
					and breast 10~20 cm, unable to place jacks, with other temporary support to point
					beam replacement bearings must be jacked up. In order to facilitate future replacement
					bearings should be top of coping and bottom surface of the beam reservation placed
					between beams held up the Jack of the space, which can be easily realised through
					the raised seat cushion stone height, usually beams gap bottom top of the coping
					above 50 cm. 

					7.3 INNOVATIVE CONSTRUCTION METHOD AND CORRESPONDING EQUIPMENT 

					Modern bridge construction technology of progress but the advances in design theory
					and engineering materials, but also relies heavily on construction technology progress.
					Best bridge designs should make full use of the existing state of the art construction
					techniques, as well as the progress of construction technology in turn can also promote
					technological progress of bridge design, bridge engineers to come up with a brilliant
					plan. The progress in bridge construction technology on the main steps in the construction
					equipment, it is difficult to imagine relying on manual operations can build a modern
					bridge. Therefore, as a bridge designer, you should understand the most advanced
					construction methods and the appropriate equipment. 

					7.3.1 Driving Force Behind Method of Innovation 

					Innovation method of invention is always to achieve certain ends, when innovation
					brings significant benefits are other engineering mode limitation, thus forming various
					type of mature technology. In the area of today's bridge-building, technique innovation
					is as follows power. 

					1. Adaptation and Building Bridges Span More 

					Build a bridge of long-span bridge builders is always striving for goals. When the
					span to a certain extent, previously formed mature technology will not be able to
					complete the task, therefore, the pursuit of a long-span bridge construction process
					is the biggest driving force of innovation. 

					2. Adapt to the Special Circumstances of Construction 

					Social development calling for greater room for development, as well as communication
					between people and people, towns and cities and towns also increased, need to bridge
					had previously encountered in the environment. Constantly in the new environment
					under the condition of bridges, is a bridge engineer challenging, and sometimes requires
					a completely different technology. For example, in the construction of the bridge
					in marine environment, and across the river bridge, there is no land as a base for
					building a bridge, and need to use ships as the main tool. In cities, for example
					the construction of viaduct, does not affect the existing traffic within the city,
					you must operate in the narrow space, a lot of process cannot be adapted under normal
					conditions. 

					3. Improve Construction Speed, Reduce Human Resource Costs 

					With the improvement of transportation requirements, in order to improve the prevailing
					conditions, bridge road, the proportion is considerably improved, this required built
					super long bridge, and even all the road construction on the bridge. Such as high-speed
					rail, in order to reduce the damage of foundation subsidence in soft basic foundation
					area to replace the bridge embankment, this requires the construction of dozens of
					even hundreds of kilometers of bridges. In super-long bridges construction, structure
					is not complicated, but to bridge construction to be completed within a certain duration
					becomes the key of course, in accordance with traditional methods of construction
					can take full flowering, doing so while it is possible to achieve that goal, but
					will result in human and equipment costs increase significantly. Therefore, through
					process improvements to achieve increased speed of construction has become an inevitable
					requirement. 

					4. Improve the Reliability of Construction Quality 

					Improving construction quality is another goal of bridge builders, which is bridge
					construction method for improved direct power. Good construction method is simple
					and reliable, quality can be guaranteed. Imagine in very difficult conditions in
					construction, or in process of non-often complex situations, it is very difficult
					to guarantee the quality. 

					Innovative bridge construction mainly in two aspects: one is to improve the construction
					of bridge in the structure, arrangement; the second is development of specialised
					equipment, mechanised, large-scale, automated, intelligent development trends of
					bridge construction is equipment. 

					7.3.2 New Technology of Bridge Erection Adapted to Special Requirements 

					Bridge erection environment is the main factor affecting the bridge erection technology
					of, which set up process is sometimes a bridge-building success the key to this section
					presents specific examples to illustrate the influence of bridge construction method
					of the bridge program. 

					1. Ideas for Special Bridge Erection the Erection Process 

					Is a kind of self-anchored cable-stayed bridge cable-supported bridge, the advantage
					of stiffness of cable, cable-amount of horizontal force to the primary beam outside
					pre-stressed and combined with the cantilever construction technique, so modern cable-stayed
					bridge in more than 50 years become of long-span bridges strong competitive bridge,
					currently the world's largest long-span cable-stayed bridge span exceeds 1000 m,
					Master of bridge design Denmark's Professor Niels J. Gimsing's idea of 5000 m long
					span cable-stayed bridge. However, increasing self-anchorage cable in bridge span
					but had a negative factor. With the increase of long-span girder under the horizontal
					force is increased, eventually beam compression capability and image stabilisation
					qualitative further increased span constraint. In order to overcome this disadvantage,
					Gimsing, Professor idea 5000 m for long-span cable-stayed bridge on the Bill partially
					anchored cable-stayed bridge, as shown in Fig. 7.50. 

					Using some anchor side main beam level pressure can be reduced, but not decreased
					across the tower at the root of the main beam level pressure, need to span sections
					in setting horizontal cables welded connection pressure distribution from the roots
					cross-section to the cross-section. At bridge completion phase this is a good idea,
					but the traditional cantilever construction technology of large-span cable-stayed
					bridges are used, yet before the closure of main girders, to pass all the dead load
					of the horizontal force to the main section near Liang Tagen. This makes cross-level
					recovery is not installed front, beam is broken. In order to solve this problem,
					Gimsing in conceiving and devising this programme, a professor at the same time,
					proposed in the span middle and around the pylon-girder construction method for installation
					at the same time, across horizontal cables can be installed at the same time, as
					shown in Fig. 7.51. You can see from this example, bridge in bridge design and construction
					technology of relationships. 



Fig. 7.50 Partially anchored cable-stayed bridge with intermediate horizontal cables.
						



Fig. 7.51 Process idea to first erect span in the middle. 

					2. Ideas for Special Bridge Erection the Erection Process 

					Bridge construction environment on the erection of the bridge there is a restriction,
					and optional erection process restricted bridge program ideas. This section describes
					several of the ingenious design to adapt to environmental conditions of building
					the bridge and the construction method. 

					Across eastern Canada Northhumberland Strait Confederation Bridge Jian Qiao, is located
					in a natural environment, the biggest obstacle has a long winter, sea ice most of
					the time in a year, and cross-channel bridge a total length of 12.9 km. How to hold
					effective construction within a year, built the bridge within the limited annual,
					becomes the key to bridge construction. Bridge scheme uses multiple-span beam bridge,
					divided into three sections. West approach for 14 holes standard long-span continuous
					beam of 93 m bridge, cross-channel part 43-hole standard 250 m with hanging hole
					rigid-frame bridge with long span, East approach span to 7 hole standard long-span
					continuous beam bridge of 93 m. Full-bridge uses fully assembled construction technology,
					approach as on land and in shallow water, and limited capacity of lifting equipment,
					the use of bridge girder erection machine segmental construction, while 43-hole-by-holes
					and assembling construction of cross-sea bridge, the large floating crane "Swan,"
					used in the construction of hoisting the most large lifting quality 7500t. 

					Construction of the bridge is the main feature of the bridge pier foundation, including
					all components are used, including the assembly of pre-fabricated construction technology,
					components pre-fabricated in the factory, the west shore of the prefabricated, pre-cast
					steam curing, insure uninterrupted during the cold winter. In order to make the base
					and piers using the installation process, designed using underwater foundation programme,
					is also the basis of pre-fabricated expanded by floating crane floating transported
					to the bridge, placed directly on the sea-bed. In order to expand the foundation
					level, expanding the bottom surface of the base is set three blocks. Figure 7.52
					is disecting views of bridges pre-cast components. Expansion base was mainly used
					in the construction of land bridges, and the bridge because the environment element
					assembling process must be used, so the geological conditions of spread foundation
					under the water, is a bold idea. In order to piers pre-cast completely, the pier
					and the base is divided into two sections of pre-fabricated, using tooth-shaped tenon
					joints, avoiding the wet joint assembly, simplifies the assembly process. While the
					main beam is divided into only two cantilevers and weigh upto 7,500t 1,200t of hanging
					two large paragraphs complete set equipment, greatly simplifies the assembly process.
					Of course that are inseparable from the large lifting equipment.

						of lifting pieces divided; (c) hoisting the east approach spans of segmented. 



Fig. 7.53 Rion-antirion Bridge (size: m) (a) river section (b) pylon structure (c)
						infrastructure. 

					Foregoing Greece for 4 towers connected across Rion-Antirion bridge cable-stayed
					bridge, bridge is located in water depths of 65 m. In such deep water bridge base
					is a technical challenge. Commonly used scheme for large-scale deep water bridge
					foundation or the open caisson foundation of pile, but construction works of the
					foundation in such a deep sea water is very difficult. Therefore, the foundation
					uses the innovative design of this bridge and under the sea construction of large
					foundation. Undersea site is soft foundation of bridge site, in order to enhance
					bearing capacity and to broaden the base of foundation intensive short break into
					piles, each base consists of 250, (25~30 m long) steel pipe piles, within 7~8 m,
					as shown in Fig. 7.53. 

					Such a large expansion is located to the bottom of the process is a bold and innovative
					ideas. Used floating under water sinking craft. 90 m diameter, expansion chassis
					is designed to be separated into many compartments sealed hollow box, box at the
					coast stratified placement within the excavation dry dock, dry dock can be poured
					two base chassis. When you finish pouring the pier at the bottom of section, bring
					water in the dry dock, the chassis can emerge, dragged into the sea. Dry dock once
					again closed after pouring two pier foundations chassis. Continue pouring the piers
					on floating on the sea bottom, high piers at the same time, the chassis underneath
					due to the weight of the piers over the sea floor. When high piers reach to a certain
					height, floating in the waters of spread foundation and was towed to pier—the pier
					continued to pour concrete. When the pier to board after a pier height, infusion
					in the chassis and the basis of hollow pier, sea piers to the effect of gravity located
					under pile reinforced seabed. At this point, the foundations and piers built entirely,
					you can continue up bridge tower in construction. Fig. 7.54 shows in dry dock in
					the pouring of the foundation and completion of prefabricated base being dragged
					out of dry dock.

					As China's economic development and technological progress to build the bridge, construction
					of bridge over the sea requirement has become reality. In our country in recent years
					building Donghai bridge, Hangzhou Bay Cross-Sea Bridge, the island project in Zhoushan
					Jintang bridge, Qingdao haiwan bridge and a number of cross-Sea Bridge. These bridges
					across dozens of kilometers of distance on the sea, no land construction, erection
					method of bridge beam design of the most important factors to be considered. These
					cross-sea bridges across the shallow water or mud flat, little depth, in addition
					to the navigation needs set outside the large-span bridge, the remaining bridge were
					determined by the economy and duration, economy and duration depends mainly on the
					erection process and equipment capacity. 

					East China Sea Bridge was built-in China's first cross-Sea Bridge a total length
					of 32.5 km. Full bridge in addition to the two main navigation span stayed-cable
					three auxiliary navigation opening bridge, using cantilever construction continuous
					girder bridge with variable cross-section, but rest all used the height of continuous
					beam bridge of bridge spans. Deep sea Part is a 70 m long-span continuous beam using
					monolithic construction technology of hoisting, simple support into continuous erection.
					Shallow Ford parts is a 50 m long-span continuous beam using movable frame hole-by-hole
					in situ process set up. 

					Hangzhou Bay Bridge is the world's longest sea-crossing bridge, full length 36 km,
					the two main navigation span cable-stayed bridge, North Channel size 448 m, navigable
					span South 318 m, and the remaining 30~80 m span continuous girder of bridge spans.
					Deep part with 70 m span sea part is a 70 m long-span continuous beam using monolithic
					construction technology of hoisting, simple support into continuous erection. Shallow
					sections dominated by 50 m long-span continuous beam using shift formwork lifting
					hole-by-hole (beam girder) in process and beaches part dominated by 30 m long-span
					continuous beam. 

					Island project in Zhoushan Jintang bridge is 26.54 km, 620 m steel girder cable-stayed
					bridge of main navigation span for span east navigable Kong Wei 216 m span prestressed
					continuous rigid-frame and navigation span 156 m span continuous girders in the west,
					the majority of non-navigable spans of 60~70 m continuous beam, using full span pre-cast
					hoisting erection process. 

					In order to guarantee period, several bridges are used in this installation process.
					Because the water is not very deep, use of driven pile foundation. Had intended to
					use pre-cast pre-stressed concrete pipe piles for Donghai bridge Fig. 7.55(a), but
					after some time it was found that prestressed concrete pipe pile head could be easily
					crushed, thereafter only steel pipe piles were used. Two other bridge was used to
					break into steel tube pile bases Fig. 7.55(c). Steel bottom sealing concrete of pile
					construction technology, is only one on-site placement of full-bridge construction
					pieces. Piers precast hoisting technology of watering down the seam and pile connection
					Figs. 7.55(b), (d). Superstructure of continuous beam effects lifting or moving die
					carrier cast uses technology, to accommodate construction of water over long distances.
					The deep water area, you can use large floating cranes, floating cranes of lifting
					capacity of 2,500 t, therefore, constructed using the 60~70 m long-span continuous
					beam, 70 m lifting the quality of whole hole 2180t Figs. 7.55(e), (f). Inaccessible
					to large ships in shallow water, we must use the already built piers erection of
					main girder. Uses 50 m long-span continuous girder of Hangzhou Bay Bridge, box girders
					with large girder transport vehicle has been set up on the deck of transported to
					the bridge using erector erection Figs. 7.55(g), (h). 50 m continuous girders of
					Donghai bridge using the moving die carrier cast new construction technology. Due
					to the number of number of main girders, piers, during the process of pre-fabricated
					steel banding used pre-fabricated in the workshop, whole casting process, makes efficient
					use of templates is greatly increased.

					Massive construction of railway passenger dedicated line, design speed of 200~350
					km/h, rail ride quality is very high, when completed should consider not only the
					situation, while also taking into account the long-term deformation results. Therefore,
					requires a long-term commitment and total not more than 30 mm of deflection, and
					the 20 m range of uneven settlement not exceeding 20 mm. Such a high demand for soft
					soil foundation and roadbed filling height exceeds the 5 m section is unable to achieve,
					so these sections needed to bridge road design, which increase the proportion of
					railway bridges in passenger dedicated lines in length, average total route length
					of bridge 36%. Using bridge instead of road bridge generally do not require long
					span, span size depends on the cost of the superstructure and substructure cost balance,
					also depend on the time, equipment, capacity, and other factors. Track extensive
					use of bridge construction period will become the main controlling factor for the
					construction of passenger, fast bridge becomes a problem that must be solved. Increasing
					the speed of bridge erection methods there are several. One is framing a comprehensive
					workers, this approach requires a lot of support, templates, and human, and cannot
					turnover. II is the use of large precast technology this requires fast and efficient
					precast plant, as well as large girder erecting equipment. In order to solve this
					problem, in railway-related research and after a long exploration in engineering
					units, develop criteria for passenger bridges in China were—32 m, 24 m, 20 m, span
					post-tensioning method pre-stressed concrete simply supported box beam Fig. 7.56.
					Three kinds of standard double-track box beam with long span 899t, 699t, 562t, respectively,
					using the whole construction technology of pre-cast hoisting, transport, in order
					to achieve the goal of rapid construction. Primarily in pre-cast box beams pre-fabricated
					in the factory, through the beam girder approach transport to beam, then through
					the erection of bridge girder erection machine. Set of process of pre-fabricated,
					transport, installation and operation process as well as the equipment required.

					Viaduct is a form of using bridge instead of road bridge, also built on the land
					bridge, but in most cases were of short and medium span bridges. Viaduct on the original
					road-building, bridges while maintaining traffic flow on existing roads, construction
					site became one of the important factors controlling the bridge construction. Pre-fabricated
					lifting is one way to solve space problems, on structure in pre-fabricated in the
					factory on the outskirts of the city, transport to the night-time traffic in smaller
					times of bridge crane loading. Large viaducts have greater width and weight, full
					span transport is impossible within the urban area. Early trestle used longitudinally
					parting methods, such as hollow slabs or t-beams, a piece on a girder bridge by lateral
					ties after, if the Shanghai inner ring viaduct is basically take the form of hollow
					plate and t-shaped beam. Practice: using fabricated hollow panels, weak bridge horizontal
					linkages, prone to bridge longitudinal crack, instead of t-beams, easy lateral during
					transport. Box-girder of the landscape as a whole is good, but the city will not
					be the whole set up. One approach is the use of full space supports in situ, doing
					covers, time consuming and inefficient. Another approach is to use a horizontal parting
					of the ways pre-cast segmental. Segmental assembly mounted on large movable scaffold,
					pre-cast segmental transportation to the site temporarily supported on brackets,
					all sections install in place, with tendons into the whole. As shown in Fig. 7.57(a),
					(b), (c). In order to ensure the reliable segment connections, segmental sets can
					occlude each other tooth and section after section of the front end with back-end
					of the previous segment as a template and even pre-fabricated continued, as in Fig.
					7.57(d) shown below. 

					Construction technology of large-span cable-stayed cantilever, while its system is
					also particularly suitable for cantilever construction, it is a cable-stayed bridge
					to get an important factor in promoting. In certain cases, however, erection of other
					methods, such as pushing makes it well adapted to land condition. 

					Completed in 2004, France Millau Viaduct, needs across the Tarn River Valley, connecting
					both sides of the highlands, in the valley, for soft soil foundation, basis in order
					to reduce the workload, select 8-span cable-stayed bridge scheme, span into 204 m
					+ 6 × 342 m + 204 m, due to the high bridge pier using taliang DUN consolidation
					system, as shown in Fig. 7.58. This bridge with a large span across the Valley, high,
					very high and pier (2 pier of 245 m, 3 high pier of bridge deck pavement of bridge
					deck of high 230 m), cantilever erection difficulties, you need to set the lifting
					so much so, boldly using push-installation technology of main beam, girder in place
					before you install pylons and cables. The main beam, for adapting to the incremental
					launching construction, used single-cable-plane with small base width (only 4 m)
					inverted trapezoidal cross section, and bridge deck width of 32.05 m (Including wind
					up), at the intersection of bottom and inclined plate set longitudinal clapboard
					to support push reaction forces in the process, as shown in Fig. 7.59. 



Fig. 7.58 Facade of the Millau Viaduct set (size: m). 

					Pushing from both ends of the bridge, between the 2nd and 3rd pier closure. In order
					to reduce the girder moments in the process of thrusting the two measures: first,
					in addition to 2, outside the closure between the 3rd pier-span, each set up a temporary
					pier; the second is close to push the top forward side pylons installed, follow the
					main beam push, tension on each tower 6 to cable, as shown in Fig. 7.60(a). Of course
					in front of thrusting beams also usually set the steel truss girders. In order to
					reduce friction in the process of thrusting on the pier horizontal force a pier while
					the thrust of the synchronised launching technology, with the exception of side span
					outside the temporary pier installed a push on Jack, all the remaining bridge DUN
					is installed on two jacks, all jacks through the computer control system of control
					to ensure the synchronisation job. In addition to the first segment more complex,
					took 3 days to push things, remaining on average 5 days pushing a span (171 m). 



Fig. 7.59 Cross-sectional arrangement of the Millau Viaduct (size: m). 

					Deck above the bridge tower of steel box-section, high 88.92 m, 800 t, by flatbed
					truck from pushing the main beam delivery to each a pier location, the ultimate bearing
					capacity of the girder was a real test. Tower is straight through a temporary tower
					bar lifting towers on bifurcation, bifurcation point is raised later when, under
					the action of gravity and natural vertical towers, (see Fig. 7.60(b). 



Fig. 7.60 Construction of the Millau Viaduct (a) Pushing the Millau Viaduct girder

					Can be seen from the examples described above, in order to adapt to different environments
					to build the bridge, flexible mounting method must be used, not what approach to
					what type of bridge is mechanically. In exceptional cases, possible mounting methods,
					in turn also affect bridges set design scheme. Therefore, good bridge engineers must
					master the technical principles in different contexts in order to work out alone
					and practical design and construction program. 

					7.3.3 Equipment of New Bridge Erection Technology 

					Manual handling ability is limited, but cannot guarantee the quality, so large, complex,
					high quality of bridge construction rely advanced construction equipment. Construction
					equipment usage has following purposes: the first is carrying large objects into
					the air, which would require large lifting capacity, long-distance lifting cranes;
					second, increasing operational efficiency, the use of mechanical equipment can greatly
					improve labour efficiency, and impossibly long intense labour of the workforce; the
					third is improving accuracy, manual operation is affected by skills, attitudes, and
					the use of automated equipment operation ensures that each time the error levels
					remain stable; and, finally, use equipment to detect structural parameters that cannot
					be directly observed by humans, lots of testing equipment help engineers to check
					the quality of construction. 

					1. Large-scale Bridge Construction Equipment 

					The most direct goal of using machinery and equipment is maximisation, as human carrying
					capacity is very limited, it's hard to imagine a modern bridge construction relies
					on manual handling of large structures on the site. Large power equipment is used,
					not only help workers lifting large structures, sometimes even changing the mode
					of construction, affect the design. Heavy lifting, pile driving, transport equipment
					are representatives of this type of equipment. 

					Construction of sea bridge as described earlier in this chapter, while also achieving
					rapid construction without land support using large load distribution construction
					technology becomes the most ideal construction methods. Large segments would require
					large lifting equipment, lifting capacity, lift height are critical to these devices.
					



Fig. 7.61 Confederation bridge main part parameters (size: m). 

					Canada Confederation Bridge used complete assembling technology from base to the
					upper structure, the largest component is 250 m span t-type rigid frame cantilever
					section, 192 m in length, weighs 7,500t. Figure 7.61 is the bridge's 250 m rigid
					span erection part parameters. 

					The erection of the bridge using a unique lifting ship "Swan" (SVANEN), as shown
					in Fig. 7.62. "Swan" was specially built-in 1990, for the erection of Denmark West
					Sea Bridge set of lifting, transportation bridges of large own floating crane can
					lift caissons, piers, main beam and various artifacts. At first, design of lifting
					capacity of 6500t, lifting height 48.5 m. Between 1994~1995, it was reformed for
					hoisting Canada Confederation bridge, the maximum lifting capacity reached 8700t
					(including enclosed hanging beams), maximum lifting height 76 m, as shown in Fig.
					7.63(a). In order to hoist pier, the hull was designed as catamaran, length is 102.8
					m, the full width of 71.8 m, ship shape deep 6 m, draft of 4.5 m, able to work under
					15 m/s conditions of high wind speeds, wave 1 m, as shown in Fig. 7.62. The biggest
					feature of the ship is to bring large bridge component without cooperation from other
					barges. 



Fig. 7.62 Ship "Swan" (SVANEN). 

					In 1997, the ship was hoisted out resund link between Denmark and Sweden, with the
					main span of the bridge being 490 m it is road-railroaddual purpose cable-stayed
					bridge with approach spans span 140 m, as shown in Fig. 7.63(b). Main bridge girders
					of approach spans are used ceiling the floor is concrete, webs of steel truss composite
					beam. As a result of the "Swan", the main bridge with long segmental, bridge hoisting
					the hole. 

					They built the sea-crossing bridge of Donghai bridge in China in 2002, also facing
					a large floating crane lifting requirements, when water transportation can be found
					on the market can be used in the construction of bridge crane, the largest lifting
					tonnage of 2,500t. It is the original ministry of transportation salvage and rescue
					Bureau of Shanghai's "strong" number, captain 100 m, 38 m, 9 m, 1981 years from Japan's
					Aichi shipyard was constructed by turning multipurpose crane, as shown in Fig. 7.64(a).
					If the leased foreign large-tonnage crane, daily rent is upto 10 Million. In accordance
					with the natural condition of bridge of Donghai Bridge based high cost, should be
					appropriate to increase the span of bridge hole to achieve a higher economic indicators.
					But considering the lifting capacity of 2,500t limit, the Sham Shui Po non-navigable
					spans of 70 m. One 70 m hole of box girder weighs about 2,000t, and lifting auxiliary
					spreader can be controlled in the range of 2,500t.

						in hoisting Bridge approach bridge. 

					During the course of construction of Donghai bridge, designed and built the "four
					airlines to forge ahead" and "little Swan", and two large floating crane, are dedicated
					to marine construction crane. 

					CCCC's "four sail endeavour" has jib crane, with lifting capacity of 2,600t, 100
					m in length, width 41 m, 7.6 m in depth, its most prominent feature is the lifting
					heights of upto 80 m, as shown in Fig. 7.64(b), box girder cable-stayed bridge at
					main navigation span of Donghai bridge "The four airlines to forge ahead" was lifting.
					The floating crane with "strong" number only has a lifting capability, must have
					a beam barges together. 

					Iron bridge Engineering Bureau for 70 m box girders of Donghai bridge erection construction
					of "little Swan" crane ship, using a "Swan" design ideas, you can beam lifted themselves
					after, don't need to beam barges together. Disadvantage of doing so is that the floating
					crane to transport contains the main beam navigation in bridge longer in length,
					floating crane used less efficiently. "Little Swan" lifting capacity of 2,500t, maximum
					lifting height 41 m, wide 7 m, as shown in Fig. 7.65 (a). In order to set up district
					70 m of box girder of Hangzhou Bay Bridge high pier, built iron bridge Engineering
					Bureau a "floating crane. "Day one", also is lifting one floating crane, lifting
					capacity of 3,000t, the maximum lifting height upto 53 m. On the bridge erection
					is complete it can also be converted into a jib crane for other hydraulic lifting
					operations. Due to "day one" construction, during the construction of the Shanghai
					Yangtze River tunnel and bridge, bridge using steel-concrete composite beam of long
					span 105 m, quality 2350t, saving foundation price, achieved better economic results,
					as shown in Fig. 7.65(b).

					Long span bridge was built on the water, in order to guarantee period, use of driven
					pile foundation. Built-in China in the East China Sea Bridge of Hangzhou Gulf bridge
					cross-Sea Bridge, due to the bridge's long, tight, in addition to several main navigation
					channel bridge piers using basically the basis of a bored pile into steel pipe foundation.
					Hangzhou Bay Bridge, a total of 1.5 m, 1.6 m diameter steel 5144 pipe piles, maximum
					depth of 88 m, such a large number of large steel pipe pile must have big effective
					pile driving equipment to complete. Piling on the water must be done with the pile
					driver, in order to build offshore long bridge and coastal Marina, China has built
					several of the world's most advanced driving boats in recent years. Common characteristics
					of these floating pile driver is: pile high, 90 m above, can sink into the 80 m the
					length of the pile diameter, the biggest pile diameter 2.0~3.0 m, flexible operation,
					could eat into raking piles and higher productivity, as a result of automatic hydraulic
					control device, every boat sinking 10~15. In the absence of measuring marks to determine
					where piling on the water, usually real-time GPS positioning system is equipped.
					Haili 801 turn pile frame, precision 60 mm, is currently one of the world's most
					advanced large pile driver. Table 7.2 is the largest parameters of the largest pole
					ship. Fig. 7.66 shows the two different types of floating pile driver.

					Massive bridge assembly construction on land again at a large bridging equipment,
					however, due to limitations of transportation road conditions, no big equipment may
					be used for maritime transport, so also has limited land mass assembled construction
					the span of the bridge. 

					China's massive construction of railway passenger dedicated line by lifting simply
					supported girder, formed a 32 m, 24 m, 20 m, standard beam forms. Weight is 32 m
					long-span double-line box girders, 900t beam girder approach on transport, saving
					construction pavement. This process, when required during the construction of 900
					t Erector, 900t beam carrier, 900t or 450t spar three essential for large equipment.
					



Fig. 7.66 Large pile driver (a) three air 15th; (b) Hai Li, No. 801. 

					Beam girder erection of hole-by-hole method is not a new technology, pre-fabricated
					bridges have also been used in the past. However, because the primary beam horizontal
					slice, the weight of each beam is relatively small, even if 50 m-span T-beams, lifting
					weight does not exceed 250t, therefore, bridge girder erection machine lifting capacity
					required is small. Meanwhile, pre-cast beam transport in the already-built bridge
					will not break through the bridge's load, no special treatment in deck paving of
					temporary rail, beam carrier formed by several temporary group of railway axles.
					But for the entire hole set girder weighs greatly increased, these 32 m long span
					box girder weighing 900 t. This lifting capacity requirements for bridge girder erection
					machine greatly improved, moreover, beam has been set up on the beam transport, its
					weight far beyond the future use of loads must use special transportation beam motor
					on beam spread over a wider area. Liang Ti from the pre-fabrication to beam transportation
					truck also need large removable hanger—The gantry. 

					Bridge building machine is a means to expand the already built piers and girders,
					a hole-by-hole bridge equipment. In order to be able to set up completed bridge across
					the span, generally long main beam of bridge erecting machine must be no more than
					two holes. The difference between setting up all full hole and erection of pre-cast
					beams is that in order for erection of girder bridge girder erecting machine through
					the bridge girder erection machine in the hind legs, the legs must be entirely outside
					the beam width, or retractable. Assembled width is much smaller than the width of
					the beam, it is easy to cross the bridge girder erection machine and made the design
					of bridge girder erecting machine very simple as that. In order to improve the efficiency
					of bridging, advanced bridge girder erecting machine using the hydraulic control
					system. Advanced embodiment of bridge girder erection machine in terms of its light
					weight and ease of operation.

					Italy's Nicola is the world's leader in the production of bridge girder erecting
					machine, after the digestion and absorption of recent years, our country has production
					and erection of monolithic erecting machine. According to the characteristics of
					China's construction of passenger dedicated lines, these erector is also supported
					to varying degrees improvement, make the operation more convenient. For example,
					using beam transportation truck TRANS-bridge-tunnel machine, Erector, erector bi-directional
					bridging technology are manufacturer improvements and inventions in China. Current
					monolithic erecting machine comes in three forms, namely without Liang Shi, Liang
					Shi, and integrated transportation and erection. Fig. 7.67 are no guiding-beam bridge
					girder erecting machine DF900, guiding-beam bridge girder erecting machine DF900D
					and Italy nicola-transporting-erecting-in-one bridge machine structure diagram, they
					are all used in the Chinese passenger dedicated lines. 

					Beam carrier's main functions are: delivery of prefabricated box girder by bridge
					girder erecting machine and is responsible for feeding of pre-fabricated box girder
					erecting machine, within the transitions can be checked when erecting machine long
					distances. Because of openings since major, currently most advanced beam transportation
					truck with rubber-tyred, in order to increase and beam transportation road contact
					area increases. In addition, wheel type beam carrier operations greater freedom,
					without the preset orbit, as shown in Fig. 7.68.

						bridge in orbit transfers and (b) Wheeled girder of Hangzhou Bay Bridge. 

					Full span pre-cast and hoisting construction of porous Longbridge is the duration
					of the programme is born out of control factors of condition of building the bridge,
					although the full time limit, but the demand for heavy equipment. In the construction
					of Chinese passenger dedicated line, through comparative analysis are as follows
					inspection, construction of a main beam pre-casting yard complete with girder, bridge
					equipment, one-way bridge length of 10 km of the economy. Super pre-fabricated plant
					can be built in the middle of line, after finishing erecting a bridge girder the
					erection machine transport back to the beam direction to start the opposite direction.
					The economic length of double Erection is 20 km. 

					2. Automated in situ Bridge-construction Equipment 

					Erection of monolithic process mentioned above, fast speed, high efficiency, suitable
					for construction of super long bridge, but requires large transportation equipment
					and pre-fabricated, assembled or concrete on the bridge directly is the way to solve
					this problem. Previous in situ bridge assembling or concrete casting used scaffolds
					and templates in general, to improve transport efficiency of bracket, mobile scaffold
					and shuttering were invented and used. MSS is a template or scaffold or bracket combined
					with mobile devices, done using a template and bracket in one cross, afterward it
					does not require complete disintegration, instead using mobile device it is transferred
					to another cross and can be assembled instantly, thereby improving efficiency. Mobile
					support only needs to provide segmental beams assembled with stand, movable frame
					in addition to removable brackets also want with a group put together by the template.
					Mobile scaffold and shuttering of advantage is that a good chunk of the automatic
					control of hydraulic equipment, so that bracket, template, moving to group together
					shorten the process, while ensuring the quality of the template. 

					Main components of the mobile frame or formwork is coasted between the piers of the
					main beam, according to the support pouring or assembling bridge mode is divided
					into the upper deck and lower deck. The girders of upper deck type mobile bracket
					moves along the cross bridge fixed to piers, the concrete girder to be erected is
					placed on top surface of supporting beam, as shown in Fig. 7.69. Through-type mobile
					bracket girder moves along the completed concrete beam, on the bridge to be poured
					(assembled) , and through the legs on top of the pier, as shown in Fig. 7.70. Deck
					bearing stents benefits are that beam to be poured (assembled) is on the top of mobile
					frame, with large hands-on space; on the contrary, benefits of through good mobile
					stand is that stent placement (assembled) is on top of beam, not restricted by the
					clearance under the bridge, bridge operations are affected by the interference of
					mobile frame. 



Fig. 7.69 Working diagram of deck-bearing type movable frame. 

					Using mobile formwork on-site pouring good beams, and girders framing finished pouring
					quality is basically the same, but due to require binding reinforcement on the mold
					and cured concrete, long duration, for construction of a cellular beam normally takes
					12~15 days, so efficiency is quite low. Girders assembled using mobile frame segmental
					generally requires dry joints, stretching and external pre-stressed girder to join
					together, the wholeness of the completed beam is not as good as beams using casting
					placement. Therefore, choice of dedicated-passenger railway in China complete set
					mounted or movable frame construction technology of on-site pouring. Bridge using
					technology of segmental has higher efficiency than using the shuttering method, Shanghai-Shanghai
					Min Lu viaduct, using a movable frame construction technology of segmental, after
					the craft skill, every three days can be installed in a hole 30 m long span box the
					end of circular beam, as shown in Fig. 7.71. 

					Movable frame bridge construction cannot only for straight line construction through
					eccentric wedge change paragraph or section by section of the template can also be
					construction of curve bridge, Norway produced by NRS shuttering minimum radius 75
					m construction of the viaduct. 



Fig. 7.70 Working diagram of Through-type movable form frame (units: m). 

					The former Transportation Ministry first highway construction company build the 4th
					bridge in Mosul, Iraq, with the Federal Republic of Germany PZ company-developed
					Switzerland-provided movable form frame. Using this device, in 1990, built the first
					bridge in China movable frame construction of pre-stressed concrete continuous beam
					bridge—gaoji Strait Bridge in Xiamen. Gaoji Strait Bridge full length is 2070 m,
					made up of multi-span continuous girder of long span of 45 m. Since then, construction
					equipment manufacturers have done a lot of research and development in China, China
					had to create all kinds of mobile scaffold and shuttering, but relies on imports
					of key high-precision hydraulic equipment. 

					These MSS are erecting beam bearing units, thus, creating span movable frame girder
					of bridge bearing capacity restrictions now, shuttering to construction of main girder
					of the largest span is 60 m over this span, movable frame girder sections greatly
					increased. Multiple-span beam with large span bridge can take advantage of mobile
					scaffold to assemble, but must be combined with other bridge construction technology
					the role of Mobile supports is only to transport segment so to reduce the mobile
					frame weight. Fig. 7.72 is China's Zhongtie major research of large-span mobile 96
					m long-span continuous beam bridge adopts cantilever segmental construction technique,
					remove boot supports transport of box girder sections.

					3. High-quality Concrete Formwork 

					Concrete templates are basic civil engineering construction equipment, determining
					the appearance and quality of components and templates-intensive, in engineering
					cost account for a large proportion. Previously (before in the 1970, of the 20th
					century) the most often used was a natural wood-mode, with los repetitive use (no
					more than 5 times), and high resource consumption, abroad have long used alternative
					materials to build templates. Currently widely used are glued wood template, glue
					bamboo, steel, composite templates, engineering plastic application templates are
					at exploring stage. 



Fig. 7.72 China's zhongtie major research of large-span mobile (unit : m). 

					Steel high strength, good rigidity and flatness, widely used in engineering. But
					the high cost of steel formwork, not easy to change re-used, so in need of mass production
					of pre-cast plant to use more. In order to overcome this shortcoming, assembled steel
					framework was invented, but the seams of assembled steel framework is difficult to
					handle and, therefore, relatively poor surface quality of concrete. 

					Glulam template is the currently used template, it has hardened layer on the surface,
					there is a certain air suction, and seams easy to deal with and therefore produced
					better surface quality of concrete structures. Both sides of Glulam templates can
					be used, and re-usedfor upto 30~50 times. In the 1980, of the 20th century the introduction
					of glued wood mold production technology, but the relatively poor quality of the
					domestic bond template, some re-use can reach no more than 10 times. Bamboo production
					is large in China, in the 1980, of the 20th century in China invented a glue bamboo
					template, properties and glulam is similar to or better than wood-mode, repeat number
					can be more than 30 times, and has been widely applied, can now be exported to foreign
					countries. 

					Template's surface physical properties directly affect the quality of production
					of concrete components, concrete is vibrated and condensation to release a certain
					amount of water and gas in the process, it will form bubbles and tiny grooves on
					the surface of the concrete, thus affecting the concrete the compactness of the surface,
					reducing the role of reinforced protection. In order to solve this problem, Japanese
					engineers invented in 1985, production a controlled permeability formwork (Controlled
					Permeability Formwork, known as CPF). The surfaces have permeability for water and
					airy, which can be in the newly poured concrete to drain excess free water and air,
					greatly improved performance. Since then, the Europe, Denmark, Germany and the United
					Kingdom have been produced using this template. Starting from Hangzhou Bay Cross-Sea
					Bridge in China, in order to high durability of the bridge piers, try using permeable
					formwork, good results have been achieved. 



Fig. 7.73 CPF work schematic diagram. 

					Permeable formwork is made in ordinary templates by pasting a layer of permeable
					formwork on cloth formed. Permeable formwork cloth generally consists of raw materials
					such as polypropylene special handling, varying periods of formation of filaments
					of polypropylene fibers, via., hot spinning processes and surface prepared from special
					secondary roller handle. Structure can be divided into upper, middle-tier, and centre.
					Surface and intermediate layers are formed by fine 17~115 dtex, 110~313 dtex fiber
					composition, its diameter is 1~10 μm and 4~15 μm; adhesive layer and pasted the template,
					consisting of fine fiber 212~414 dtex, the aperture is 10~30 μm, has water- and air-permeability
					and retains moisture. Due to the small surface pores of permeable formwork cloth,
					equivalent aperture D95 composite structure is much less than 30 μm, you can spilling
					water and cement and cementitious materials to be stranded in a flooded template
					inside of the concrete surface, makes the structure surface hardened into a dense
					layer of hydrated calcium silicate-rich layers, so you can to effectively reduce
					cellular concrete surface, pockmarked face. Also, this water formwork cloth with
					water retention, improves concrete curing quality. Fig. 7.73 is permeable formwork
					structure schematic drawing. Currently permeable formwork materials in China is still
					at an experimental stage of production, and imported products are still lags behind.
					

					Template is assembled at the construction site is more labour-intensive processes,
					templates in conjunction with stents increase the production efficiency effective
					method. Therefore, a variety of ingenious flexible formwork system is widely used,
					its fundamental component is a steel-frame glued wood mold. Japan and Europe and
					the United States is currently widespread use of these composite templates, instead
					of steel, template support system from the original group together into small blocks
					of hydraulic automatic contraction device. Fig. 7.74 is the overall external formwork
					of box girders of Hangzhou Bay Bridge and collapsible overall internal model.

					7.3.4 Detection Equipment for Bridge Erection 

					Early in the design and construction, to ward off a variety of uncontrollable factors,
					it required a higher safety factor. With the development of engineering technique,
					bridge design safety factor becomes more and more rational, so as to make the structure
					more lithe, more saving and longer span. Therefore, quality control of the construction
					process becomes the key to bridges built. Various parameters and accurate detection
					of bridges in terms of quality are the necessary means of control. Parameters that
					are commonly used in the construction of bridge location, shape, stress, and so on.
					Regarding these arguments, there were corresponding test equipment, but most of the
					hand-operated, low efficiency and poor operating conditions and low accuracy cannot
					be comprehensive, observation. Currently testing equipment for the construction of
					the bridge was largely digitized, allowing for remote detection. 

					1. Test Equipment for Location and Shape 

					The position and shape of bridge construction is the most basic control data, early
					main optical telescope measuring instruments, including water associate and theodolite.
					Measured data are subject to complex measuring and calculating, thus time consuming
					and error-prone. At present, these two compliance measurement tool has been included
					with microcomputer combination of calculation of total station instrument functions,
					automatic total stations can also automatically set goals greatly improves the efficiency
					and accuracy. 

					Application of laser technology in the measurement makes the component location and
					shape measurement accuracy greatly improved, and are commonly used in large bridges
					beam box beam pre-fabricated factory, bringing the precast segmental box girder to
					mm-level accuracy. 

					Wide-range application of Global Positioning System GPS position measurement, built
					a bridge over wide surface measurements of productivity and greatly improved. Using
					GPS, and horizontal position can reach millimeter precision, elevation can achieve
					centimeter-level accuracy. 

					2. Stress Testing Equipment 

					Direct indicators of internal force is the force structure, load can directly reflect
					the present state, especially for statically indeterminate structures. Early force
					measuring devices required sensors to be embedded in the component in general. For
					example, the cable tension to pressure-measuring sensor embedded in under the bolt
					head, counteracting force to pressure measurement sensors embedded in bearing down.
					In this way, high equipment costs, and cannot be replaced. In response to this situation,
					the random vibration test method of cable tension of cable-stayed and devices have
					been invented, as long as the measured fundamental frequency of vibration of cable-stayed
					access to cable tension, can be measured at any time. With the advent of steel wire
					cable, because there are gaps between the casing and steel strand, it is not easy
					to measure the whole length of cable's frequency and, therefore, magnetic flux, cable
					tension measuring devices have been invented. Through the force of cable-stayed solenoid
					effect of magnetic flux conversion cable, got rid of the vibration characteristics
					of difficult measurement obstacles. 

					3. Strain Gauge Testing Equipment 

					Strain is the local reaction of structure to force, its monitoring is a traditional
					measure. Early monitoring of stress used variable, but characteristics of the strain
					gauge readings with time drift is not conducive to long-term monitoring of the construction
					process. Therefore, VW sensor was invented, which uses embedded sensors in measuring
					of pipe vibration on steel base frequency to conversion of the strain sensor. Due
					to the lower steel relaxation rate, and generally keeping the apparent drift strain
					readings for more than a year. At present, the fiber bragg grating sensors are being
					explored. Fiber grating sensor using fiber bragg grating in the deformed by the spectral
					changes of principle, measuring estimated spectrum change of variables. Theory of
					fiber bragg grating strain sensor drift is small, and can be more than one sensor
					measurement series, so for large strain distribution measurement and monitoring of
					micro-cracks in concrete structure is very effective. Therefore, this very broad
					prospects for application of fiber bragg grating sensors. 

					7.4 APPLICATIONS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND HIGH-TECH 

					7.4.1 Application Requirements of New Materials and High-Tech 

					Advances in materials engineering and high-tech itself and various use requirements
					are closely related. Bridge builders continue to pursue larger spans, better durability,
					lower the cost of these promote the application of new materials and technologies
					in Engineering investigation. Application of new materials and new techniques in
					engineering, in turn, contributed to raising the level of bridge design and construction.
					

					Material is the basis for construction, modern advances in materials industry to
					fundamentally change the system of engineering structures and concepts. With the
					development of modern materials, there have been a lot better materials, but from
					a price/ performance perspective, there is best suited for steel and concrete bridges,
					to replace the two materials have a long research path. Civil engineering materials
					research is to improve the properties of steel and concrete. 

					With the development of science and technology, there have been a number of high
					technology, knowledge of new technologies, are defined as high-tech, this is one
					classes on the latest scientific research achievements applying transformation. High
					and new technology was quickly applied to all walks of life, have made great economic
					benefits. Application of information technology in building the bridge, the bridge
					construction has been developing by leaps and bounds. 

					7.4.2 High Performance Steel (HPS) 

					Steel is the result of modern smelting technology, is one of the most important influence
					on modern engineering structure materials. From the 1980s, high-performance steel
					products has been gradually popularised. High Performance Steel (HPS) application
					is from High-Strength Steel (HSS) began. With research and development of high performance
					steel, currently in structural steels material called high performance in the field
					usually contains the following aspects: high strength, weldability, weather resistance,
					shock-resistance, mutation profiles. 

					1. High Strength Steel 

					Using high strength steel from structural design point of view has distinct advantages,
					it can reduce the dimensions of the structural components, thus reducing low weight,
					increased span. High strength steel as early as after World War II were tried for
					bridge construction. 

					Japan in the 1950, of the 20th century will be the yield strength of the steel of
					500 MPa and 600 MPa for construction of the bridge, 60's the steel with yield strength
					of 800 MPa. Akashi Kaikyo Bridge on stiffening girder of 800 MPa steel is used, made
					to reduce weight of good results. 

					In Europe, the bridge with a yield strength of HSS usually between 460~690 MPa. After
					heat treatment of 16 mm S960QL steel, nominal yield strength up to 960 MPa. 

					United States began using HSS and weathering steel in bridge engineering (such as
					bridge, completed in 1977, the new river valley). prior to HPS research and development,
					there are 4 grades of steel for bridges: 250, 345 (345S, 345W), 485 (485W), 690(690W),
					numbers in code represents the minimum yield strength, the unit is MPa,W on behalf
					of the types of steel have weather-resistant properties. The most common bridge steel
					is 345W. 

					Steel bridges made of high strength low alloy structural steel, mainly 16 Mnq and
					Q345q series-steel, in special bridge supplied by agreement. On the Jiujiang Yangtze
					River Bridge, the 15MnVNq produced by angang steel on the Yangtze River Bridge in
					Wuhu, mining 14 MnNbq steel manufactured by the Wuhan iron and steel (thickness ≤
					16 mm yield strength ≥ 370 MPa); the Lupu bridge, Pu steel reference as Germany DIN
					EN standard S355N steel (thickness ≤ 16 mm yield strength ≥ 355 MPa). Promulgated
					in 2000 national standard of the structural steel for bridges (GB/T 714-2000), provides
					Q345q, Q370q, Q420q (containing three of C, D, E rating) series-steel (thickness
					≤ yield strength ≥ 345MPa, respectively 16 mm, 370 MPa, 420 MPa). 

					Early high strength steel, high strength, but poor solderability, need to be pre-heated
					welding, to bring quality and cost control difficulty, so applications are difficult.
					

					2. High Weldability Steels 

					In the 1990, with the development of smelting technology, while maintaining high
					strength requirements for structural steel, but also have ease of processing (mainly
					weldability), weather and so on, become a High Performance Steel (HPS). Improving
					the performance is through modifications rolling process of steel chemical composition
					and heat treatment method. Effect of heat treatment on Crystal structures of steel
					has great, Oh the United States and Japan has developed in the fine control of heat
					treatment technology in cold rolling process in Europe is called quenching and tempering
					(called Q&T) technology, in the United States and Japan called Thermally Controlled
					Processing (TMCP) technology to produce while maintaining high strength and easy
					welding of fine grain structural steels resistance and high toughness. 

					Respectively in the 1990, of the 20th century, America and Japan have developed high-performance
					structural steel standards, including on weld pre-heating temperature requirements
					a at 50°C the following, for example, United States HPS485W requirements of steel:
					thickness of weld pre-heat temperature at 60 mm only 20°C, 60 mm will be 50 degrees
					centigrade. Ordinary steel weld preheating temperature of 100~120 degrees centigrade.
					

					High solderability is also reflected in the different strength of steel can be welded,
					which makes structural engineers design concept completely changed. In the past it
					can be used with different strength levels in the structure of steel, but in different
					components, this is called a hybrid design (Mixed Design). If used in the main beam
					of a component, or a different type of steel, it is called a Hybrid Design (or translated
					as "confounding"). Hybrid design is characterised: according to the force structure
					configuration model (generally not more than two) of steel, in order to give full
					play to material properties, economical benefits. 

					Located in United States, Tennessee, Martin, R. (Martin Creek) bridge, opened in
					February 1998, to 2 × 71.78 m two-span continuous girder bridge, the roadway width
					of 8.53 m, horizontal layout 3 contiguous pieces of shaped beam, girder spacing 3.2
					m. Original design used 345W steel, after support from FHWA, using HPS 485W for bridge
					design. In re-design, intermediate HPS 485W was used in pivot near the beam, span
					beam using hybrid design, which all transverse webs and connect the 345W. Final result:
					girder steel consumption by 24.2%, costs reduced by 10.6%. Weight considerably reduced
					because the primary beam, apparently transport, erection and lower construction cost
					savings. 

					3. Corrosion Resistant Steel 

					With high atmospheric corrosion-resistant property (weathering), is one of the characteristic
					of HPS. Due to atmospheric corrosion resistance, omission or partial omission of
					painting of steel bridges can be significantly reduced maintenance costs in service
					period, achieving better overall economic benefit. In the United States, has 45%
					using weathering steel bridges. 

					Weathering steels contain certain amounts of copper in steel, chromium and nickel
					alloys, their solid steel surface oxide layer, preventing steel step continued to
					internal corrosion, play a role in weathering. Normal weathering steel only in the
					case of low salt content in the air, and early rust on the surface of weathering
					steel and sometimes affect the appearance of the structure. Japan is in most parts
					of the marine environment and the winter salt non-slip, high salt content in the
					air and, therefore, ineffective use of normal weathering steel, so less used in bridge
					construction. To solve this problem, Japan steel works has been developed in the
					coastal environment of atmospheric corrosion resistant steel and weathering steel
					is developed early corrosion resistant coating to prevent formation of oxide layer
					on the surface of weathering steel in the process of rust off. 

					4. Low Yield Point Steel (Earthquake-resistant Steel) 

					The general concept of seismic design of structures is by means of calculation and
					analysis of design and construction measures under the "strong column-weak beam",
					"weak strong shear bending", "strengthening connections weak members" principle,
					when the structure column and beam structure when subjected to seismic action in
					some parts of the plastic deformation and absorb seismic energy in order to achieve
					the required seismic performance of "minor earthquakes are not bad, repairable in
					the earthquake, earthquake fail" three levels of security requirements. 

					However, in the 1994, United States California's Northridge earthquake and the 1995,
					Japan's Kobe earthquake damage survey, found conventional principle design of welded
					steel frame beam-column connections of steel building near the region widespread
					destruction. Although this damage not cause steel-frame buildings to collapse, there
					is no personal injury due to damage of steel frame joints, but the owner and the
					insurance company for inspection and repair complex pay lots of fees. Therefore,
					as a new method for solving such problems, set in the building seismic control device
					(example the damper) "structural seismic control" studies began to be developed.
					Fig. 7.75(a) is expressed in conventional buildings under earthquake action beam
					ends of plastic hinge absorb seismic energy, while Fig. 7.75(b) is artificially set
					at specific areas consumption can absorb seismic energy, both on the principle of
					shared features, but it is a different design concept. 



Fig. 7.75 Comparison of energy absorbing plastic hinges and seismic control device
						(a) Beam plastic hinges to absorb seismic energy; (b) Energy dissipation devices
						absorb seismic energy. 

					After 10 years of research, Japan Nippon Steel company LYP100, LYP235 (yield strength
					of 100MPa and 235MPa) two low-yield-point steel, steels compared to conventional
					steel with lower yield strength and resistance to Rachyan, and yield-point margin
					of error smaller, has better extension and low cycle fatigue resistance properties.
					

					5. Vertical Steel Plates with Variable Thickness (LP) 

					Steel plate thickness along its length changing (Longitudinally Profiled Plate, referred
					to as LP steel) is hot when changing the thickness of the slab length. Webs and bottom
					plate of continuous box girder bridge across the different locations often need to
					change the thickness, if the thickness of steel plate, to achieve this purpose it
					is necessary to use different thickness sheet steel stitching, welding and material
					waste. Using variable thickness steel can reduce the number of welding structure
					and reduce the weight of the structure. In Japan all high performance structural
					steels can be rolled vertical thickness. Fig. 7.76 shows the schematic diagram of
					a LP plate production process and cost savings.

						(b) LP plate cost reduction. 

					6. Other Features of High Performance Steel 

					High performance steel in addition to these characteristics, according to a variety
					of structural features, you can also achieve some special performances, such as:
					Fire resistance, fatigue resistance, toughness at low temperature, special shapes,
					etc. In the 1990, of the 20th century, the high-performance steel products in the
					world wide range of attention, more and more applications will affect engineers design
					concepts. 

					In addition to applications in civil engineering, high-performance steel products
					in other areas where there are more and more applications, so all over the world
					have invested heavily in the research and development of high performance steel.
					

					In 1997, Japan invested 10 yen, started the "super steel" research project, the goal
					was developed over 10 years strength equivalent to twice times the super steel for
					iron and steel (including 800 MPa easily welded steel, fatigue and delayed fracture
					resistance and failure 1,500 MPa class ultra high strength steels, heat-resisting
					steel for ultra supercritical pressure power generating equipment and beach area
					using weathering steel, etc.). 

					In 1998, China has started in the national key basic research development plan "a
					new generation of steel materials for key basic research" "973 Program". The ultimate
					goal of the study was a significant increase in Chinese steel output over 60% of
					carbon steels, low alloy steels, and the strength and life of structural steel, to
					produce a new generation of steel prototypes. Some specific objectives are: yield
					strength of carbon structural steel high to 400 MPa, low alloy yield strength of
					800 MPa, yield strength of alloy structural steel 1,500 MPa, also the service life
					of steel 1 time. Domestic steel mills also applies to new steel bridges are being
					developed. 

					7.4.3 High-performance Concrete (HPC) 

					Traditional concrete is extended from late 19th century, 20th century human civilisation
					and made a great contribution. Development of China's economy is undergoing a period
					of rapid growth and construction is unprecedented in scale, in China in 2007, cement
					production reached 13.200 milliont, almost half of world cement concrete output of
					7 billiont. 

					However, the cement is high energy-consuming, resource-friendly products, improve
					efficiency in the use of concrete, not only on the construction itself has boost
					also contribute to socio-economic development. Therefore, in the development process,
					increase per unit of volume of a strong becomes a goal to strive for engineering
					and technical personnel, the development of high-performance concrete is from the
					beginning of high-strength concrete. 



Fig. 7.77 Concrete development process schematic drawing. 

					Early concrete strength depends mainly on improvement of cement strength grade and
					reduce mixing water consumption of concrete realisation. Water content reduction
					in the amount leads to significant reductions of the work, which is hard to operate
					at construction site. In 1986, Norway engineers first developed admixture in concrete
					with Silica fume on concrete strength, impermeability and resistance to chloride
					diffusion enhancement. In 1990, the United States rates first coined the term high-performance
					concrete (High Performance Concrete, called HPC), defined as having high strength,
					durability, high-workability concrete. To focus on these targets a different aspect
					of research in Europe, Japan and other countries, makes high-performance concrete
					application is rapidly advancing. Fig. 7.77 is described by Chinese academician Wu
					Zhongwei concrete development process. 

					The objective is achieved through high performance concrete adding superplasticizer
					and implemented active fine admixture. Active fine admixture ground granulated slag
					and fly ash, silica fume, high quality, fine zeolite powder and development of rice
					husk ash, and so on. Such as fly ash, slag and silica fume admixture in began in
					the 1950, of the 20th century, however, owing to lack of grinding fineness, did not
					play an active role. To the above material, greatly improves the density of the concrete,
					thereby increasing the strength, durability and impermeability of the concrete, while
					increasing the work performance. To increase the concrete tensile capacity in recent
					years, adding fiber concrete material to be studied extensively. 

					1. High Strength Concrete 

					High strength concrete is widely used in the construction of high-rise buildings
					and bridges. At present in the construction of bridge engineering C60 concrete has
					been more widely used in the bridge construction site, C80 concrete abroad already
					have lots of applications, C100 concrete also has experimental applications in foreign
					countries. 

					High performance concrete with compressive strength under 150 MPa can consist of
					a fine admixture cement + active + reducer + sand + ground stone tie in together.
					Due to the active fine admixture and superplasticizer admixture, the slump can be
					reached 27 cm, making it work can be improved dramatically, can achieve a pump and
					self-leveling. 

					High strength and Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) is entirely the activity
					is made of cement + admixture + this carefully superplasticizer mix together, compressive
					strength up to 200 MPa. 

					From Norway began in the 1970, of the 20th century research on ultrafine silica powder,
					50 MPa, compressive strength of concrete slump 120 mm normal strength concrete, by
					1990, the slump 270 mm, 100 MPa, compressive strength and high performance concrete.
					

					2. The Self-leveling Concrete 

					Also known as self-compacting concrete vibration-free self-leveling concrete is a
					kind of high performance concrete with low water-binder ratio, usually mixed with
					a lot of powder coal ash, slag. Japan Tokyo University first developed the self-leveling
					concrete, concrete cement on each side only 114 kg, 71% per cent of total amount
					of cementitious material with slag, fly ash, in mixture added with high efficiency
					water reducing agent and expansive agent, thickening agent, mix with wrap sand technology,
					it is more complicated. Later development of vibration-free concrete cement-principal
					cementitious materials and mixing a number of mineral admixtures, adding superplasticizer
					and thickening agents such as phthalate, such as acrylamide. Vibration-free concrete
					can improve construction speed, reduce labor intensity and save on vibrating machinery
					and electric power consumption and eliminate noise pollution. 

					This amount of powder and fine aggregate in concrete more need to find ways to suppress
					shrinkage of concrete, is the focus of research. Self-leveling concrete slump 230~270
					mm, Development is greater than 550 mm (upto 700~800 mm). 

					3. For Fiber-reinforced Concrete 

					By means of high efficiency water reducing agent, activated ultrafine admixtures
					can significantly improve the compressive properties of concrete, but the tensile
					strength of modified good is not evident, and improve cracking resistance and tensile
					strength of concrete is one of the research efforts in the direction of high performance
					concrete. To concrete mixing a quantity of fiber is one of the methods to improve
					the tensile strength of concrete, are widely studied. 

					Mix fiber in concrete with steel fibers, synthetic fibers. Various fibers improve
					tensile strength of concrete key parameters under study, for example, steel fiber
					shape, size, etc. Constructability of fiber mix is the focus of research these factors.
					Through the fiber-reinforced concrete tensile strength of upto 10 MPa. If the concrete
					on bridge design, alter our concrete design concepts. 

					There are a lot of practical engineering where steel fiber was Added to the concrete
					bridge deck pavement, however, because of steel fiber-reinforced mechanism is not
					used in full, crack resistance of concrete tensile strength only as a reserve. 

					4. Other Properties of High Performance Concrete 

					High performance concrete in other performance improvements are under study, these
					studies will be overcome the existence of ordinary concrete weaknesses so that concrete
					can be more widely applied in various fields of civil engineering. Table 7.3 shows
					some features of high performance concrete.

					application prospects in the future. Concrete performance will affect bridge design
					ideas. 

					7.4.4 Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) 

					Fiber reinforced composite (fiber reinforced polymer/plastic, FRP for short) is composed
					of fibrous materials and substrates proportionally mixing and through a certain formation
					of composite high-performance materials. This material came into use in the 1940,
					in the world of aviation, aerospace, shipbuilding, automotive, chemical, medicine
					and machinery are widely applied in the field. In recent years, the FRP with its
					advantages of high strength, light weight, corrosion resistance, began to be applied
					in civil and building engineering structural and attracts the engineering sector's
					great attention. In Engineering structures oftern used are mainly carbon fiber FRP
					(carbon fiber), fiberglass (glass fiber) and aramid fiber (aramid fiber) reinforced
					resin matrix, respectively referred to as CFRP, AFRP and GFRP. Table 7.5 the three
					types of fibers and the mechanical properties comparison with steel and aluminum.
					

					As can be seen from Table 7.5, fibrous material strength (tensile strength/weight)
					20~50 times that of steel, high-strength lightweight performance is outstanding;
					carbon fiber modulus (tensile modulus/weight) 5~10 times that of steel, aramid fiber
					modulus for steel sheets 2~3 times, modulus of fiberglass and steel. Simply looking
					at specific strength and modulus alone, actual projects with carbon fiber material
					works achieve best results, but carbon fibre elongation is very small, they sometimes
					need to be mixed with other fibers, with the idea better overall performance.

					1. Preparation Technology of FRP Products 

					Preparation of moulding is the premise of FRP fiber and matrix in working together.
					Mechanical properties of FRP relies heavily on preparation technology, so one must
					be taken into account in the design the preparation technology of FRP structures.
					Products obtained by different preparation forms differ greatly. Application of FRP
					in structures Engineering's products mainly include: the sheet of material (fiber
					cloth and plates), reinforcement materials and Suo Cai, mesh bar and grille, pultrusion,
					winding, molding profiles and profiles such as hand lay-up. 

					Fiber cloth is the most widely used form. It consists of a continuous filament woven
					together, usually of unidirectional fiber cloth, so that do not infiltrate the resin
					before use. Current fabric mainly used in structural engineering, with resin paste
					surface after the invasion. 

					FRP panels are fiber through layers in the factory shop, infiltration, curing the
					resin prepared from preformed, paste it in the construction or mechanical anchors
					fixed on the surface. FRP tendons is a one-way process (pultrusion), unidirectional
					fibers and resin molding rods may be on the table surface processed to increase its
					bonding with concrete. FRP cable is long, continuous fiber braid, then use a small
					amount of resin moist curing or without resin and cords made of FRP products. FRP
					reinforcement materials and cable materials in the reinforced concrete structure
					instead of reinforcement and prestressing tendons, can also be used for large-span
					cable-supported structures, tensioned structure and cable structures. 

					Long fiber bundles woven in accordance with certain spacing perpendicular, and infiltrated
					with resin curing FRP grid materials can form FRP grating. FRP grid material substitute
					reinforcement mesh, three-dimensional FRP reinforcement cage alternative. FRP grating
					can be directly used as a floor or structure made of sandwich panels and other components.
					

					Pultrusion is the fiber or fabric through continuous feeding Creel, through the resin
					tank impregnated fibres, and wearing a thermal after the mold to pull bodies, can
					be made into a continuous FRP products accordingly. Pultrusion produces cross-sectional
					shape complex mixed continuous profiles, because of pultruded fiber along the axis,
					and is high in fiber, have very good mechanical properties, can be used directly
					as for loadbearing elements, force can also be combined with other materials. But
					the lower transverse strength and shear strength of pultruded profiles. 

					FRP winding profiles were continuous fibers or fabrics impregnated resin, clinging
					to core-mould according to certain rules (or lining of bile), and then after curing
					to form in order to annular fibers oriented profiles, a common form of tubes, tanks,
					spheres, etc. In engineering structure, FRP winding Canal filling can be used as
					a column, concrete piles, beams, component properties can be superior to concrete-filled
					steel tube. 

					Moulded profiles are pre-impregnated resin fiber or pressurised heating curing fabric
					into the tool made of FRP material. Profile of this technology to produce accurate,
					smooth surface, stable quality, but usually low in fiber mechanical properties is
					poor. 

					For some large or complex-shaped profiles, normal temperature and low pressure is
					generally used contact moulding process, low pressure at room temperature, or under
					no pressure formed a type of sticky with resin fibers and fabrics, used to manual
					operation is complete, so called hand lay-up. This method can produce complicated
					shapes, fibers lay out arbitrary and large sizes of FRP products, product quality
					is stable. 

					2. The Performance Characteristics of FRP 

					Very high strength, that is commonly referred to as lightweight and high strength,
					so using FRP materials to reduce the structural weight. In bridge engineering, or
					FRP composite structures using FRP structure as a bridge superstructure can limit
					span greatly increases. 

					Good corrosion resistance, acids, alkalis, chloride, and FRP can long-term use in
					a damp environment, which the traditional structural materials cannot compare with
					very suitable for designing. FRP artificial material, you can shop with different
					fiber, fiber content, and chen Fang to design a variety of strength, modulus of elasticity
					and specific performance requirements for FRP product. FRP products are easy to shape,
					shapes can be designed. 

					Good elastic properties, stress-strain curve is close to linear elastic, in restitution
					after large deformation, plasticity deformation and structural deformation recovery
					after accidental overload. 

					FRP products are suitable for production in a factory, transported to the site, installation
					of industrialised construction process, to ensure project quality and labour efficiency
					and building industrialisation. 

					FRP itself contains mainly fiber conductive ability is related to the stress applied
					to it, by detecting certain fibers conductivity degree of stress can be deducted,
					therefore, FRP material will automatically detect the smart widget. 

					3. FRP Application in Bridge Engineering 

					FRP high strength light weight makes it from the date of birth as the study subject
					by engineers on how to apply to construction works. In bridge engineering A variety
					of attempts have been conducted, including bridge strengthening, FRP tendons instead
					of directly using FRP reinforcement and prestressing tendons or FRP composite structure
					bridges. 

					Paste in concrete structures using FRP surface to improve the bearing capacity of
					most of the current application of FRP bridge condition. Concrete piers strengthened
					with FRP winding through concrete to improve strength and deformation capacity of
					concrete and the shear capacity of high pier, this is the most effective re-habilitation
					method of FRP reinforced concrete. Beam and plate tension sides pasting FRP sheet
					can be improve their bending strength and cracks can be effectively controlled, passive
					force due to FRP, reinforcement efficiency is not high. Wrapped with FRP beams, beams
					shear strength can be improved, but there is also strength of FRP application low-efficiency
					problem, generally only using the strength of FRP 20%~40%. 

					Fiber volume content in FRP reinforcement could reach 60%, has the advantages of
					light weight, high strength, weight about one-fifth of the ordinary steel, strong
					6 times the ordinary steel, corrosion resistance and fatigue resistance, low relaxation,
					nonmagnetic, and so on. With FRP tendons instead of steel makes good Use of its
					corrosion resistance, avoiding corrosion on the structural damage, reduce structural
					maintenance costs; FRP cable used as a suspended rope slings and cables of the cable-stayed
					bridge, and tendons in pre-stressed concrete bridge. 

					Due to high strength and light weight, the direct use of FRP profiles to build bridges
					with good prospects, countries around the world conducted a lot of research on cable,
					up to now, completely made of FRP bridge limited to footbridges. 1982, in Miyun County,
					Beijing, China lay-up process of GFRP honeycomb beam, built a bridge, spans 20.7
					m, width 9.2 m, is the world's first FRP road bridges. In 1992, the United Kingdom
					of Aberfeldy in Scotland built up a whole structure of FRP cable-stayed pedestrian
					bridge, long 113 m, main span of 63 m, width 2.2 m, double tower double cable plane
					cable-stayed system, a-shaped pylon. Towers, beams and decking and handrails of a
					box-shaped cross-section of GFRP pultruded, AFRP cables of cable-stayed, coated with
					polyethylene protection, some connected to metal connections. The total cost of $
					200,000, for traditional wooden, concrete and steel cable-stayed bridge or half the
					cost of the steel truss bridge, and at least 20 years from dimension fix the bridge's
					success greatly promoted the study of FRP bridge. In 2002, Japan's Maeda proposed
					using FRP to build 5000 m long-span suspension bridge scheme Tower, qiaosuo and bridges
					are FRP, and static and dynamic analysis of the programme proposed for application
					of FRP bridge opened up a bright future. 

					FRP bridge as a whole in addition to, build a deck with FRP and FRP composite member
					is being a hot spot, as shown in Fig. 7.78. Decks are vulnerable to erosion, especially
					in the northern regions winter road salt non-slip, corrosion of the deck is more
					severe, good corrosion resistance of FRP, made decks can greatly improve performance,
					save maintenance cost.

					4. Application of FRP in Bridge Engineering Problems and Solutions 

					FRP has the above excellent structural performance, but there is still a number of
					obstacles, problems all over the world an unremitting exploration, some have found
					a solution. 

					FRP products is usually anisotropic, high strength and elastic modulus of along fiber
					direction, perpendicular to the fiber direction, strength and Young's modulus are
					low. Due to the anisotropy of FRP, on the mechanical properties are different from
					traditional structural materials, stretch warp phenomenon, which will increase the
					difficulty and design of FRP structures. 

					Compared with steel, the majority of FRP products due to the small cross-sectional
					area, have low rigidity. Therefore, the design of FRP structures usually is controlled
					by the deformation. The current solution is accomplished through the design of FRP
					members section and rationally, and combinations of materials such as concrete and
					using deformation of prestressed methods such as control structures, to compensate
					insufficient rigidity. 

					FRP materials shear strength, tensile strength and interlaminar shear strength between
					layers are just 5%~20% of tensile strength, while metal shear strength is 50% of
					its tensile strength, which makes connection of FRP components a prominent problem.
					Current solutions are riveting, bolting and bonding, but no matter what kind of connection,
					connecting parts are likely to be the weak part of the entire Widget. In structural
					design of FRP, therefore, on the one hand you want to minimise connect, on the other
					hand, you want to take the connection design. 

Figure 7.79 are the FRP anchor and connection types that have been developed. 

					Compare with concrete, poor fire performance of FRP material in general, mainly because
					most of the resin at high temperatures would soft, resin the softening temperature
					is reached (usually 70 degrees or so) will be greatly reduce the mechanical properties,
					reach the glass transition temperature (usually about 300°C) behaviour will occur
					when you shift. Current solution is mixed with fire retardant FRP resin material,
					at the same time fire prevention at the surface and improve its fire resistant properties.
					



Fig. 7.79 FRP materials connection form (size unit: mm) (a) Bonded FRP reinforcement
						type anchor; (b) Wedge bonding FRP reinforcement type anchor; (c) Bonding FRP profile
						form. 

					In addition, fatigue resistance, durability of the FRP has not yet mature theory
					and experience, need further study. 

					Finally, the economics is the question concerned by all engineers and users. Only
					seen from the material price, FRP structure and compared with reinforced concrete
					structure is not competitive, but due to light weight, and taking into account the
					corrosion resistance of FRP materials lower maintenance costs arising from using
					FRP materials, the overall economic efficiency is deserving attention. Given that
					the FRP is at an early stage, the cost is high, as the volume of applications increased,
					the price of FRP products produced on a larger scale will be greatly decrease. Case
					study of concrete structures strengthened with CFRP and its price from the initial
					2000 yuan/m2, is reduced to at present about 500 Yuan/m2, is a good example. 

					7.4.5 Role of IT Technology in Promoting Bridge-building 

					In all high-tech, the role of IT technology in bridge-building is obvious. IT technology
					in bridge engineering starts from Numerical calculation, with the development of
					IT technology, visual, multimedia, network technologies are quickly applied to the
					construction of bridge engineering. 

					1. Numerical Techniques Promoting Effect on Bridge Engineering 

					Bridge structure mechanics is complex, structural calculations is the key for the
					design of bridges. Traditional mechanics can be provide analytical solutions read
					clearly, but for complex and time-consuming effort, and in many cases cannot be solved,
					emergence of the finite element method allows engineers freed from structural calculations
					and finite element calculation is the basis of other information technology applications.
					

					Now solving complex mechanical problems in bridge engineering is mainly reflected
					in high solve statically indeterminate structure, non-linear problem solving, mechanics
					problem solving etc. 

					The solution to higher order of statical structures provides the basic means for
					the development of bridge type. Cable-stayed bridges are higher order of statical
					structures, its development embodies the role of computing. The most important development
					trend of cable-stayed bridge is from the earlier thin cables system to the current
					system of dense cables, cable-stayed bridges span has grown from 200 m level to the
					1000 meter scale over the decades, this is inseparable from the increase in calculation
					capacity. Traditional bridge design analysis simplified the bridges into planar structure,
					this limits the bridge type development. With the popularity of structure calculation,
					space system bridge program has been growing, particularly in urban landscape bridge
					in the city. The solution to hyperstatic problem makes it possible to structure fine
					analysation. The current bridge design specifications is based on the concept of
					beams and columns, and correction factor of spatial problems, often through a variety
					of methods into a simple beam force calculation, calculate the average result is
					based on the beam-column cross section spatial peak load. The problem of this is
					waste, and in some cases, failure to cover peak, resulting in accidents. Fine analysing
					designs is based directly on spacial stress, problems from average stress design
					can be avoided, at the same time it saves material. 

					Non-linear question is mainly manifested in two aspects of geometry and material,
					particularly in the case of large span and load carrying capacity. In the traditional
					non-linear problems are solves using differential equations, but solutions cannot
					be found in many cases. By finite element iterative calculation, non-linear problems
					have been solved. Calculation method of nonlinear problems plays a very important
					role in promoting development of large-span bridges, cable-supported bridges. Self-anchored
					suspension bridge development benefits from finite element non-linear analysis methods.
					Traditional suspension bridge is based on the pre-sumption that main beam being suspended
					on main cable, the girders at the construction stage are completely hanging in the
					main cable, making construction processes simple, also enable the suspension bridge
					span more than 1000 m without computers. While the main cables of self-anchored suspension
					bridge is anchored on the main beam, girder by boom pushes overall hanging on the
					main cable, construction phase the main cables would have to work with the main beam.
					

					Non-linear large displacement problems with the entire construction process, if there
					are no non-linear finite element calculations, it is hard to imagine the reinforced
					concrete girder self anchored suspension bridge could be built successfully. Implementation
					of finite element method for material non-linear analysis, allows engineers to analyse
					bridges from beginning of loading to collapse the whole process, this technology
					will be promote the safety of bridge design values is more reasonable. 

					Dynamic problem-solving is the difficulty point in calculation of classical mechanics,
					it tends to associate power with power amplifier in bridge design static problem
					solving converting approach, it is difficult to reflect the actual situation. By
					using dynamic numerical simulation based on finite element method, the whole process
					of bridge vibration under the external excitation can be reflected. Through analysing
					the data of the bridge response to seismic, wind, vehicle, one can better grasp the
					dynamic performance of bridges, and most reaction ever to pass the test of these
					structures otherwise is time-consuming and costly. During bridge program planning,
					one can be calculated by numerical analysis of structural dynamic response, until
					the final stage when test is carried out, this leads to significant savings in manpower
					and material resources and project selection can be carried out on a large scale.
					

					2. Environmental Factors to Simulate Actual Working State Calculation of Bridge Design
					Approach 

					Bridges work under natural conditions, classical mechanics needs to abstraction and
					standardisation of external action can be take place. With the development of computer
					technology, nature has gradually digitized simulation of various external factors,
					and effect on bridges and structures closer to the real situation. Currently wind,
					fluid flow, temperature field and main force are the main factors affecting bridge,
					can be dealt by digital simulation, and can substantially reduce design costs. 

					3. The Visualisation Technology Transforms the Bridge Design from Abstract Thought
					into Virtual Operating 

					With the development of computer technology, in the 1990, of the 20th century, the
					era of ordinary computer into a graphical user interface, visualisation technologies
					in all fields of engineering construction began to develop from the early visualisation
					of two-dimensional visible until now. Visualisation of virtual digital world helps
					people to visualise the concept of real world image, so that people can be simulated
					in the virtual world real objects. Applications of this technology in civil engineering,
					enables designers to imagine visually design the structure. 

					Combination of visualisation and finite element calculation techniques, enabling
					engineers completely in three-dimensional graphic model and output manifested by
					our understanding of physical concepts, such as stress, deformation of shape, greatly
					improving working efficiency. In the 1980, when the continuous rigid-frame bridge
					luoxi bridge with a span of 180 m was analysed on the middle pier top No. 0 for space
					stress, finite element software did not have visualisation, classification units
					to be constructed on the drawings are solid structures are divided into small pieces,
					and compute node position output result is artificial to draw stress contour lines.
					Such an analysis took more than 1 year. In 2008, in Zhoushan island-connecting project
					216 m long-span continuous rigid-frame bridge in Jintang bridge No. 0 space stress
					analysis, finite element software has achieved a visual modeling and results output,
					calculation of the same size, no more than 1 month, the efficiency increased by more
					than 10 times. 

					Visualisation technology enables designers in structural design, you can easily build
					bridges or their local members of three-dimensional images, drawing only three-dimensional
					images are projected onto a two-dimensional drawing. This technology greatly facilitates
					the implementation of complex structure design of structure design from the original
					abstract ideas into the ideas and the outcome of the interaction. 

					4. Networking Technologies Enable Remote Monitoring Bridge Construction 

					Extensive comparison of bridge construction in the past, construction and design
					is often disassociated, ensures the quality of bridge construction monitoring data
					cannot be instant analysis, resulting in quality problems of bridge construction.
					As the technology of computer network and digital sensor signal development of remote
					control of bridge construction possible. 

					In recent years, various sensor signals the progressive realisation of analog-digital
					conversion, digital signals can be easily through computer networks instant transmission.
					the sensor or measuring instrument embedded in the structure transmit data in real
					time from the construction site to the office computer engineers, engineers can compare
					estimates of rates and design, judge bridges the site conditions, in the event of
					deviations can be adjusted promptly inform site. Construction monitoring technology
					in the past 30 years have made sufficient progress, thanks to the structural development
					in computing technology, you can use computers to simulate the entire construction
					before the bridge construction drive second, thanks to the sensors and the development
					of network technology, makes it possible to remote real time measurement. 

					7.5 CHOOSING RESEARCH TOPICS IN COMPLEX BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION WORK 

					Bridge-building and development of science and technology progress alongwith engineering,
					every bridge engineer in bridge engineering foster innovative concepts in the construction
					of the project, in the construction of large bridges in China tend to earmark some
					of the money to fund scientific and technological innovation, bridge recognised by
					peers in the world are those making break through in different ways. The most direct
					and simple break through indicator of bridge construction is the size of bridge-building,
					span, large scale, large span often reflects the level of bridge construction. However,
					the size does not mean everything, many of the projects themselves are relatively
					small, and does not require large-span. Bridge construction technology breakthroughs
					should be reflected in larger span, more economical and faster construction period,
					and many other aspects. Building a bridge and where to make break through reflect
					bridge engineer vision and ability. 

					7.5.1 The Purpose and Necessity of Research Project 

					In bridge design and construction process, in order to meet the special conditions
					of building the bridge to reach higher quality standards, technical requirements,
					some would point to the current bridge design and construction there is no theoretical
					and empirical research on, and development of innovative technologies. Often one
					or several key breakthroughs can help more difficult projects complete successfully,
					so that projects achieve higher economic efficiency and some new technology can be
					made a demonstration for future projects with social benefits. This work has gone
					beyond the normal bridges design and requires special studies. Some large foreign
					complex bridge projects have some the key issues studied years prior to the bridge
					being built special study on the issue, the success of these key issues and sometimes
					determines the success or failure of bridge program. 

					Thematic studies in the construction of large bridges have two purposes. 

					First, solve new problems in the construction. Complex conditions of building the
					bridge or the special requirements of building the bridge often exceeds technology
					and experience, case studies is required to ensure the successful completion of the
					bridge. For example, the construction of bridges in coastal areas, long sex will
					become critical to the success of, China's first cross-sea bridge Donghai bridge
					in bridge design in the process of coagulation soil, steel and other construction
					materials durability problems in the marine environment for a number of case studies,
					culminating in selection, mixing ratio, processing technology, anti-corrosion measures
					proposed technical procedures to ensure measures. Similar coastal environments, Zhoushan
					island project in xihoumen suspension is the span of 1650 m suspension bridge and
					wind resistance will become the success or failure of critical issues, conducted
					a special study finally using the middle groove 6 m box-steel box girder stiffened
					girder of this special plan. 

					Second, to obtain building experience for similar bridges. Technological progress
					of bridge construction is built on a large number of projects on the basis of practice,
					during the course of a bridge built, ways to solve specific problems, and after summarising
					the formation theory and method of enterprise in order to enhance its ability to
					compete, if extended to other similar projects, can also get very good social benefits.
					Therefore, some prospect of technology combined with the engineering special studies,
					forming monographic study on theories, techniques and methods become another primary
					purpose. Chinese government from the central to the local, thematic studies on promising
					strong support, in addition to engineering construction set owners to provide funding,
					government back to work with a certain amount of subsidies. Currently used in bridge
					design and construction of theory, technology and engineering methods are formed
					this way. For example, in China's first railway passenger line on Qinhuangdao-Shenyang
					passenger dedicated railway line construction process, on land speed bridge type,
					prefabricated technology of erecting bridge, bridging technology, equipment and
					other special studies on a number of key issues, the results for our large-scale
					construction of passenger dedicated line provided technical support. Again, the bridge
					of Donghai bridge erection technology of thematic research offers for our other cross-sea
					bridge construction experience. 

					7.5.2 Choosing Research Contents 

					Research content should adapt to the level of scientific and technological development
					of bridge-building, and commensurate with the needs. At present, the hot issue of
					bridge construction are mainly the following several aspects: 


						The application of new structural systems. 

						Structure adaptability to complex environmental conditions. 

						Forms of complex details. 

						A new working method and corresponding equipment. 

						The application of new materials and technologies. 

						The durability. 


					The rapid development of China is in bridge-building phase, due to the different
					levels of economic development, peak of bridge construction in foreign countries
					30 years earlier, so the bridge can be a lot of foreign experience for reference
					in our country. However, our country and abroad the same, different natural conditions
					of the construction, so we cannot copy the technology. For example, a country with
					a large population, with a development of the traffic surge in overall level width
					of building bridges in China than abroad, which make foreign developed bridge knot
					system is not necessarily suited to China's national conditions, design theories
					are not necessarily suitable lagging research in China results in quality problems
					in wide bridges. However, the large population of China has the advantage of low
					labour costs, China's construction, Labour costs account for about project cost 25%
					~30% and 60% ~70% of foreign labour cost of the total project cost, therefore, drive
					to solve the problem in the construction of mentality and the focus is different.
					

					Raising the level of science and technology in order to improve the bridge construction,
					our country at all levels of Government in the construction of the bridge has promotional
					value, can improve the industry competition ability research projects were funded.
					On bridge engineering research funding in recent years is the highest national technical
					support program. 

					National science and technology support program is to implement the outline of the
					national medium-and long-term program for scientific and technological development
					(2006-2020) (Hereinafter referred to as the program), mainly for national economic
					and social development needs, is focusing on major economic and Social Development
					Department technical problems, and was established on the basis of national scientific
					and technological plans of national science and technology plan. Supporting programme,
					mainly the implementation of the platform for point and its priority theme in the
					area of mission, to major public technical and industrial generic technology research
					focuses on development and application of the model, and major construction projects
					and major equipment development, strengthening of integrated innovation and the introduction
					of secondary innovation, with a focus on involving global major technical issues
					of sex, trans-industry, trans-regional, focused on overcoming a number of key technologies,
					break through the bottlenecks and improve our industrial competitiveness, providing
					support to the coordinated development of economy and society in China. 

					States currently funding mainly for bridge engineering research is set in large complex
					bridge construction project, requiring in bridge construction at the same time, address
					the common problems of similar bridges, enhance the competitiveness of the industry
					as a whole. Currently national science and technology support included in bridge-building
					case studies were funded through three bridges, they are: Su-Tong Yangtze river highway
					bridge and Zhoushan Island West Hou bridge of Taizhou Changjiang river highway bridge.
					Funded research is as follows. 

					Su Tong bridge technology supporting plan research overall objectives: make meter
					scale long span cable-stayed bridges breakthrough to improve cable-stayed bridge
					construction techniques. There are six sub-topics:

					of construction technology of super long-span suspension bridges in our country catch
					up with the world advanced level. There are six sub-topics:

						split;

						of key technologies; 

						Meag size steel box girder of long span suspension bridge with key technologies of
						monitoring and management. 


					Science supported planning of Taizhou Changjiang overall objectives to: promote continuous-span
					suspension bridge design technology. A total of three sub-topics: 


						Multi-tower continuous span suspended cable structures characteristics; 

						Multi-tower continuous span suspension bridge middle tower key technology research;
						

						Flexibility of large span continuous bridge track structure characteristics and key
						techniques of pavement. 


					7.5.3 Research Technique and Method 

					Most technical route and method of bridge engineering research may use two types
					of methods: theoretical analysis and experimental research. 

					Theoretical analysis usually uses two means: analytical and numerical analysis. Analytical
					method is traditional, with strong concept, but many problems are hard to find answer
					using this method, for example, the most commonly used many of the mechanical behaviour
					of beam with variable cross-section would be difficult to analytically solve. Numerical
					analysis employs the finite element method. In theory, all current mechanical problems
					can be solved with finite element method, however, finite element calculation for
					a particular structure at a time, to get results, a lot of work. Therefore, at present
					many studies use the combination of analytical solution and numerical analysis, to
					structure the purpose of conceptual clarity and ability to solve practical problems.
					

					For problem whose mechanism is not completely understood the empirical method must
					be used. Experimental studies in engineering have two purposes: first, exploratory
					testing, the other is a confirmatory test. Experimental studies of physical connections
					is not clear structural problem, access to analytical or numerical analysis of constitutive
					relation of software needed, often requires a large series of tests. Confirmatory
					test is a new structure, new technologies and so on before the actual application
					authentication. There are some particularly complex structure, process, although
					in theory has been to suggest that programmes were established, however, due to physical
					works high cost the project is not allowed to fail and, therefore, require scale
					or full size prior to the implementation of verification tests to detect design problems
					not thought through in design. For example, a cable-stayed bridge cable tower anchorage
					zone of cable-stayed, stress and complex production processes, sutong bridge constructed
					with steel anchor box for the first time in the country, although the design of theoretical
					calculations have pledged to set up, but in order to ensure bridge construction site
					safe, sectional model test of anchorage zone, a theoretical analysis is to validate
					the design indeed, the second is verifying the reliability of construction technology.

CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF URBAN BRIDGE 

					In this chapter, I would like to speak with you about a recent hot topic: the conceptual
					design of urban bridge. Before starting this topic, a couple of interesting phenomena
					may stimulate some of your thoughts. These things take place on bridge designer,
					you may also be familiar with. 

(a) The Most Beautiful Bridge 

					The end of 20th century, International Association for bridge and engineering organised
					the "20 century world's most beautiful bridge" selection, from more than 100 countries
					over 1000 bridges 15 were awarded the "the 20th century most beautiful bridges in
					the world" title. One the top is Switzerland engineer R. Maillart's Salginatobel
					bridge Fig. 8.1, a sickle-bearing arch; the second is a United States engineer J.
					Strauss' United States famous San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge Fig. 8.2; the third is France Engineer J. Muller's single cable concrete
					cable-stayed bridge—Brotonne bridge Fig. 8.3. Neither of these first three has the
					largest span in the bridge, special the Salginatobel bridge whose span is only 90
					m, built-in 1930, this fully shows that bridge aesthetic evaluation is not determined
					by its span size. So, what is the standard to measure a bridge aesthetic? How to
					display the beauty of the city bridges?

Fig. 8.2 The Golden Gate Bridge (United States). 



Fig. 8.3 Brotonne bridge (France). 

					The Millennium footbridge when the world entered a new era, all the way to build
					a bridge to mark the dawn of the new millennium, it is not a co-incidence. At this
					stage, monumental construction of the highway bridge and the railway bridge is no
					longer the center of attention, they gave and human relations are closely related
					to the footbridge Figs. 8.4~8.6. This shift reflects on the "sustainability" continue
					to strengthen that concerns people and people's desire for healthier lifestyles.
					In this wave of pedestrian bridges, the interesting thing is that design working
					group includes architects, engineers, artists, as well as landscape and environmental
					experts, have now joined the ranks of the bridge design, and historically, the bridge
					design was under the Project Professional's realm. Meanwhile, some excellent, avantgarde
					engineering also began to focus more on bridge aesthetics and artistry, and explore
					innovations in bridge structures, beautiful design ideas throughout the design process,
					and not just be limited to the traditional pattern of engineering.

(b) Sea-River Bridge 

					In recent years, cities around the world started renovating the landscape, creating
					city river bridge culture to show city charm, urban river bridge landscape has become
					a shining point of the urban landscape in urban development have an increasingly
					important location. Beginning in 2003, Tianjin out of Haihe economic development
					overall plan, it has been the past five year, has achieved great successes in its
					infrastructure construction. Among them, the bridge construction is one of the highlights
					of haihe development, has completed the order represented a number of excellent works
					of dagu bridge Figs. 8.7, 8.8, for the entire river landscape considerably. Attention
					on Tianjin 5 years of bridge-building, whether it is modified by strengthening of
					existing bridges or the implementation of a new bridge, conceptual design of system
					analysis of urban bridges provides good material.

Fig. 8.8 Haihe River new bridge of dagu bridge. 

(c) National bridge Conference 

					In May 2006, the convening of the 17th National Conference on bridges in Chongqing
					City, on the theme "strengthening innovation, improve the quality, attention to aesthetics"
					and "Western bridge". In May 2008, to "reinforce innovation, attention to aesthetics"
					as the theme of the 18th state Bridge Symposium held in Tianjin. The annual bridge
					conference held in Tianjin, Tianjin in recent years, mainly due to "strengthening
					new, focused on aesthetics, "outstanding achievement in bridge-building, in particular,
					won the 2006. World of dagu bridge Youjin Feige international awards, a good example
					of academic exchanges. Two bridges meetings listed "renovation" and "aesthetic" as
					the theme of the meeting, the two concepts become the mainstream of design of new
					bridges. We found that, unlike in previous years national bridge conference compared
					to twice in this annual meeting, the participating experts and scholars on the "city
					of bridges" to give more clearance note, receive papers covering bridges also enriched
					the contents of many of the city. 

					8.1 THE CONCEPTS OF URBAN BRIDGES 

					8.1.1 The Definition of Urban Bridges 

					In the initial stages of bridge design, how to use conceptual design to construct
					reasonable overall arrangement? 

					How to level up from the basic concepts to understand bridge design and construction?
					

					How to use the new technology, new technology, new design concept to the design and
					construction of bridge? 

					As mentioned in the above questions, in the preceding seven chapters, we bridge the
					conceptual design, bridge aesthetic, innovative thinking, and an in-depth discussion
					of topics such as structural concept, hoping for future practical work and research
					offer some help. 

					This chapter is: the conceptual design of urban bridge. First of all, if you're a
					bridge engineer, may wish to consider this question: when you have received one or
					several bridges designing tasks, road and rail bridges and bridges, would the conditions
					be different. Difference in Owner's project requirements, respectively. Throughout
					the design process, you begin to design cut changes accordingly. If you are not clear
					on the road and rail bridges and bridges of the city in the process of design and
					construction of otherness, concept being very fuzzy, this chapter may be of interest
					to you. 

					So, what exactly is bridge? As its name suggests, usually refers to the city limits
					of urban bridge built across the river, across the river, cross-sea beam bridges,
					overpasses and pedestrian bridges. The load of urban bridge design standards (CJJ
					77-98) city bridges known as: "Urban construction, reconstruction of permanent bridges
					and elevated highways structure as well as other constructions." In the beginning
					of this chapter, "the haihe River Bridge" for example, by collecting a lot of data,
					summed up this type of municipal bridge's main features are: 


						Key aspects of bridge aesthetics in bridge construction, each bridge to become a
						beautiful scenic line, as for one aspect of the city, became a symbol of the city.
						Dagu bridge in, for example, it won the world famous bridge awards—receive the folling
						evaluation: "the imagination and innovation of dagu bridge in Tianjin, China, in
						bridge engineering have made distinguished achievement, and became a local landmark."
						

						Bridge in the central area of the city, bridges scales in the appropriate range,
						the span of the bridge is more modest. 

						The bridge structure is extremely complex, and challenge to the structural design.
						Such as the Tianjin Haihe River Bridge in Bengbu, space antisymmetric network structure
						and vertical and horizontal arch structure, and complex stress. 

						The complex loads on bridges, under the influence of high-rise building in the city,
						uncertain direction and high wind speeds, decorative objects various, decorative
						load heavy. For example, Northampton, bridge, bridges with decorations, and have
						some loadings of structures. 

						The bridge tends to be thin, mostly steel for the main beam and larger flexibility.
						


					The five points above, as certain characteristics of the Haihe River Bridge, many
					of these areas is common for city bridge. But the characteristics of urban bridge
					do not exist the so-called unification, for each city's bridge, things could have
					been different, even for the same two bridges in the city, their requirements are
					sometimes quite different. Therefore, we cannot pass the limited character of urban
					bridge features a near-comprehensive summary. It is Not hard to find urban bridge
					with highway bridge beam in bridge aesthetic requirements, environmental conditions
					and other aspects, the difference is obvious, but a successful bridge must meet "safety,
					utility, economy and beauty" four demands, which requirements are the same for all
					bridges. Previously involved concepts and theories, and apply equally to city bridges,
					so no attention is here, focusing on the characteristic of urban bridges talking
					about several points while, as a bridge (all types) continuation of conceptual design
					and additions. 

					In order to differentiate from road and rail bridges, the contents of the chapter,
					using narrower concept of urban bridge, especially in urban centers bustling bridges,
					bridges aims to solve inner-city traffic, spanning medium, in the range of appropriate
					scales bridge, which we often refer to the "urban landscape bridge". 

					Here we treat "urban bridge" as a separate section to discuss, because in recent
					years, "city bridge beam" landscape "very high frequencies of terms such as, it seems
					that all the bridge engineers talking about" beautiful "everyone in the speaking
					of "innovation" and the topics concentrated on the large component on top of the
					bridge. These days, for almost all of urban bridge construction industry owner require
					"landscape design". In fact, the "landscape design of the urban bridge" that is in
					itself is a statement of the layman design is a process of discovering, analysing
					and solving problems, city bridge design is a blend of structure engineering and
					architectural aesthetic thought in creative thinking process, there is no peeling
					of the bridge design called the "landscape design. Structural engineering and architectural
					aesthetics combined with the topic in 7. Section 5 will form a more exhaustive discussion.
					The beginning of this chapter "National symposium on bridge" referred to in the country,
					"bridge aesthetics" received more and more attention, this is a very welcome, but
					still want to see, not all of the owners and designers can truly understand the construction
					of bridges in cities reasonable use of "aesthetics" and "innovation". There are some
					bridges, decorated with a very pompous, very economic and there are individual bridge
					work, for different purposes, "innovations", but makes for a weird and unreasonably
					bridge, which reduces the value of the bridge, these demand our vigilance. In this
					chapter we want to solve the problem: How is the process of conceptual design of
					urban bridge like? In which we encounter design problems, and how should we respond?
					We'll start off city bridges development history. 

					8.1.2 Historical Evolution of Urban Bridge 

					Since time immemorial, the bridge is witnessing a transformation of human nature,
					making history, it reflects the human conquest of nature, also reflects the on human
					nature return; bridge is not only to create beautiful works of art, buildings full
					of wonder. It adds to nature beautiful melodies, but also with its different style
					to demonstrate and give specific beauty and arts; bridge is the cultural landscape
					is closely related to people's lives, it is human nature, to modern civilisation
					and the United States better ties with the future. 

					Marx said: "people cannot be allowed to change history", they had "in a direct encounter,
					established, from the past inherited condition" to create. So, who will have a more
					profound and thorough understanding of history, who are more likely to succeed work
					foundation. Conversely, if only to look beyond ideology and in the present, not to
					mention future-oriented, I'm afraid even now is uncertain. In fact, great time to
					have a great sense of history, a great designer must also have great historical meaning.
					Therefore, today's design students learn to appreciate the historical achievements,
					and learn to apply it in the contemporary setting. We have to study the city bridge,
					first thing to analyse is its history. 

					We know that rivers are cradles of human civilisation, mentioned in the history textbooks
					of the cradles of human civilisation, is the world's accepted, they are the Euphrates
					and Tigris and Euphrates river valleys, the Ganges river, the Nile river and the
					Yellow river. Together with the Development of civilisations, urban bridge across
					a river's history can be traced back to the earliest urban civilisation development
					and bridge beam since ancient times and people's daily life are inseparable, famous
					qingming Shang he Tu Fig. 8.9 is the Testimony of ancient Chinese bridge-side commercial
					prosperity. This diagram depicts the qingming Festival the Northern Song capital
					of Bianjing (now Kaifeng) East point inside and outside the door and the Bian river
					bustling scene on both sides. 



Fig. 8.9 Hong Qiao (the qingming, local). 

					Chinese ancient bridges, stone and wooden materials have built thousands of stone
					arch bridge wooden bridge, Shiliang bridge, wooden beams bridge, wonderful, still
					rendered architectural achievements of ancient Chinese bridges is universally acknowledged.
					For instance, the Sui first year of Yianye (605) Zhaozhou bridge is an arch bridge
					above the fold-open small arches, known as the "international landmark of wood engineering";
					founded Jin Mingchang three years (1192 ad) Wanping Lugou bridge in Beijing, Shi
					Liang Qiao, for a total of 11 Hole, the stone railing on the deck head, carved hundreds
					of stone lions, shapes and more numerous little lion in the lion who, legend, from
					now no one has been able to count how many lions are there on the Marco Polo Bridge.
					This bridge is not only a national cultural relics protection in 1991, have been
					listed as world culture heritage. Wooden bridges built in the 4th century AD have
					been recorded, existing in Guangxi, Sanjiang Dong autonomous Cheng Yang Yongji bridge,
					is a 4-hole wooden cantilever bridge with 5 piers, whose 5 piers are built with laminated
					bridge Pavilion and corridor through the bridge, the bridge Pavilion Balance, architectural
					decorative art features combined with the bridge, is the first bridge in the ancient
					and modern history of bridge building in China art examples in conjunction with bridge
					function. 

					In this section, through fragments of narrative history of urban bridge which can
					help us to understand the design of municipal bridges change the course of history.
					Attention is needed that when we read history, to have a sense of the times and a
					sense of realism, 
Rather than simply knowing a few historical facts. Because history
					has it's objectivity, but every era has its own of new issues, new social situation,
					and hope that through history to look for new answers. In this fast-changing time,
					we need to understand history from a new perspective. We look forward to the historical
					changes of urban bridges analysis, find some inspiration. 

					1. Pre-18th Century Urban Bridge 

					Before 18th century bridges all over the world mainly made of natural wood, stone
					construction: wooden bridge destroyed, pre-18th century wooden bridge to this has
					gone away, only descendants according to the painting or repairing the original to
					see them face, such as the above "Qingming Riverside picture"; the durability of
					the stone is better, we might as well take a few surviving ancient stone bridge,
					for example, recall that period of history. 

(a) China's Southern Stone Arch Bridge 

					Bridges are special, because they are cultural integration; bridge were told through
					the ages, because they contain the calendar the vicissitudes of history; a bridge
					across time and space, because they embody a regional style. Bridges in ancient China
					have always been connected closely to arts and culture , as says in a poem: 

					Night mooring by Maple Bridge relay
					Moonset Wu Ti Frost all over the sky,
					Jiangfeng for sleeping.
					An interlude,
					Midnight bells to passenger ships.

					Maple bridge was first built in the Tang dynasty in a poem, Hanshan Temple in Suzhou
					city, Jiangsu Province, North of Maple Bay, now Suzhou can see that bridges. Bai
					Juyi's poem: "the South is good, old everyone knows scenery; the flaming river, Spring
					Green river waves grow as blue. Cannot Yi Jiang South?", unconscious thoughts lead
					to people's picturesque south, and can reflect the style charm of the historic riverside
					town are that most floats a few ancient bridges, water, household. 

					South China is abundant in bridges, Guangxu of Shaoxing Fu cheng Qu road records,
					when Lu Xun's hometown of Shaoxing city had 229 bridges, averaged 31 per square kilometer
					bridge density of is 45 times higher of Venice in Europe. Although these are small
					bridges beam bridge, Shaoxing, but varied, and political skills, which are adapted
					to the wooden beams of the Xiaojiang river Bridge, wooden arch bridge, adapted to
					Jiang Dahe along the Boardwalk, then develops to a girder bridge, semi-circular arch,
					horseshoe-shaped arch, oval stone arch bridge, and even into today's advanced world
					of catenary arch bridge arch structure, constitute an extremely complete family of
					old bridge, bridge and ancient China economic development, the epitome of evolution.
					And the poem "bright moonlight 24 bridge" to describe the Yangzhou bridge, visible
					in ancient China bridge building boom scene. 



Fig. 8.10 Bridge-river-family (Zhou). 

					Southern China Bridge is not only found in poetry and prose, and are available in
					among the many paintings. Fig. 8.10 three painting in Chinese ink, depicting an old
					town—Zhou Zhuang of small bridges, flowing water, and people's home. 24 stone bridge
					across a narrow straight on the river, formed Zhouzhuang, a beautiful landscape,
					and Chinese-American paintings chen Yifei has to double as the background, creation
					famous paintings of the hometown memories, bridge of Zhouzhuang fame into even greater,
					popular at home and abroad. 

					China's Yangtze River Bridge (as mentioned above, Zhouzhuang, Shaoxing, Suzhou and
					Yangzhou, the bridge, as shown in Fig. 8.11), although will be regarded as the true
					meaning of "city of bridges", but they are an epitome of ancient bridges, evolution
					and economic development, set out China's rich history and culture, in many places
					worthy of our reference. 

					First of all, at the time, bridges serve pedestrians or Bullock carts and carriages.
					Without the modern bridge construction design, you could only use simple tools, manual
					work, teach skills by experience, actual housing architecture and the designer of
					the bridge craftsman. We might call this process is called "local design", then design
					and construction are inextricably linked. But in modern times society, the construction
					of a bridge for the most common, requires a series of professionally-designed bridge
					itself is made up of several structural engineers regiment designed to bridge decoration
					done by architect, bridge crossing by road designers and lead to the design, the
					road network grounds for professional designers for drainage, road and bridge location
					arranged by town planners, and these designers are likely to have never participated
					in the production of these artifacts. So can separating design from construction
					produce better design? This is a debatable topic. 

					Secondly, the Jiangnan bridge is popular, generally civil building, myself, unlike
					today's bridge owned by somebody. Rivers and footbridge, stranded, met Qiao bridge,
					trade, culture is created by the mass of the bridge. Therefore, the water bridge
					is a simple subject, stationary, it was used, it was celebrated, it was described
					with poetry and painting, film and television performances, story ...... Something about
					these and bridge, bridge cultural accumulation process is why bridge the infinite
					vitality. Popular culture is a multi-functional integrated culture, it is the entity
					matter and the spontaneous product of abstract ideas. In contrast, modern the utilitarianism
					of the bridge too thick, especially after the industrial revolution, the bridge is
					treated as a mass production of "industrial production" To meet the transport needs
					and bridge construction general lack of humanism and culture. 



Fig. 8.11 Southern China Bridges (a) Maple (Suzhou); (b) Stone arch bridge (Shaoxing);
						(c) Bridge (Zhou); (d) wutingqiao (Yangzhou). 

(b) In Europe in the Middle Ages the City Bridge 

					In the world, in Paris and London, for example, rapid development of two cities starting
					from the 12th century, their common feature is built around the ancient old river
					to organise its urban development, bridges and the city main streets, town squares,
					as well as important public buildings, to shape the key elements of the new metropolis,
					city bridge has also ushered in a relatively stable development opportunities. 

					In the era of roman rule in Paris, Seine by East-West and North-South trunk road
					cut, built-in the interchange four major bridges: transform bridge (Pont au Change),
					Notre Dame bridge (Pont Notre Dame), close, St bridge (Pont Saint-Michel) and the
					bridge (Petit Pont). These four bridges located in a region with high density of
					buildings and people, coupled with the city's geographical, administrative and religious
					influences, making it they have unparalleled status and value. Bridges are characterised
					by: 

					River crossing construction is basically completely blend with its surroundings,
					the bridge there are houses and shops, architectural style and houses around the
					same, seems to be completely unrelated with the river. Such bridges in the middle
					ages an extremely common, Called the "living bridge", Venice's famous Rialto Bridge
					Fig. 8.12 is the representative of such bridges. This style is to bring the bridge
					into environmental manipulation to the max, as you wander through the city streets,
					wander through the bridge of time, can fail to feel its presence. This to us contemporary
					designers are inspiring, true, bridge is an important node of the traffic system,
					functionally road system spanning barrier tool for city bridge, but, in fact, it
					is part of the cultural landscape of the city, and not specific, not isolated from
					the bridge in the city outside the city, but to consider it as a part of the human
					living environment. 



Fig. 8.12 The Rialto Bridge (Venice). 

					2. Near-modern City Bridges 

(a) Near-modern Time World-wide Urban Bridges 

					The 1760, industrial revolution changed the world. First European industrialisation,
					mechanisation and production industry is one of the main characteristics of industrialisation,
					it necessitates a more effective means of transport and transport systems. Between
					1883~1885, the automobile was invented, in the 1920, of the 20th century, Germany,
					and Italy led the rise of the highway-building craze, 30 European countries built
					many roads and bridges , United States followed suit. Industrialisation pursues mass
					production and high efficiency, and does not tolerate any "non-economic" operation,
					as an element in the landscape image of the bridge architecture requirements are
					considered to be "uneconomic", and thus is not desirable, which even continues until
					today. Relative to roads and bridges, some of the urban bridges of that era, due
					to decoration of its special significance and be strong to ensure the architectural
					heritage of the bridge, which is the fashion of its representative works in United
					Kingdom London Tower Bridge and France's Alexandria III bridge. We here in United
					Kingdom London Tower Bridge Fig. 8.13, for example, to see bridge construction works
					of art of the 19th century, Pont Alexander III bridge will tell you in the decorative
					section. 



Fig. 8.13 Tower Bridge in London (United Kingdom). 

					Tower Bridge is the first bridge from mental arithmetic on the River Thames. Its
					designer was the London architects Horace Jones and Wolfe Barry. The bridge was originally
					designed to establish a principle: new bridge must be integrated into the surrounding
					environment, so that the old palace and adjacent to the "London" maintain the harmony
					of stone castle, Tower Bridge hence got its name. Designer use rebel bridge was designed
					so that it reflected in the environment of conflict beautiful, but kept the echoes
					on the environment. Tower Bridge is a double layer of dual-use Bridge, lower level
					is a bascule bridge, upper level is fixed footbridge Within one month of the initial
					navigation, Tower Bridge opening or closing a total 655 times, it also alludes to
					the Thames at that time flourishing. The construction of this bridge meaning has
					gone far beyond its functional needs, but it has been recognised as enjoying London
					City and the River Thames best place for scenery, the bridge itself into the local
					environment, became classics in the history of the bridge. 

					Represented by the beautiful Tower Bridge and Pont Alexandre III bridge, urban bridge
					is not a brief appearance in modern bridge engineering history. With the growing
					deterioration of the urban environment of industrialisation, people start to care
					about living environment, build the new landscape of thought of nature conservation-oriented.
					In 1863, United States officially presented the landscape designers and landscape
					design represented by Olmsted, landscape design courses was offered in 1900, in Harvard.
					Bridge as an artificial landscape elements, judging from the sense of Visual beauty,
					also received attention. In 1936, fulici·laianghate and Kaer·shexitele of Germany
					jointly published the bridge shape, according to his request, the 1978, International
					bridge engineering society created the "structural engineering aesthetics" task force,
					to the attention of the world to promote bridge aesthetics, 1984 book bridge publication
					of architecture and style. Japan starting in 1930s-40s and the 80s, published the
					"Guide to aesthetic bridge design", "bridge modeling" and other writings. New bridge
					aesthetics is gradually taking shape, broadens the design idea to generally raise
					the level of bridge construction and design, emerge and can be comparable with the
					predecessor bridge design and innovative newbridge laid the Foundation of. Modern
					bridge image features can be summarised as follows: 


						simple, slender, smooth, bright; 

						respect for the natural environment, pay attention to the overall effect; 

						remarkable creative effect; 

						detailed delicacy, modest decoration. 


(b) The Development of Modern Chinese Urban Bridge 

					Since reform and opening up, advance the urbanisation process and building a well-off
					society in China, infrastructure construction of China development by leaps and bounds,
					size around urban bridge construction has made rapid development, showing construction
					boom of urban bridge. Here, only few mega-cities in China as an example to explain
					China's bridge history and today. 

					• Beijing Development and Evolution of Urban Bridges 

					Beijing's urban area, although not wide, deep rivers, but as the capital of China's
					city construction started early, traffic large bridge main complex of overpass bridge,
					across the city line, light rail viaduct, and is very good for easing Beijing's busy
					urban transport. With the construction of ring road in Beijing and other cities,
					rapid development of traffic engineering, construction of urban bridge both in terms
					of size and quality is impressive. I will cite several bridges: built-in 1986, over
					the Yongding river daning reservoir the yongding River Bridge, 1120 m, is Beijing's
					longest river-crossing bridge, the project won the national quality engineering AG
					in 1991, Beijing Guang an men used pre-stressed concrete, reinforced concrete and
					other forms of interchange and supports different bridge, bridge area of about 21000
					m2, a breakthrough in structural design of special-shaped slab; completed in 2001,
					North Beijing city ring road, all 147 bridges, bridge area of 485,000 m2; in October,
					2003 designed to complete the ring road of Beijing has interchange 55 seats, of which
					12 large interchange, Bridge 11, line 259 bridges and bridge area of 694,000 m2.
					At the end of 2007, Beijing has built a variety of interchange over more than 400,
					but said China's largest number. 

					In recent years in Beijing area in the city of new type of bridge design and construction,
					have made the leap-style development: for example, Beijing BeijingChengde highway
					in Beijing success in Chaobai river built a cable stayed bridge with low pylon; built
					internally in qinghe bridge line Subway Line 5 a curved cable stayed bridge; in the
					Changping District of South Central bridge built Asia's first self-anchored suspension
					bridge. In the design concept also has a new improvement, in construction of urban
					bridge the application of new materials, new technology, new technology has taken
					a solid step forward. 

					• Shanghai Development and Evolution of Urban Bridges 

					Talking about Shanghai's urban construction will naturally link to a few big names:
					Nanpu bridge and Yangpu bridge. In 1970s-80s, Shanghai in large-span bridge construction
					has been at the forefront of domestic, such as the construction of 1982, Shanghai
					China's first cable-stayed bridge in Hongkong—MaoHarbour Bridge. At Shanghai railway
					station after construction of cable-stayed bridges—near Shanghai hengfeng Lu bridge.
					In the 1990s, the Shanghai Huangpu river has built a world-class city bridges, nanpu
					bridge and Yangpu bridge, Xupu bridge and Lupu bridge, and so on. 

					• Development and Evolution of Tianjin Urban Bridges 

					Tianjin is located in the North China plain, Bohai Sea coast, Haihe river system
					downstream of the river confluence to the sea, commonly known as Tianjin as "nine
					rivers converge", Canal-dense, well-developed, in the North of China, history is
					the construction of a bridge across a river upto the city of Tianjin. Up to 1948,
					urban area a total of 72 bridges across the river, of which: 6 steel bridges, reinforced
					concrete bridge 19, Woodbridge 46, brick bridge 1, however, the Haihe river, North
					Canal and South Canal, Ziya river, xinkai 5 major rivers in the urban areas of rivers
					with a length of 38 km consists of only 12 bridges, urban river 14 km only 4 of the
					Haihe River Bridge, and the majority of major bridge projects contracted by foreign
					companies, technology held in the hands of foreigners. Among them, the gold steel
					bridges, Jintang bridge, Jiefang bridge, and the bridge of Jinhua 4 for open-type
					steel bridge, with the exception of Jiefang bridge which was still open in the 1960s,
					others have been replaced by fixed bridges, due to the river of Tianjin, little bridges,
					railway, resulting in the river crossing Difficulty, railroad difficulty, causing
					serious consequences for urban traffic.

					In 1949, after the liberation of Tianjin, with the development of Tianjin's economic
					self-reliance built a massive bridge Table 8.1. Especially since the 1980s after
					the introduction of reform and opening up, great changes have taken place in bridge
					construction on the technology and scale. In order to improve urban transport in
					order to meet the needs of economic construction, Tianjin has newly built and re-built
					many important bridges. Especially in the Haihe river in Tianjin, gradually building
					the Lion Bridge, North Andover Plaza bridge, chifeng light bridge and the Guanghua
					bridge. These are all concrete bridge, built-in the 1970, of the 20th century and
					80 respectively. Old bridge renovation project including the 1991, Liu Zhuangqiao
					and King Kong Bridge in 1996. 

					Tianjin haihe bridges mostly built before in the mid 1980, of the 20th century on,
					more Jintang bridge, built in 1906, Jiefang bridge, built in 1927. Due to the existing
					bridge built for a long time, limited to the political and economic condition, its
					simple structure and low load, and due to the settlement of the business for many
					years, most no longer meets planning navigation requirements as well as Haihe economic
					development consistent with the objectives, in particular, highlight the landscape
					design requirements. For the penetration of these issues to be resolved at the end
					, existing bridges need to be rebuilt or reconstructed. 

					As the river of nine rivers converge, has given birth to this beautiful city and
					formed and continues to be enriched its culture, history and cultural heritage. For
					connecting the city of Tianjin Haihe River Bridge construction pioneer leagues has
					become the natural places of great players. Silent love of the Haihe River, witnessing
					the history of bridge construction of Tianjin. From the late 19th century, on the
					Haihe river in Tianjin began building various bridges. Bridge structure evolved from
					the original forms into meeting the needs of urban development and function. From
					the design concept, the bridge construction is no longer content merely to function,
					but constant attention to coordination with the urban landscape. Construction of
					the Haihe River Bridge, one must take full account of the city's master plan, and
					look at haihe economic development closely, and with a new design creating a modern
					city environment. Tianjin Haihe economic development, Tianjin Haihe bridge planned
					to form a complete set of system. 

					According to the current construction of Haihe River Bridge, can be divided into
					the following two categories: 


						Both the re-construction of the old bridge of the Haihe river, including retrofit
						and bridge repair and reinforcement of concrete bridges; Concrete bridge reconstruction
						include: Lion Bridge, Guanghua bridge and North bridge, bridge of light; Open repair
						and reinforcement of the bridge include: Jintang bridge, Jiefang bridge. 

						The new bridge on the river, including: Dagu bridge and Fenghua, Chifeng, Bengbu
						bridge, Ji Zhaoqiao bridge, and so on. 


					8.2 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF URBAN BRIDGE—GENERAL DESCRIPTION 

Unlike most products, the architecture presents space while being felt as an entire
						environment. Design tasks are comprehensive and specific, it has both shaped and
						invisible, and this makes things complicated. In order to create an effective building,
						designers need to process spatial form with three interrelated functions: use, material
						relating to the activities and the symbolic needs. Requirement for designers is to
						group multiple properties of a building together, in order to meet these requirements,
						and the collection should be optimized. 

T. y. Lin, "the concept and system structure" 

					We might as well apply this concept to the design of urban bridge with this interpretation:
					urban bridges is a structure, while itself produces an environment, which is an integral
					part of the urban landscape. Bridge design process is about the overall concept ,
					and detailed local, it not only in structural engineering, but also in architectural
					aesthetics, which puts the ideas into a complex systematic engineering of bridge
					design. In order to complete a good piece of work, the designer must bridge structure
					with three interrelated functions: functions, constraints and aesthetic requirements.
					Bridge designer is required to use structural and architectural aesthetics and other
					means to meet these three requirements, and optimize it, i.e., a bridge's indicators
					of "safety, utility, economy and beauty" are optimal. 

					Thus, to form a good design solution, you need to use advanced design ideas and new
					technologies, new processes, and fully understand concept and system structure, and
					not only can accurately calculate and analyze a given structure and components. Today,
					only in accordance with a program training designers does not go far enough, because
					the very fast pace of development in the world today, because no one wants to be
					left behind. Students of architectural or structural design can not only learn a
					few traditional skills and be done, on the contrary, they must be taught to appreciate
					and use new technology, the best method is to use innovations in design. Designs
					are a process of discovering problem, problem analysis and problem-solving process,
					design form is one of the results of this process, it does not exist outside this
					process independently and therefore they cannot be indulged in "forms". If you will
					only rely on the specification, design manuals, computer programs used by traditional
					design, especially in integrated computer program comprehensive application today,
					learned college as they get older can lead to the loss of learned concepts, let alone
					innovate designs. 

					In this chapter, we try to think in terms of analysis and creation of urban bridge
					design activities, is because the thinking of the world completeness and depth of
					the grip is unmatched by anything else. Perhaps the same designer of the bridge varies,
					but thinking is the subject reflects the object of relatively stable forms, depending
					on the value objective of designers, psychological characteristics and cultural traditions,
					knowledge structure and professional basis. During the course of the conceptual design
					of urban bridge, design thinking is exactly what we need the most. 

					Construction of the bridge, is closely related to socio-economic development; throughout
					the history of bridges in the world, is an ancient bridge outstanding practicality
					to focus on aesthetic effects of modern as well as contemporary bridges and landscape
					history of the transition with the surrounding environment. In this case, an increasing
					number of newly built bridge highlights the features of the new bridge, structure
					diversification, focusing on the surrounding environment coordination has become
					the development trend of the new bridge. In recent years, urban bridge has received
					more and more attention, it is due to the construction of bridges in the city, reflecting
					the more styling variety, more attention to expressions of landscape. Therefore,
					at conceptual design of urban bridge how to apply advanced design idea, what ideas,
					become the primary issue facing a bridge designer. 

					What we say here "concept design", refers to the bridge design's initial conception
					stage, overall layout of how to set up layout, how to carry out the overall concept
					of the process. At this stage, bridge designer must have knowledge and hard work,
					meticulous, use deduction and conscious, positive towards advice of the partners
					and owners. any decision on bridge structure in conceptual design phase will have
					the rational, economic, aesthetic effects on bridge structure. We perform "concept
					design" with the ultimate goal being to provide the most complete and efficient technical
					solutions, but in general design phase, should grasp the overall design concept of
					avoiding ideas received numerous details of the disturbance. In fact, whether you
					can distinguish the fundamental elements from many details is an important factor
					dertermining if he could successfully complete the design. 

					A case study of dagu bridge in Tianjin Haihe river, at the start of the design, we
					must first understand the design requirements, can be summarised as follows: 


Functional requirements: bi-directional 6 traffic lanes, 4 m wide sidewalks on each
						side. 

Restrictions: maximum permissible longitudinal gradient of bridge deck 3.5%; Under
						the bridge navigation clearance requirements limit the maximum height of main span
						beams shall not exceed 1.3 m; Cannot be set in the Haihe River Bridge, determines
						the span of dagu bridge is 106 m; For soft foundation of bridge site. 

Landscape: landscape on the Haihe river with a special sign on the building. 


					Function, the restrictive conditions and landscape aspects, covering almost all bridge
					design requirements, designers is the concept of rational use of structure and aesthetics,
					in meeting the above requirements based on the finished design tasks, and try to
					achieve "security, utility, economy and beauty" optimal configuration. Dagu bridge
					is built, not only strengthened the Haihe river transport links, and became part
					of Tianjin City landscape, and thus by virtue of its excellent design and landscape,
					becomes when landmark buildings. 

					So, designers is how to do it? I think that to successfully complete a design work,
					science must be and intuition and deduction and induction are perfectly combined
					to design around it. Indeed, for any design, regardless of how perfect the theory,
					based on ideas of how mature, inevitably there will be numerous subjective concept
					design, as a bridge designer, you will always have the opportunity to structure their
					own unique ideas into practical projects to, and may also melt into the idea of art
					and aesthetics, and achieve the combination of art and technology, this is the charm
					of design. Scientists could very well do their job without having to care about how
					artists think; the artist may or may not need theories of the scientists will be
					able to creations, but is not so simple for designers, they have to pay attention
					to scientific and artistic effects. Here, although it is not possible only through
					text drove home for the conceptual design of urban bridge, but this is not going
					to give talk about some vague concept, but how to deeply explore issues in structural
					engineering and architecture learn two ways to carry out the conceptual design of
					urban bridge. 

					8.3 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF URBAN BRIDGE—STRUCTURE AND ENGINEERING 

					In the bridge design process, many advanced design ideas are often through conceptual
					design to materialize. Want to finish any good works, cannot be fully implemented
					in accordance with an established procedure. We emphasise that a bridge engineer's
					main tasks are under certain qualifying conditions, apply concepts to design the
					structure of the programme as a whole, creatively to achieve optimal structures to
					meet the requirements of owners. The following content, largely through explain the
					structure of urban bridge engineering unique places, to further elaborate the ideas
					of conceptual design, as well as how to troubleshoot creative use of urban bridge
					design. 

					8.3.1 Choice of Urban Bridge Style 

					There are several types of urban bridge: urban city pedestrian bridges, overpasses,
					viaducts and bridges, this kind of bridge concept and characteristics of design point
					of view, relative to the road and bridge of urban bridge is obviously special nature.
					However, our common design tasks, tend to be some of the more common jump or cross-river
					bridge, these general bridges exist in cities and rural area. So, for general bridge
					in the city, how during the conceptual design phase, that is, i.e., general design
					stage, to form the best design solutions to meet the functional and aesthetic needs?
					

					We simply Comb through a design process, when we received a design task, starting
					with early work usually manifested in gathering information and compiling feasibility
					study report and then the familiar conceptual design, preliminary design, construction
					drawing design. So, at a time when sufficient information is gathered, we entered
					a phase of general layout design. At the time, we must start from the functional
					requirements, technical conditions, ecological environmental protection, visual images,
					viewing conditions and other aspects of the co-ordination, we immediately faced the
					task of bridge scheme selection. 

					1. Basic Bridge and its Development Characteristics 

					We take a look at, exactly what are the forms of bridges: 


						according to the purpose, there are a road bridge, a railway bridge, the road-railway
						bridge, bridge, pedestrian bridges, aqueducts, as well as other special bridges beam
						(such as through the pipes, cables, etc.). 

						by the main materials: wooden, steel bridges, masonry bridges, reinforced concrete
						and pre-stressed reinforced concrete bridge. 

						according to the structure, warping, arch, bridge, cable-supported bridge (suspension
						bridges and cable-stayed bridge) systems. 

						by the cross form: fixed bridge, a bascule bridge, floating, submersible bridge etc.
						


					In these four classifications, classification of structural systems for designers
					is the most important, and bridge engineering design process, its soul is in the
					organisation of structures. The previous 3.3 (bridge type and applicability of the
					foundation), we have compared the shape of bridge structures with detailed description,
					here is only for simple review. 

(a) The Form of the Basic Structure of Modern Bridge 


Beam bridge: Beam bridge bear pre-dominantly vertical loads which produce bending
						moments and shear forces, the basic forms include plate girders, box beams and girders.
						

Arch bridge: Arch bridge is a bearing structure with compression arch or arches as
						the main components , its basic structure include non-hinge arch and single-hinge
						arch and double-hinged arch, generally span less than 200 m or 300 m. 

The cable-supported Bridge: The original suspension bridge after a lengthy development
						process and evolved into today's cable-supported bridge of the most basic structural
						forms of suspension bridges. Relative to the other basic bridge forms, suspension
						bridge spanning the most, generally upto 1500 m. 


(b) Characteristics of Modern Bridge Structure Development 

					Bridge in its development process in three categories new form have emerged based
					on the basic forms, and alongwith the winning elimination of inferior quality, natural
					selection, survival of the fittest rules. Material development as a precondition
					for development, has always run through the bridge structure the development process
					all the time. 

					• Development of Beam Bridge 

					Introducing pre-stress is the most important element in concrete bridges development,
					and the knowledge of premature damage due to salt damage of concrete materials, neutralisation.
					Alkali-aggregate reaction, freezing and thawing, and other dameges, "the concrete
					maintenance free" is a thing of the past, we were forced to begin research on a variety
					of measures to prolong the service life of concrete bridge deck. 

					• Development of Arch Bridge 

					In the development process of Arch Bridge, two-hinged arch, single-hinged arch soon
					exited the competition stage, hingeless arch with better use performance and stress
					performance get more attention. The beginning of 20th century, there has been a tie-bar
					offset thrust of arch tied arch bridge, which can be either geological conditions
					for thrust arch bridge, which greatly expand the scope of application of the arch.
					Similarly, arch bridge has a certain applicable span. 

					• Development of Suspension Bridge 

					Suspension bridge development is mainly reflected in span increasing, and this process
					is credited with the following research: theory of computation march wind tunnel
					test on wind-resistant stability of theoretical research and technological advances;
					stable development of high strength steel wire. To date, the completed suspension
					bridge with the maximum span is Japan stone bridge, 1991 m. Messina Strait bridge
					under construction in Italy has a span of 3300 m. 

					• Cable-stayed Bridge 

					Cantilever construction of cable-stayed bridges due to the suit, tower shape and
					the shape diversify their tall beautiful model, various parts reasonable strength,
					quickly spread the word to come out, this is also the most successful in the history
					of bridge structure models. So far the built cable-stayed bridge with the largest
					Span length is China's Su Tong Yangtze River Bridge, a main span of 1088 m, exceeds
					1000 m. 

					• Beam, Arch and Cable Combined System 

					In the history of the bridge, people never gave up on the rational use of the mechanical
					properties of beams, arches, cables, seeking greater span, and achieve better economic
					performance and innovation. Such as beam-arch composite, cable-tower-beam, even cable-arch-beam
					composite, and so on. Today, dozens of such bridges have been built around the world,
					spanning between the abilities of continuous beam bridge with cable-stayed bridge,
					and can be mixed beams (cross-beams for the PC beam intermediate supports) to extend
					its span. The representing bridges including Japan mucengchuan bridge (hybrid, long
					160 m + 3 × 275 m + 160 m), China's Wuhu Yangtze River Bridge (steel truss girders,
					span 180 m + 360 m + 180 m). 

					• Novel Bridge Structure 


						cable-stayed bridge without backstays, arched bridge pylon, sailing pylon of cable-stayed
						bridges, curves and broken line pylon of cable-stayed bridges, bridge tower positionedon
						the side of a curved cable-stayed bridges, cable surface arrangement of cable-stayed
						bridges and cable-stayed arch bridge; 

						single rib oblique arched bridges, latticed arch bridges, arch bridge without spandrel,
						fish-shaped arch, Arch Butterfly arch and lattice configuration and petal-shaped
						connection system, straight, arched bridges, flat space, rotate to arch, the arch
						shell bridge and fish-shaped truss bridge; 

						curved bridge tower suspension bridge, suspension bridge with curved cable layout,
						suspension bridge, suspension bridge and arch combination system; 

						bionic bridge: fish-shaped bridge, swan bridge, bridge of shells, butterflies, dinosaurs
						and the Sun and the arch of the bridge, and so on. 


					2. Traditional Bridge Type Selection 

					Earlier, we give a general illustration on selection of bridge type, you can choose
					the old form, or you can select a new form, select the base type, or you can select
					a derived type. However, when in the face of the specific design problems, which
					one to choose is not a simple task. We try to seek answers from textbooks, in many
					traditional textbooks, bridge type selection method is often described like this
					

					First of all, carefully determine the bridge span, especially the span of the main
					span. Bridge engineering conditions, such as topography, terrain, geology, water
					text, navigation (or line), may have their own span requirements, should be based
					on the maximum span as required by various factors must meet the designed main span.
					This should be based on design for long-span must be met, according to adjustment
					of upper and lower parts of the economy as a whole selection of bridge span, and
					according to the to select the type of bridge. The smaller the span, the more options,
					and vice-versa. 

					Then, implement the "safety, utility, economy and beauty" principle, according to
					different conditions of bridge span, select the appropriate bridge type, from the
					point of view, and continuous system of pre-stressed concrete bridge should be preferred,
					and the design process as far as possible the use of new technologies, new materials
					and new techniques. 

					Traditional bridge type selection, can be summarised as follows: the span selected
					for the pilot, backed by four principles, sound bridge programme selection. This
					idea, ingrained in almost all the bridges in the designer's head, guides us to design.
					May be you didn't notice, this modern, industrial design and its appearance is only
					two hundred or three hundred years ago something, maybe you never doubted the correctness
					of this bridge type selection, and even as a designer, you do not fully understand
					the true meaning of this option. Engineer's approach is generally motivated by economics,
					practical considerations, generally receive the design has a very strict time limit,
					as in today's society when the bridge became a mass product, engineer work tends
					to be limited to a standard procedure, and will bring them to find readymade solutions.
					

					About 100 years ago or 80 years ago, bridges slowly become industrialised, with advances
					in engineering, bridge more and more possession and control, community lost interest
					in the bridge, construction of the bridge is no longer a risky business. After the
					second world war, people had to re-build road and rail networks after the war, and
					later developed into our modern transportation systems in large industrial bridge
					engineers become anonymous partner. Since reform and opening up, China's construction
					of the bridge has undergone a never before process of rapid development, bridge construction
					are impressive in terms of its scale and the number, form a thriving scene. In such
					a large bridge construction, formed a mature set of bridge design and construction
					technology for simply-supported girder bridge and continuous girder bridge, continuous
					rigid-frame bridge, x-style arch bridge, bridge of concrete-filled steel tube arch
					bridge type, such as developing very quickly, almost every classic bridge all land
					in China is furiously copying, in this process, the choices and the importance of
					appearance, usually lag behind practical consideration. 

					Nowadays people are fully aware of all the artificial, the cultural landscape is
					formed by relying on technological progress has its advantages and disadvantages.
					Germany master qiaoge·xilasi structure: "design today, only a functional purpose,
					doesn't care about the overall effect. Most to be proud of, especially after the
					industrial revolution in the 1960, of the 20th century, including many name loud,
					for which our eyes shiny structures, today has been monotonous and awkward structure
					in place. At that time, a bridge across the streets and a railroad the bridge, in
					terms of materials or forms are not the same, a city bridge with a broad rural bridge
					is often different. Now all the bridges are similar to simple, clumsy, drab box-shaped
					components constitute the primary beam consists of pre-cast elements or, beam is
					equipped with vertical and horizontal blocks, beams supported on a flat base. In
					long-span variable depth beams. The upper structure applies to all types of piers
					and are interchangeable. "Production of this factory, the bulk of the bridge, on
					a highway, appeared to be relatively affordable, but if it is in the city is terrible,
					as if the whole city was packed with stands one track, match-box-like skyscrapers,
					bark beetles of the technological advances become eroded people's living environment,
					the whole city landscape slowly become alienated, eventually forming the environmentally
					indifferent city. Therefore, we rejected in the city similar to simple quantification
					production of bridges, this doesn't mean that they should pursue bridge forms of
					quirky and weird, but that buildings and structures, our consumer resource consumption
					at the expense of constructed living space, we want to work with city bridge is closely
					related to our daily life can be reflected history and culture, rather than an industrial
					product. 

					City bridge due to its regional restrictions, more medium and small span across line
					across the river bridge, bridge types to choose from more flexibility in the design
					of the structure also provides a larger space. Here, we present a view that: "the
					city of bridges beam bridge type selection is more than just a traffic problem, cannot
					and highway bridges for mass production and cannot be rigidly fixed or mechanical
					way of thinking, but using a more flexible design to create a more reasonable characteristics
					better suited to urban environments structure parameters." 

					In contrast, traditional bridge type selection thinking has its drawbacks, it's really
					easy to understand, because, "the bridge type selection" statement in itself limits
					the designer's thinking, we do a bridge is designed to be organised structure to
					overcome obstacles, hard at the concept design stage in beam bridges, arch bridges,
					Suo Fuqiao, choosing one of the bridges, they will amount to "form", and put into
					the habitual thinking, resulting in monotony of the bridge form. In the dilemma in
					the planning principles and authors mentioned Ritter: "Problem-solving skills a lot,
					one solution is don't be too quick to be restricted to a certain range." In the UK
					architects bulaien·laosen, also mentioned in the monographs of the design thinking:
					"designer constraints relative to other sources of constraints flexible (designer
					constraint refers to the habitual thinking in the design process itself, such as
					constraint). If constraint caused too much difficulty, or difficult to achieve, the
					designer can be freely adjusted or reformulated constraints. Design students often
					did not recognize realize the simple truth, tend to think it should cost a lot of
					intelligence in an attempt to resolve many self-inflicted that could not be overcome.
					Designers need to acquire skills, is able to use a critical eye to evaluate and analyse
					their own design restraint." So, in our design of urban bridge, to review the applicability
					of traditional bridge type selection. 

					3. Urban Bridge Structure Design 

					City bridge span is small, if only technically, to implement it across a city bridge
					features in the works highly developed today, it is relatively easy to do, because
					our predecessors left a lot of off-the-shelf solutions, in this days a lot of the
					design sector, even in large quantities using standard image to complete the design.
					In the field of bridge design, there is such a saying, is a new bridge design, at
					least a decade to get out because the bridge complex, to various forms of bridges
					do come here, accumulating enough experience, about a decade's time. With today's
					highly developed computer-aided technology, many early designers of the bridge involved
					had the feeling that bridge is so easy to do, because the calculation of the structure
					of bridges with large engineering software is not difficult. As a designer of bridges,
					what are we doing? Is the accumulation of various forms of bridges, is a readymade
					analysis and calculation of structures? Today, many bridge engineers design look
					too simple. 

					Design is a process of discovering, analysing and solving problems. Some structural
					engineers may be calculated reinforcement design for main girder. In practice, however,
					to say the least, the process is almost entirely mechanical: use one or some formulas,
					in drawing up the size (textbook in the proposed rule a decision) into the, value
					generation beams subjected to loading in, needed much reinforcement even came out,
					and this is our concrete structure design course at university have learned. This
					process is the essence of "computing" instead of "analysis", in fact, does not call
					it "design", although these powers in the detail ties frame processing is necessary.
					Specific details are different, conceptual design of bridges, in a structural conception
					of first-order paragraphs is the best design ideas. City bridge, the owners and the
					public often has a relatively high standard of requirements and, therefore, our expectations
					for its is not confined to arrive at a solution, but was more of an aesthetic, humanistic,
					urban taste as well as cultural and historical heritage, and so on. 

					Karl Kraus said: "the artist is the only solution that will have people to challenge."
					Bridge Master Dr. Man-Chung Tang also said: "the bridge is an art. Art is flexible
					and engineering also flexible. To meet the established functional requirements of
					the bridge, one can have a lot of different choices in appearance, structure. This
					flexibility gives engineers the creation and the new space. Because engineers rely
					on, not just the scientific truth, more important is to implement and use the scientific
					truth of wisdom and the experience accumulated in the practice of engineering. Engineering
					guidelines are not a matter of right or wrong, but rather can or cannot. "Obviously,
					in urban bridge design ideas using structural art concept is very important. In the
					first article, referred to in the general layout of the city bridges is located the
					timing, the use of traditional bridge type selection is abusive, which tends to make
					the design process flow in programming and design work tends to be "form", so how
					can we deal with it? How do you achieve structural art? We try to make the following
					views: 

					In conceptual design of bridges in the city, the design idea is: the bridge pattern
					is determined by "need". In city bridge design process, explore each due to the specific
					design of " demand" caused by design problems and solutions and reflecting the specific
					characteristics of the bridge, and originality of design. Actually referred to here
					is the design of the "common sense", rather than a profound thing. Because the design
					can be interpreted as: "Design is a particular condition, meeting the needs of all
					genuine best practices". Design Needless to say is a very complex maybe that "design"
					seems too general outlines the definition of. First, the "specific conditions" refers
					to the designer constraints limiting conditions encountered during the design process,
					concern asked problem is, in many cases, these constraints are limiting conditions
					is not clear. Secondly, all "real demand" does not enumerate out early in the design
					stage, not all design issues are for specific purposes. 

					Again, the "best practice" is often difficult to determine, the success of the design
					results, very little can be done in a setting of standards to adhere to our way of
					thinking about the question: since the classic bridge-tied our design thinking, we
					might as well go back to bridging the last step is "design" from the original "requirements"
					set out to craft our structure, we need to is a kind of "structure of thinking",
					rather than a series of models. In sculpture, for example, if it is a factory production
					of stone lions, it is charged its just a product, but from the hands of masters,
					and carved into their feelings for the re-creation can become a work of art. 

					The design concept that "Bridge structure form is decided by" "need" is not the negation
					of traditional bridge type selection method, on the contrary, it they are interlinked.
					However, engineers have to bridge some understanding of how choices are one-sided,
					used according to bridge span to select the type of bridge, but, in fact, never had
					any articles point out that, for a functional set of bridges, what kind of bridge
					type is best suited. Bridges in the form depends primarily on the number of "needs",
					namely: construction cost, construction materials, transport, worker technical, aesthetic
					and other factors. 

					Bridge is in the form of the ever-changing and basic form of warping, arched bridges,
					cable-stayed bridge, suspension bridge, but the bridge option is not is select from
					one of these bridge types, then apply some classic bridge and be done, we need to
					open our minds, not only bridge in the form of ever-changing, why should we get bogged
					down in "form", we can according to organisation frame form to meet the actual needs.
					

					During the process of our knowledge, to learn how to "in" and "out", can we have
					a critical distance, the independent thinking. On bridge form selection, "entry"
					refers to is that our predecessors left the classic bridge, carefully studied analysis
					of mechanical characteristics of fully understanding these bridge, applicability
					and functionality advantages; " Get out of the" is referring to, from a bystander
					point of view, from a large scale to measure the accumulation of history, a classic
					bridge. Many of those world class bridge works today still have remarkable features,
					but this is only in the knowledge level, unable to graft it onto that bridge today.
					However, we can try to transform yourself into the role of bridge master, exploring
					them when designing bridges when thinking, design work is definitely not plagiarism
					imitations of them, there is no question that, and so on, repeated exercises our
					ability to think, to form their own structure of thinking, utilizing today's designs,
					is the right way to learn. How to use mechanical concepts in design of urban bridge,
					forming excellent structure, the bridge will be reflected in what the kind of structure,
					will be discussed in the next section. 

					3. Urban Bridge Structure Characteristics 

					At the beginning of this chapter, I cited "Millennium footbridge" example, built
					to mark the new Millennium Memorial Bridge, it was focus from big-span highway bridge,
					moved to more closely related to humans on the pedestrian bridge, and use a very
					flexible construction technique, done plenty of bridge works of artistic value. Similarly,
					in recent years, its urban bridge modeling concepts such as variety, emphasis on
					landscape, reflecting the characteristics of many different from traditional bridges.
					Germany architecture master Douglas said: "each compatible with the ultimate goal
					of building were filed and, therefore, each engaged in structural design engineer
					is an inventor. Scientists found that what was already there, and engineers are always
					inventing new things. But very regrettably, many engineers rarely or never use them.
					" In the previous section, we talked about the bridge's structural design, is to
					tell you, city bridge design to its specific objectives in order to meet the needs
					of all aspects of this design idea will lead us to be the kind of structure? The
					content that is discussed in this section. 

(a) The Development Direction of Urban Bridges 

					For architects, and implementation is often the biggest challenge of building height,
					long-span under specific conditions but bridge's first challenge, like the height
					of skyscrapers, load history is that the growing length of the bridge. In the 20th
					century of large-span bridges landmark buildings are: 


						A main span of 1991, m of Japan Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, the steel suspension bridge
						(advanced technology of deep water Foundation, advanced technology, super cable design,
						structure control technology); 

						A main span of 1624 m of Denmark the sea with Bridge, the steel suspension bridge
						(advanced technology and advanced design of deep-water Foundation construction technology.
						

						Cross 890 m of Japan more luoqiao, steel cable-stayed bridge (side span for concrete
						structures); 

						Cross 856 m of France the Normandy bridge, steel cable-stayed bridge (side span for
						concrete structures, hybrid cable-stayed bridge, advanced pyramid structures, towers
						and girder construction side by example, using structural control technologies, welded
						box-section). 


					In the last decade of the 20th century, we have witnessed more than a few record
					span bridge construction, each of them is a sign of progress of bridge engineering.
					In China, in the years late in the 1990, of the 20th century and the 21st century
					began, China bridge both in scale and pace, have made a spectacular achievement.
					Today, China remained the world's record of longest bridges: Donghai bridge is the
					longest cross-sea bridge. Meanwhile, we should also see, China is in the midst of
					reform and opening up economic takeoff stage of development and infrastructure advances,
					although the scale and pace of the construction of the bridge in the world is the
					leading, But that doesn't mean China bridge technology to achieve world class standards,
					our most developed in the 1960, of the 20th century, the creation of new materials,
					new technology and new structure, we just got done with people decades ago have already
					done. For world records, Chinese-American doctor of man-Chung Tang was said long
					ago: "I don't think we should spend extra money to Genesis records, and great efforts
					should be made to design beautiful, technologically advanced bridge. Break the world
					record does not make sense, and is a beautiful bridges, high quality is always excellent
					achievements of the monument." 

					In the wake of modernism, bridges has appeared in two: the first is bridges and complex
					advanced modern technology links and tend to bring bridge to engineering Kingdom
					bridge another tendency is viewed as a system of cultural meaning, the bridge beam
					shapes generated as a result of the cultural connotation of the ingenious interpretations
					to explain the significance of structural form, the pursuit of cultural performances
					and continuation. In terms of engineering, developed almost all the innovation in
					raw technology that China, as a developing country lags behind developed countries
					in the process of technology development and need further efforts to shorten the
					gap in culture, due to the developed infrastructure is complete, scale and pace of
					the construction of the bridge has reached a stable development stage, bridge designers
					began to focus more on the bridge of cultural understanding, Spain engineer Santiago
					caratera watts is particularly prominent in this area. In China, is now at a stage
					of rapid development infrastructure, and so-called "food will often eat, and then
					for the United States; clothing will often warm, and then seek Hali; Chang an Habitat
					will then seek music," Chinese bridge on building size and number and taken get extraordinary
					results, but beautiful bridge lags utility requirements, this is determined by the
					economic and social conditions in China. 

					In his book, published in 1991, the global bridge aesthetics, mentioned in the view:
					Bridge configuration should be designed under the maximum visual attraction to bear
					its loads. Some prominent bridge engineers and architects in the book of words very
					enlightening for us: 

					"The validity of performance and aesthetic structure so closely together, which is
					more difficult to determine in some sheer beautiful bridge and touch us in the creative
					impulses behind in structural engineering, whether it is dynamic or static structure
					of abstract aesthetics thought." 

					—De Miranda (Italy) 

					"As was the case as each crafts, a beautiful bridge of many aesthetic characteristics
					are represented in the form, to say that in the bridge designer of bridges could
					be granted in the form of a beautiful. Process for both sensitivity and technical
					capacity require form, because it does not do so, he cannot guarantee the realization
					of thought." 

					—Revelo (Mexico) 

					"In this regard, however, must be emphasised depending on project requirements, but
					with less changes or decorating attempts to improve appearance is set method of bridge
					and should be condemned in the strong wording. Only developed into a general idea
					of the main aesthetic design department in order to achieve kick-butt design. Therefore,
					there must be a full involvement of the architect, this, from the time envisaged
					by the basic forms are to begin." 

					—Liebenberg (South Africa). 

					Many writers argue that the global bridge aesthetics and bridge shape should not
					be in the form of load effects, regardless of its shape, while bridge shape should
					not be in the form of appearance, regardless of bridge load effect. Instead, the
					two main objectives and appearance, is not out to combine together, thus the choice
					of a certain specific forms of bridges from the design evolution and come, alternating
					and continuous consideration forms the design process in the functionality and appearance
					of the effect of two aspects of decision-making. Finally, at least in the designer's
					comments, two aspects of the design optimisation and thus will show up. Functionality
					and appearance of both determining form, bridge designers to ignore one or the other
					major goals, to be built in the wrong place at the wrong time, the wrong bridge.
					As Dr man-Chung Tang has mentioned: "beauty is not added on the structure of the
					decorations, but the philosophy throughout the design process. Function of a beautiful
					bridge should be natural, with simple structure, innovative design, and the environment
					harmony." 

(b) Design Requirements and Structure Characteristics of Urban Bridges 

					Mentioned earlier, the bridge as a tool of cultural expression, bridge of plastic
					art is a kind of urban bridges trend, this thought is represented by Spain engineer
					and architect Santiago. Calatrava. We are here as a case study of the architect's
					life and works, to experience the cutting edge concepts in the design of urban bridge
					design thought. 

					Santiago Calatrava is one of the most well-known and innovative architects, his voice
					and elegant and rich in the humanistic spirit generation of structural form, as well
					as controversial architect. He has a dual identity of engineers and architects, they
					are able to form and structure as a whole into account, resulting in a unique work,
					which works like a dynamic abstract sculptures, which he won the "poet of structure,"
					said. He designed bridges, world-famous for its sheer elegance of structure formation
					dynamics, showing the technique rational logic that can be rendered in the United
					States, and as the tie beyond the law of gravity and the structure. Because of his
					architect and engineer dual role, he has accurate grasp on the interaction between
					structural and architectural aesthetics. We use the master's works, to share experience
					of modern urban bridge structure. 



Fig. 8.14 The alamillo bridge. 

					• Alamillo Bridge (Fig. 8.14) 

					The bridge was built-in 1992, is located in Seville, Spain, across the Guadalquivir
					River, asymmetric, road inclined tower cable-stayed bridge without backstays, with
					sidewalks. It design is a bold, innovative, and the structure, architecture and sculpture
					merge into one. This bridge is the world's first large-span without back stay cable-stayed
					bridge. 

					Alamillo cable-stayed bridges overthrew the basic principle of achieving steady state
					balance through symmetry structure reaching balance in imbalance, obtaining the stable
					function of in instability, from deriving static dynamic image, not a sculpture but
					better than sculpture, as a levy geese coming into people's minds, nurture the movement
					in a blink. This was Calatrava is often used, he often places the structure forces
					the focus outside the structure, which under structure is static, stable, but always
					presented or fly or fall trends, leading to a strong sense of tension and inference.
					This approach are reflected in his work Europe Bridge Fig. 8.15, Millennium bridge,
					Ladeweisa bridge Fig. 8.16. 



Fig. 8.15 The European Bridge. 



Fig. 8.16 Ladeweisa pedestrian bridge. 

					• Barcelona Expo bridge (Bach de Roda-Felipe II Bridge) ( Fig. 8.17) 

					In 1984, Calatrava bridge is designed for the Barcelona Olympics, and in the design
					of the bridge, he adopted dissimilation and shaped policy. Arch bridge span 52 m
					bridge deck width of 25.8 m, the main arch ribs by the auxiliary arch enhanced ability
					to resist twisting and overturning of bridge. Auxiliary tilt inward arch ribs, short
					ribs connect to the main arch ribs and shoulder next to the sidewalk and step load.
					Ladder attached to the auxiliary arch, a natural product. Calatrava classic for this
					idea is that broke through horizontal linkages to resolve their two main arch ring
					of arch bridge stability of ask title law, and reflected in the symmetry of the whole
					bridge component of the master-slave relationship. Thus it can be seen by Santiago
					Calatrava bridges design of multifunctional form, integrated and coordinated approach.
					This programme has been successful in structural and cultural levels. The bridge
					created a recognised integrated aesthetics, sculpture and engineering characteristics
					of Calatrava style, meanwhile, also proves that karat lavoie the bridges works printed
					on the chic structure label. 

					• Milwaukee Footbridge (Fig. 8.18) 

					This bridge was built-in 2001, is located in United States, Wisconsin, Milwaukee
					Art Museum on one side with a main span of 73 m, as the leaning tower of cable-stayed
					bridges, Calatrava is in the United States's first work. The construction of this
					bridge is to connect the same was designed by Calatrava quadracci Pavilion with a
					local main road, the Lincoln Memorial drive. The building to direct people's attention
					to the new building up straight on the Gallery's main entrance. Cable-supported bridge
					in bridge forms the traditional vertical pylons, to draw out a striking entrance
					box. Due to the master of Calatrava on the load-bearing concrete structures, the
					white material of concrete pylons vividly underscores the forceful and strong temperament,
					all of a sudden the whole building character and inventory hold out. In 2001, by
					the United States on the times magazine's annual design list, Milwaukee Art Museum,
					were cited as the top. This bridge and art gallery received the 2004, International
					Association for bridge and structural engineering with outstanding structure Award.

					• Alameda Bridge (Fig. 8.19) 

					In Spain Valencia Alameda Bridge also present unfinished state, and giving the instability
					feeling. Bridges completed in between 1991-1995, deck include the 130 m of highway
					bridge surface and overhanging a pedestrian path. The oblique arch with an inclination
					of 70°, vaulting from the deck 14 m, main girder of steel box beam, arch steel boxes
					with a main span 130 m rise 14 m, overall length: 163 m, main beam 2.54 m, the width
					of 26.0 m. In cross section, oblique arches in bridges one side of the body, suspended
					walkways through its tilt balance bridge torque. Alameda Bridge used the suspension
					pick structure characteristics of arches within the law lined with sturdy steel tilt
					rod gives a sense of stability. The bridge and other bridges designed by Kara terraba
					are white, diffused sunlight makes suspender line in continuous changing shadows
					and give it vitality. Although the bridge has no Majesty spectacular vehemence, but
					its fresh, balanced structure shows the kind of gritty temperament. At this point,
					Calatrava arch-beam treatment preferences are revealed.

(c) Training of Structure Thinking 

					United Kingdom bulaien laosen in his book the design of famous architect thinking
					(How Design Think) said: "my experience in both teaching and research, convinced
					me of two things: First, all of us capable of designing and, secondly, through learning
					that we can better design. Indeed, as to how to do bridge design, probably it cannot
					be defined by the master or authoritative writings , because there is none of the
					so called standard and the standard answer to that question. All we can do is through
					learning and practice improve our understanding of the design and to make "better
					design". For the design of urban bridge, we would like to make a point here, in order
					to help people to deepen understanding of urban bridge design process, it is: "structure
					the train of thought", which is going to help you better achieve an important way
					of urban bridge structure design. Moreover, the "structure thinking" and design are
					alike, we can all learn and continuously improved through training. Just as Edward:
					"treat thinking as a skill, not a gift, it is the first step of continuously improving
					one's thinking." 

					Earlier, we mentioned that the landscape of urban landscape bridge due to its high
					specification needed bridge engineer in the design structural art, rather than merely
					rely on mechanical codes, manuals and computer design. So, how do we specific design
					projects, reflect the diversity of structure, and to meet specific aspects of design
					needs? The answer is that we need to apply "structural thinking," will design and
					structure organisation scheme to establish a link between, and the said the structure
					was not there, it may only appear in the designer's mind at a certain time, that
					is, original design works. Here we are not talking about hanging in and hanging of
					esoteric theory, in simple terms, is in the analysis of this problem, ask bridge
					structure design for questions, problem-solving process, we need not only learn knowledge,
					but also applying "knot structure-thinking" to build our system of bridge structure,
					the development of our ideas, and ultimately seeks to meet project-specific design
					standard, rather than a copy of an existing structure. 

					The so-called "structure of thinking" is not a new concept, refers to the creation
					of structural form using design thinking. Design in all its forms, must include the
					exact and fuzzy two different ideas, requires systematic and chaos of intuition and
					reset method of thinking, requires imaginative thinking and accurate calculation
					of integrated. In other words, is to learn how to design science and consciousness,
					deductive and inductive organically together. How to use in design of "structures",
					it is a very complicated and delicate skill, it would just like us to learn flute
					and table tennis, although almost all are all trained to to learn, but it takes practice
					to do. 

					Concepts of urban landscape bridge structure of the design is a creative design,
					need a rich imagination, and in the overall design filled with unknown factors in
					the process, some designers, created may be a burden, but for others speaking, they
					may feel that it is very exciting. Germany bridge master as a bridge engineer, described
					his creative process: "naturally, you will have some unconscious thought, it is because
					something is stored in your memory inspiration occasionally emerges. But generally
					speaking, happy is hard work; field exploration, thinking and painting sketches,
					evaluating design plan, identify advantages. A sketch after another, not satisfied
					with the reverse designs, fighting with it, new programmes, to consult with others,
					sweat, until the final solution from the many choices in implementing them. The more
					difficult a task, the greater the opportunity that you can come up with some unique
					solutions. As time goes by, you will develop a certain degree of design strategy.
					First solve the most difficult problems in a complex task, but using the most simple
					way possible, so that other unresolved issues will become less difficult issues,
					and finally you'll be able to put forward a comprehensive and coherent solution design
					scheme. However, our engineers are not there simply to seek to satisfy, and not just
					to promote technological progress to the top, we are within a short time to live
					on the Earth, making human life more pleasant." If you frequently experience urban
					landscape bridge conceptual design process, it is not difficult to understand the
					hardships of the creative process. In most of the time, when we do not see The things
					we require, we may feel frustrated, in the conceptual design of the structure of
					the process, we are going to learn could substitute with firm confidence disappointed—I
					know it was already on the path of realisation, is what we are learning in practice
					the growing "structure of thinking" ability gives us that confidence. 

					8.3.3 Urban Bridge Structure Characteristics 

					1. Design ad Construction Difficulty in Urban Bridge Design 

					At the beginning of this chapter, we talked about the topic of Haihe River Bridge,
					with the advancement of landscape construction of the Haihe River, alongwith the
					improvement of urban traffic, gradually a group of river-crossing bridges were built
					on the river. In this section, through the introduction of Haihe bridge design and
					construction difficulties, we try to understand issues related to the design and
					construction of urban bridge. 

					According to the overall policy of Haihe construction of Tianjin about Dagu bridge
					construction begins at home and abroad are invited to most famous civil engineering
					consulting firms to participate in the design and tender. Table 8.2 Famous foreign
					consulting companies participating in new bridge design and tendering upto date.

					highlight the economic development in Tianjin. 

					Width of the Tianjin Haihe river is generally around 100 meters, as span are small,
					and navigation standards are not high, so most of the various types of bridges are
					consider a bridge over the river. Starting from selecting your new bridge of dagu
					bridge in bridge and structural characteristics as shown in Table 8.3.

(a) Design and Construction Innovations of Dagu Bridge 

					Dagu bridge in Tianjin (8.20) use open, non-symmetric space arch design, breaking
					the previous two-dimensional arch bridge structures from flat surface of the three-dimensional
					structure of two-dimension to space. Dagu bridge design philosophy is "Sun Moon arch",
					constructed by two asymmetrical arch, Arch rings arch high 39 m facing east to symbolise
					the Sun; little arch high arch 19 m to the west, a symbol of the Moon, predicts bright
					future of Tianjin as the Moon and Sun. Total bridge length 154 m, as a three-span
					continuous girder system, unique design, modern and fully represents the current
					bridge development trend, that is safe to use and beautiful landscape, technological
					innovation, and the economy sensibility. 



Fig. 8.20 Dagu bridge in Tianjin. 

					In terms of landscape, the bridge is a very nice and in harmony with the local environment
					of the bridge; in terms of structural mechanics, it makes full use of bridge lateral
					rigidity and vertical stiffness of arched, making this look extremely slim structure
					can also resist Tianjin area strong earthquake. 

					It is a three-span continuous tied arch bridge, bridge spans are: 24 m + 106 m +
					24 m, bridge, 154 m. Bridge arch crosses over the river, side arch provide adequate
					space for two sides under roads and Riverfront hydrophilic platform. Sidewalks and
					landscape design of trails for pedestrians and provides a resting and viewing platform.
					

					In the whole process of Dagu bridge construction system switch is the key to completion
					of bridge, novel structure requires in this phase of construction to be innovative.
					Practice proves, the entire set of system construction technology to be practical.
					It increases the accuracy of the positioning of the bridge structure, accelerate
					the pace of construction, guarantees the safety of construction process for smooth
					and completing the works played an important role in quality, but also for the future
					of such bridges provides valuable experience for reference. The design mainly has
					following several aspects and construction innovations: 


						general procedures for mechanical calculation and analysis of applicability of bridge
						structure; 

						steel weldability study on small space; 

						low alloy steel thick plate welding performance of different types of steel welding
						performance; 

						inverted trapezoidal arch moulding process; 

						study on installation technology of steel box arch ribs; 

						asymmetry of the Suspender tension control process. 


(b) Design and Construction Innovations of Fenghua Bridge 

					Fenghua, Tianjin Haihe River Bridge Fig. 8.21 is located in Fenghua road, Hexi District,
					Tianjin Hedong District, and connected a bridge across the river, was designed by
					Mr. Makemanlang, founder of the France makemanlang design engineering firm. Fenghua
					river on both sides of the bridge and the coastal strip garden connected due to the
					surrounding landscape, and will attract a lot of visitors and, therefore, when Mr
					Makemanlang in bridge design to avoid pure traffic function of bridge design, but
					rather from the function of urban bridges and from landscaping standards to select
					bridge form. To this end, the Fenghua bridge structure is three-span arch structure,
					span is 56 m + 138 m + 56 m, hole 138 m across the river. Main span arch is 32.5
					m in height, side-span arch 20 m, upstream sidewalk bridge are fully linked, downstream
					sidewalks on both sides connected, from coast to coast, on both sides of the Park
					connected. Each arch of the bridge formed by three independent arch, main span and
					side spans the Middle arch is located between the lanes on both sides, lateral arch
					is located at a carriageway and scenic trails and sidewalks in between. Each separate
					arch formed by the three box-section steel tube arch, box-section steel tube arch
					of curve, box roof arch, between steel pipe arch consists of several different forms
					of metal leaf-shaped piece connected to the network. Three of the same cross alone
					state set between the arch of wind connections, to ensure lateral stability of arch
					structure. Main span arch and lateral side arches hang from the bar in 4 m, others
					are 2 m. Deck system formed by the longitudinal beam and steel deck, side pedestrian
					bridge consisting of steel beams and concrete composition. Its main design application
					difficulties are: 



Fig. 8.21 Fenghua bridge. 


						Spatial structural analysis of special-shaped arch; 

						Super thick steel plate welding technology research; 

						Hyperboloid steel arch rib and petal structure fabrication; 

						Sliding pan on steel deck erection technology; 

						Space diagonal steel arch with variable cross-section of installation; 

						Steel arch closure process; 

						Construction technology of new tensions in suspenders. 


(c) Design and Construction Innovations of Bengbu Bridge 

					Tianjin Haihe River Bengbu Bridge Fig. 8.22 used in the design of a girder and arch
					combination system. The total length of the bridge 192 m, flat against the structure
					parameters A thin single-room of steel box beam in along the bridge has a double
					point, respectively (parts of the bridge abutments, strut position and diagonal brace
					parts), point (v-shaped piers in parts), point (v-shaped piers in parts), double
					(Raking parts, strut position and abutment areas) supported even continued beam wing
					through a number of bridges are cantilever beam, transverse arch, V-shape piers
					of components and auxiliary bridge made up of vertical and horizontal beam structure multi-point support, connection, and consists of three spatial
					distortions on both sides of the longitudinal arch and the corresponding transverse
					arch even and reticular arches withstand the external part of the passed to the lower
					base of arch. 




Fig. 8.22 Bengbu bridge. 

					Bengbu bridge is anti-symmetric spatial distortion mesh arch structure. Commonly
					regulations simply increase or decrease the stiffness can be improved to some extent
					loading condition of the structure, and for this kind of beam and Arch (Generalized
					arch) system, in whole or in part under the influence of external load rigidity and
					internal force distribution problem, it takes should be carefully weighed and studied.
					

					This bridge and the bridge has been built in the past, stress characteristics of
					huge difference, unable to bridge design has been built through learning from other
					experiences full control and design information on structures, so we devoted to the
					study of the bridge. Design concept of this bridge novel, even with conventional
					bridge design concepts, and manifested in the following aspects: 


						Main structure consists of box girder of the bridge with the lattice arch consists
						of small box girder sections, structure of the unique network-shape arch bridge is
						never use a principal stress structures. 

						Design first starting from the landscape dimensions of the selected components, which
						greatly increases the difficulty of structural design and workload. 

						Load bars under tension and compression transform into bridge design support structure
						(1st, 6th Pier). 

						Used in the bridge configuration is a hinged components in order to meet the need
						of force structure (2nd and 5th Pier). 

						Special "V"-shaped structure Pier design (3rd and 4th Pier). 


					Due to the prominent landscape of this bridge, bridge structure fully into account
					aesthetic requirements. This bridge, such as linear, sectional dimensions of space
					hormone directly affects the aesthetic effect through optimized calculations and
					research necessary to solve the difficulties of the structure to meet traffic requirements,
					and full attention to appearance, so as to ensure uniformity in its effects and appearance
					features, rich in Tianjin urban image, Ascension Day Tianjin's status, which greatly
					promoted the economic development the Haihe River. 

					2. Improvement of Existing Urban Bridge 

					Tianjin's development, especially in more than a century, is working closely with
					the development of the Haihe river, also accompanied the Haihe river development.
					Tianjin Haihe river have been completed on existing bridges, witnessed the Tianjin
					culture, history and the progress of humanity. Because sea bridge over the river's
					low density, is far from meeting the needs of urban development, so in terms of Haihe
					river bridge continues to show the beauty Li's rich historical and cultural point
					of view, or continue to divert the busy traffic in the city's point of view, require
					Haihe river bridge. 

					However, because of the bridge construction days earlier, is confined to the settlement
					of the standards as well as many years of operating, such as element, now Tianjin
					has been unable to meet the growing demand. These factors not only are unable to
					satisfy traffic under the bridge, bridge traffic and load standards improve using
					features such as new requirements, at the same time, demand more and more of an urban
					landscape of urban development element, so must deal with problems of existing bridges,
					according to the overall plan calls for each of the reform of the existing bridge.
					

(a) The Lion Bridge 

					Lion Grove Bridge name derived from the "lion" names. Existing lion bridge built-in
					two: 1974, construction of pre-stressed reinforcement concrete bridges, bridge width
					24.6 m, the layout of the roadway and sidewalks on the bridge. Upper structure is
					a three-span simply supported single arm hang hole structure 24 m + 45 m + 24 m bridge,
					hanging length is 8 m. Piers, abutments with reinforced concrete piles. Under the
					original bridge, 1994 tours on each side to build a new bridge, Shinbashi Bridge
					9.3 m. Shinbashi bridge superstructure shapes with the same old bridge and structure
					for the three span variable cross-section pre-stressed concrete continual box-girder
					span is 25.2 m + 45 m + 25.2 m. New and old bridge substructure for reinforcing steel
					bar pier concrete entities, with bored pile foundation in the lower part. 

					To comprehensive tests showed the Lion Bridge, the bridge continues to meet load
					standards and existing regulatory requirements, you can still in order to continue
					using it. But because the river navigable standard, lion bridge could no longer meet
					the current navigation requirements, must be of high bridge range is increased by
					1.271 m. Because the Lion Bridge has a unique cultural and landscape values, to dismantle
					it would be a pity. After overall carefully researched and repeatedly demonstrated,
					decided to conduct an overall rising, at the same time, in accordance with the landscape
					requirement to haihe bridge area decoration. 

					Transformation after Lion Bridge sculpture 4 magnificent Crouching Lion, with the
					bronze lions of bridge railing look different form the unique style of stately traditional
					Chinese culture. Fig. 8.23 respectively, Lion Bridge in the rebuilding process and
					after reconstruction. 

(b) North Bridge 

					North Bridge (Fig. 8.24), built in 1973, the main bridge consists of three spans,
					long-span 24 m + 45 m + 24 m, width 24.6 m bridge laid on the roadway and sidewalks.
					Superstructures for simple single cantilever girder pre-stressed concrete box girder
					with variable cross section with a hanging beam, suspension beam length: 8 m, weight

					8.4 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF URBAN BRIDGE—STRUCTURE AND ENGINEERING—THE ARCHITECTURAL
					AESTHETICS 

					When Germany bridge master qiaoge·xilasi was asked in an interview: "what is an engineer
					in the eyes of the art of architecture?" He replied: "that process it is the natural
					or urban environment can be like dealing with the function and construction of social
					responsibility as sensitive creative design. A friendly, holistic solution suitable
					for all purposes, including their appearance is also very beautiful feeling. Architecture
					is the ultimate goal, comments ensue. "The designer wants to stress is, the beauty
					of bridges art values and bridging functions are equally important. An excellent
					bridge designs should be the science, technology and culture the result of combining
					art and should adapt to the various aspects of the project requirement, while the
					demand for architectural aesthetics, two of the more important point is: in harmony
					with the environment and an attractive appearance. 

					Dr man-Chung Tang once said that "a successful bridge design must be natural, simple,
					innovative, coordinated with the surrounding environment, and get along well. "He
					was once quoted in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of" civilisation "definition of"
					using science and technology to achieve the comfort and convenience of modern "to
					describe the United States important concept in building design. The bridge structure
					is concerned, "safety leaps" provides "convenience", and beautiful environment makes
					one feel "comfortable". Therefore, Man-Chung Tang stressed the importance of bridge
					aesthetics in terms of quality of life. He thought bridge are public buildings was
					decorating the environment one of the most important structures. History of mankind
					are to improve the quality of life. Beauty is a very important part of quality of
					life! Therefore, the bridge should not neglect the beautiful. 

					Professor qiaoge·xilasi and Dr man-Chung Tang, although we are doing the structural
					origins of bridge engineers, but they do not exclude introduces the idea of architecture
					aesthetics in bridge design. Instead, they're very big on bridge aesthetics, their
					works can be seen in the many of the design elements of the building. 

					Early city bridge, due to the lack of material and technical, generic bridge design
					with practicality, Liang Duo mark design and use of precast construction, in order
					to achieve high performance and short of goals, choices and the importance of appearance,
					often behind such pragmatic considerations. Today, the bridge has a more and more
					important role in urban space, we hope the city bridge not only as a tool to cross,
					but other buildings, reflecting the quality of urban life, interpreting in a way
					or value, become part of people's lives. 

					As bridge designers of the new era, we can't force their way of thinking in the field
					of architecture, also want to try architecture some thinking into the field of bridge
					design, creating both works of art and architectural design of the structure. Modern
					architecture, is a design imported from western thought since reform and opening
					up, all along, the domestic construction sector there are several trends: 


						Irrational tendencies. In teaching, the teachers will be sporadic and emotional experience
						through different building types similar problems (such as functions, forms and norms)
						repetition of the exercise in order to "language, but not explained" way to teach
						in practice, people rely on talent, "perception", with the sudden "inspired" created
						around themselves "feel" for evaluation. 

						Art trend. Inherited from the 19th century Beaux "bandage" system, academic background
						in China formed under a set of "fine arts building" concept. From the perspective
						of advancement of the design and evaluation of, the "beauty" concept significance
						based knowledge construction of knowledge, theory, "style and genre" is the main
						tool, the focus is still on "forms". 

						The gap between theory and practice. Most of the architectural theory at the abstract
						level, with the text, the theory itself is logical demonstrated, the lack of effective
						ways to put it into practice; architectural practice multi stays on the perceptual
						experience of specific projects, it is difficult to methodological level, refine,
						validate and promote. 


					Domestic architecture of the level there is a considerable gap with the European
					powers, several tendencies of the above, the domestic construction sector common
					problem in columns. We should pay attention to when using architectural philosophy,
					not blindly to the Builder, but should be directed at specific problems of rational
					thought, after all, in the field of bridge using architectural aesthetics, at the
					international level is still at an initial stage. 

					8.4.1 In Harmony with the Environment 

					We start by looking at an example—Italy bridge of Sighs, as shown in Fig. 8.25. 



Fig. 8.25 Italy bridge of sighs. 

					"When the Sunset bell rings, I want you kiss under the bridge at sunset"—In the film
					"the sunset bridge" the most classic dialogues of love, has been popular around the
					world, the two main characters of the film it was standing in on the bridge of sighs
					in Venice. Also here into Europe and young people to the lovers expressed their love
					in the most romantic of places. But if the origin of the name of the bridge of sighs
					is not romantic. The bridge of sighs was built-in 1600, the style early Baroque style,
					the Bridge House, the upper dome cover closed tightly, only to Canal two openwork
					carving small side window. The bridge fully illustrates the meaning of "connection",
					it connects tokary Palace next to the Governor's mansion and old prison dungeons
					in the middle ages, when the prisoners at the Governor's mansion after the trial,
					criminals will be brought to the Dungeon, and may have thus to be gone forever. Only
					one bridge away, but can be described as between heaven and hell. These dying prisoners,
					after which beautiful marble bridge, through the side of the bridge window to see
					beautiful water scenery, will not help and groaned, the bridge of sighs hence the
					name. 

					Through the "bridge of sighs" in this case, we may wish to explore the deep: essentially,
					the bridge was designed to between the two points (tokary Palace next to the Governor's
					mansion and old prison dungeons in the middle ages) to provide access to bridge the
					natural and artificial obstacles (the Canal between two buildings). Bridge Designer
					is not just building a building, its soul is how to use ingenious structures that
					link the meaning perfectly into the environment, so that it not only provides a new
					processes, new viewpoints and experiences through time, and forming new place and
					in shaping the landscape. 

					Therefore, the bridges of the city and the urban environment are inseparable, it,
					town squares and main streets and other urban architecture, into the cultural landscape
					of the city as a whole, is part of people's daily life. 

(a) The city's Landscape 

					City is an integral part of human civilisation, cities along with the development
					and progress of human civilisation. The impergium, humans started to settle; accompanying
					commercial development, development, urban civilisation began to spread. In fact
					the impergium, cities appear and role in the military defence and sacrificial ceremony,
					does not have the production function, it's just a consumer centre. At that time
					the City Planning Board model is very small, because the surrounding countryside
					provides surplus grain is not much. Each city and its control in rural areas, forming
					a small unit, the relative closed and self-sufficient. Scholars generally believe
					that cities are the result of industrial and commercial development in the true sense.
					As of the 13th century mediterranean Coast, places like Milan, Venice, Paris, is
					an important commercial and trade Center; Venice, which during the boom, the population
					exceeded 200,000. After the industrial revolution, and greatly speeds up the process
					of urbanisation as farmers continue to flock to the new industrial centres, urban
					growth was unprecedented . To the eve of the first world war, United Kingdom and
					the United States, and Germany and France and other Western countries, most people
					have been living in the city. This is not only a symbol of abundance, and is a symbol
					of civilisation. 

					According to the Chinese Academy of social sciences, according to city blue book
					published on July 29, 2010, as of 2009, China's urbanization rate was 46.6%, the
					town's population reached 6.200 million, urbanization scale ranks the first in the
					world. This report, titled China urban development report of blue skin demonstrates,
					the 1996-2005, the urban population every year in China more than 20; 2006-2009 year
					increase the town's population is approximately 1 to 5 million people. By the end
					of 2009, China's total urban population was the United States population (two times),
					even higher than the total size of the 27-nation bloc's population of one-fourth.
					The blue book is expected, for some time to come, China's urbanisation process will
					remain in a period of rapid progress, by 2015 the urbanisation rate will reach around
					52%, by 2030 65% or so. 

					In the rapid development of urbanisation in China and even the whole world today,
					understanding further insight into the urban environment, it becomes very necessary.
					In the famous TV series beijingers in New York, a classic line, had this to say:
					"If you love someone, send him to New York, for it's heaven if you hate someone,
					send him to New York, for it's hell." It is clear that urban environment complex,
					let us not analyzed the city's concepts from the fields of philosophy, this is not
					the focus of this chapter. We are here concerned the city as a place to live, many
					of us work, and it really gives us a kind of environment? These urban bridge design
					concepts and how close liaison? 

(b) Coordinating and Urban Landscape and Urban Bridge 

					Previously mentioned the global bridge aesthetics, a book, in this book, 24 of the
					world's prominent bridge engineers and architects, from 16 countries selected representative
					bridges, shared their experience on bridge design aesthetics, comments and suggestions.
					They summarised that in the conception and design of bridge the main principles to
					be followed are "unity of the location of the bridge and the bridge" and the application
					of "the presenting form of the structure". "The structural form" is discussed in
					articles in structural engineering, above, and "bridges and bridge unity "is the
					central idea of this section. Bridge location refers to the "landscape", "City",
					"city space", "ring state" "scenic area", "the bridge and the environment do not"
					noise" and "harmony" and "complementary", "enhance", "protect", "side-by-side etc.".
					Experts in the book are cited: 

					"We must pay attention to the balance of nature and landscape to interfere as little
					as possible to form a bridge for us. As long as the bridge construction is Close
					to spectacular natural beauty, this is especially important." 

					—Von Olnhausen (Sweden) 

					"We think that the bridge must be combined with its local environment, landscape
					or city views, particularly when it comes to size relationships and the proportion
					of occasions. In the past decades due to the heavy concrete blocks were placed in
					the old Center of the city had caused many mistakes ... ... Often, with deep, heavy
					girder of long-span bridges will undermine the lovely valley views or city"—Leonhardt
					(Germany) 

					"With boundary node of this property, is another aspect of importance of bridges
					exist in space. That is to say, a bridge the function not only as a thoroughfare,
					and is a place for people to meet each other ... ... Space and form design of the
					bridge, also turned up consider bridges in urban space as a unique meeting place
					of this aspect of human culture." 

					—Nakamura (Japan) 

					"When we think about at the location of the bridge and its relationship to the environment,
					configurations and colours of the temples and palaces available as an example to
					investigation. For example, a temple or palace of the city sights are built high
					walls, decorated in red, green or yellow glazed tiles. This deals with the contrasting
					backgrounds, showing temples, palaces, the existence of different and important.
					In the same way, some large-scale modern steel bridge designer bridges has been painted
					with bold colors. However, most of the bridges are designed and decorated with your
					local environment Association Harmony complement each other." 

					—Tang (China) 

					"The bridge should never be considered unrelated to its surroundings. Therefore,
					a bridge must be designed to complement each other with their setting environment
					and Harmony exists." 

					—Menn (Switzerland) 

					City bridge, the city/bridge, city bridge concept, closely related to the city's
					overall philosophy. Bridge should fit in the local environment, as well as the history
					and culture of the city, unique style, and so on, require bridges to echo the urban
					environment, reflecting the high urban quality. 

(c) City Bridges in the River Landscape 

					At the beginning of this chapter, we mentioned the topic of rapid development of
					Haihe River Bridge construction, economic development for bridge construction to
					provide strong powerful protection, harmony with the environment of the new bridge
					is also able to stimulate economic growth. Going across the city like Tianjin Haihe
					River rivers, its bridge-building of the whole landscape is very noticeable. Haihe
					River Bridge construction, Tianjin will become a global and strategic and historic
					works. Construction of Haihe River Bridge, to capitalise on advantages of the bridge,
					Haihe River economic belt formed effect, thus boost the city's economic and social
					development is of great significance and importance. 

					Coincidentally, at the national level, with the process of urbanisation, in order
					to adapt to the development trend of urban landscape renovation, urban traffic development
					needs, many cities have also started to landscape planning of urban River Bridge
					renovation, such as the Shanghai Suzhou River bridgescape governance, Guilin, "two
					rivers and four lakes" landscape renovation of bridges and so on. 

					Bridge is the city's business card, is condensed and carrier of geographical and
					cultural history of the city. Landscape of urban bridge not only needs to comply
					with technical and aesthetic characteristics, but also display features, embodying
					regional characteristics into the cultural identity. Urbanisation, art, human culture
					is urban landscape meets the general landscape of three major characteristics. River
					bridges are part of the urban landscape of the city, by the in its waterfront properties/in
					waterfront personality, organisation of urban space environment of urban environment
					and urban activities play an irreplaceable role. 

					• Waterfront Space Properties 

					River Bridge across the surface of the city, connecting the two sides of traffic
					as the main function, which combines the different blocks of the city as a whole,
					provides the basis for people perceiving the city's overall intent. Bridges are often
					marked cross-hair in the direction to the river crossing, with the city roads connected
					urban traffic network. People walk on the deck and fast driving vehicles and surface
					ships navigating under the bridge joint formation of transportation flows, showing
					the bridge's dynamic landscape features, reflect the waterfront of the most productive
					in urban bridgescape. 

					• The Urban Landscape Features 

					City River Bridge, town squares and main streets and major public buildings became
					part of urban elements, the style should be consistent with the city's overall style.
					Bridge design both as an independent building design as well as road landscape in
					its entirety, an entire section of water features, part of the street environment
					as a whole, with its surrounding environment, the built environment and cultural
					landscape harmoniously. 

					• Geographical Culture Characteristics 

					Each city is unique in the world, has a unique history and culture. Bridge as a special
					kind of knot frame, long considered a symbol of economic and cultural. It tells you
					more about the history of changes and the evolution of the times, reflects the different
					age architectural features, contains a wealth of culture. 

					• Night Landscape Aesthetics Characteristics 

					Bridge pattern in the city's strategic position in the night view of the bridge became
					an important component of urban lighting. Waterfront of bridges site, its expansive
					vision is the expression focus of the urban landscape, night view of the bridge city
					night view of depth and space layer play an important role. 

					8.4.2 Construction Techniques 

					After entering in the 1980, of the 20th century, bridges as the main cultural and
					architectural landscape, obtaining increasing attention. Bridge's two main line is
					particularly evident in the development of: innovation of large-span structures are
					emerging on the one hand, are the big traffic load in North America and the Pacific
					region, especially China, and on the Spain architects in San Diego Yage Kalatelawa
					(Santiago Calatrava), France Marc Mimum, and the Chinese-American Pei (Pei Ieoh Ming),
					architect, United Kingdom by Wilkinson Eyre, Ove Arup company, France, Dietmar Feichtinger
					division of Spain of the engineer Leonardo Fernandez Troyano, works as a model, is
					absorbing in bridge design construction approach, designed many bridges as art. These
					bridges are often small scale of urban bridge, or a some artistic atmosphere footbridge.
					Environmental Designer, product designer and graphic designer needed vocational skills
					may be the most important space, form, line and colour and mechanism, and so on.
					Similarly, for urban bridge, apart from satisfying beyond technical feasibility,
					there is another very important factor is its aesthetic value. Because city bridge
					not only to meet its required function, it is always in sight. The achieving of aesthetic
					value, in many cases requires the power of the architect by using effective techniques
					to beautify the bridges, such as the below are listed several bridges. 

(a) The Aspiration Bridge 

					This bridge is an impressive, delicate and bold designs, a high place in Floral Street
					in Covent Garden bright, shiny footbridge, across from the new building of the Royal
					Ballet School and the Royal Opera House link for dancers direct before. Revolving
					bridge shape, square 23 door frame made of aluminum girders, adjacent to each gantry
					rotation, then install glass to become. The bridge opened in 2003, as shown in Fig.
					8.26. 



Fig. 8.26 Aspiration Bridge in London. 

(b) United Kingdom Butterfly Bridge 

					United Kingdom Butterfly bridge Fig. 8.27 is using modern programme material and
					the design. Original butterfly double Arch truss bridge design on the new bridge
					with high arching parabola forms of reproduction, this parabola is composed of a
					single ring, hollow steel tubes form. Arches on both sides of the point, upward-sloping
					constitutes upto open shapes. Two Vault between water distance is 16 m, look like
					the wings of a butterfly. This modeling buildings have a certain vitality, as if
					stuck in the flooded low the mechanical insects on the ground. This, coupled with
					the nearby bridge beam Parallels, making this perfect combination of new bridge and
					the surrounding environment. 



Fig. 8.27 United Kingdom Butterfly bridge. 

(c) The United Kingdom's Millennium Bridge Over the Lankaisitelun River 

					United Kingdom Millennium Bridge on the Lankaisitelun river Fig. 8.28 "Y"-shaped
					railway viaduct piers and connects with the North Bank of the river. It makes both
					sides of the river between Lancaster and morecambe walking and bicycling all very
					convenient. This twin mast cable-stayed structure using the south better geographical
					conditions and at the same time awakens sleeping memories, people seemed to enjoy
					the 17 and 18th century, when the pier was crowded with ships. Bridge passageway
					extending into the terminal, adding navigation the image, you can also play a reinforcing
					role and prevents the mast swings. 

					In making use of architectural aesthetics of urban bridge model design, and structural
					design compared, often of a more large uncertainties. In fact, for the architectural
					design of the bridge is not a so-called absolute standard that can be quantified,
					in the design process, most of the time we are unable to determine exactly to what
					extent an issue is fully resolved. Generally speaking, the designers end a design
					for two reasons: one is that time has run out, and second, they think it is no longer
					necessary to have a design problem studied further more. Bridge design in urban landscape,
					however, we had to hastily because former junction beam architectural design process,
					there are many designs and sometimes regrets. The causes of these issues are , the
					urban landscape bridge was built building design, is often the goal is unclear, including
					design issues would also need to be proactive to discover. Clearly, "judge when to
					conclude its work" is an important bridge designers, but this seems to only find
					itself through practice. Fizzled out design problems is very unreasonable, and the
					other extreme is that problem at design at the beginning of Ming dynasty practice,
					later also tend to bring a lot of misleading, in this argument about "traditional
					bridge type selection alternative thinking "are mentioned. 



Fig. 8.28 United Kingdom River Lune Millennium Bridge. 

					8.4.3 Bridge Decoration 

					1. The Knowledge of Urban Bridges Decoration 

					The Pont Alexandre III in Paris Fig. 8.29 and Notre Dame bridge Fig. 8.30 are very
					famous, from the aspect of structure, that two bridges there is almost no difference,
					they are steel deck-arch bridge, the structure forms are similar, but in appearance,
					it seems as if there is a big difference between the two arch bridge, the reason
					is that they adopt a different style of decoration, so as in a completely different
					visual effects. 



Fig. 8.29 Pont Alexandre III (Paris). 

					At the time, heavy is a stylish decoration of the urban bridge, especially the Pont
					Alexandre III, the bridge is decorated very heavy, sumptuous, Royal style came to
					prominence. Bridges North and South ends of the four pylons erected on the pier,
					the tower a bronze Pegasus rose, symbolising the goddess conquers Pegasus; Bridge
					vaults sculptor George Lei Xipeng work; bridge the lamp is made of Cupids holding
					on, meaning the image construction of bridge decorative theme; on the bridge's steel
					skeleton outside the bars of gold is a gorgeous flower-shaped sculpture, garland
					pair of beautiful ladies looming; bridge lights installed on a bronze sculpture lights
					and lamps next to the candle holder hugs, forever as festive. Two columns on the
					left bank of the bridge represented on the Renaissance and Louis 14 of france signs
					on two pillars on the right bank have symbolic sign of ancient Italy and modern French.
					At the entrance from both ends of the bridge column there are symbols of the Seine
					with the moral of the decorations of the Neva river. All in all, this bridge decorative
					technique used to perfection, its decoration is meant to convey a certain meaning
					and emotion, namely: praising former Russia and France's friendship. 



Fig. 8.30 Notre Dame bridge (Paris). 

					To decorate the bridge has a very long history. As society changes, bridges decoration
					has undergone since time immemorial Jane single, simple to fussy pile and finely
					crafted before the 18th century, from the 19th century, abandoning decoration to
					the early 21st century form of functionalism generation, decoration of reason such
					a development process. Second half of the 20th century, bridge sector have no bridges,
					decorative, displaying is the number in front of people without any "traditional"
					ingredients, just to meet the functional requirements of the bridge, although the
					solution some looming transportation issues, but did not take into account bridge
					landscape. 

					The so-called bridge decorative refers to non-necessary for the function and design
					of bridge structures, but additional, improved bridge art image measures collectively.
					Highway bridge, due to its zone pedestrian with few tourists, mainly to meet transport
					function it is generally not necessary to do unnecessary decoration, simple nature
					is as good a city bridge, due to mostly medium and small span, and high aesthetic
					requirements, in order to make the bridge more harmonious with the surrounding environment,
					it is appropriate to add decoration. 

					2. Principles of Decorative Design of Urban Bridge 

					In the external decoration of the urban bridge, generally should be guided by the
					following principles. 

(a) Do not Decorate for the Sake of Decoration 

					Modern bridge architectural decoration are not symbols of power, not a mark of wealth,
					not fake vulgar display, nor nostalgia retro-decadence, but socially positive spirit
					in the pursuit of the ideal, is the memory of history and culture and develop the
					successor, is an effort to establish social perfection. Modern bridge architectural
					design should be decorative, not ornamental, must be in the bridge coordinate functions
					on the basis of full consideration of its practical value, taking into account their
					artistry, building society and nature, and harmony, in order to improve the people's
					quality of life, to contribute to the promotion of social progress. 

(b) The Green Decoration and Economic Constraints 

					Modern bridge architectural design should promote "green" principles, namely natural
					priority, people-oriented, optimization of landscape as a whole, conservation of
					resources and energy. Under the economic conditions, and at a minimum cost, maximum
					results are achieved. 

(c) Decorative Symbols 

					Decorative performance will inevitably affect people's mental, and influence is limited
					by people understanding, so people understand are important restrictions of decorative
					design, decoration design creations, using those for the public to understand and
					familiar symbols, more capacity easy to be accepted and loved. Meanwhile, giving
					new meaning to the old symbols, thus allowing it to update and develop. 

(d) Regional and Democracy 

					Modern bridge architectural design must pay attention to ethnic and regional characteristics,
					correctly reflect the national style and local characteristics. 

(e) Harmony Between Features and the Environment, Unity of Variability and Integration


					Bridge design and decoration should be distinctive, but restricted its features should
					be in harmony with the environment, and the environment, interrelation. "Highlighting"
					is the decoration makes bridge-building image is reinforced, prominent in the environment;
					" Tumor suppressor" is a decorative bridges beam fusion of architecture and environment.
					Fusion is divided into two categories: assimilation or comparison, the former is
					a common integration with the environment, directly integrated in environment which
					is integration with the environment, namely, self-expression, and environmental interdependence,
					formed an indivisible whole. 

					Change and unity, including changes in individual and groups of unity and change
					and unity, which refers to the partial and whole relationship is the unity of different
					local treatment method in the overall unity of style, whereas the latter refers to
					groups of individuals and groups in relation, it is unification of multiple individual
					style. 

(f) Tradition and Modernity 

					Modern bridge architectural design should consider how to express a cultural tradition
					with modern technologies and materials; how to use traditional technologies art adapted
					to modern bridge architectural features, reflecting the modern life. Key is to find
					the combination of tradition and modernity, to find the true genus in China the national
					decorative design, and which conforms to the spirit of modern society. 

(g) Simplicity and Luxury 

					Different Zeitgeist created a different style of architectural decoration, luxury,
					rule was once a period of ancient popular décor modern bridge design with simple,
					slender style as tone, the decorative style is predominantly minimalist. Simplicity
					is not simply in form, but also refers to outside of the component containing a common
					understanding, characterised by free imagination of uncertainty, so as to expand
					the connotation of the decorative and value. Even in specific cases, and require
					luxury decorating design style nor should be simple and rustic, and when should be
					given in accordance with spiritual connotations. 

(h) Strictly Control and Raise the Standard Bar 

					Modern bridge architectural design decorative items should be tightly controlled
					and content, should not pretentious and banal, not to thick made, high standard of
					design and decoration should be conducted and decorated with exquisite craft. 

					3. Functionality of Decorative Design of Urban Bridge 

					Bridge decoration is a secondary part of bridge attached to bridge body to participate
					in and strengthen the bridge landscape, while also can also have a bit of accessibility,
					as reflected in: 

(a) Decoration on the Main Structure of the Bridge has a Protective Effect 

Such as: surface paint rust-proof steel surface coating and finishes can prevent
					rain water and poisonous gases on the corrosion of concrete flowers engineered stone
					veneer of Pier and abutment can prevent water, mud, ice, erosion and so on. 

(b) Decorations can make up for Local Defects in Bridges of body Image 

For example: bridgehead buildings make up the bridge the monotonous level image;
					honeycomb, pockmarked face, templates, seam, reinforced gel top concrete tables unavoidable
					construction defects can be covered through shows that decoration, so that they could
					with a beautiful image like this in front of other people. 

(c) Decorations can be used to Adjust the Bridge body Proportions, Scale 

For example: use shadow or painted in different shades of colour change too much
					height or physical area of visual perception and week surrounding environment of
					colour can be adjusted to its sense of scale, and so on. 

(d) Decoration can be used as "Visual exchange point" has Weakened the Role of Bridge
					and Bridge Differences 

Example: difference between great bridge and bridge joints easily shaped points,
					destroying smoothly and continuously, built on the main bridge and bridge approach
					between the bridgeheads, move horizontally so that people's attention is transformed
					into vertical movement, weakening the main and bridge the differences. 

(e) Decorative Sign Recognition Function, Become the image of Cities or Regions on
					Behalf of Road or Bridge, "Critical" Sign 

					Bridge structural limitations restrict the morphological changes of bridge-building,
					by crafting decorations, so that people can clearly know bridges, discriminating
					bridge terminal, mood in favour of regulating traffic and traffic safety. Such as
					the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, South beijing Yangtze River bridgehead of different
					shapes have become recognized Bridge as well as the city's symbol. 

(f) Decoration can Build Shelter Space Environment 

					Bridge gallery building not only the characteristic shape of the bridge was constructed,
					and providing the actual service function for pedestrians and to prevent water intrusion
					erodes wooden beams. 

(g) Bridges can be Beautified to the Spirit Realm by Decoration 

					The Pont Alexandre III, represented on the two columns on the left bank of the Renaissance
					period and Louis 14 France logo, right france signs on two pillars on the right bank
					have symbolic sign of ancient Italy and modern French. At both ends of the bridge
					entrance to the post respectively, features the Seine and moral of the decorations
					of the Neva river, a symbol of the former Russia and France between friendship. 

(h) Decorating can Extend and Strengthen the Bridge Space and time Exhibition and
					Beautify the Bight Environment 

					Like bridge landscape lighting at night, not only make it night or day, you can enjoy
					the artistic image of the bridge, and improved the city image of the city, showing
					social progress, improve people's lives. 

					8.5 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF URBAN BRIDGE—STRUCTURE ENGINEERING IN COMBINATION WITH ARCHITECTURAL
					AESTHETICS 

					United Kingdom architect bulaien·laosen monograph in design thinking, the authors
					summarised the design model as shown in Fig. 8.31. In his view, design is a process
					of discovering, analysing and solving problems, and from design issues to resolve
					path to the programme, requiring analysis, synthesis, evaluation of complex intertwined
					with the process of thought. 



Fig. 8.31 The design process. 

					We know that design goal is rarely a single design problem in the majority of cases
					with multiple and interacting. United States architect Philip Johnson (Philip Johnson)
					has found that: some people think some chairs are beautiful, it is because it is
					comfortable to sit while others thought, chairs were comfortable, it is because they
					look very pretty. In this light, both visual and ergonomic chair design is very important.
					Geometry of a chair leg and making way to express definitely not just spatial problems,
					it also has to meet the following requirements: it must be stable and have a certain
					bearing force it wants to ensure the chair stacking chair legs can bite each other;
					it requires the designer to chair the overall vision on the vision. Designer a chair
					cannot be stacked and visual stability, support, and other issues considered separately,
					because all these account problems must be resolved through the same programme at
					the same time. In addition, designers have to consider many other common sense issues,
					such as the construction costs, the practicality of manufacturing technology, materials,
					finished products and durability of the node, and so on. Therefore, in the design,
					it is often necessary to a comprehensive solution to meet all your requirements.
					Then the natural consequence is that being a "good design", you will comprehensive
					reflection of all the problem; to make a "good designers", they must possess the
					ability to integrate and digest. 

					All attempts to define the design process as a set of logical operations concluded,
					there are all kinds of lack of can't tell you what steps a city bridge design through,
					how to do it. However, through some study, we find: urban design bridge is in some
					sense, is the creative application of structural engineering and the construction
					of aesthetic ideas, two thought mastery, to guide us through the design.
