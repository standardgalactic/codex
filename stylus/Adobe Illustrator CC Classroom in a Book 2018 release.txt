Adobe Illustrator CC Classroom in a Book® (2018 release) is part of the official training series for Adobe graphics and publishing software
         developed with the support of Adobe product experts. The features and exercises in
         this book are based on Illustrator CC (2018 release).

Restoring default preferences
      

 Note: If finding the preferences file proves difficult, please contact me at brian@brianwoodtraining.com for assistance.
         

The preferences file controls how command settings appear on your screen when you
         open the Adobe Illustrator program. Each time you quit Adobe Illustrator, the position
         of the panels and certain command settings are recorded in different preference files.
         If you want to restore the tools and settings to their original default settings,
         you can delete the current Adobe Illustrator Prefs file. Adobe Illustrator creates
         a new preferences file, if one doesn't already exist, the next time you start the
         program and save a file.
      
You must restore the default preferences for Illustrator before you begin each lesson.
         This ensures that the tools function and the defaults are set exactly as described
         in this book. When you have finished the book, you can restore your saved settings,
         if you like.
      
To delete or save the current Illustrator preferences file
The preferences file is created after you quit the program the first time and is updated
         thereafter. After launching Illustrator, you can follow these steps:
      


Exit Adobe Illustrator CC.


Locate the file named Adobe Illustrator Prefs for macOS as follows:


[startup drive]/Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/Adobe Illustrator 22 Settings/en_US**.

 Note: In Windows, the AppData folder is hidden by default. You will most likely need to
                        enable Windows to show hidden files and folders. For instructions, refer to your Windows
                        documentation.
                     





Locate the file named Adobe Illustrator Prefs for Windows as follows:


[startup drive]\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 22 Settings\en_US**\x86
                     or x64.
                  


*On macOS, the Library folder is hidden by default. To access this folder, in the
               Finder hold down the Option key, and choose Library from the Go menu in the Finder.
            
**The folder name may be different depending on the language version you have installed.

 Tip: To quickly locate and delete the Adobe Illustrator preferences file each time you
                  begin a new lesson, create a shortcut (Windows) or an alias (macOS) to the Adobe Illustrator
                  22 Settings folder.
               

For more information, refer to Illustrator help:
https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/kb/preference-file-location-illustrator.html
If you can't find the file, that's because either you haven't started Adobe Illustrator
               CC yet or you have moved the preferences file. The preferences file is created after
               you quit the program the first time and is updated thereafter.
            


Copy the file and save it to another folder on your hard disk (if you want to restore
               those preferences) or delete it.
            


Start Adobe Illustrator CC.


To restore saved preferences after completing the lessons
      


Exit Adobe Illustrator CC.

 Note: You can move the original preferences file rather than renaming it.
               



Delete the current preferences file. Find the original preferences file that you saved
               and move it to the Adobe Illustrator 22 Settings folder.

What's New In Adobe Illustrator CC (2018 Release)
Adobe Illustrator CC (2018 release) is packed with new and innovative features to
         help you produce artwork more efficiently for print, web, and digital video publication.
         The features and exercises in this book are based on Illustrator CC (2018 release).
         In this section, you'll learn about many of these new features—how they function and
         how you can use them in your work.
      
New Properties panel
The new Properties panel in Illustrator lets you view settings and controls in the
         context of your current task or workflow. This new panel has been designed with ease
         of use in mind, ensuring that you have access to the right controls right when you
         need them.
      
The Properties panel is available by default in the Essentials workspace. You can
         also choose Window > Properties to view it.
      

Puppet Warp tool
      
Puppet Warp lets you twist and distort parts of your artwork, to make transformations
         that appear natural. You can add, move, and rotate pins to seamlessly transform your
         artwork into different positions and stances using the new Puppet Warp tool in Illustrator.
      

Artboard Improvements
There are a lot of artboard improvements in Illustrator CC (2018 release). The following
         is a list of those improvements and new features:
      


Artboards are much easier to work with in this release of Illustrator CC.


You can now create 1 to 1,000 artboards per document depending on the size of your
               artboards.
            


You can also now select multiple artboards.


Artboards can now be aligned and distributed.



Variable fonts
Illustrator now supports Variable Fonts, a new OpenType font format supporting custom
         attributes like weight, width, slant, optical size, etc. This release of Illustrator
         ships with several variable fonts for which you can adjust weight, width, and slant
         using convenient slider controls available when you click in the Character panel,
         Character Styles panel, and Paragraph Styles panel.
      


 Note: To learn more about the Variable Fonts, visit helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/fonts.html.
         

Enhanced export experience
      
You can now collect objects in the Asset Export panel for export as a single asset
         or multiple assets. Simply drag your artwork to the Asset Export panel. Alternatively,
         right-click a piece of artwork and then choose Collect for Export > As Multiple Assets
         from the context menu.
      

Add and share text assets using Creative Cloud libraries
Now, you can add text objects from your Illustrator documents to Creative Cloud libraries
         and then share them with other users and across applications. Text assets in a library
         retain the character/paragraph styles and other attributes originally applied to them.
         You can reuse text assets in libraries across Illustrator or InDesign documents. However,
         if a text object has effects and appearances applied to it, you must add it to the
         library as a graphics asset to preserve them.
      

Other enhancements
      


You can now disable zoom to selection. Choose Illustrator CC > Preferences > Selection
               & Anchor Display (macOS) or Edit > Preferences > Selection & Anchor Display (Windows)
               and then deselect the Zoom To Selection option.
            


You can now preview font characteristics, such as size, style, leading, and tracking
               in real time by simply hovering over the font characteristics in the Properties panel,
               Control panel, and Character panel.
            


A new swatch is now a Global swatch by default.


The New Document dialog box displays the units of measurement in the text boxes, such
               as Width and Height. You can use the formulas to add, subtract, multiply, and divide
               for quick computations of the preset dimensions in the New Document dialog box. You
               can also specify the Color Mode, Raster Effects, and Preview Mode settings of your
               document.
            


You can now use the Path > Join command (Command+J [macOS] or Ctrl+J [Windows]) in
               Illustrator to join the end points of compound paths and artwork in different groups.
            


This list touches on just a few of the new and enhanced features of Illustrator CC
         (2018 release), yet still exemplifies Adobe's commitment to providing the best tools
         possible for your publishing needs. We hope you enjoy working with Illustrator CC
         (2018 release) as much as we do.

               in this lesson. Leave the file open for reference, if you'd like.
            


Creating a new document
In Illustrator, you can start a new document using a series of preset options, depending
         on your needs. In this case, you will print the artwork you create as a postcard,
         so you will choose the Print preset to start.
      

 Note: Learn more about creating and editing artboards in Lesson 5, "Transforming Artwork."
         



Choose File > New.


In the New Document dialog box, select the Print category along the top of the dialog
               box.
            

Click the Letter document preset.
In the Preset Details area on the right, change the following:


Name: TheLofts


Units (to the right of Width): Inches


Width: 8.5 in (the default setting)
                  


Height: 11 in (the default setting)
                  




Click Create, and a new, blank document opens.


Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, leave the name as TheLofts.ai, and
               navigate to the Lessons > Lesson00 folder. Leave the Format option set to Adobe Illustrator
               (ai) (macOS) or the Save As Type option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows),
               and click Save.
            


In the Illustrator Options dialog box that appears, leave the Illustrator options
               at their default settings and then click OK.
            


Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.

 Note: If you don't see Reset Essentials in the Workspace menu, choose Window > Workspace
                  > Essentials before choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
               



Drawing a shape
Drawing shapes is the cornerstone of Illustrator, and you'll create many of them in
         the coming lessons. To start your project, you'll create a rectangle.
      

 Note: Learn more about creating and editing shapes in Lesson 3, "Using Shapes to Create Artwork for a Postcard."
         



Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.

The white area you see is called the artboard, and it's where your printable artwork will go. Artboards are like pages in Adobe
               InDesign{{#}}0174;.
            


Select the Rectangle tool () in the Tools panel on the left. Move the pointer into the upper-left part of the
               artboard (see the red X in the figure). Click and drag down and to the right. When
               the gray measurement label next to the pointer shows a width of approximately 6.5 inches and a height of 7 inches, release the mouse button. The shape will be
               selected.
            


 Note: You can also create shapes by clicking the artboard with a shape tool and modifying
                  shape properties before they are created.
               



Editing shapes
      
Most shapes are live, which means you can edit them without switching away from the drawing tool, like
         the Rectangle tool. Next, you'll round the corners of the rectangle you just drew.
      


With the rectangle still selected, drag the bottom, middle point on the rectangle
               down until you see a height of about 7.6 inches.
            



Move the pointer over the center of the shape (the blue circle). When the pointer
               changes (), drag the rectangle into the approximate center of the artboard.
            



With the rectangle still selected, click and drag the upper-right corner widget () toward the center of the rectangle. When the gray measurement label shows a value
               of approximately 0.4 in, release the mouse button.
            

A lot of the different types of shapes you can create have widgets, like the corner
               widgets, for editing properties such as the number of sides on a polygon, adding pie
               angles to ellipses, and more.
            

 Tip: You can also round all of the corners independently. You'll learn more about creating
                  and editing Live Shapes in Lesson 3, "Using Shapes to Create Artwork for a Postcard."
               



Choose File > Save to save the document.


Applying and editing color
      
Applying color to artwork is a common Illustrator task. Shapes you create can have
         a stroke (border) and a fill. There are many ways in Illustrator to create your own
         colors and edit colors that come with each document by default, called swatches. In this section, you'll change the fill of the selected shape and edit the color
         you apply.
      

 Note: Learn more about fill and stroke in Lesson 7, "Using Color to Enhance Signage."
         



With the rectangle still selected, click the Fill color box to the left of the word
               "Fill" in the Properties panel to the right of the Document window. In the panel that
               opens, make sure that the Swatches option () is selected at the top of the panel to show the default swatches. Move the pointer
               over an orange swatch, and when a tooltip appears ("C=0, M=50, Y=100, K=0"), click
               to apply the orange color to the fill of the shape.
            

While you can use the predefined swatches, you can also create your own colors and
               save them as swatches to reuse them later.
            


With the swatches still showing for the fill, double-click the orange swatch you just
               applied to the shape to edit the color.
            


In the Swatch Options dialog box, change the values to C=0, M=0, Y=0, K=8 and select Preview to see the change to the shape. Click OK to edit the swatch color
               for the rectangle. Press Escape to hide the Swatches panel.
            


 Note: Going forward, you'll find you need to hide panels such as the Fill color panel before
                  you continue. You can press Escape to do this.
               



Editing strokes
      
A stroke can be the visible outline (border) of artwork like shapes and paths. There
         are a lot of appearance properties you can change for a stroke, including width, color,
         dashes, and more. In this section, you'll adjust the stroke of the rectangle.
      

 Note: Learn more about working with strokes in Lesson 3, "Using Shapes to Create Artwork for a Postcard."
         



With the rectangle still selected, click the color box () to the left of the word "Stroke" in the Properties panel. In the panel that appears,
               make sure the Swatches option () is selected to show the default colors that come with the document. Click to apply
               a medium gray color.
            



Click the word "Stroke" in the Properties panel to open the Stroke panel. Change the
               following options:
            


Stroke Weight: 3 pt


Align Stroke: Align Stroke to Outside ()
                  


Dashed Line: Selected


Dash: 50 pt, Gap: 3 pt. After typing the Gap value, press Enter or Return.
                  





Choose Object > Lock > Selection to temporarily lock the rectangle so that it can't
               be selected.
            


Working with layers

 Note: Learn more about working with layers and the Layers panel in Lesson 9, "Organizing Your Artwork with Layers."
         

Layers allow you to organize and more easily select artwork. Next, using the Layers
         panel, you'll start to organize your artwork.
      


Choose Window > Layers to show the Layers panel to the right of the document.



Double-click the text "Layer 1" (the layer name) in the Layers panel. Type Background, and press Return or Enter to change the layer name.
            
Naming layers can be helpful when organizing content. Currently, the rectangle you
               created is on this layer.
            


Click the Create New Layer button () at the bottom of the Layers panel to create a new, blank layer.
            


Double-click the new layer name, Layer 2, and type Content. Press Return or Enter to change the layer name.
            



Click the Content layer to make sure it's selected in the Layers panel. Any new artwork
               will be put on the selected layer.
            


Transforming artwork
In Illustrator, there are a number of ways to move, rotate, skew, scale, distort,
         and shear (and more) artwork so you can get it just the way you want. This is called
         transforming artwork and is something you'll do next to a building icon you create.
      

 Note: Learn more about transforming artwork in Lesson 5, "Transforming Artwork."
         



Select the Line Segment tool () in the Tools panel on the left. In the middle of the artboard, to create a line,
               drag from left to right. As you drag, press and hold the Shift key to make the line
               straight. When you see a D (Distance) of 1.5 inches in the gray label next to the
               pointer, release the mouse button and then the key.
            



Press the letter D to set the default fill color (white), stroke color (black), and
               stroke weight (1 pt) for the line.
            


Choose View > Zoom In twice to zoom in to the selected line.


Click the Properties panel tab on the right side of the workspace to see the Properties
               panel. Change the stroke weight of the selected line by choosing 14 pt from the stroke
               weight menu.
            


 Tip: You can also choose Window > Properties to open the Properties panel.
               



Move the pointer just above the line and drag from the left edge of the line to the
               right, while pressing the Shift key, to create a straight line. Release the mouse
               button and then the key.
            



Change the stroke weight of the new line to 3 pt in the Properties panel by choosing
               it from the stroke weight menu. Now you'll make copies of the line.
            


With the line selected, choose Object > Transform > Move. In the Move dialog box,
               change the Vertical value to -0.3. Select Preview and then click Copy.
            



Choose Object > Transform > Transform Again to repeat the last Move transformation
               on the selected line, and make another copy of the line.
            


With the last line copy selected, select the Rotate tool () in the Tools panel on the left. Click the left end of the line to set a point to
               rotate around there (see the first part of the following figure). Move the pointer
               to the right of the line and drag counterclockwise to rotate the line a little. When
               you see an angle of around 10 degrees in the gray label next to the pointer, stop
               dragging.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


Creating a blend
      

 Note: Learn more about working with blends in Lesson 10, "Gradients, Blends, and Patterns."
         

You can blend two distinct objects to create and distribute shapes evenly between
         two objects. For instance, to create a fence, you could blend two rectangles together,
         and Illustrator will create all the copies between the two original rectangles. Next,
         you'll create the rest of the building icon using a blend.
      


Select the Line Segment tool () in the Tools panel again. Move the pointer over the top line you rotated (see the
               first part of the following figure). Drag straight down to create a new line. As you
               drag, press and hold the Shift key to make it straight. When the pointer reaches the
               bottom thinner line, release the mouse button and then the key.
            



Change the stroke weight to 1 in the Properties panel to the right.
            


Position the pointer over the center widget (the center circle) of the selected line.
               When the pointer changes (), press and hold Option+Shift (macOS) or Alt+Shift (Windows), and drag to the right.
               Drag until you almost reach the right end of the lines. Release the mouse button and
               then release the keys.
            



Move the pointer over the top of the new line and drag straight up to extend the line
               to the top line. When the line you are extending touches the top line, the word "intersect"
               may appear.
            


 Tip: There are lots of keyboard commands that can help you work more efficiently in Illustrator.
                  The Option (Alt) key copies a shape, and the Shift key constrains the movement to
                  0, 45, or 90 degrees.
               



Double-click the Blend tool () in the Tools panel to set a few settings for the tool. In the Blend Options dialog
               box, choose Specified Steps from the Spacing menu, and change the value to the right
               to 5. Click OK.
            



Click the vertical line on the left when you see the cursor look like this: . Then click the vertical line to the right when the cursor looks like this: . This creates a blend of the two lines, with five copies between them.
            



Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and drag across all of the artwork for the building icon. Click
               the Group button in the Properties panel to keep it all together and treat it as a
               single object.
            



Drawing with the Pencil tool

 Note: Learn more about working with the Pencil tool and other drawing tools in Lesson 6, "Creating an Illustration with the Drawing Tools."
         

The Pencil tool () lets you draw freeform paths that contain curves and straight lines. The paths you
         draw with the Pencil tool are editable later. Now you'll draw a bush with the Pencil
         tool.
      


Click and hold down on the Shaper tool () in the Tools panel on the left, and in the tools menu that appears, select the Pencil
               tool ().
            

For the next step, don't worry about matching what you see in the figures. Just have
               some fun.
            


To the left of the building icon, click and drag to create a bush. When the pointer
               approaches where you started drawing, a circle will appear next to the Pencil tool
               (), indicating that the path will be closed. Release the mouse button to close the
               path. Leave the path selected.
            



Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel to the right to reveal a panel. Make
               sure that the Swatches option () is selected, and click to apply a blue/green color to the fill of the shape.
            



Change the stroke weight to 0 below the fill color in the Properties panel.
            


Select the Selection tool in the Tools panel, and drag the bush shape to the left
               of the building icon. Press the Shift key and drag a corner of the box around the
               bush, called a bounding box, to scale it in proportion to the building icon (see the figure for sizing). When
               finished resizing, release the mouse button and then the key.
            


 Note: The Shift key maintains the proportions of the artwork as you scale it.
               



With the bush selected, choose Edit > Copy and then Edit > Paste. Drag the bush copy
               to the right of the building icon.
            


Click the Flip Along Horizontal Axis option () in the Properties panel.
            



Drag across the building icon and the two bush shapes to select them. Choose Object
               > Group to keep them together.
            


 Tip: You could have also clicked the Group button in the Properties panel like you did
                  earlier in the lesson.
               



Creating shapes using the Shape Builder tool
      

 Note: Learn more about working with the Shape Builder tool in Lesson 4, "Editing and Combining Shapes and Paths."
         

The Shape Builder tool () is an interactive tool for creating complex shapes by merging and erasing simpler
         shapes. Next, you'll make a cloud by creating a few circles and using the Shape Builder
         tool to combine them.
      


Click and hold down on the Rectangle tool () in the Tools panel on the left. Select the Ellipse tool () in the menu that appears.
            


Press and hold the Shift key, and drag above the building icon and bushes. When the
               gray measurement label next to the pointer shows a height and width of 1 inch, release
               the mouse button and then the Shift key to create a perfect circle.
            



With the circle selected, choose Edit > Copy and then Edit > Paste to paste a copy.
               Choose Edit > Paste two more times to create a few more copies.
            


Select the Selection tool (), and drag each of the circles on top of one another into a cloud shape.
            



With a circle selected, drag a corner of the bounding box around the circle to make
               it smaller. Do the same for a few of the other circles, making them all different
               sizes. Drag to arrange them into a cloud shape.
            



Move the pointer above and to the left of the circles. Drag across all of the circles
               to select them.
            


Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel to the right, make sure the Swatches
               option () is selected, and click white to apply it. Leave the circles selected.
            



Select the Shape Builder tool () in the Tools panel on the left. Position the pointer to the left and above all of
               the selected circles (see the red X in the figure). Press the Shift key and drag to
               the right and down across all the selected circles. Release the mouse button and then
               the Shift key to combine the shapes.
            



Choose Object > Hide > Selection to temporarily hide the cloud.


Choose File > Save.

 Note: On macOS, if you don't see the Link option in the dialog box, click the Options button.
         

In Illustrator, you can place raster images, like JPEG and Adobe Photoshop® files, and either link to them or embed them. Next, you'll place an image of hand-drawn
         text.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Choose File > Place. In the Place dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson00 folder,
               and select the HandLettering.psd file. Make sure that the Link option in the dialog
               box is selected, and click Place.
            



With the loaded graphics cursor, click in the upper-left corner of the rectangle to
               place the image. Leave it selected.
            



Using Image Trace
      

 Note: Learn more about Image Trace in Lesson 3, "Using Shapes to Create Artwork for a Postcard."
         

You can use Image Trace to convert raster images into vector artwork. Next, you'll
         trace the Photoshop file you just placed.
      


With the hand-lettering image still selected, click the Image Trace button in the
               Properties panel to the right and choose Black and White Logo from the menu.
            



Click the Image Trace panel button () in the Properties panel. In the Image Trace panel that opens, click the toggle arrow
               to the left of Advanced (circled in the following figure). Select Ignore White near
               the bottom of the panel to remove the white. Close the Image Trace panel by clicking
               the small X at the top.
            


 Tip: Another method for converting the hand-drawn lettering is by using the Adobe Capture{{#}}0174;
                  CC app. To learn more about Adobe Capture, visit http://www.adobe.com/products/capture.html.

               of the Properties panel to make the object a series of editable vector shapes that
               are grouped together.
            

 Note: The hand lettering for this project was created by Danielle Fritz (www.behance.net/danielle_fritz).
               



Select the Selection tool (). Move the pointer onto the lettering and drag it so that it's above the building
               icon and bushes, if it isn't already. Leave the hand-lettering shapes selected.
            



Creating and editing gradients
      

 Note: Learn more about working with gradients in Lesson 10, "Gradients, Blends, and Patterns."
         

Gradients are color blends of two or more colors that you can apply to the fill or stroke of
         artwork. Next, you will apply a gradient to the lettering.
      


With the lettering still selected, click the Fill color box in the Properties panel
               to the right, make sure the Swatches option () is selected, and select the white-to-black swatch with the tooltip "White, Black."
               Leave the panel with the swatches showing.
            



At the bottom of the panel with the swatches, click the Gradient Options button to
               open the Gradient panel. An arrow is pointing to the button in the previous figure.
            
You may need to drag the Gradient panel by the title bar at the top to see the whole
               thing.
            


In the Gradient panel, click the Fill box to make sure you are editing the fill (circled
               in the following figure). Double-click the little white color stop () on the left side of the gradient slider in the Gradient panel (an arrow is pointing

               "C=0, M=0, Y=0, K=70."
            



Press the Escape key to hide the color swatches.


Select the Gradient tool () in the Tools panel on the left. While pressing the Shift key, starting at the red
               X in the figure, click and drag down across the lettering to reposition and resize
               the gradient. Release the mouse button and then the key.
            


Choose Select > Deselect, and click the X at the top of the Gradient panel to close
               it.
            



Working with type

 Note: Learn more about working with type in Lesson 8, "Adding Type to a Poster."
         

Next, you'll add some text to the project and change the formatting. You'll choose
         a Typekit font that requires an Internet connection. If you don't have an Internet
         connection, you can simply choose another font you have.
      


Select the Type tool () in the Tools panel on the left, and click in a blank area at the top of the artboard,
               above the "THE LOFTS" lettering. A text area will appear with the selected placeholder
               text, "Lorem ipsum." Type on59th (with no space between "on" and "59th").
            



With the cursor still in the text, choose Select > All to select all of the text.


In the Properties panel to the right, click the Fill color box. In the panel that
               appears, make sure the Swatches option is selected, and click to select the darker
               gray swatch with the tooltip "C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=70."
            



In the Character section of the Properties panel, select the font size, and type 20. Press Return or Enter to accept the size change.

Choose Select > Deselect.


Working with brushes

 Note: Learn more about working with brushes in Lesson 11, "Using Brushes to Create a Poster."
         

Brushes let you stylize the appearance of paths. You can apply brush strokes to existing
         paths, or you can use the Paintbrush tool () to draw a path and apply a brush stroke simultaneously.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, click in the gray rectangle in the background to select it.
            


Choose Window > Brush Libraries > Borders > Borders_Lines to open the Borders_Lines
               collection of brushes in a panel.
            


Click the brush named "Multilines 1.4" in the panel to apply it to the stroke of the
               shape.
            


Click the X in the corner of the Borders_Lines panel to close it.


Choose Select > Deselect.


 Note: The brush you apply is a pattern brush, which means that it repeats artwork (in this
                  case) along the path. The brush artwork is scaled on the path based on the stroke
                  weight.
               



Working with symbols
      

 Note: Learn more about working with symbols in Lesson 13, "Creating Artwork for a T-Shirt."
         

A symbol is reusable art stored in the Symbols panel. Symbols are useful because they can
         help you save time and can save on file size as well. You will now create a symbol
         from the cloud artwork.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, choose Object > Show All to see the cloud. The cloud shape should be selected.
            


Choose Window > Symbols to open the Symbols panel. Click the New Symbol button () at the bottom of the panel to save the selected cloud as a symbol.
            


In the Symbol Options dialog box that appears, name the symbol Cloud, and click OK. If a warning dialog box appears, click OK as well.
            

The artwork now appears as a saved symbol in the Symbols panel, and the cloud on the
               artboard you used to create the symbol is now a symbol instance.
            


From the Symbols panel, drag the cloud symbol thumbnail onto the artboard three times and arrange them however you like in the background. Click the X at the top of the
               Symbols panel group to close it.
            


 Note: Your cloud symbol instances may be in different locations than those in the figure.
                  That's okay.
               




Resize a few of clouds, making them different sizes, by dragging a corner of the symbol
               instance with the Shift key held down. Release the mouse button and then the key.
            


Double-click one of the cloud instances on the artboard to enter Isolation mode. In
               the dialog box that appears, click OK.
            

 Tip: You could have also clicked the Edit Symbol button in the Properties panel to the
                  right of the document.
               



Click to select the cloud shape. Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel
               to the right of the document with the Color Mixer option () selected so you can see the CMYK sliders. Change the values to C=20, M=0, Y=0, K=0 to create a light blue color. Press the Escape key to hide the panel.
            



Double-click in a blank area of the document window to exit the editing (Isolation)
               mode, and notice that the other clouds have changed as well.
            


Click one of the cloud instances on the artboard, and choose Select > Same > Symbol
               Instance to select all of them. Choose Object > Group.
            


Click the Arrange button in the Properties panel, and choose Send To Back.



Working with effects

 Note: Learn more about effects in Lesson 12, "Exploring Creative Uses of Effects and Graphic Styles."
         


 Note: Choose the Stylize option in the Illustrator Effects section of the Effect menu.
         

Effects alter the appearance of an object without changing the base object. Next,
         you'll apply a subtle Drop Shadow effect to the lettering you traced earlier.
      


With the Selection tool (), click the "THE LOFTS" lettering.
            



Click the Effect option () in the Properties panel on the right, and choose Stylize > Drop Shadow. In the Drop
               Shadow dialog box, set the following options (if necessary):
            


Mode: Multiply (the default setting)
                  


Opacity: 10%


X Offset and Y Offset: 0.1 in


Blur: 0

To make the most of the extensive drawing, painting, and editing capabilities of Adobe
         Illustrator CC, it's important to learn how to navigate the workspace. The workspace
         consists of the Application bar, menus, Tools panel, Properties panel, Document window,
         and other default panels.
      
Introducing Adobe Illustrator
      
In Illustrator, you primarily create and work with vector graphics (sometimes called
         vector shapes or vector objects). Vector graphics are made up of lines and curves defined by mathematical objects called vectors. You can freely move or modify vector graphics without losing detail or clarity because
         they are resolution-independent.
      

An example of vector artwork.

Editing vector artwork.
In other words, vector graphics maintain crisp edges when they are resized, printed
         to a PostScript printer, saved in a PDF file, or imported into a vector-based graphics
         application. As a result, vector graphics are the best choice for artwork, such as
         logos, that will be used at various sizes and in various output media.
      

 Tip: To learn more about bitmap graphics, search for "Importing bitmap images" in Illustrator
            Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
         

Illustrator also allows you to incorporate bitmap images—technically called raster images—that use a rectangular grid of picture elements (pixels) to represent the visual.
         Each pixel is assigned a specific location and color value. Pictures you take on your
         phone camera are considered raster images. Raster images can be created and edited
         in a program like Adobe Photoshop.
      

Example of a raster image and a zoomed-in portion to show the pixels.
Starting Illustrator and opening a file
      
In this first lesson, you'll begin by exploring Illustrator. You'll open a few art
         files during this lesson, but before you begin, you'll restore the default preferences
         for Adobe Illustrator CC. This is something you will do at the start of each lesson
         in this book to ensure that the tools function and the defaults are set exactly as
         described in this lesson.
      


To delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CC preferences file, see
               "Restoring default preferences" in the "Getting Started" section at the beginning
               of the book.
            

 Note: If finding the preferences file proves difficult, please contact me at brian@brianwoodtraining.com for assistance.
               



Double-click the Adobe Illustrator CC icon to launch Adobe Illustrator.
With Illustrator open, you will see a start screen showing resources for Illustrator,
               and more.
            


Choose File > Open or click the Open button in the Start screen. In the Lessons >
               Lesson01 folder on your hard disk, select the L1_start1.ai file, and click Open. You
               will use the L1_start1.ai file to practice navigating, zooming, and investigating
               an Illustrator document and the workspace.
            

 Note: If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson to your computer
                  from your Account page, make sure to do so now. See the "Getting Started" section
                  at the beginning of the book.
               


 Note: If a Tour window appears after opening the document, you can simply close it. Do
                  the same thing going forward for each lesson.
               



Choose Window > Workspace > Essentials, make sure it's selected, and then choose Window
               > Workspace > Reset Essentials to reset the workspace.
            
The Reset Essentials command ensures that the workspace, which includes all of the
               tools and panels, is set to the default settings.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
An artboard is the area that contains your printable artwork and is similar to a page
               in Adobe InDesign®. This command fits the whole artboard into the Document window so that you can see
               the entire artboard.
            

When the file is open and Illustrator is fully launched, the menus, Application bar,
               Tools panel, and panels appear on the screen.
            


Exploring the workspace
      

 Note: The figures in this lesson are taken using the macOS operating system and may look
            slightly different from what you see, especially if you are using Windows.
         

You create and manipulate your documents and files using various elements, such as
         panels, bars, and windows. Any arrangement of these elements is called a workspace. When you first start Illustrator, you see the default workspace, which you can customize
         for the tasks you perform. You can create and save multiple workspaces—one for editing
         and another for viewing, for example—and switch among them as you work.
      
Below, the areas of the default workspace are described:



The Application bar across the top by default contains application controls, the Workspace Switcher,
               and Search. On Windows, the menu items appear inline with the Application bar—see the following figure.
            



Panels help you monitor and modify your work. Certain panels are displayed by default, and
               you can display any panel by choosing it from the Window menu.
            


The Tools panel contains tools for creating and editing images, artwork, page elements, and more.
               Related tools are grouped together.
            


The Document window displays the file(s) you're working on.
            


The Status bar appears at the lower-left edge of the Document window. It displays information, zooming,
               and navigation controls.
            


Getting to know the Tools panel
      
The Tools panel on the left side of the workspace contains tools for selecting, drawing
         and painting, editing, and viewing, as well as the Fill and Stroke boxes, drawing
         modes, and screen modes. As you work through the lessons, you'll learn about the specific
         function of many of these tools.
      

 Note: The Tools panel shown here and throughout this lesson has two columns. You may see
            a one-column Tools panel, depending on your screen resolution and workspace.
         




Position the pointer over the Selection tool () in the Tools panel. Notice that the name (Selection Tool) and keyboard shortcut
               (V) are displayed in a tooltip.
            

 Tip: You can modify the default keyboard shortcuts that Illustrator comes with. To do
                  this, choose Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts. For more information, see "Keyboard Shortcuts"
                  in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
               


 Tip: You can turn the tooltips on or off by choosing Illustrator CC > Preferences > General
                  (macOS) or Edit > Preferences > General (Windows) and deselecting Show Tool Tips.
               




Move the pointer over the Direct Selection tool (), and click and hold down the mouse button until a tools menu appears. Release the
               mouse button and then click the Group Selection tool to select it.
            
Any tool in the Tools panel that displays a small triangle contains additional tools
               that can be selected in this way.
            



Click and hold down the mouse button on the Rectangle tool () to reveal more tools. Click the arrow at the right edge of the hidden tools panel
               to separate the tools from the Tools panel so that you can access them at all times.
            

 Tip: You can also select hidden tools by pressing the Option key (macOS) or the Alt key
                  (Windows) and clicking the tool in the Tools panel. Each click selects the next hidden
                  tool in the tool sequence.
               





Click the Close button (X) in the upper-left corner (macOS) or upper-right corner
               (Windows) on the floating tool panel's title bar to close it. The tools return to
               the Tools panel.
            

 Tip: You can also collapse the floating tool panels or dock them to the workspace or each
                  other.
               

Next, you'll learn how to resize and float the Tools panel. In the figures in this
               lesson, the Tools panel is a double column by default. As I said before, you may see
               a single-column Tools panel to start with, depending on your screen resolution and
               workspace, and that's okay.
            


Click the double arrow in the upper-left corner of the Tools panel to either expand
               the one column into two columns or collapse the two columns into one (depending on
               your screen resolution).
            



Click the same double arrow again to expand (or collapse) the Tools panel.


Click the dark gray title bar at the top of the Tools panel or the dashed line beneath
               the title bar, and drag the Tools panel into the workspace. The Tools panel is now
               floating in the workspace.
            


 Tip: You can click the double arrow at the top of the Tools panel or double-click the
                  title bar at the top of the Tools panel to switch between two columns and one column.
                  Just be careful not to click the X or it will close! If you close it, choose Window
                  > Tools > Default to open it again.
               



To dock the Tools panel again, drag its title bar or the dashed line below it to the
               left side of the Application window. When the pointer reaches the left edge, a translucent
               blue border, called the drop zone, appears. Release the mouse button to dock the Tools panel neatly into the side of
               the workspace.
            




Custom tools panels
         
You may find yourself using a specific set of tools most of the time. In Illustrator,
            you can create custom tools panels that contain the tools you use most often.
         
By choosing Window > Tools > New Tools Panel, you can create a custom tools panel.
            They are saved with Illustrator and can be closed and opened, regardless of which
            document is open. They are free-floating and can also be docked and saved in a custom
            workspace you create.
         
Each new custom tools panel has stroke and fill controls at the bottom and a plus
            sign (+) where you can drag copies of tools from the main Tools panel onto the custom
            panel you are creating and drag them off to remove it.
         


Working with the Properties panel
When starting Illustrator for the first time and opening a document, you'll see the
         Properties panel on the right side of the workspace. The Properties panel displays
         properties for the active document when nothing is selected, and appearance properties
         for content you select. It puts all of the most commonly used options in one place,
         and it's a panel you will be using quite a bit.
      


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and look in the Properties panel on the right.
            
At the top of the Properties panel, you will see "No Selection." This is called the
               Selection Indicator and is a great place to look and see what type of content is selected
               (if any). The properties in the Properties panel are currently for the current document
               properties and program preferences.
            



Move the pointer into the blue background in the artwork, and click to select it.
            

In the Properties panel, you should now see appearance options for the selected artwork.
               You can change the size, position, color, and much more for the artwork you selected.
               The artwork selected is a rectangle, as indicated by "Rectangle" at the top of the
               panel.
            


Click the underlined word "Opacity" in the Properties panel to open the Transparency
               panel options. Words that are underlined in the Properties panel will show more options
               when you click them.
            



Press Escape to hide the Transparency panel, if necessary.



Choose Select > Deselect to deselect the rectangle.
The Properties panel once again shows the default properties when nothing is selected.


Working with panels
      
Panels in Illustrator, like the Properties panel, give you quick access to many of
         the tools and options that make modifying artwork easier. All of the panels available
         in Illustrator are listed alphabetically in the Window menu. Next, you'll experiment
         with hiding, closing, and opening panels.
      


Click the Layers panel tab to the right of the Properties panel tab.

The Layers panel appears with two other panels—the Properties panel and the Libraries
               panel. They are all part of the same panel group.
            

 Tip: To find a hidden panel, choose the panel name from the Window menu. A checkmark to
                  the left of the panel name indicates that the panel is already open and in front of
                  other panels in its panel group. If you choose a panel name that is already selected
                  in the Window menu, the panel and its group either close or collapse.
               



Click the double arrow at the top of the dock to collapse the panels.

 Tip: To expand or collapse the panel dock, you can also double-click the panel dock title
                  bar at the top.
               


You can use this method of collapsing the panels so you have more area to work on
               your document.
            


Drag the left edge of the docked panels to the right until the panel text disappears.

This hides the panel names and collapses the panel dock to icons only. In order to
               open a panel when collapsed as an icon, you can click a panel icon.
            


Click the double arrow again to expand the panels.



Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials to reset the workspace.


Docking panels
Panels in Illustrator can be moved around in the workspace and organized to match
         your working needs. Next, you'll open a new panel and dock it with the default panels
         on the right side of the workspace.
      


Click the Window menu at the top of the screen to see all of the panels available
               in Illustrator. Choose Align in the Window menu to open the Align panel and the other
               panels grouped with it by default.
            
Panels you open that do not appear in the default workspace are free-floating. That
               means they are not docked and can be moved around. You can dock free-floating panels
               on the right or left side of the workspace.
            


Drag the Align panel group by the title bar above the panel names to position the
               group closer to the docked panels on the right.
            

Next, you'll dock the Align panel with the Properties panel.


Drag the Align panel tab away from the panel group and onto the panel tabs (Properties,
               Layers, and Libraries) at the top of the docked panels. When a blue highlight appears
               around the entire panel dock, release the mouse button to dock the panel.
            



Click the X at the top of the Transform and Pathfinder panel group, which is free-floating,
               to close it.
            

 Tip: You can also dock panels next to each other on the right or left side of the workspace.
                  This is a great way to conserve space.
               


Aside from adding panels to the dock on the right, you can also remove them.


Drag the Align panel by the panel tab, to the left, away from the dock of panels,
               and release the mouse button.
            



Click the X at the top of the Align panel to close it.


Click the Libraries panel tab on the right to show that panel, if it isn't already.


Switching workspaces
      
When you first launch Illustrator, the Essentials workspace is showing. Illustrator
         comes with a host of other default workspaces that can be used to set the workspace
         for a variety of tasks. Next, you'll switch workspaces to another default workspace
         to learn about some new panels.
      


Click the workspace switcher in the Application bar above the docked panels to change
               the workspace.
            

 Tip: Press Tab to toggle between hiding and showing all panels. You can hide or show all
                  panels at once, except for the Tools panel, by pressing Shift+Tab to toggle between
                  hide and show.
               

You'll see a number of workspaces listed, each with a specific purpose, that will
               open panels and arrange the workspace to make it most conducive to that type of work.
            


Choose Layout from the workspace switcher menu to switch workspaces.

You'll notice a few major changes in the workspace. One of the biggest is the Control
               panel that's now docked at the top of the workspace, just above the Document window
               (an arrow is pointing to it in the following figure). Similar to the Properties panel,
               it offers quick access to options, commands, and other panels relevant to the currently
               selected content.
            

Also, notice all of the collapsed panel icons on the right side of the workspace.
               In workspaces like Essential, you can create groups of panels that are stacked one
               on another. This way, you can have a lot more panels showing.
            


Choose Essentials from the workspace switcher above the docked panels to switch back
               to the Essentials workspace.
            


Choose Reset Essentials from the workspace switcher in the Application bar.
When you choose a previous workspace to switch to, it remembers any changes you made,
               like selecting the Libraries panel. To completely reset a workspace, Essentials in
               this case, to the default settings, you can choose to reset it.
            


Saving a workspace
So far, in this lesson, you've reset the workspace and chosen a different workspace.
         You can also set up the panels the way you like and save your own custom workspace.
         Next, you'll dock a new panel and create your own workspace.
      


Choose Window > Artboards to open the Artboards panel group.


Drag the Artboards panel by the panel tab onto the Properties panel tab at the top
               of the dock on the right. When a blue highlight appears around the entire panel dock,
               release the mouse button to dock the Artboards panel.
            

 Note: To delete saved workspaces, choose Window > Workspace > Manage Workspaces. Select
                  the workspace name, and click the Delete Workspace button.
               


 Tip: To change a saved workspace, reset the panels as you'd like them to appear and then
                  choose Window > Workspace > New Workspace. In the New Workspace dialog box, name the
                  workspace with the original name. A message appears in the dialog box warning that
                  you will overwrite an existing workspace with the same name if you click OK.
               



Click the X at the top of the free-floating Asset Export panel to close it.



Choose Window > Workspace > New Workspace. Change Name to My Workspace in the New Workspace dialog box, and click OK.
            
The name of the workspace could be anything, as long as it makes sense to you. The
               workspace named "My Workspace" is now saved with Illustrator until you remove it.
            


Choose Window > Workspace > Essentials.


Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
Notice that the panels return to their default positions.


Choose Window > Workspace > My Workspace. Toggle between the two workspaces using
               the Window > Workspace command, and return to the Essentials workspace before starting
               the next exercise.
            


Using panel and context menus
      
Most panels in Illustrator have more options available in a panel menu, found by clicking
         the panel menu icon ( or ) in the upper-right corner of a panel. These additional options can be used to change
         the panel display, add or change panel content, and more. Next, you'll change the
         display of the Swatches panel using its panel menu.
      


With the Selection tool () selected in the Tools panel on the left, click the blue shape in the background
               of the artwork again.
            


Click the Fill color box, to the left of the word "Fill," in the Properties panel.



In the panel that appears, make sure that the Swatches option () is selected. Click the panel menu icon () in the upper-right corner, and choose Small List View from the panel menu.
            

This displays the swatch names, together with thumbnails. Because the options in the
               panel menu apply only to the active panel, only the Swatches panel view is affected.
            


Click the same panel menu icon () in the panel showing, and choose Small Thumbnail View to return the swatches to
               their original view.
            
In addition to the panel menus, context-sensitive menus display commands relevant
               to the active tool, selection, or panel. Usually the commands in a context menu are
               available in another part of the workspace, but using a context menu can save you
               time.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.
            



Position the pointer over the dark gray area surrounding the white area of the artboard.
               Then, right-click to show a context menu with specific options.
            
The context-sensitive menu you see may contain different commands, depending on what
               the pointer is positioned over.
            

 Note: If you position the pointer over the tab or title bar for a panel and right-click,
                  you can close a panel or a panel group in the context menu that appears.
               




Adjusting the user-interface brightness
Similar to Adobe InDesign or Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator supports a brightness adjustment
            for the application user interface. This is a program preference setting that allows
            you to choose a brightness setting from four preset levels.
         
To edit the user-interface brightness, you can choose Illustrator CC > Preferences
            > User Interface (macOS) or Edit > Preferences > User Interface (Windows).
         


Changing the view of artwork
      
When working in files, it's likely that you'll need to change the magnification level
         and navigate among artboards. The magnification level, which can range from 3.13%
         to 64000%, is displayed in the title bar (or document tab) next to the filename and
         in the lower-left corner of the Document window.
      
There are a lot of ways to change the zoom level in Illustrator, and in this section
         you'll explore several of the most widely used methods.
      
Using view commands
To enlarge or reduce the view of artwork using the View menu, do one of the following:


Choose View > Zoom In to enlarge the display of the artwork.


Choose View > Zoom Out to reduce the view of the artwork.



 Tip: You can also zoom in using the keyboard shortcut Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows).
            That's Command and + (macOS) or Ctrl and + (Windows). You can also zoom out using the keyboard shortcut Command+- (macOS)
            or Ctrl+- (Windows). That's Command and - (macOS) or Ctrl and - (Windows).
         

Each time you choose a Zoom option, the view of the artwork is resized to the closest
         preset zoom level. Using any of the viewing tools and commands affects only the display
         of the artwork, not the actual size of the artwork. The preset zoom levels appear
         in a menu in the lower-left corner of the Document window, identified by a down arrow
         next to a percentage. If you have artwork selected, using the View > Zoom In view
         command will zoom into what is selected.
      
You can also use the View menu to fit the active artboard to your screen, to fit all artboards into the view area, or to view artwork
         at actual size. The active artboard is the selected artboard. Artboards represent
         the regions that can contain printable artwork (similar to pages in a program like
         Adobe InDesign). The artboard is indicated by a red line I added to the following
         figure.
      



Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
            

 Tip: You can also double-click the Hand tool () in the Tools panel to fit the active artboard in the Document window.
               


 Tip: You can also double-click the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel to display artwork at 100%.
               

By choosing View > Fit Artboard In Window or by using the keyboard shortcut Command+0
               (macOS) or Ctrl+0 (Windows), the artboard is centered in the Document window.
            


Choose View > Actual Size to display the artwork at actual size.
The artwork is displayed at 100%. The actual size of your artwork determines how much
               of it can be viewed onscreen at 100%.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window before continuing to the next section.


Using the Zoom tool
In addition to the View menu options, you can use the Zoom tool () to magnify and reduce the view of artwork to predefined magnification levels.
      


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel and then move the pointer into the Document window.
            
Notice that a plus sign (+) appears at the center of the Zoom tool pointer.


Position the Zoom tool over the text "Maui" in the center of the artboard and click
               once.
            

The artwork is displayed at a higher magnification. Notice that where you clicked
               is now in the center of the Document window.
            


Click two more times on the Maui text. The view is increased again, and you'll notice
               that the area you clicked is magnified.
            


With the Zoom tool still selected, hold down the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key.
               A minus sign (-) appears at the center of the Zoom tool pointer. With the Option or
               Alt key pressed, click the artwork twice to reduce the view of the artwork.
            
Using the Zoom tool, you can also drag in the document to zoom in and out. By default,
               if your computer meets the system requirements for GPU Performance and it's enabled,
               zooming is animated. To find out if your computer meets the system requirements, see
               the sidebar titled "GPU Performance" following this section.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


With the Zoom tool still selected, click and drag from the left side of the document
               to the right to zoom in. The zooming is animated. Drag from right to left to zoom
               out.
            

 Note: If your computer does not meet the system requirements for GPU Performance, you will instead draw a dotted
                  rectangle, called a marquee, when dragging with the Zoom tool.
               


 Tip: With the Zoom tool selected, if you move the pointer into the Document window and
                  press the mouse button for a few seconds, you can zoom in using the animated zoom.
                  Once again, this will work if your computer meets the system requirements for GPU
                  Performance and it's enabled.
               


 Note: In certain versions of macOS, the keyboard shortcuts for the Zoom tool () open Spotlight or the Finder. If you decide to use these shortcuts in Illustrator,
                  you may want to turn off or change those keyboard shortcuts in the macOS System Preferences.
               




Double-click the Hand tool () in the Tools panel to fit the artboard in the Document window.
            
The Zoom tool is used frequently during the editing process to enlarge and reduce
               the view of artwork. Because of this, Illustrator allows you to select it using the
               keyboard at any time without first deselecting any other tool you may be using.
            


To access the Zoom tool using your keyboard, press Command+spacebar (macOS) or Ctrl+spacebar
                     (Windows).
                  


To access the Zoom Out tool using your keyboard, press Command+Option+spacebar (macOS)
                     or Ctrl+Alt+spacebar (Windows).
                  





GPU Performance
The graphics processing unit (GPU), found on video cards and part of display systems,
            is a specialized processor that can rapidly execute commands for manipulating and
            displaying images. GPU-accelerated computing offers faster performance across a broad
            range of design, animation, and video applications.
         
The GPU Performance in Illustrator feature has a preview mode called GPU Preview,
            which enables rendering of Illustrator artwork on the graphics processor.
         
This feature is available on compatible Mac and Windows computers. This feature is
            turned on by default for documents, and options can be accessed in Preferences by
            clicking the GPU Performance icon in the Application bar.
         

To learn more about GPU performance, visit https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/kb/gpu-performance-preview-improvements.html.
         

Scrolling through a document
      
In Illustrator, you can use the Hand tool () to pan to different areas of a document. Using the Hand tool allows you to push
         the document around much like you would a piece of paper on your desk. This can be
         a very useful way to move around in a document with a lot of artboards or when you
         are zoomed in. In this section, you'll access the Hand tool using a few methods.
      


With the Hand tool () selected in the Tools panel, drag down in the Document window. As you drag, the
               artwork moves with the hand.
            
As with the Zoom tool (), you can select the Hand tool with a keyboard shortcut without first deselecting
               the active tool.
            


Click any other tool except the Type tool () in the Tools panel, and move the pointer into the Document window. Hold down the
               spacebar on the keyboard to temporarily select the Hand tool and then drag to bring
               the artwork back into the center of your view.
            



 Note: The spacebar shortcut for the Hand tool () does not work when the Type tool () is active and the cursor is in text. To access the Hand tool when the cursor is in text, press
            the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key.
         


Touch workspace
In Adobe Illustrator CC, the Touch workspace is designed for touch-enabled devices
            on Windows 8 or newer. The touch layout has a cleaner interface that allows you to
            comfortably use a stylus or your fingertip to access the tools and controls of the
            Touch workspace.
         
You can create logos, create icons, explore custom lettering and typography, create
            UI wireframes, and more. The Touch workspace brings traditional drawing templates
            and French curves to the Illustrator workspace. These shapes project a scalable, movable
            outline that can be traced against to quickly create refined curves.
         
At any time (on a supported device), you can immediately switch between the Touch
            and traditional workspaces to access the full range of Illustrator tools and controls.
            For more information on working with touch devices and Illustrator, visit Help (Help
            > Illustrator Help).
         
On a touch device such as a Direct touch device (a touchscreen device), Indirect touch
            device (the trackpad on a Mac), a touchpad, or a Wacom Intuos5 (and later) device,
            you can also use standard touch gestures (pinch and swipe) to do the following:
         


Pinch in or out, using two fingers (like the thumb and forefinger) to zoom


Place two fingers on the document, and move the fingers together to pan within the
                  document
               


Swipe or flick to navigate artboards


In Artboard Editing mode, use two fingers to rotate the artboard by 90°



Viewing artwork
      
When you open a file, it is automatically displayed in Preview mode, which shows how
         the artwork will print. Illustrator offers other ways of viewing your artwork, such
         as outlines and rasterized. Next, you'll take a look at the different methods for
         viewing artwork and understand why you might view artwork that way.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
When you're working with large or complex illustrations, you may want to view only
               the outlines, or paths, of objects in your artwork so that the screen doesn't have to redraw the artwork
               each time you make a change. This is called Outline mode. Outline mode can also be
               helpful when selecting objects, as you will see in Lesson 2, "Techniques for Selecting Artwork."
            



Choose View > Outline.
Only the outlines of objects are displayed. You can use this view to find and select
               objects that might not be visible in Preview mode.
            

 Tip: You can press Command+Y (macOS) or Ctrl+Y (Windows) to toggle between Preview and
                  Outline modes.
               



With Outline mode still showing, choose View > GPU Preview (or View > Preview On CPU
               if GPU Preview is not supported) to see all the attributes of the artwork.
            



Choose View > Overprint Preview to view any lines or shapes that are set to overprint.
This view is helpful for those in the print industry who need to see how inks interact
               when set to overprint.
            

 Note: When switching between viewing modes, visual changes may not be readily apparent.
                  Zooming in and out (View > Zoom In and View > Zoom Out) may help you see the differences
                  more easily.
               



Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Choose 400% from the zoom level menu in the lower-left corner of the application window.



Choose View > Pixel Preview.
When you turn on Pixel preview, Overprint preview is turned off. Pixel preview can
               be used to see how the artwork will look when it is rasterized and viewed onscreen
               in a web browser. Note the "jagged" edge on some of the artwork. An arrow is pointing
               to it in the figure.
            


Choose View > Pixel Preview to turn off Pixel preview.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window to make sure that the entire active artboard
               is fit in the Document window, and leave the document open.
            



Zooming and panning with the Navigator panel
The Navigator panel is another way to navigate a document with a single artboard or
            multiple artboards. This is useful when you need to see all artboards in the document
            in one window and to edit content in any of those artboards in a zoomed-in view. You
            can open the Navigator panel by choosing Window > Navigator. It is in a free-floating
            group in the workspace.
         
The Navigator panel can be used in several ways, including the following:


The red box in the Navigator panel, called the proxy view area, indicates the area of the document that is being shown.
               


Type in a zoom value or click the mountain icons to change the magnification of your
                  artwork.
               


Position the pointer inside the proxy view area of the Navigator panel. When the pointer
                  becomes a hand (), drag to pan to different parts of the artwork.
               




Navigating artboards
      

 Note: Learn how to work more with artboards in Lesson 5, "Transforming Artwork."
         

Artboards represent the regions that can contain printable artwork (similar to pages
         in a program like Adobe InDesign). You can use artboards to crop areas for printing
         or placement purposes. Multiple artboards are useful for creating a variety of things,
         such as multipage PDFs, printed pages with different sizes or different elements,
         independent elements for websites, video storyboards, or individual items for animation
         in Adobe® Animate CC or Adobe After Effects® CC. You can easily share content among designs, create multipage PDFs, and print
         multiple pages by creating more than one artboard.
      
Illustrator allows for up to 1,000 artboards within a single file (depending on their
         size). Multiple artboards can be added when you initially create an Illustrator document,
         or you can add, remove, and edit artboards after the document is created. Next, you
         will learn how to efficiently navigate a document that contains multiple artboards.
      


Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson01 folder,
               and select the L1_start2.ai file on your hard disk. Click Open to open the file.
            


Choose View > Fit All In Window to fit all artboards in the Document window. Notice
               that there are two artboards in the document that contain the designs for the front
               and back of a postcard.
            

The artboards in a document can be arranged in any order, orientation, or artboard
               size—they can even overlap. Suppose that you want to create a four-page brochure.
               You can create different artboards for every page of the brochure, all with the same
               size and orientation. They can be arranged horizontally or vertically or in whatever
               way you like.
            


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and click to select the "HELLO FROM" text objects on the artboard
               on the right.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


When you select artwork, it makes the artboard that the artwork is on the active, or selected, artboard. By choosing the Fit Artboard In Window command, the currently
               active artboard is fit in the Document window. The active artboard is identified in
               the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document window. Currently
               it is artboard 2.
            


Choose Select > Deselect to deselect the text.



Choose 1 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the Properties panel.
Notice the arrows to the right of the Artboard Navigation menu in the Properties panel.
               You can use these to navigate to the previous () and next () artboards. Those arrows plus a few others also appear in the Status bar below the
               document.
            


Click the Next navigation button () in the Status bar below the document to view the next artboard (artboard 2) in the
               Document window.
            


 Note: You'll learn all about Artboard Editing mode in Lesson 5, "Transforming Artwork."
               

The Artboard Navigation menu and navigation arrows always appear in the Status bar
               below the document, but only appear in the Properties panel when not in Artboard Editing
               mode, the Selection tool is selected, and nothing is selected.
            


Using the Artboards panel
      
Another method for navigating multiple artboards is to use the Artboards panel. The
         Artboards panel lists all artboards currently in the document and allows you to navigate
         between artboards, rename artboards, add or delete artboards, edit artboard settings,
         and more. Next, you'll open the Artboards panel and navigate the document.
      


Choose Window > Artboards to open the Artboards panel.


Double-click the number 1 that appears to the left of the name "Front" in the Artboards
               panel. The artboard named Front is now fit in the Document window.
            


 Note: Double-clicking the artboard name in the Artboards panel allows you to change the
                  name of the artboard. Clicking the artboard icon ( or ) to the right of the artboard name in the panel allows you to edit artboard options.
               



Double-click the number 2 to the left of the name "Back" in the Artboards panel to
               show the second artboard in the Document window.
            

Notice that when you double-click to navigate to an artboard, that artboard is also
               fit in the Document window.
            


Click the X at the top of the Artboards panel group to close it.


Arranging multiple documents
      
There will be times when you open more than one Illustrator document at a time. When
         you open more than one document, the Document windows are tabbed. You can arrange
         the open documents in other ways, such as side by side, so that you can easily compare
         or drag items from one document to another. You can also use the Arrange Documents
         menu to quickly display your open documents in a variety of configurations.
      
You should currently have two Illustrator files open: L1_start1.ai and L1_start2.ai.
         Each file has its own tab at the top of the Document window. These documents are considered
         a group of Document windows. You can create document groups to loosely associate files
         while they are open.
      


Click the L1_start1.ai document tab to show L1_start1.ai in the Document window.


Drag the L1_start1.ai document tab to the right of the L1_start2.ai document tab.
               Release the mouse button to see the new tab order.
            

Dragging the document tabs allows you to change the order of the documents. This can
               be very useful if you use the document shortcuts to navigate to the next or previous
               document.
            

 Note: Be careful to drag directly to the right. Otherwise, you could undock the Document
                  window and create a new group. If that happens, choose Window > Arrange > Consolidate
                  All Windows.
               


 Tip: You can cycle between open documents by pressing Command+~ (next document) and Command+Shift+~
                  (previous document) (macOS) or by pressing Ctrl+F6 (next document) and Ctrl+Shift+F6
                  (previous document) (Windows).
               

To see both of the documents at the same time, maybe to drag artwork from one to the
               other, you can arrange the Document windows by cascading or tiling them. Cascading allows you to cascade (stack) different document groups. Tiling shows multiple Document windows at one time, in various arrangements. Next, you'll
               tile the open documents so that you can see both documents at one time.
            


Choose Window > Arrange > Tile.
This shows both Document windows arranged in a pattern.

 Note: On macOS, the Application Frame needs to be turned on (Window > Application Frame)
                  for tiling to work in this step.
               


 Note: Your documents may be tiled in a different order. That's okay.
               



Click in the Document window on the left to activate the document, and choose View
               > Fit Artboard In Window. Do the same for the Document window on the right.

 Note: In Illustrator, all the workspace elements are grouped in a single, integrated window
                  that lets you treat the application as a single unit. When you move or resize the
                  Application frame or any of its elements, all the elements within it respond to each
                  other so none overlaps another. If you are using a Mac and prefer the traditional,
                  free-form user interface, you can turn off the Application frame by choosing Window
                  > Application Frame to toggle it on or off.
               

With documents tiled, you can drag the dividing line between each of the Document
               windows to reveal more or less of a particular document. You can also drag artwork
               between documents, which copies them from one document to another.
            
To change the arrangement of the tiled windows, it's possible to drag document tabs
               to new positions. However, it's easier to use the Arrange Documents menu to quickly
               arrange open documents in a variety of configurations.
            



Click the Arrange Documents button () in the Application bar to display the Arrange Documents menu. Click the Consolidate
               All button () to bring the documents back together.
            

 Note: On Windows, menus appear in the Application bar.
               


 Tip: You can also choose Window > Arrange > Consolidate All Windows to return the two
                  documents to tabs in the same group.
               



Click the Arrange Documents button () in the Application bar to display the Arrange Documents menu again. Click the 2-Up
               vertical button () in the Arrange Documents menu.
            


Click to select the L1_start1.ai tab, if it is not already selected. Then, click the
               Close button (X) on the L1_start1.ai document tab to close the document. If a dialog
               box appears asking you to save the document, click Don't Save (macOS) or No (Windows).
            



Choose File > Close to close the L1_start2.ai document without saving.


Finding resources for using Illustrator
      

 Tip: The Learn panel, which contains instructional content, was added just prior to release.
            To access it, open a file and either choose Window > Learn or click the Learn icon
            () in the Application bar.
         

To access Illustrator tutorials, close all open files and click the Learn tab at the
         top of the Start workspace. You will find links to video and written tutorials on
         a variety of Illustrator-related topics.
      

For complete and up-to-date information about using Illustrator panels, tools, and
         other application features, visit the Adobe website. By choosing Help > Illustrator
         Help, you'll be connected to the Illustrator Help website, where you can search Illustrator
         Help and support documents, as well as other websites relevant to Illustrator users.

         authors, and experts to give you the most useful, relevant, and up-to-date information
         about Adobe products.
      

Data recovery
When you restart Illustrator after a program crash, you have the option of recovering
            work-in-progress files so that your hours of work are not wasted. The recovered files
            are opened with the "[Recovered]" in the filename.
         

You can turn data recovery on and off as well as set options such as how often to
            save recovery data in the program preferences (Illustrator CC > Preferences > File
            Handling & Clipboard [macOS] or Edit > Preferences > File Handling & Clipboard [Windows]).

                  it to your screen; you can also use the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel and click or drag over a document to enlarge or reduce the view.
                  In addition, you can use keyboard shortcuts to magnify or reduce the display of artwork.
                  You can also use the Navigator panel to scroll artwork or to change its magnification
                  without using the Document window.
               


To select a tool, you can either click the tool in the Tools panel or press the keyboard
                  shortcut for that tool. For example, you can press V to select the Selection tool
                  () from the keyboard. Selected tools remain active until you click a different tool.
               


You can save panel locations and visibility preferences by choosing Window > Workspace
                  > New Workspace to create custom work areas and to make it easier to find the controls
                  that you need.
               


To navigate among artboards in Illustrator, you can choose the artboard number from
                  the Artboard Navigation menu at the lower-left of the Document window; with nothing
                  selected, the Selection tool selected, and while not in Artboard Editing mode, you
                  can choose the artboard number from the Artboard Navigation menu or use the Artboard
                  Navigation arrows in the Properties panel; you can use the Artboard Navigation arrows
                  in the lower-left of the Document window to go to the first, previous, next, and last
                  artboards; you can use the Artboards panel to navigate to artboards; or you can use
                  the Navigator panel to drag the proxy view area to navigate between artboards.
               


Arranging Document windows allows you to tile windows or to cascade document groups
                  (cascading wasn't discussed in the lesson). This can be useful if you are working
                  on multiple Illustrator files and you need to compare or share content among them.

Selecting content in Adobe Illustrator is one of the more important things you'll
         do. In this lesson, you learn how to locate and select objects using the Selection
         tools; protect other objects by grouping, hiding, and locking them; align objects
         to each other and the artboard; and much more.
      
Starting the lesson
      
Creating, selecting, and editing artwork is the cornerstone of Adobe Illustrator.
         In this lesson, you'll learn the fundamentals of selecting, aligning, and grouping
         artwork using different methods. You'll begin by resetting the preferences in Illustrator
         and opening the lesson file.

Selecting objects
      
Whether you're creating artwork from scratch or editing existing artwork in Illustrator,
         you will need to become familiar with selecting objects. There are many methods and
         tools for doing this, and in this section, you'll explore the most widely used, which
         includes the Selection () and Direct Selection () tools.
      
Using the Selection tool
The Selection tool () in the Tools panel lets you select, move, rotate, and resize entire objects. In
         this first section, you'll become familiar with it.
      


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel on the left. Move the pointer over the different artwork on the
               artboards, without clicking.
            

The icon that appears next to the pointer as it passes over objects () indicates that there is artwork that can be selected under the pointer. When you
               hover over an object, that object is also outlined in a color like blue (in this instance).
            


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and drag across the two blue circles on the artboard on the
               right, from left to right, to zoom in.
            


 Tip: If you can no longer see both blue circles after zooming, with the Zoom tool selected,
                  drag from right to left to zoom out. You can also press the spacebar to temporarily access the Hand tool
                  () and drag in the Document window.
               



Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel and then position the pointer over the edge of the blue circle
               on the left.
            


 Tip: You'll learn more about Smart Guides in Lesson 3, "Using Shapes to Create Artwork for a Postcard."
               

A word such as "path" or "anchor" may appear because Smart Guides are turned on by
               default. Smart Guides are temporary snap-to guides that help you align, edit, and transform objects or
               artboards.


Click anywhere inside the blue circle on the left to select it. A bounding box with
               eight handles appears around the selected circle.
            
The bounding box is used when making changes to artwork (vector or raster), such as resizing or rotating.
               The bounding box also indicates that an item is selected and ready to be modified,
               and the color of the bounding box indicates which layer the object is on. Layers are
               discussed more in Lesson 9, "Organizing Your Artwork with Layers."
            



Using the Selection tool, click in the blue circle on the right. Notice that the left
               blue circle is now deselected and only the right circle is selected.
            

 Note: To select an item without a fill, you can click the stroke (the edge) or drag across
                  the object.
               



Holding down the Shift key, click the blue circle on the left to add it to the selection
               and then release the key. Both blue circles are now selected, and a larger bounding
               box surrounds them.
            



Move the circles anywhere in the document by clicking inside either selected circle
               (in the blue area) and dragging. Because both circles are selected, they move together.
            

As you drag, you may notice the magenta lines that appear. These are called alignment guides and are visible because Smart Guides are turned on (View > Smart Guides). As you
               drag, the objects align to other objects in the document. Also notice the measurement
               label (gray box) next to the pointer that shows the object's distance from its original
               position. Measurement labels also appear because Smart Guides are turned on.
            


Revert to the last saved version of the document by choosing File > Revert. In the
               dialog box that appears, click Revert.
            


Using the Direct Selection tool
      
In Illustrator, as you draw, you create vector paths that are made up of anchor points
         and paths. Anchor points are used to control the shape of the path and work like pins
         holding a wire in place. A shape you create, like a square, is composed of at least
         four anchor points on the corners with paths connecting the anchor points.
      

You change the shape of a path or shape by dragging its anchor points (among other
         things). The Direct Selection tool () lets you select anchor points or paths within an object so that it can be reshaped.
         Next, you'll become familiar with selecting anchor points using the Direct Selection
         tool and reshaping a path.
      


Choose View > Fit All In Window.


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and click several times on the series of red and green shapes
               below the blue circles to zoom in closely.
            


Select the Direct Selection tool () in the Tools panel on the left. Without clicking, position the pointer over the
               upper-left corner of one of the green shapes. The word "anchor" should appear next
               to the pointer.
            
With the Direct Selection tool selected, when the pointer is over an anchor point
               of a path or object, the word "anchor" appears. The "anchor" label is showing because
               Smart Guides are turned on (View > Smart Guides). Also notice the little white box
               to the right of the pointer (). The small dot that appears in the center of the white box indicates that the cursor
               is positioned over an anchor point.
            


 Tip: You can also click in the middle of a shape to select it and to see the anchor points
                  around its edge. This can be an easy way to see where the points are, and then you
                  can click a point to select it.
               



Click to select that anchor point and move the pointer away.

Notice that only the anchor point you selected is solid (filled with blue), indicating
               that it is selected, and the other anchor points in the shape are hollow (filled with
               white), indicating that they are not selected.
            


With the Direct Selection tool still selected, move the pointer over the selected
               anchor point and drag it up to edit the shape.
            


 Note: The gray measurement label that appears as you drag the anchor point has the values
                  dX and dY. dX indicates the distance that the pointer has moved along the x-axis (horizontal),
                  and dY indicates the distance that the pointer has moved along the y-axis (vertical).
               



Try clicking another point on a corner of the shape, and notice that the previous
               point is deselected.
            



Revert to the last saved version of the file by choosing File > Revert. In the dialog
               box that appears, click Revert.
            


Creating selections with a marquee
Another way to select content is by dragging across content that you want to select
         (called a marquee selection), which is what you'll do next.
      


Choose View > Fit All In Window.


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and click three times on the blue circles, on the right.
            


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel. Position the pointer above and to the left of the leftmost blue
               circle and then drag downward and to the right to create a marquee that overlaps the
               tops of both circles. Release the mouse button.
            

When dragging with the Selection tool (), you need to encompass only a small part of an object to select it.
            


Choose Select > Deselect, or click where there are no objects.
Now you'll use the Direct Selection tool to select multiple anchor points in the blue
               circles by dragging a marquee around anchor points.
            


Select the Direct Selection tool () in the Tools panel. Starting off the top left of the leftmost blue circle (see the
               following figure), drag across the top edges of the two circles, then release the
               mouse button. Only the top anchor points become selected.
            



Drag one of the selected anchor points to see how they move together.

You can use this method when selecting points so that you don't have to click exactly
               on the anchor point that you want to select.
            


Revert to the last saved version of the file by choosing File > Revert. In the dialog
               box that appears, click Revert.
            



Selecting artwork with the Magic Wand tool
You can use the Magic Wand tool () in the Tools panel to select all objects in a document that have the same attributes,
            like a color fill. The fill is a color applied to the inside of an object. You can
            customize the Magic Wand tool to select objects based on options, like stroke weight,
            stroke color, and more, by double-clicking the Magic Wand tool in the Tools panel.
         

Hiding and locking objects
      
At times, selecting artwork may be more difficult if there are objects stacked one
         on another or there are multiple objects in a small area. In this section, you'll
         learn a common way to make selecting objects easier, by locking and hiding content.
      


Choose View > Fit All In Window.
Next, you'll attempt to drag across artwork to select it.


With the Selection tool () selected, move the pointer into the blue area to the left of the snowman (the "x"
               in the following figure) and drag across the two ellipses that are the eyes of the
               snowman.
            

Notice that you drag the large blue shape instead.


Choose Edit > Undo Move.


With the blue background shape still selected, choose Object > Lock > Selection, or
               press Command+2 (macOS) or Ctrl+2 (Windows).
            
Locking objects prevents you from selecting and editing them. You can unlock artwork
               by choosing Object > Unlock All.
            


With the Selection tool (), move the pointer into the blue area to the left of the snowman's hat and drag across
               the head of the snowman to select the whole thing (including the hat). See the following
               figure.
            

 Note: Any artwork within the marquee area will be selected using this method.
               



Press the Shift key and click each eye shape, one at a time, to remove them from the selection.
            



Choose Object > Hide > Selection, or press Command+3 (macOS) or Ctrl+3 (Windows).
            

The selected shapes are temporarily hidden so that you can more easily select other
               objects.
            


Choose File > Save to save the file.


Selecting similar objects
You can also select artwork based on similar fill color, stroke color, stroke weight,
         and more, using the Select > Same command. The stroke of an object is the outline
         (border), and the stroke weight is the width of the stroke. Next, you will select
         several objects with the same fill and stroke applied.
      


With the Selection tool (), click to select one of the blue circles on the right.
            



Choose Select > Same > Fill Color to select all objects on any artboard with the same
               fill color (blue) as the selected object.
            
Notice that the circles with the same blue-colored fill are selected.


Click to select one of the red- or green-filled shapes below the blue circles, and
               then choose Select > Same > Stroke Color.
            
All of the shapes with the same stroke (border) color are now selected. If you know
               that you may need to reselect a series of objects again, like the selected red and
               green shapes, you can save a selection. Saved selections are a great way to easily
               recall a selection later, and are only saved with that document. You'll save the current
               selection next.
            



With the shapes still selected, choose Select > Save Selection. Name the selection
               Scarf in the Save Selection dialog box, and click OK so that you'll be able to choose this
               selection at a later time.
            


 Tip: It's helpful to name selections according to use or function. If you name the selection
                  "1 pt stroke," for instance, the name may be misleading if you later change the stroke
                  weight of the artwork.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.


Selecting in Outline mode
By default, Adobe Illustrator displays all artwork with their paint attributes, like
         fill and stroke, showing. However, you can choose to display artwork so that only
         outlines (or paths) are visible. The next method for selecting involves viewing artwork
         in Outline mode and can be very useful if you want to select objects within a series
         of stacked objects.
      


Choose Object > Show All so you can see the artwork you previously hid.


With the Selection tool (), click within one of the white eye shapes to select it.
            
Since the shape has a white fill (a color, pattern, or gradient filling the inside
               of an object), you can click anywhere within the bounds of the object to select it.
            



Choose View > Outline to view artwork as outlines.


With the Selection tool, click in a blank area of the other eye shape.
Notice that you cannot select the object by clicking the fill using this method. Outline
               mode displays artwork as outlines with no fill. To select in Outline mode, you can
               click the edge of the object or drag a marquee across the shape to select it.
            


 Tip: In Outline mode, you may see the small x in the center of the shapes. If you click
                  on that x, you can select the shape.
               



With the Selection tool selected, drag across both eye shapes. Press the Up Arrow
               key several times to move both shapes up a little bit.
            



Choose View > GPU Preview or View > Preview On CPU (or Preview) if GPU Preview is
               not available to see the painted artwork.
            


Aligning objects
Illustrator makes it easy to align or distribute multiple objects relative to each
         other, the artboard, or a key object. In this section, you'll explore the different
         options for aligning objects.
      
Aligning objects to each other
One type of alignment is aligning objects to each other. This can be useful if, for
         instance, you want to align the top edges of a series of selected shapes to each other.
         Next, you'll align the red and green shapes to each other.
      


Choose Select > Scarf to reselect the red and green shapes on the right.


Click the Next artboard button () in the lower-left corner of the Document window to fit the artboard with the selected
               red and green shapes in the window.
            


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and drag across (from left to right) the red and green shapes
               to zoom in.
            


 Note: You can also simply click several times to zoom in.
               



Click the Vertical Align Bottom button () in the Properties panel on the right.
            

Notice that the bottom edges of all the selected objects move to align with the lowest
               selected object.
            


Choose Edit > Undo Align to return the objects to their original positions. Leave
               the objects selected for the next section.
            


Aligning to a key object
A key object is an object that you want other objects to align to. This can be useful when you
         want to align a series of objects, and maybe one of them is already in the perfect
         position. You specify a key object by selecting all the objects you want to align,
         including the key object, and then clicking the key object again. Next, you will align
         the red and green shapes using a key object.
      


With the shapes still selected, click the leftmost shape with the Selection tool ().
            
When selected, the key object has a thick outline indicating that other objects will
               align to it.
            


 Note: The key object outline color is determined by the layer color that the object is
                  on.
               



Click the Vertical Align Top button () in the Properties panel.
            

Notice that all of the selected shapes move to align to the top edge of the key object.

 Note: To stop aligning and distributing relative to an object, click the object again to
                  remove the blue outline.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.


Aligning anchor points
Next, you'll align two anchor points to each other using the Align options. Like setting
         a key object in the previous section, you can also set a key anchor point that other
         anchor points will align to.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Select the Direct Selection tool (), and click the lower-left corner point of the white shape at the bottom of the artboard.
               Shift-click to select the lower-right point of the same shape (see the following figure).
            
The last selected anchor point is the key anchor point. Other points will align to
               this point.
            


Click the Vertical Align Top button () in the Properties panel to the right of the document. The first anchor point selected
               aligns to the second anchor point selected.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


Distributing objects
Distributing objects using the Align panel enables you to select multiple objects
         and distribute the spacing between the centers or edges of those objects equally.
         Next, you will make the spacing between the red and green shapes even.
      


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel.
            


Choose Select > Scarf to reselect all of the red and green shapes on the second artboard.


Click More Options () in the Align section of the Properties panel (circled in the following figure).
               Click the Horizontal Distribute Center button () in the panel that appears.
            

 Note: When distributing objects horizontally, make sure that the leftmost and rightmost
                  objects are where you want them and then distribute the objects between them. For
                  vertical distribution, position the topmost and bottommost objects and then distribute
                  the objects between them.
               


Distributing moves all the selected shapes so that the spacing between the center of each of them is equal.
            

 Note: Using the Horizontal Distribute Center or Vertical Distribute Center button distributes
                  the spacing equally between the centers of the objects. If the selected objects are not the same size, unexpected results
                  may occur.
               



Choose Edit > Undo Align.


With the shapes still selected, click the leftmost shape (red shape) to make it the
               key object.
            
You have to define a key object before you are able to enter a value for distribute
               spacing, next.
            



Click More Options () in the Align section of the Properties panel (circled in the following figure).
               Ensure that the Distribute Spacing value is 0 (zero) and then click the Horizontal
               Distribute Space button ().
            

Distribute Spacing distributes the spacing between selected objects, whereas the Distribute Objects alignments distribute the spacing
               between the centers of selected objects. The value you can set is a great way to set
               a specific distance between objects.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.


Aligning to the artboard
You can also align content to the active artboard (page) rather than to a selection
         or a key object. Aligning to the artboard aligns each selected object separately to
         the artboard. Next, you'll align the white half-circle shape to the artboard with
         the snowman.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, click the white half-circle shape at the bottom of the righthand artboard
               to select it. Choose Edit > Cut.
            


Click the Previous artboard button () in the lower-left corner of the Document window to navigate to the first (left)
               artboard in the document, which contains the snowman.
            


Choose Edit > Paste to paste the white half-circle.


Choose Window > Align to open the Align panel.
            
As of the writing of this book, there is no option in the Properties panel to align
               a single selected object to the artboard. That is why you are opening the Align panel.
            


Choose Show Options from the Align panel menu () (circled in the following figure).
            


Click the Align To Selection button () in the Align panel, and choose Align To Artboard in the menu that appears. Any content
               you align will now align to the artboard.
            



Click the Horizontal Align Center button () and then click the Vertical Align Bottom button () in the Align panel, to align the white half-circle to the horizontal center and
               vertical bottom of the artboard.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


Click the X at the top of the Align panel group to close it.


Working with groups
      
You can combine objects into a group so that the objects are treated as a single unit.
         This way, you can move or transform a number of objects without affecting their individual
         attributes or positions relative to each other. It can also make selection of artwork
         easier later.
      
Grouping items
Next, you'll select multiple objects and create a group from them.


Choose View > Fit All In Window to see both artboards.


Choose Select > Scarf to select the series of red and green shapes.



Click the Group button in the Quick Actions section of the Properties panel on the
               right, to group the selected artwork together.
            

 Tip: You can also choose Object > Group to group content.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.


With the Selection tool () selected, click one of the shapes in the new group.
            
Because they are grouped together, all are now selected.



Drag the group of shapes to just beneath the snowman's head.

This will become part of the snowman's scarf. Right now, the group you dragged onto
               the snowman is behind other artwork. You'll fix it shortly.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.


Editing a group in Isolation mode
      
Isolation mode isolates groups (or sublayers) so that you can easily select and edit
         specific objects or parts of objects without having to ungroup the objects. When in
         Isolation mode, all objects outside of the isolated group are locked and dimmed so
         that they aren't affected by the edits you make. Next, you will edit a group using
         Isolation mode.
      


With the Selection tool (), click the snowman's hat.
            
You will see that it selects a group of shapes.


Double-click a shape in the hat to enter Isolation mode.
Notice that the rest of the content in the document appears dimmed (you can't select
               it). At the top of the Document window, a gray bar appears with the words "Layer 1"
               and "<Group>." This indicates that you have isolated a group of objects that is on
               Layer 1. You will learn more about layers in Lesson 9, "Organizing Your Artwork with Layers."
            



Click to select the red shape in the hat. Click the Fill color box in the Properties
               panel on the right, and making sure the Swatches option () is selected in the panel that appears, click to select another color. I chose a
               green.
            

When you enter Isolation mode, groups are temporarily ungrouped. This enables you
               to edit objects in the group or to add new content without having to ungroup.
            

 Note: You will need to hide the panel to continue, and can do so by pressing the Escape
                  key. I won't always tell you to hide these panels, so it's a good habit to get into.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.


Double-click outside of the shapes within the group to exit Isolation mode.


Click to select the same shape in the hat.
Notice that it is once again grouped with the rest of the shapes in the hat, and you
               can also select other objects.
            

 Tip: To exit Isolation mode, you can also click the gray arrow in the upper-left corner
                  of the Document window, press the Escape key when in Isolation mode, or double-click
                  a blank area of the Document window.
               



Creating a nested group
      
Groups can also be nested—grouped within other objects or grouped to form larger groups. Nesting is a common
         technique used when designing artwork. It's a great way to keep associated content
         together. In this section, you'll explore how to create a nested group.
      


With the Selection tool (), drag a marquee across the hat and head of the snowman. Choose Object > Group.
            
You have created a nested group—a group that is combined with other objects or groups to form a larger group.
            
After grouping, you may notice that the scarf group is now behind the head shape.
               This is because of the stacking order of objects, which you will learn about in the
               next section.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


With the Selection tool, click the hat to select the nested group again.


Double-click the hat to enter Isolation mode. Click to select the hat again, and notice
               that the shapes that make up the hat are still grouped. This is a nested group.
            

 Tip: Instead of either ungrouping a group or entering Isolation mode to select the content
                  within, you can select with the Group Selection tool (). Nested within the Direct Selection tool () in the Tools panel, the Group Selection tool lets you select an object within a
                  group, a single group within multiple groups, or a set of groups within the artwork.
               




Press the Escape key to exit Isolation mode; then click a blank area of the artboard
               to deselect the objects.
            


Exploring object arrangement
      
As you create objects, Illustrator stacks them in order on the artboards, beginning
         with the first object created. This ordering of objects, called stacking order, determines how they display when they overlap. You can change the stacking order
         of objects in your artwork at any time, using either the Layers panel or Arrange commands.
      

 Tip: To learn more about objects and stacking order, see the PDF "Stack_order.pdf" in
            the Lessons > Lesson_extras folder
         

Arranging objects
Next, you will work with the Arrange commands to change how objects are stacked.


Choose View > Outline to more easily select artwork.


With the Selection tool () selected, drag a marquee across the three parts of the scarf. Drag carefully so
               as not to select other content.
            


Choose View > GPU Preview or View > Preview On CPU (or Preview) if GPU Preview is
               not available to display the painted artwork.
            


Shift-click the white half-circle to deselect it, if necessary.


Choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front to bring the scarf shapes in front of the
               snowman's body shapes.
            



Selecting objects behind
When you stack objects on top of each other, sometimes it becomes difficult to select
         objects that are underneath. Next, you'll learn how to select an object through a
         stack of objects.
      


Drag either of the blue circles on the right artboard, on top of the smaller eye for
               the snowman. Release the mouse.
            

The circle disappears but is still selected. It went behind the ellipse (the eye)
               because it was created before the eye shape, which means it is lower in the stacking
               order.
            


With the circle still selected, choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front. This brings
               the blue circle to the front of the stack, making it the topmost object.
            


With the Selection tool (), select the other blue circle on the right artboard, and drag it onto the larger
               eye shape on the left artboard.
            
This circle disappears like the other, but this time, you will deselect the circle
               and then reselect it using another method.
            


Choose Select > Deselect. Because it is behind the larger eye shape, you can no longer
               see the blue circle.
            


With the pointer positioned over the location of the blue circle you just deselected,
               the one behind the eye shape, hold down the Command (macOS) or Ctrl (Windows) key,
               and click until the circle is selected again (this may take several clicks).
            

 Note: To select the hidden blue circle, make sure that you click where the circle and the
                  eye overlap. Otherwise, you won't be able to select the blue circle.
               



Choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front to bring the circle on top of the eye.

 Note: You may see an angle bracket displayed with the pointer ().

Review answers


You can select an object that has no fill by clicking the stroke or by dragging a
                  marquee across any part of the object.
               


You can double-click the group with the Selection tool selected, to enter Isolation
                  mode, edit the shapes as needed, and then exit Isolation mode by pressing the Escape
                  key or by double-clicking outside of the group. Read Lesson 9, "Organizing Your Artwork with Layers," to see how you can use layers to make complex selections. Also, using the Group
                  Selection tool (), you can click once to select an individual item within a group (not discussed in
                  the lesson). Click again to add the next grouped items to the selection.
               


Using the Direct Selection tool (), you can select one or more individual anchor points and make changes to the shape
                  of an object.
               


For any selection that you anticipate using again, choose Select > Save Selection.
                  Name the selection so that you can reselect it at any time from the Select menu.
               


To align objects to an artboard, first select the Align To Artboard option.


If your access to an object is blocked, you can choose Object > Hide > Selection to
                  hide the blocking object. The object is not deleted. It is just hidden in the same
                  position until you choose Object > Show All. You can also use the Selection tool () to select an object that's behind other objects by pressing the Command (macOS)
                  or Ctrl (Windows) key and then clicking the overlapping objects until the object you
                  want to select is selected.

Basic shapes are at the foundation of creating Illustrator artwork. In this lesson,
         you'll create a new document and then create and edit a series of shapes using the
         shape tools for a postcard.
      
Starting the lesson
      
In this lesson, you'll explore the different methods for creating artwork using the
         shape tools and various creation methods to add artwork to a postcard that contains
         a pirate map.
      


To ensure that the tools function and the defaults are set exactly as described in
               this lesson, delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CC preferences
               file. See "Restoring default preferences" in the "Getting Started" section at the
               beginning of the book.
            

 Note: If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson to your computer
                  from your Account page, make sure to do so now. See the "Getting Started" section
                  at the beginning of the book.
               



Start Adobe Illustrator CC.



Choose File > Open. Locate the file named L3_end.ai, which is in the Lessons > Lesson03
               folder that you copied onto your hard disk, and click Open.
            
This file contains the finished illustrations that you'll create in this lesson.


Choose View > Fit All In Window; leave the file open for reference, or choose File
               > Close.
            


Creating a new document
You will now create a document for the postcard that will have two artboards, each
         with content that you will later combine.
      


Choose File > New to create a new, untitled document. In the New Document dialog box,
               change the following options:
            


Select the Print profile at the top of the dialog box.

 Tip: In the New Document dialog box, you will see a series of document presets you can
                        start each project with.
                     



Select the Letter document preset.


On the right, in the Preset Details area, change the following:


Name: Change it from Untitled-1 to Postcard.
                  


Units: Change the units from Points to Inches.
                  


Width: 6 in (You don't need to type the in for inches.)
                  


Height: 4.25 in


Orientation: Landscape ()
                  


Artboards: 2 (to create two artboards)
                  


You'll learn about the Bleed option shortly. At the bottom of the Preset Details section
               on the right side of the New Document dialog box, you will also see Advanced Options
               and More Settings (you may need to scroll to see it).
            
They contain more settings for document creation that you can explore on your own.
            


 Note: You can set up a document for different kinds of output, such as print, web, video,
                  and more, by choosing a profile. For example, if you are designing a web-page mock-up,
                  you can select the Web profile and select a default document, which automatically
                  displays the page size and units in pixels, changes the color mode to RGB, and changes
                  the raster effects to Screen (72 ppi).
               



Click Create in the New Document dialog box.


Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, ensure that the name of the file
               is Postcard.ai, and save it in the Lessons > Lesson03 folder. Leave the Format menu
               set to Adobe Illustrator (ai) (macOS) or the Save As Type option set to Adobe Illustrator
               (*.AI) (Windows), and click Save.
            
Adobe Illustrator (.ai) is called a native format. That means it preserves all Illustrator data, including multiple artboards.
            


In the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the Illustrator options at their default
               settings, and click OK.
            
The Illustrator Options dialog box is full of options for saving the Illustrator document,
               from specifying a version for saving to embedding any files that are linked to the
               document.
            

 Tip: If you want to learn more about these options, search for "Save artwork" in Illustrator
                  Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
               



Click the Document Setup button in the Properties panel (Window > Properties).
The Document Setup dialog box is where you can change document options like units,
               bleeds, and more, after a document is created.
            


In the Bleed section of the Document Setup dialog box, change the value in the Top
               field to 0.125 in, either by clicking the Up Arrow to the left of the field once or by typing the value,
               and all four fields change. Click OK.
            

The red line that appears around both artboards indicates the bleed area. You will
               typically add bleed to artboards where you want artwork to be printed all the way
               to the edge of the paper. Bleed is the term used for the area that extends beyond
               the edge of the printed page, and it ensures that no white edges show up on the final
               trimmed page.
            

 Note: You could have set up the bleeds when you first set up the document in the New Document
                  dialog box by choosing File > New.
               



Working with basic shapes
      
In the first part of this lesson, you'll create a series of basic shapes, such as
         rectangles, ellipses, rounded rectangles, polygons, and more. Shapes you create are
         composed of anchor points with paths connecting the anchor points. A basic square, for instance, is composed
         of four anchor points on the corners with paths connecting the anchor points (see
         the figure at right). A shape is referred to as a closed path.
      

Examples of Closed Paths
A path can be closed, or it can be open with distinct anchor points on each end, called
         end points (see the figure at right). Both open and closed paths can have fills applied to them.
      

Examples of open paths
You'll begin this exercise by setting up the workspace.


Choose Window > Workspace > Essentials (if it's not already selected) and then choose
               Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
            


Choose 2 from the Artboard Navigation menu below the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Creating and editing rectangles
You'll start this lesson by creating a few rectangles. All of the shape tools, except
         for the Star tool and Flare tool, create Live Shapes. Live Shapes have attributes such as width, height, rotation, and corner radius that are editable
         later, without having to switch from the drawing tool, and are retained even if you
         scale or rotate the shape.
      


Select the Rectangle tool () in the Tools panel. Move the pointer near the center of the artboard. Press the
               mouse button and drag down and to the right. Drag until the rectangle is approximately
               0.5 inches wide and has a height of 2 inches, as shown in the gray tooltip next to
               the cursor.
            


 Tip: Holding down Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) as you drag with the Rectangle, Rounded
                  Rectangle, or Ellipse tool draws a shape from its center point.
               

As you drag to create shapes, the tooltip that appears next to the pointer is called
               the measurement label and is part of Smart Guides (View > Smart Guides), which will be discussed throughout
               this lesson. By default, shapes are filled with a white color and have a black stroke
               (border). Using any of the shape tools, you can either draw a shape or click the artboard
               with a shape tool selected to enter values in a dialog box.
            


With the rectangle selected, move the pointer over the small blue dot in the center
               of the rectangle (called the center point widget). When the pointer changes (), drag the shape into the bottom half of the artboard.
            



Begin dragging the right-middle bounding point of the rectangle to the left to make
               it narrower. As you drag, press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key to resize
               the left and right sides together. When you see a width of approximately 0.3 in the
               measurement label, release the mouse button and then the key.
            



Move the pointer just off of a corner on the shape. When you see rotate arrows (), press and drag clockwise to rotate the shape. As you drag, press the Shift key
               to constrain the rotation to 45 degrees. When an angle of 315 shows in the measurement
               label, release the mouse button and then the key. Leave the shape selected.
            



Rounding corners
Rounding the corners of a rectangle can be done using several methods. In this section,
         you'll learn a few ways to round the corners of rectangles you've already created.
      


With the shape still selected, choose View > Zoom In a few times.


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and drag any of the corner widgets () in the rectangle toward the center of the rectangle to change the corner radius
               for all corners without worrying about how much right now.
            


 Note: If you drag a corner widget far enough, a red arc appears indicating you've reached
                  the maximum corner radius.
               



In the Properties panel to the right, click More Options () in the Transform section to show a panel with more options. Ensure that Link Corner
               Radius Values is on (), and change any of the Radius values to 0.125. If necessary, click in another field or press the Tab key to see the change to all
               corners.
            


 Tip: You can Option-click (macOS) or Alt-click (Windows) a corner widget in a shape to
                  cycle through the different corner types.
               


 Note: You can press the Escape key to hide the panel before moving on.
               



Select the Direct Selection tool (). With the shape still selected, double-click the top-corner widget (). In the Corners dialog box, change the radius to 0 (zero), and click OK.
            

Notice that only that one corner changed. The Corners dialog box allows you to edit
               the corner type and radius, but it also has an extra option called Rounding for setting
               absolute versus relative rounding. Absolute means the rounded corner is exactly the
               radius value. Relative makes the radius value based on the angle of the corner point.
            


Click the bottom-corner widget () to select just that one corner widget. See the first part of the following figure.
            


Drag the bottom-corner widget () away from the center of the shape, until you see 0 in the measurement label. You
               will need to drag past the corner point.
            



Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel. Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel, and make sure
               that the Swatches option () is selected in the panel that appears. Select a darker red color to fill the rectangle
               with red.
            

 Note: You can press the Escape key to hide the panel before moving on.
               



Click the Stroke color box in the Properties panel, make sure that the Swatches option
               () is selected, and select None to remove the stroke from the rectangle.
            



Choose Edit > Copy and then choose Edit > Paste In Front to paste a copy of the rectangle
               right on top of the original.
            


Move the pointer just off of a corner on the shape. When you see rotate arrows (), drag counterclockwise to rotate the shape. As you drag, press the Shift key to
               constrain the rotation to 45 degrees. When an angle of 45 shows in the measurement
               label, release the mouse button and then the key.
            



Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel, and make sure that the Swatches
               option () is selected in the panel that appears. Select a lighter red color to fill the rectangle
               with red.
            


Choose Select > All On Active Artboard to select both shapes. Click the Group button
               in the Quick Actions section of the Properties panel to the right of the document.
            
Grouping treats content like a single object which makes it easier to move the currently
               selected artwork. You'll group other content you create going forward for the same
               reason.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


Working with the Rounded Rectangle tool
      
Next, you'll create a rounded corner rectangle using the Rounded Rectangle tool. Rounded
         rectangles are also Live Shapes, which means you can edit properties such as the corner
         radius after the fact. Next, you'll create a shape for the mast of a boat.
      


Choose View > Zoom Out.


Click and hold down the mouse button on the Rectangle tool () in the Tools panel, and select the Rounded Rectangle tool ().
            
For the next step, don't release the mouse button until told to do so.


To the right of the rectangles on the artboard, click and drag to make a rectangle
               with a width of 0.2 inches and a height of 1.5 inches in the measurement label, but
               do not release the mouse button yet. With the mouse button still held down, press the Down Arrow key several times to
               see the corner radius become less rounded. Press the Up Arrow key several times to
               see the corner become more rounded. No matter how rounded the corners are, release
               the mouse button.
            


 Tip: When drawing with the Rounded Rectangle tool, pressing the left arrow key will change
                  the corner radius to 0 (zero), and pressing the right arrow key will set the rounded
                  corner radius at the maximum value for the shape.
               



In the Properties panel to the right, make sure Constrain Width And Height Proportions
               to the right of Width (W:) and Height (H:) is deselected (it looks like this: ). Select the Width (W:) value and change it to 0.1. Click in the Height (H:) field, and change the value to 1. Press Return or Enter. Leave the shape selected.
            

Typing in for inches isn't necessary; it is added automatically.
            

 Note: You'll learn a lot more about general transformations in Lesson 5, "Transforming Artwork."
               



Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel on the left. Drag across the top part of the selected rounded
               rectangle to zoom in closely.
            


Select the Selection tool () and, with the rounded rectangle selected, drag any of the corner widgets () toward the top of the shape until the measurement label shows a value of 0.02 in.

 Note: Zoom in closer if you don't see the corner widgets after selecting the Selection
                  tool.
               




Double-click one of the corner widgets () to open the Transform panel. The Transform panel will open, and you should now see
               corner options. Select Chamfer for the corner type for the top two corners only (circled in the following figure).
            


Choose View > Zoom Out until you see the bottom of the shape.


Deselect Link Corner Radius Values (so it looks like this []) to change the corners independently. Change the bottom-left and bottom-right corners
               to 0.
            


Click the X at the top of the Transform panel group to close it.


Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel, and make sure that the Swatches
               option () is selected in the panel that appears. Select a brown color.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.




Working with the document grid

The document grid allows you to work more precisely by creating a series of nonprinting
            horizontal and vertical guides behind your artwork in the Document window that objects
            can snap to. To turn the grid on and use its features, do the following:
         


To show the grid or hide the grid, choose View > Show Grid/Hide Grid.


To snap objects to the gridlines, choose View > Snap To Grid, select the object you
                  want to move, and drag it to the desired location. When the object's boundaries come
                  within 2 pixels of a gridline, it snaps to the point.
               


To specify grid properties such as the spacing between gridlines, grid style (lines
                  or dots), grid color, or whether grids appear in the front or back of artwork, choose
                  Illustrator CC > Preferences > Guides & Grid (macOS) or Edit > Preferences > Guides
                  & Grid (Windows).

Creating and editing ellipses
      
Next, you'll draw and edit an ellipse with the Ellipse tool () to continue creating a boat. The Ellipse tool can be used to create ellipses and
         circles.
      


Choose View > Zoom Out a few times.


Click and hold down the mouse button on the Rounded Rectangle tool () in the Tools panel, and select the Ellipse tool ().
            


Move the pointer above the brown rectangle. Click and drag to make an ellipse that
               has a width of 1.5 inches and a height of 0.5 inches.
            
After creating an ellipse, with the Ellipse tool still selected, you can drag the
               shape from the center widget, transform the shape, and also change the pie angle.
               Next, you'll create a copy of the ellipse to use later.
            



Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel. Choose Edit > Copy and then Edit > Paste to paste a copy of
               the circle you will use later in the lesson. Drag it into a blank area of the artboard,
               out of the way.
            



 Tip: To reset a pie shape back to an ellipse, double-click either pie widget.
               

Click to select the original ellipse. Drag the pie widget () off the right side of the ellipse, counterclockwise around the top of the ellipse.
            

Dragging this widget allows you to create a pie shape. After dragging the widget initially
               and releasing the mouse button, you will then see a second widget. The widget you
               dragged controls the start angle. The widget that now appears on the right side of
               the ellipse controls the end angle.
            

 Note: You can also change ellipse properties like pie angle with the Ellipse tool still
                  selected.
               



In the Properties panel to the right, click More Options () in the Transform section to show more options. Choose 180° from the Pie Start Angle
               menu. Press Escape to hide the panel.


Move the pointer over what was the center of the ellipse, and drag the ellipse so
               it snaps to the bottom edge of the brown rectangle. The word "intersect" will most
               likely appear when it is snapped.
            

A vertical magenta guide will also show in the center of the brown rectangle to ensure
               that the ellipse is center-aligned horizontally with the rectangle.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Changing stroke width and alignment
So far in this lesson, you've mostly edited the fill of shapes but haven't done too
         much with the strokes (a visible outline or border of an object or path). You can
         easily change the color of a stroke or the weight of a stroke to make it thinner or
         thicker, which is what you'll do next.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, click the copy of the brown ellipse you made in the last section to select
               it.
            



Drag it on top of the half ellipse. Magenta smart guides will appear when it's aligned
               in the center of the half-ellipse.
            


Change the fill color to a darker brown and the stroke color to a lighter brown in
               the Properties panel.


Drag the top-middle point of the ellipse down. As you drag, press the Option key (macOS)
               or Alt key (Windows) to resize both sides as the same time. When you see a height
               of 0.1 inch, release the mouse button and then the key.
            



Click the word "Stroke" in the Properties panel to open the Stroke panel. In the Stroke
               panel, change the stroke weight of the selected rectangle to 2. Click the Align Stroke To Inside button () to align the stroke to the inside edge of the ellipse.
            

 Note: You can also open the Stroke panel by choosing Window > Stroke, but you may need
                  to choose Show Options from the panel menu ().
               



 Note: You may notice in the selected artwork that you only see the corner points of the
                  bounding box. It depends on the zoom level of your document.
               



Click the brown rectangle and then click the Arrange button in the Properties panel
               and choose Bring To Front so the rectangle is on top of the ellipses.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


Creating and editing a circle
Next, you'll draw and edit a perfect circle with the Ellipse tool (). Later in the lesson, you'll make a series of copies of the circle you create here
         for other artwork.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window to see the whole artboard.


Select the Ellipse tool (), and move the pointer over a blank area in the upper-left corner of the artboard.
               Begin dragging down and to the right to begin drawing an ellipse. As you drag, press
               the Shift key to create a perfect circle. When the width and height are both roughly
               1 inch, release the mouse button and then the Shift key.
            

Without switching to the Selection tool, you can reposition and modify an ellipse
               with the Ellipse tool, which is what you'll do next.
            


With the Ellipse tool selected, position the pointer over the left-middle bounding
               point of the circle. Click and drag toward the center to make it smaller. As you drag,
               press Shift+Option (macOS) or Shift+Alt (Windows). Drag until the measurement label
               shows a width and height of approximately 0.3 inches. Release the mouse button and
               then the keys.
            


 Note: An ellipse is also a Live Shape like a rectangle or rounded rectangle.
               



With the circle selected, click the Fill color in the Properties panel and make sure
               that the Swatches option () is selected in the panel that appears. Select a light gray color with a tooltip
               of "C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=10."
            


Creating polygons
Using the Polygon tool (), you can create shapes with multiple straight sides. By default, the Polygon tool
         draws hexagons (a five-sided shape) and all shapes are drawn from the center. Polygons
         are also Live Shapes, which means attributes like size, rotation, number of sides,
         and more are still editable. Now you'll create a triangle to make a diamond gem using
         the Polygon tool ().
      


Click and hold down the mouse button on the Ellipse tool () in the Tools panel, and select the Polygon tool ().
            


Choose View > Smart Guides to turn them off.


Move the pointer in a blank area of the artboard. Drag to the right to begin drawing
               a polygon, but don't release the mouse button yet. Press the Down Arrow key once to reduce the number of sides on the polygon to five,
               and don't release the mouse yet. Hold down the Shift key to straighten the shape.
               Release the mouse button and then the key. Leave the shape selected.
            

Notice that you didn't see the gray measurement label (the tooltip) since the tooltip
               is part of the Smart Guides that you turned off. The magenta alignment guides are
               also not showing since the shape is not snapping to other content on the artboard.
               Smart Guides can be useful in certain situations, such as when more precision is necessary,
               and can be toggled on and off when needed.
            


Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel, and make sure that the Swatches
               option () is selected in the panel that appears. Select a light gray color with a tooltip
               of "C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=30."
            


Choose View > Smart Guides to turn them back on.


With the Polygon tool still selected, drag the side widget on the right side of the
               bounding box to change the number of sides to three, making a triangle.
            



Drag a corner bounding point of the triangle until you see a width of 1.2 inches and
               a height of 0.8 inches in the measurement label.
            


 Note: The figure may look different from what you see. Your starting shape may have been
                  bigger or smaller, and that's okay. As long as the resulting size is 1.2 inches in
                  width and 0.8 inches in height.
               



Editing the polygons
Now, you'll make a copy of the polygon and create the rest of the diamond gem.


With the triangle still selected, choose Object > Transform > Reflect. In the Reflect
               dialog box, select Horizontal, and click Copy.
            


Drag the new (top) triangle from the center widget (the blue circle in the center)
               so its top edge snaps to the bottom edge of the original triangle.
            



Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel. Click the original (top) triangle.
            


Select the Eraser tool () in the Tools panel. Pressing the Shift key, drag from left to right, across the
               middle of the triangle. Release the mouse button and then the key.
            



Select the Selection tool () and click in a blank area to deselect the artwork. Click the smaller triangle on
               top and press Backspace or Delete to remove it.
            


Click to select the remaining part of the top triangle, and click the Fill color box
               in the Properties panel. Make sure that the Swatches option () is selected in the panel that appears, and select a lighter gray color with a tooltip
               of "C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=5."
            

Next, you'll make a copy of the original triangle and make a mountain shape with a
               rounded corner top.
            


Click the darker gray triangle to select it. Option-drag (macOS) or Alt-drag (Windows)
               the triangle into the lower-left corner of the artboard to make a copy. Release the
               mouse button and then the key.
            



Click More Options () in the Transform section of the Properties panel to the right to show more options.
               To return the triangle to an equal-sided polygon, click the Make Sides Equal button.
            



Select the Direct Selection tool () in the Tools panel. Click the top-corner widget () of the selected triangle to select it.
            



Drag the top-corner widget toward the center of the shape to round the top corner
               a little.
            


Creating a star
      
Next, you'll use the Star tool () to create a few stars that will go on the diamond you just created. The Star tool
         currently doesn't create Live Shapes, which means editing the star after the fact
         can be more difficult. When drawing with the Star tool, you'll use keyboard modifiers
         to get the number of points you want and to change the radius of the arms of the star
         (the length of the arms). Here are the keyboard modifiers you'll use in this section
         when drawing the star and what each does:
      


Arrow keys: Pressing the Up Arrow or Down Arrow keys adds or removes arms from the star, respectively,
               as you draw it.
            


Shift: This straightens the star (constrains it).
            


Command (macOS) or Ctrl (Windows): Pressing the key and dragging while creating a star allows you to change the radius
               of the arms of the star (make the arms longer or shorter).
            


Next, you'll create a star. This will take a few keyboard commands, so don't release the mouse button until you are told.
      


Click and hold down the mouse button on the Polygon tool () in the Tools panel, and select the Star tool (). Move the pointer somewhere on the artboard to the right of the triangle shapes
               that make up the diamond.
            


Click and drag slowly to the right to create a star shape. Notice that as you move
               the pointer, the star changes size and rotates freely. Drag until the measurement
               label shows a width of about 1 inch and then stop dragging. Don't release the mouse button!


 Tip: You can also click in the Document window with the Star tool () and edit the options in the Star dialog box instead of drawing it.
               



Press the Up Arrow key once to increase the number of points on the star to six. Don't release the mouse button!



Press Command (macOS) or Ctrl (Windows), and continue dragging to the right a little.
               This keeps the inner radius constant, making the arms longer. Drag until you see a
               width of approximately 1.5 inches, and stop dragging, without releasing the mouse
               button. Release Command or Ctrl but not the mouse button.
            



Hold down the Shift key. When the star straightens out, release the mouse button and
               then the Shift key.
            



Change the stroke weight of the star to 0 in the Properties panel.
            

 Tip: If the stroke color is None (), then you don't need to set the stroke weight.
               



Change the fill color in the Properties panel to white.
            


Select the Selection tool (), press the Shift key, and drag a corner of star bounding box toward the center.
               When the star has a width of approximately 0.4 inches, release the mouse button and
               then the key.
            


Select the Star tool (), and draw one more star, a little smaller than the first.
            

Notice that the new stars have the same basic settings as the first star you drew.


Select the Selection tool (), and drag the stars on top of the shapes that make up the diamond.
            
They may be difficult to see since they have a white fill and are on a white artboard.
               In this case, you could choose View > Outline to more easily see them. Then, after
               you are finished dragging the shapes by their edges, choose View > GPU Preview (or
               Preview On CPU if GPU Preview is not supported).
            


Drag across the triangle and star shapes to select them all, and then click the Group
               button in the Properties panel to group them together.
            



Drawing lines
Next, you'll create lines and line segments, known as open paths, with the Line Segment tool to create a few bones. Lines created with the Line Segment
         tool are Live Lines, and similar to Live Shapes, they have many editable attributes.
      


Select the Line Segment tool () in the Tools panel. On the right side of the artboard, above the existing artwork,
               click and drag to the right. Notice the length and angle in the measurement label
               next to the pointer as you drag. Drag until the line is around 1.5 inches in length.
            



With the new line selected, position the pointer just off the right end. When the
               pointer changes to a rotate arrow (), click and drag (up or down) until you see an angle of 0 (zero) in the measurement
               label next to the pointer. That will make the line horizontal.
            

Lines rotate around their center point by default. The angle of the line can also
               be changed in the Properties panel.
            


With the line selected, change the stroke weight to 15 pt in the Properties panel to the right of the document.
            

 Note: If you drag a line in the same trajectory as the original path, you will see the
                  words "Line Extension" and "on" appear at opposite ends of the line. These are part
                  of Smart Guides and make it easy to drag a line longer or shorter without changing
                  the angle.
               



Click the Stroke color box in the Properties panel, and make sure that the Swatches
               option () is selected in the panel that appears. Select a lighter gray color with a tooltip
               of "C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=10."
            



Choose Object > Path > Outline Stroke. The line is now a shape with a fill.


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and drag the gray circle in the upper-left corner of the artboard
               over to the shape.
            


Choose Edit > Copy. Choose Edit > Paste three times to create a total of four circles.
               Drag the circles onto the shape like you see in the figure to make a bone.
            



Drag across the bone artwork and click the Group button in the Properties panel to
               keep the artwork together.
            


Move the pointer just off a corner. When the pointer changes to rotate arrows (), drag counterclockwise to rotate it until you see approximately 45 degrees in the
               measurement label.
            



Choose Object > Transform > Reflect. In the Reflect dialog box, select Vertical, and
               click Copy.
            



Drag across the artwork for the bones and click the Group button in the Properties
               panel to keep the artwork together.
            


Working with the Shaper tool
      
Another way to draw and edit shapes in Illustrator involves the Shaper tool (). The Shaper tool recognizes natural gestures and produces Live Shapes from those
         gestures. Without switching tools, you can combine, delete, fill, and transform basic
         shapes you create. In this section, you'll get a feeling for how the tool works by
         exploring the most widely used features.
      

 Note: The Shaper tool is present in the Tools panel of the classical workspace. In the
            Touch Workspace, it is a top-level tool in the toolbar. This tool works best with
            a stylus on touch surfaces, such as Surface Pro or Wacom Cintiq, or through indirect
            inputs such as the Wacom Intuos.
         

Drawing shapes with the Shaper tool
To get started with the Shaper tool, you'll draw a few simple shapes that will eventually
         become the sail for the boat you made.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Select the Shaper tool () in the Tools panel on the left. Draw a rough representation of a rectangle in a
               blank area of the artboard, like you would with a pencil on paper. Use the figure
               as a guide.
            

When you finish drawing the shape, the gesture will be converted to a Live Shape with
               a default gray fill. There are a variety of shapes that can be drawn with the Shaper
               tool, including (but not limited to) rectangles, squares, ellipses (circles), triangles,
               hexagons, lines, and more.
            


Draw a scribble over the shape you just drew to delete it.

This simple gesture is an easy way to delete shapes. Note that you can scribble across
               more than one object to remove them, and you simply need to scribble over part of
               the artwork, not the whole thing to delete it. You can also click within a shape you
               created to select it and then press Backspace or Delete to remove it.
            

 Note: If you try to draw a scribble, a line may be created instead. Simply scribble across
                  all the shapes to remove them.
               



Draw an ellipse in a blank area of the artboard.

If the shape is not an ellipse, delete it by scribbling across it, and try again.
Once shapes are created, you can also use the Shaper tool to edit those shapes without
               having to switch tools. Next, you'll edit the ellipse you just created.
            


Click in the ellipse with the Shaper tool to select it.


Choose View > Zoom In.


Drag a corner of the ellipse to turn it into a circle. When magenta hinting crosshairs
               (Smart Guides) show in the center, it means the ellipse has become a circle (an ellipse
               with equal width and height).
            
Shapes drawn with the Shaper tool are live and dynamically adjustable, so you can
               draw and edit intuitively without the extra hassle of switching between tools. Notice
               that no measurement label appears to indicate the shape size. When transforming shapes
               with the Shaper tool, measurement labels won't appear, even if Smart Guides are on.
            



Punching and combining shapes with the Shaper tool
Not only does the Shaper tool let you draw shapes, but you can then combine, subtract,
         and continuously edit them, all with a single tool. Next, you'll draw a few more shapes
         and use the Shaper tool to add and subtract them from the original circle, creating
         a sail for the boat.
      


With the Shaper tool () selected, press Shift+Option (macOS) or Shift+Alt (Windows), and drag the circle
               straight to the left to make a copy. A horizontal magenta alignment guide will show.
               Make sure the circles are not touching, and then release the mouse button and then the keys.
            


 Note: Don't worry if the new circle is on or off the edge of the artboard. You'll reposition
                  it all shortly.
               



Click and hold down the mouse button on the Star tool (), and select the Rectangle tool () in the Tools panel. Move the pointer over the center top of the circle on the left.
               When the word "anchor" appears, drag to create a rectangle. Drag to the bottom-center
               point of the circle on the right.
            



Select the Shaper tool () in the Tools panel. Click in a blank area of the artboard to deselect all shapes.
            


Move the pointer to the left of the shapes. Scribble across the circle shape, stopping
               just after the left edge of the rectangle. When you release, the circle on the left will be
               deleted, and the overlapping area of the shapes will be removed.
            



Move the pointer into the circle on the right, and draw a scribble to the left, into the gray area of the
               remaining rectangle shape to combine them.
            



Move the pointer over the gray shape to see the outlines of the original shapes, and
               then click to select the merged group, called a Shaper Group. See the first part of the following figure.
            

 Tip: You can also double-click a Shaper Group to be able to select the underlying shapes.
               



Click the arrow widget () on the right side of the Shaper Group to be able to select the underlying shapes.
               After clicking the arrow widget, the Shaper Group is in Construction Mode.
            

All shapes in a Shaper Group remain editable, even after portions of shapes may have
               been punched out or merged.
            


Click the stroke of the left circle to select it. Press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key and
               drag the right-middle bounding point to the left to make the circle a little narrower.
               Release the mouse button and then the key.
            

 Note: If you attempted to select the shape and you deselected instead, repeat the previous
                  steps. The circle on the left now has no fill, so it cannot be selected by clicking
                  within.
               


Notice that the circle you dragged is still punched out from the rectangle. Not only
               can you resize individual shapes in a Shaper Group, but you can also reposition them,
               rotate them, and more.
            


Press Esc to stop editing the individual shapes, and select the entire Shaper Group.


Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel, and make sure that the Swatches
               option () is selected in the panel that appears. Select a light gray color with a tooltip
               of "C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=5."
            


Change the stroke weight to 0 in the Properties panel by clicking the down arrow until the stroke is removed.
            


Drag the sail shape onto the boat in the lower-right corner. You may need to zoom
               out.
            

 Note: You can Shift-drag a corner of the sail shape to resize it to fit better with the
                  boat shapes, if needed.
               



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.



Using Image Trace
In this part of the lesson, you'll learn how to work with the Image Trace command.
         Image Trace traces existing artwork, like a raster picture from Adobe Photoshop. You
         can then convert the drawing to vector paths or a Live Paint object. This can be useful
         for turning a drawing into vector art, tracing raster logos, tracing a pattern or
         texture, and much more.
      

 Tip: Use Adobe Capture CC on your device to photograph any object, design, or shape and
            convert it into vector shapes in a few simple steps. Store the resulting vectors in
            your Creative Cloud libraries, and access them or refine them in Illustrator or Photoshop.
            Adobe Capture is currently available for iOS (iPhone and iPad) and Android.
         



Click the Previous button () below the document in the status bar to show the artboard to the left in the Document
               window.
            


Choose File > Place. In the Place dialog box, select the island.png file in the Lessons
               > Lesson03 folder on your hard disk, leave the options at their defaults, and click
               Place.
            


Move the pointer over the upper-left corner bleed guide (the red guide off the edge
               of the artboard), and click to place the image.
            



With the image selected, click the Image Trace button in the Properties panel to the
               right of the document, and choose Low Fidelity Photo. The tracing results you see
               may differ slightly from the figure, and that's okay.
            

 Note: You can also choose Object > Image Trace > Make, with raster content selected, or
                  begin tracing from the Image Trace panel (Window > Image Trace).
               


This converts the image into an image tracing object. That means you can't edit the
               vector content yet, but you can change the tracing settings or even the original placed
               image and then see the updates.
            


Choose 6 Colors from the Preset menu that's showing in the Properties panel.

The 6 Colors preset will trace the image, forcing the resulting vector content to
               use six colors only. In some cases, in an image with a lot of different color, this
               can apply the same color to a lot of content. An image tracing object is made up of
               the original source image and the tracing result (which is the vector artwork). By
               default, only the tracing result is visible. However, you can change the display of
               both the original image and the tracing result to best suit your needs.
            


Click the Image Trace Panel button () in the Properties panel. In the Image Trace panel, click the Auto-Color button () at the top.
            

The buttons along the top of the Image Trace panel are saved settings for converting
               the image to grayscale, black and white, and more. Below the buttons at the top of
               the Image Trace panel, you will see the Preset option. This is the same option as
               in the Properties panel. The Mode option allows you to change the color mode of resulting
               artwork (color, grayscale, or black and white). The Palette option is also useful
               for limiting the color palette or for assigning colors from a color group.

 Tip: The Image Trace panel can also be opened by choosing Window > Image Trace.
               



In the Image Trace panel, click the triangle to the left of the Advanced options to
               reveal them. Change the following options in the Image Trace panel, using the values
               as a starting point:
            



Colors: 20


Paths: 50%


Corners: 25%


Noise: 8 px




Close the Image Trace panel.


With the map tracing object still selected, click the Expand button in the Properties
               panel.
            

The map is no longer an image tracing object but is composed of shapes and paths that
               are grouped together.
            


Choose Object > Hide > Selection to temporarily hide it.


Working with drawing modes
Illustrator has three different drawing modes available that are found at the bottom
         of the Tools panel: Draw Normal, Draw Behind, and Draw Inside. Drawing modes allow
         you to draw shapes in different ways. The three drawing modes are as follows:
      


Draw Normal mode: You start every document by drawing shapes in Normal mode, which stacks shapes on
               top of each other.
            


Draw Behind mode: This mode allows you to draw behind all artwork on a selected layer if no artwork
               is selected. If an artwork is selected, the new object is drawn directly beneath the
               selected object.
            


Draw Inside mode: This mode lets you draw objects or place images inside other objects, including live
               text, automatically creating a clipping mask of the selected object.
            




 Note: To learn more about clipping masks, see Lesson 14, "Using Illustrator CC with Other Adobe Applications."
         

Using the Draw Inside mode
      
Next, you will learn how to add artwork inside of a selected shape using the Draw
         Inside drawing mode. This can be useful if you want to hide (mask) part of the artwork.
      


Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, select the map_edges.ai file in the Lessons
               > Lesson03 folder on your hard disk and click Open.
            
The orange shape you see is just a closed path that was created using the Pencil tool
               in the Tools panel. You'll copy this shape and paste it back in the Postcard.ai file.
            


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and click the orange map edges shape to select it. Choose Edit
               > Copy.
            


Click the Postcard.ai tab to return to the postcard document. Choose Edit > Paste
               In Place.
            


Click the orange shape to select it, if it isn't, and then click the Draw Inside button
               (), near the bottom of the Tools panel.
            

This button is active when a single object is selected (path, compound path, or text),
               and it allows you to draw within the selected object only. Notice that the orange
               shape has a dotted open rectangle around it, indicating that, if you draw, paste,
               or place content, it will be inside the orange shape.
            

 Note: If the Tools panel you see is displayed as a single column, you can click the Drawing
                  Modes button () at the bottom of the Tools panel and choose Draw Inside from the menu that appears.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.
Notice that the orange shape still has the dotted open rectangle around it, indicating
               that Draw Inside mode is still active. The shape you are about to draw inside of does
               not need to be selected.
            



Click and hold down the mouse button on the Rectangle tool () in the Tools panel, and select the Ellipse tool (). Press the letter D to apply the default white fill and black stroke to the shape
               you are about to draw. Click and drag to create an ellipse that overlaps the edge
               of the orange shape.
            
The ellipse you just drew is within the orange shape, and part of it is being hidden.


Choose Edit > Undo Ellipse to get rid of the ellipse.
            
You can also place or paste content into a shape with Draw Inside mode active.


Choose Object > Show All to show the island artwork again, which is now behind the
               orange shape.
            


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and choose Edit > Cut to cut the selected island artwork from
               the artboard.
            



Choose Edit > Paste In Place.
The island artwork is placed within the orange shape.


Click the Draw Normal button () at the bottom of the Tools panel.
            
When you are finished adding content inside a shape, you can click the Draw Normal
               button so that any new content you create will be drawn normally (stacked rather than
               drawn inside).
            

 Note: If the Tools panel you see is displayed as a single column, you can click the Drawing
                  Modes button at the bottom of the Tools panel and choose Draw Normal from the menu
                  that appears.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.



 Tip: You can also toggle between the available drawing modes by pressing Shift+D.
         


 Tip: You can separate the shapes by choosing Object > Clipping Mask > Release. This would
            make two objects, stacked one on another.
         

Editing content drawn inside
Next, you'll edit the map artwork inside of the shape to see how you can later edit
         content inside.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the island artwork. Notice that it selects the map edges
               shape instead.
            
The map edges shape is now a mask, also called a clipping path. The island artwork and the map edges shape, together, make a clip group and are now treated as a single object. If you look at the top of the Properties
               panel, you will see Clip Group. Like other groups, if you would like to edit the clipping
               path (the object that contains the content drawn inside of it) or the content inside,
               you can double-click the Clip Group object.
            



With the Clip Group selected, click the Isolate Group button in the Properties panel
               to enter Isolation mode and be able to select the clipping path (map edges shape)
               or the island artwork within.
            



Click the map artwork within the map boundaries, and drag it down and to the right
               a little.
            


 Tip: Sometimes it can be helpful to choose View > Outline to more easily see and select
                  shapes when in Isolation mode.
               



Press Esc to exit Isolation mode.


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Working with Draw Behind mode
Throughout this lesson, you've been working in the default Draw Normal mode. Next,
         you'll draw a rectangle that will cover the artboard and go behind the rest of the
         content using Draw Behind mode.
      


Click the Draw Behind button () at the bottom of the Tools panel.
            
As long as this drawing mode is selected, every shape you create using the different
               methods you've learned will be created behind the other shapes on the page. The Draw
               Behind mode also affects placed content (File > Place).
            


 Note: If the Tools panel you see is displayed as a single column, you can click the Drawing
                  Modes button () at the bottom of the Tools panel and choose Draw Behind from the menu that appears.
               



Click and hold down the mouse button on the Ellipse tool () in the Tools panel, and select the Rectangle tool (). Position the pointer off the upper-left corner of the artboard where the red bleed
               guides meet. Click and drag to the lower-right corner of the red bleed guides.
            


 Note: If artwork was selected, clicking the Draw Behind button would allow you to draw
                  artwork behind the selected artwork.
               



With the new rectangle selected, click the Fill color box in the Properties panel.
               Make sure that the Swatches option () is selected, then change the fill color to a tan color with the tooltip "C=25 M=25
               Y=40 K=0." Press the Escape key to hide the panel.
            



Choose Object > Lock > Selection.


Finishing up
      
To finish the postcard, you'll bring the artwork onto the artboard with the island
         artwork on it.
      


Choose View > Fit All In Window to see both artboards.


Select the Selection tool (), and drag across the ship artwork to select it. Click the Group button in the Properties
               panel.
            



Choose Select > All On Active Artboard to select all of the shapes. Choose Object
               > Arrange > Bring To Front.
            
You brought the selected artwork to the front because it was created first, which
               means it would be behind the artwork on the left artboard, which was created after.
               Next, you'll drag the artwork onto the artboard on the left and resize it.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.


Drag each group from the right artboard onto the left artboard, one at a time. To
               resize each group to better fit within the map, you can press the Shift key and drag
               a corner of the artwork bounding box to scale it. When finished, release the mouse
               button and then the key.
            
In the final artwork, I created copies of a few of the objects by choosing Edit >
               Copy and then Edit > Paste. I also selected copies of the mountain shape and changed
               the color fill in the Properties panel on the right, for each.
            


 Note: You may want to zoom in to different artwork by choosing View > Zoom In.
               



Choose File > Save and then File > Close.

Review answers


There are six shape tools: Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, Star, and
                  Flare (the Flare tool was not covered in the lesson). As explained in Lesson 1, "Getting to Know the Work Area," to tear off a group of tools from the Tools panel, position the pointer over the
                  tool that appears in the Tools panel, and hold down the mouse button until the group
                  of tools appears. Without releasing the mouse button, drag to the triangle on the
                  right side of the group and then release the mouse button to tear off the group.
               


After you draw a rectangle, rounded rectangle, ellipse, or polygon using the shape
                  tool, you can continue to modify its properties such as width, height, rounded corners,
                  corner types, and radii (individually or collectively). This is what is known as a
                  Live Shape. The shape properties such as corner radius are editable later in the Transform
                  panel, in the Properties panel, or directly on the art.
               


Items that have no fill can be selected by clicking the stroke (or edge) or by dragging
                  a selection marquee across the item.
               


Another way to draw and edit shapes in Illustrator involves the Shaper tool. The Shaper
                  tool recognizes natural gestures and produces Live Shapes from those gestures. Without
                  switching tools, you can transform individual shapes you create and even perform operations
                  such as punch and combine.
               


You can convert a raster image to editable vector shapes by selecting it, and then
                  clicking the Image Trace button in the Properties panel. To convert the tracing to
                  paths, click Expand in the Properties panel, or choose Object > Image Trace > Expand.
                  Use this method if you want to work with the components of the traced artwork as individual
                  objects. The resulting paths are grouped.

Soon after you begin creating simple paths and shapes, you will most likely want to
         take them further in order to create more complex artwork. In this lesson, you'll
         explore how to both edit and combine shapes and paths.
      
Starting the lesson
      
In Lesson 3, "Using Shapes to Create Artwork for a Postcard," you learned about creating and making edits to basic shapes. In this lesson, you'll
         take basic shapes and paths and learn how to both edit and combine them to create
         artwork in order to finish a poster about camping.

Start Adobe Illustrator CC.


Choose File > Open. Locate the file named L4_end.ai, which is in the Lessons > Lesson04
               folder that you copied onto your hard disk, and click Open. This file contains the
               finished artwork.
            



Choose View > Fit All In Window; leave the file open for reference, or choose File
               > Close (I closed it).
            


Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson04 folder,
               and select the L4_start.ai file on your hard disk. Click Open.
            



Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, change the name to HappyCamper.ai (macOS) or HappyCamper (Windows), and choose the Lesson04 folder. Leave the Format option set to Adobe Illustrator
               (ai) (macOS) or the Save As Type option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows),
               and click Save.
            

 Tip: By default, the .ai extension shows on macOS, but you could add the extension on
                  either platform in the Save As dialog box.
               



In the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the Illustrator options at their default
               settings, and click OK.
            


Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.

 Note: If you don't see Reset Essentials in the Workspace menu, choose Window > Workspace
                  > Essentials before choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
               



Editing paths and shapes
      
In Illustrator, you can edit and combine paths and shapes in a variety of ways to
         achieve the artwork you want. Sometimes, to get the artwork you desire, you start
         with simpler paths and shapes and use different methods for achieving more complex
         paths. This includes working with the Scissors tool (), the Knife tool (), and the Eraser tool (); outlining strokes; joining paths; and more.
      

 Note: You'll explore other methods for transforming artwork in Lesson 5, "Transforming Artwork."
         

Cutting with the Scissors tool
There are several tools that allow you to cut and divide shapes. You'll start with
         the Scissors tool (), which splits a path at an anchor point or on a line segment and makes an open path.
         Next, you'll cut a rectangle with the Scissors tool and reshape it to make curtains
         in a camping trailer illustration.
      


Click the View menu and make sure that the Smart Guides option is selected (a checkmark
               appears).
            


Choose 2 Window from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window. Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
            

An example of what you will create is labeled "Final" on the right side of the artboard.
               You will work with the artwork labeled "Start," on the left.
            


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and click the white shape on the left to select it.
            


Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) a few times to zoom in to the selected
               artwork.
            



With the shape selected, in the Tools panel, click and hold down mouse button on the
               Eraser tool (), and select the Scissors tool (). Position the pointer over the bottom edge of the shape (see the figure). When you
               see the word "path," click to cut the path at that point, and then move the pointer
               away.
            

 Note: If you don't click directly on a point or path, you will see a warning dialog box.
                  You can simply click OK and try again.
               


Cuts made with the Scissors tool must be on a line or a curve rather than on an end
               point of an open path. Clicking the stroke of a shape, the rectangle in this example,
               with the Scissors tool, the path is cut where you click so that it becomes open (a
               path with two end points).
            


Select the Direct Selection tool () in the Tools panel. Move the pointer over the selected (blue) anchor point and drag
               it up.
            



Drag the other anchor point, from where you originally cut the shape with the scissors,
               up and to the right (see the figure).
            

Notice how the stroke (the black border) doesn't go all the way around the white shape.
               That's because cutting with the Scissors tool makes an open path. If you only want
               to fill the shape with a color, it doesn't have to be a closed path. It is, however,
               necessary for a path to be closed if you want a stroke to appear around the entire
               fill area.
            


Joining paths
      
Suppose you draw a "U" shape and later decide you want to close the shape, essentially
         joining the ends of the "U" with a straight path. If you select the path, you can
         use the Join command to create a line segment between the end points, closing the
         path. When more than one open path is selected, you can join them to create a closed
         path. You can also join the end points of two separate paths. Next, you will join
         the ends of the white path to create a single closed shape.
      


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel. Click away from the white path to deselect it and then click
               in the white fill to reselect it.
            

This step is important because only one anchor point was left selected from the previous
               section. If you were to choose the Join command with only one anchor point selected,
               an error message would appear. By selecting the whole path, when you apply the Join
               command, Illustrator simply finds the two ends of the path and connects them with
               a straight line.
            

 Tip: If you wanted to join specific anchor points from separate paths, select the anchor
                  points, and choose Object > Join > Path or press Command+J (macOS) or Ctrl+J (Windows).
               



Choose Object > Path > Join.
When you apply the Join command to two or more open paths, Illustrator first looks
               for and joins the paths that have end points stationed closest to each other. This
               process is repeated every time you apply the Join command until all paths are joined.
            


 Tip: In Lesson 6, "Creating an Illustration with the Drawing Tools," you'll learn about the Join tool (), which allows you to join two paths at a corner, keeping the original curve intact.
               



In the Properties panel on the right (Window > Properties), change the stroke to 0 by clicking the down arrow until the stroke is removed.
            


Click the Fill color box (white) in the Properties panel, make sure the Swatches option
               () is selected in the panel that appears, and click to select the color named Purple3.
            



Drag across the window shapes to select them.


Choose Object > Group.

 Tip: To group selected content, you can also click the Group button in the Quick Actions
                  section of the Properties panel.
               



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.



Cutting with the Knife tool
Another way to cut a shape is by using the Knife tool (). To cut with the Knife tool, you drag across a shape, and the result is two closed
         paths.
      


Choose 3 Tank from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            

An example of what you will create is labeled "Final" on the right side of the artboard.
               You will work with the artwork labeled "Start," on the left.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window to ensure it fits in the Document window.


Select the Selection tool (), and click the pink oval shape under the artwork labeled "Start."
            

If an object is selected, the Knife tool will only cut that object. If nothing is
               selected, it will cut any vector objects it touches.
            

 Note: You can select multiple vector objects and cut them at one time with the Knife tool.
               



Click and hold down the mouse on the Scissors tool (), and select the Knife tool ().
            


Move the Knife pointer () to the left of the selected shape. Drag across the shape to cut it into two.
            

Notice how dragging across a shape with the Knife tool makes a very free-form cut
               that is not straight at all.
            

 Tip: Pressing the Caps Lock key will turn the Knife tool pointer into a more precise cursor
                  (). This can make it easier to see where the cut will happen.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.


Select the Selection tool (), and click the new, top shape (see the following figure).
            


Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel, make sure the Swatches option () is selected in the panel that appears, and click to select the color named Pink.
            



Drag the small, red square that is above the shapes, down onto the shapes you cut.


Drag across all of the tank shapes labeled "Start," to select them.


Choose Object > Group.


Choose Select > Deselect.



Cutting in a straight line
Next, you'll cut artwork in a straight line with the Knife tool. Pressing the Option
         (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key allows you to cut in a straight line with the Knife tool.
         Pressing the Shift key as well constrains the cut to 45 degrees.
      


Choose 4 Tent from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            

An example of what you will create is labeled "Final" on the right side of the artboard.
               You will work with the artwork labeled "Start," on the left. You'll cut the tent opening
               shape into several paths. This requires you to cut in straight lines.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
            



With the Selection tool () selected, click the pink triangle shape under the artwork labeled "Start."
            


Choose View > Zoom In, twice, to zoom in to the artwork.


Select the Knife tool (). Position the pointer just above the top point of the selected triangle. Press the
               Caps Lock key to turn the Knife tool pointer into a precise cursor ().
            
The pointer now appears as cross hairs and can make it easier to see exactly where
               you will begin cutting.
            


Press and hold Option+Shift (macOS) or Alt+Shift (Windows), and drag down, all the
               way across the shape to cut it into two, in a completely straight line. Release the
               mouse button and then the keys.
            


 Note: Pressing the Option/Alt key keeps the cut straight, and pressing the Shift key constrains
                  the cutting to a multiple of 45º.
               



Press and hold Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows), and drag from just above the top of
               the selected triangle, down, at a slight angle, all the way across the shape to cut
               it into two. Release the mouse button and then the key.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


Select the Selection tool (), and click the middle, pink triangle.
            



Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel, make sure the Swatches option () is selected in the panel that appears and click to select the color named Yellow.
            



Drag across all of the tent shapes labeled "Start," to select them.


Choose Object > Group.


Depress the Caps Lock key.



Outlining strokes
Paths, like a line, can show a stroke color but not a fill color by default. If you
         create a line in Illustrator and want to apply both a stroke and a fill, you can outline
         the stroke of a path, which converts it into a closed shape (or compound path). Next,
         you'll outline the stroke of a line so you can erase parts of it in the next section.
      


Choose 5 Plant from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            

An example of what you will create is labeled "Final" on the right side of the artboard.
               You'll work with the artwork labeled "Start," on the left.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window to ensure it fits in the Document window.


With the Selection tool (), select the purple rectangle labeled "Start."
            
The rectangle is actually a path. You can tell it's a path with a large stroke. In
               the Properties panel, you can see that the stroke weight is set to 20. In order to
               erase part of the path to make it the shape of one of the leaves, it will need to
               be a shape (rectangle), not a path.
            

 Tip: After outlining a stroke, the shape you have may be composed of a lot of anchor points.
                  You can choose Object > Path > Simplify to try to simplify the path, which usually
                  means fewer anchor points.
               



Choose Object > Path > Outline Stroke.

This creates a filled shape that is a closed path.

 Note: If you outline the stroke and it shows as "Group" in the Selection Indicator at the
                  top of the Properties panel, then there was a fill set on the line. If the artwork
                  is a group, choose Edit > Undo Outline Stroke, apply a fill of None to the path, and
                  try again.
               



Drag the shape into position like you see in the following figure. Leave the shape
               selected.
            

Next, you'll erase parts of the shape.


Using the Eraser tool
The Eraser tool () lets you erase any area of your vector artwork, regardless of the structure. You
         can use the Eraser tool on paths, compound paths, paths inside Live Paint groups,
         and clipping content. Whatever artwork you select is the only artwork you will erase.
         If you leave all objects deselected, you can erase any object that the tool touches,
         across all layers. Next, you'll use the Eraser tool to erase part of the selected
         rectangle so it looks like a leaf.
      

 Note: You cannot erase raster images, text, symbols, graphs, or gradient mesh objects.
         



Click and hold down the mouse button on the Knife tool (), and select the Eraser tool () in the Tools panel.


Double-click the Eraser tool () in the Tools panel to edit the tool properties. In the Eraser Tool Options dialog
               box, change Size to 20 pt to make the eraser larger. Click OK.
            
You can change the Eraser tool properties, depending on what your erasing needs are.


 Tip: With the Eraser tool selected, you could also click the Tool Options button at the
                  top of the Properties panel to see the options dialog box.
               



Position the pointer above the selected purple shape. Drag down the left side of the
               shape to erase it.
            

When you release the mouse button, part of the shape is erased, and the shape is still
               a closed path.
            


Position the pointer above the selected purple shape. Drag down the right side of
               the shape to erase it.
            



Select the Selection tool () and drag across all of the plant shapes labeled "Start," to select them.
            



Choose Object > Group.


Erasing in a straight line
      
You can also erase in a straight line, which is what you'll do next.


Choose 6 Car from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            

An example of what you will create is labeled "Final" on the right side of the artboard.
               You will work with the artwork labeled "Start," on the left. You'll select and erase
               the single door shape to make two doors.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window to ensure it fits in the Document window.


Select the Selection tool (), and click to select the door shape labeled "Start."
            


Choose View > Zoom In a few times to zoom in closer.


Double-click the Eraser tool () to edit the tool properties. In the Eraser Tool Options dialog box, change Size
               to 5 pt to make the eraser smaller. Click OK.
            



With the Eraser tool () selected, move the pointer above the middle of the selected shape. Press the Shift
               key, and drag straight down. Release the mouse button and then the Shift key.
            

It may look like you erased other parts of the car, but since nothing else was selected,
               you didn't. The selected door shape is now two separate shapes, both closed paths.
            


 Tip: If you need to erase a large part of a shape, you can always adjust the eraser size
                  by using the Eraser Tool Options dialog box or by pressing either of the bracket keys
                  ([ or ]).
               



Select the Selection tool and drag across all of the car shapes labeled "Start" to
               select them.
            


Click the Group button in the Quick Actions section of the Properties panel to the
               right of the document.
            


Choose File > Save.


Creating a compound path
Compound paths let you use a vector object to cut a hole in another vector object.
         Whenever I think of a compound path, I think of a doughnut shape, which can be created
         from two circles. Holes appear where paths overlap. A compound path is treated like
         a group, and the individual objects in the compound path can still be edited or released
         (if you don't want them to be a compound path anymore). Next, you'll create a compound
         path to create some art for a wheel.
      


Choose 7 Wheel from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            

An example of what you will create is labeled "Final" on the right side of the artboard.
               You will work with the artwork labeled "Start" on the left. You'll create a wheel
               from the shapes labeled "Start."
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window, if necessary.


With the Selection tool () selected, select the gray circle on the left, and drag it so it overlaps the larger
               dark circle to its right.
            



Drag the white shape on top of the gray circle and make sure it's centered.
Smart Guides will help you align the circles. You can also select the gray circle
               and the white circle and align them to each other using the Align options in the Properties
               panel on the right.
            



Shift-click the gray circle to select it along with the white circle.


Choose Object > Compound Path > Make, and leave the artwork selected.


 Tip: You can still edit the original shapes in a compound path like this one. To edit
                  them, select each shape individually with the Direct Selection tool () or double-click the compound path with the Selection tool to enter Isolation mode
                  and select the individual shapes.
               

You can now see that the white circle has seemingly disappeared, and you can now see
               through the shape to the dark color of circle beneath. The white circle was used to
               "punch" a hole in the gray shape. With the shape still selected, you should see "Compound
               Path" at the top of the Properties panel to the right.
            


Drag the gray donut shape into the center of the darker circle behind it. The selected
               shape should be on top. If it isn't, choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front.
            



 Note: When creating a compound path, the appearance attributes of the object lowest in
                  the stacking order determine the appearance of the resulting compound path.
               



Drag across all of the circle shapes labeled "Start" to select them.


Choose Object > Group.


Choose File > Save.


Combining shapes
      
A lot of the time, creating more complex shapes from simpler shapes can be easier
         than trying to create them with drawing tools like the Pen tool. In Illustrator, you
         can combine vector objects in different ways. The resulting paths or shapes differ
         depending on the method you use to combine the paths. In this section, you'll explore
         a few of the more widely used methods for combining shapes.
      
Working with the Shape Builder tool
The first method you'll learn for combining shapes involves working with the Shape
         Builder tool (). This tool allows you to visually and intuitively merge, delete, fill, and edit
         overlapping shapes and paths directly in the artwork. Using the Shape Builder tool,
         you'll create a more complex trailer shape from a series of simpler shapes like circles
         and squares.
      


Choose 8 Trailer from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window.
            

An example of what you will create is labeled "Final" on the right side of the artboard.
               You will work with the artwork labeled "Start" on the left.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window to ensure it fits in the Document window.


With the Selection tool () selected, drag a marquee selection across the three shapes you see in the figure,
               labeled "Start," to select the shapes on the artboard. Make sure not to select the
               white circle.
            

To edit shapes with the Shape Builder tool (), they need to be selected. Using the Shape Builder tool, you will now combine, delete,
               and paint these simple shapes to create a camper.
            


Select the Shape Builder tool () in the Tools panel. Position the pointer off the upper-left corner of the shapes,
               and drag from the red X in the figure to the right into the shapes. Release the mouse
               button to combine the shapes.
            

When you select the Shape Builder tool, the overlapping shapes are divided into separate
               objects temporarily. As you drag from one part to another, a red outline appears,
               showing you what the final shape will look like when the shapes are merged together,
               after releasing the mouse button.
            

 Tip: You can also press the Shift key and drag a marquee across a series of shapes to
                  combine them. Pressing Shift+Option (macOS) or Shift+Alt (Windows) and dragging a
                  marquee across selected shapes with the Shape Builder tool () selected allows you to delete a series of shapes within the marquee.
               



Position the pointer off the upper-left corner of the shapes again. Press the Shift
               key and drag from the red X in the figure, down and to the right. Release the mouse
               button to combine the shapes.
            

Next, you'll delete a few shapes.

 Note: Your final combined shapes may have a different stroke and/or fill, and that's okay.
                  You'll change them shortly.
               



With the shapes still selected, hold down the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key.
               Notice that, with the modifier key held down, the pointer shows a minus sign (). Click the shape on the far left to delete it. See the figure for which shape to
               remove.
            


 Note: When you position the pointer over the shapes, make sure you see the mesh within
                  those shapes, before clicking to delete.
               



Select the Selection tool (). Drag across the larger shape you combined, the purple bar and the white circle
               to select all three shapes.
            


Select the Shape Builder tool () and move the pointer below the white circle. Hold down the Option (macOS) or Alt
               (Windows) key and drag through the white circle, stopping before the top of the circle
               to remove it from the larger shape you combined.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


Select the Selection tool (), and click the edge of the larger shape to select it. Change the fill color in the
               Properties panel to the color named red 1 with the tooltip name that shows as "Red
               1." Change the stroke weight to 0.
            



Drag across the red shape, purple shape, and black line to select them all.



Choose Object > Group.


Combining objects using Pathfinder effects
Pathfinder effects, found in the Properties panel or the Pathfinder panel (Window
         > Pathfinder), are another way to combine shapes in different ways. When a Pathfinder
         effect such as Unite is applied, the original objects selected are permanently transformed.
      


Choose 9 Door from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            

An example of what you will create is labeled "Final" on the right side of the artboard.
               You will work with the artwork labeled "Start" on the left. You'll combine shapes
               in different ways to create a single door.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
            


With the Selection tool () selected, drag across the circle and rectangle with the black strokes to select
               both objects.
            

You need to create a shape that looks like the door to the right of the shapes you
               selected, labeled "Final." You will use the Properties panel and those shapes to create
               the final artwork.
            


With the shapes selected, in the Properties panel on the right, click the Unite button
               () to permanently combine the two shapes.
            

 Note: The Unite button in the Properties panel produces a similar result as the Shape Builder
                  tool, by combining the shapes into one.
               



 Tip: Clicking More Options () in the Pathfinder section of the Properties panel will reveal the Pathfinder panel,
                  which has more options.
               



Choose Edit > Undo Add to undo the Unite command and bring both shapes back. Leave
               them selected.
            


Understanding Shape Modes
In the previous section, the pathfinder effect made a permanent change to the shapes.
         When several shapes are selected, clicking the Pathfinders that are showing in the
         Properties panel by default while pressing the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key
         creates a compound shape rather than a path. The original underlying objects of compound
         shapes are preserved. As a result, you can still select each original object within
         a compound shape. Using a shape mode to create a compound shape can be useful if you
         think that you may want to retrieve the original shapes at a later time.
      


With the shapes still selected, hold down the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key,
               and click the Unite button () in the Properties panel.
            

This creates a compound shape that traces the outline of what's left after the shapes
               are combined. You will still be able to edit both shapes separately.
            


Choose Select > Deselect to see the final shape.


With the Selection tool, double-click the black stroke of the newly combined shape
               to enter Isolation mode.
            

 Tip: To edit the original shapes in a compound shape like this one, you can also select
                  them individually with the Direct Selection tool ().
               



Click the edge of the circle at the top or drag across the path to select it.


Drag the selected circle from the blue dot in the center, straight down. As you drag,
               press the Shift key. Drag down until you see that a horizontal Smart Guide appears
               and the center of the circle is aligned with the top edge of the rectangle. When in
               position, release the mouse button and then the Shift key.
            

 Note: You can also press the arrow keys to move the shape if you find it difficult to drag.
               




Press the Escape key to exit Isolation mode.
You will now expand the shape. Expanding a compound shape maintains the shape of the
               compound object, but you can no longer select or edit the original objects. You will
               typically expand an object when you want to modify the appearance attributes and other
               properties of specific elements within it.
            


Click away from the shape to deselect it and then click to select it again.


Click the Expand button in the Properties panel.



Change the fill color in the Properties panel to the color named Pink. Change the
               stroke weight to 0.
            


Drag across the shapes that make up the door to select them all.


Click the Group button toward the bottom of the Properties panel to group the content
               together.
            


Creating the trailer
      
In this short section, you'll drag all of the pieces for the trailer together and
         group them.
      


Choose View > Zoom Out several times.


Press the spacebar to access the Hand tool and drag in the Document window to see
               the wheel, door, window, and tank artboards.
            


With the Selection tool selected, drag the wheel, door, window, and tank artwork you
               created onto the trailer artwork labeled "Start." Position them like you see in the
               figure.
            


 Note: You may find that with the Smart Guides on, it is difficult to position the content
                  on the trailer. You can always turn off the Smart Guides (View > Smart Guides), then
                  turn them on when you are finished dragging the artwork.
               



Drag across the trailer artwork and choose Object > Group.


Reshaping a path
In Lesson 3, "Using Shapes to Create Artwork for a Postcard," you learned about creating shapes and paths (lines). You can use the Reshape tool
         to stretch parts of a path without distorting its overall shape. In this section,
         you'll change the shape of a line, giving it a bit of curve, so you can turn it into
         a flame.
      


Choose 10 Flame from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window.
            

An example of what you will create is labeled "Final" on the right side of the artboard.
               You will work with the artwork labeled "Start" on the left. You'll reshape the straight
               line on the left to start.
            


Select the Selection tool () and click the line labeled "Start."
            


Click and hold down the mouse button on the Scale tool () and select the Reshape tool () from the tool menu.
            


Move the pointer over the path. When the pointer changes (), drag away from the path to add an anchor point and reshape the path. Move the pointer
               farther down the path and drag the path to the left. You can look at the flame shape
               labeled "Final," to the right, for guidance.
            

 Note: You can use the Reshape path on a closed path, like a square or circle, but if the
                  entire path is selected, the Reshape tool will add anchor points and reshape the path.
               


The Reshape tool can be used to drag an existing anchor point or path segment. If
               you drag from an existing path segment, an anchor point is created.
            


Move the pointer over the top anchor point of the path and drag it to the right a
               little. Leave the path selected.
            
All of the anchor points were selected in the path, which means the Reshape tool will
               adjust the entire path.
            


 Note: Only selected anchor points will be adjusted when dragging with the Reshape tool.
               



Using the Width tool
Not only can you adjust the weight of a stroke, like you did in Lesson 3, but you can alter regular stroke widths either by using the Width tool () or by applying width profiles to the stroke. This allows you to create a variable
         width along the stroke of a path. Next, you will use the Width tool to adjust the
         path you just reshaped to look like a flame.
      


Select the Width tool () in the Tools panel. Position the pointer over the middle of the path you just reshaped,
               and notice that the pointer has a plus symbol next to it () when over the path. If you were to drag, you would edit the width of the stroke.
               Drag away from the line, to the right. Notice that, as you drag, you are stretching
               the stroke to the left and right equally. Release the mouse when the measurement label
               shows Side 1 and Side 2 at approximately 0.2 in.
            

You just created a variable stroke on a path, not a shape with a fill. The new point
               on the original path that's filled with blue is called the width point. The lines extending from the width point are the handles.
            

 Tip: You can drag one width point on top of another width point to create a discontinuous
                  width point. If you double-click a discontinuous width point, the Width Point Edit
                  dialog box allows you to edit both width points.
               



Click in a blank area of the artboard to deselect the point.

 Tip: If you select a width point by clicking it, you can press Delete to remove it. If
                  there was only one width point on a stroke, removing that point would remove the width
                  completely.
               



Position the pointer anywhere over the path, and the new width point you just created
               will appear (an arrow is pointing to it in the first part of the figure below). The
               width point you see on the path next to the pointer is where a new point would be
               created if you were to click.
            


Position the pointer over the original width point, and when you see lines extending
               from it and the pointer changes (), click and drag it up and down to see the effect on the path.
            

 Note: You don't have to position the pointer over the center of the line and drag to create
                  another width point. You can drag from anywhere in the stroke area.
               




Choose Edit > Undo Width Point Change to return the width point to its original position
               on the path.
            
Aside from dragging to add a width point to a path, you can also double-click and
               enter values in a dialog box. That's what you'll do next.
            


Move the pointer over the top anchor point of the path, and notice that the pointer
               has a wavy line next to it () and the word "anchor" appears (see the first part of the following figure). Double-click
               the point to create a new width point and to open the Width Point Edit dialog box.
            

 Tip: You can move the pointer over a width point, press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows)
                  key, and drag to duplicate it.
               



In the Width Point Edit dialog box, change the Total Width to 0 in, and click OK.
            

The Width Point Edit dialog box allows you to adjust the length of the width point
               handles together or separately, with more precision. Also, if you select the Adjust
               Adjoining Width Points option, any changes you make to the selected width point affect
               neighboring width points as well.


Move the pointer over the bottom anchor point of the path, and double-click. In the
               Width Point Edit dialog box, change the Total Width to 0 in, and click OK.
            


 Tip: You can select a width point and Option-drag (macOS) or Alt-drag (Windows) one of
                  the width point handles to change one side of the stroke width.
               



Move the pointer over the original width point. When the width point handles appear,
               drag one of them away from the center of the path to make it a little wider. Leave
               the path selected for the next section.
            

 Tip: After defining the stroke width, you can save the variable width as a profile that you can reuse later, from the Stroke panel or the Control panel. To learn more
                  about variable width profiles, search for "Painting with fills and strokes" in Illustrator
                  Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
               




Finishing up the illustration
To finish the illustration, you will drag the artwork you grouped on each artboard
         into the main illustration on the left.
      


Select the Selection tool () and, with the path selected, choose Edit > Copy and then Edit > Paste to paste a
               copy.
            


With the copy selected, choose Object > Path > Outline Stroke so you can more easily
               scale the shape without having to adjust a stroke weight.
            


Shift-drag the corner of the path to make it smaller. Release the mouse button and
               then the key. Drag it into position like you see in the figure.
            



With the smaller copy selected, choose Edit > Copy and then Edit > Paste, scale the
               new copy larger, and position it like you see in the figure.
            



With the shape still selected, click the Flip Along Horizontal Axis option () in the Properties panel. Drag the shape into position like you see in the figure.
            



Drag across the three flame shapes to select them all. Choose Object > Group.


Choose View > Zoom Out a few times so you can see the campfire artwork to the right
               of the artboard. Drag the group of flames onto the fire artwork to the right of the
               artboard.
            


Drag across all of the campfire shapes to select them. Choose Object > Group.



Choose View > Fit All In Window.


Choose View > Smart Guides to turn them off.


Drag each of the artwork groups you created, into the main illustration like you see
               in the figure.
            
You may want to adjust the size of each group so they fit within the existing artwork
               better. With the Selection tool, you can hold down the Shift key and drag a corner
               point to resize artwork proportionally. When finished resizing, release the mouse
               button and then the Shift key.

Review questions
         


Name two ways you can combine several shapes into one.


What is the difference between the Scissors tool () and the Knife tool ()?
               


How can you erase with the Eraser tool () in a straight line?
               


What is the main difference between shape modes and Pathfinder effects in the Properties
                  panel or Pathfinder panel?
               


Why would you outline strokes?




Review answers


Using the Shape Builder tool (), you can visually and intuitively merge, delete, fill, and edit overlapping shapes
                  and paths directly in the artwork. You can also use the Pathfinder effects, which
                  can be found in the Properties panel, the Effects menu, or the Pathfinder panel, to
                  create new shapes out of overlapping objects. As you saw in Lesson 3, "Using Shapes to Create Artwork for a Postcard," shapes can also be combined using the Shaper tool.
               


The Scissors tool () is meant to split a path, graphics frame, or empty text frame at an anchor point
                  or along a segment. The Knife tool () cuts objects along a path you draw with the tool, dividing objects. When you cut
                  a shape with the Scissors tool, it becomes an open path. When you cut a shape with
                  the Knife tool, they become closed paths.
               


To erase in a straight line with the Eraser tool (), you need to press and hold the Shift key before you begin dragging with the Eraser
                  tool.
               


In the Properties panel, when a shape mode (such as Unite) is applied, the original
                  objects selected are permanently transformed, but you can hold down the Option (macOS)
                  or Alt (Windows) key, and the original underlying objects are preserved. When a Pathfinder
                  effect (such as Merge) is applied, the original objects selected are permanently transformed.
               


Paths, like a line, can show a stroke color but not a fill color by default. If you
                  create a line in Illustrator and want to apply both a stroke and a fill, you can outline
                  the stroke, which converts the line into a closed shape (or compound path).

You can modify objects in many ways as you create artwork, by quickly and precisely
         controlling their size, shape, and orientation. In this lesson, you'll explore creating
         and editing artboards, the various Transform commands, and specialized tools, while
         creating several pieces of artwork.
      
Starting the lesson
      
In this lesson, you'll transform artwork and use it to complete an infographic. Before
         you begin, you'll restore the default preferences for Adobe Illustrator, and then
         open a file containing the finished artwork to see what you'll create.
      


To ensure that the tools function and the defaults are set exactly as described in
               this lesson, delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CC preferences
               file. See "Restoring default preferences" in the "Getting Started" section at the
               beginning of the book.

Working with artboards
      
Artboards represent the regions that can contain printable or exportable artwork,
         similar to pages in Adobe InDesign or artboards in Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Experience
         Design. You can use artboards for creating a variety of things, such as multiple-page
         PDF files, printed pages with different sizes or different elements, independent elements
         for websites or apps, or video storyboards, for instance.
      
Adding artboards to a document
You can add and remove artboards at any time while working in a document. You can
         create artboards in different sizes, resize them in Artboard Editing mode, and position
         them anywhere in the Document window. All artboards are numbered and can have a name
         assigned to them. Next, you'll add a few artboards to the Infographic.ai document.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window and then press Command+- (macOS) or Ctrl+- (Windows)
               twice to zoom out.
            


Press the spacebar to temporarily access the Hand tool (). Drag the artboard to the left to see more of the darker canvas to the right of
               the artboard.
            


Click the Edit Artboards button in the Properties panel on the right to enter Artboard
               Editing mode and to select the Artboard tool in the Tools panel.
            


 Note: You can also simply select the Artboard tool () in the Tools panel to enter Artboard Editing mode.
               


 Note: If a message appears after drawing the artboard, click Okay to close it.
               



Move the pointer to the right of the existing artboard and drag down and to the right.
               When the measurement label next to the pointer shows an approximate width of 800 pixels
               and height of 800 pixels, release the mouse button.
            

The new artboard should be selected. You can tell it's selected because of the dashed
               bounding box surrounding it. In the Properties panel on the right, you'll see properties
               for the selected artboard like position (X, Y) and size (width and height), name,
               and more.
            


In the Properties panel on the right, select the width value and type 800. Select the height value and type 850 then press Return or Enter to accept the height.
            



Change the name to Back in the Artboards section of the Properties panel. Press Return or Enter to make the
               change.
            
Next, you'll create another artboard that's the same size.



Click the New Artboard button (), in the Properties panel on the right, to create a new artboard that is the same
               size as the selected artboard (Back) and added just to the right of the Back artboard.
            



Change the name of the new artboard to Front in the Properties panel.
            

When editing artboards, in Artboard Editing mode, you can see the name of each artboard
               in the upper-left corner of the artboard.
            


Editing artboards
      
After creating artboards, you can edit or delete artboards by using the Artboard tool
         (), menu commands, Properties panel, or the Artboards panel. Next, you'll reposition
         and change the size of an artboard.
      


Choose View > Fit All In Window to see all of your artboards.


Press Command+- (macOS) or Ctrl+- (Windows) twice to zoom out.


While still in Artboard Editing mode, and with the Artboard tool () still selected in the Tools panel, drag the artboard named Front to the left of
               the original artboard. Don't worry about its exact position yet, but make sure it
               doesn't cover any artwork.
            

In the Properties panel on the right, in Artboard Editing mode, you'll see lots of
               options for editing the selected artboard. When an artboard is selected, the Preset
               menu lets you change the artboard to a set size. The sizes in the Preset menu include
               typical print, video, tablet, and web sizes. You can also switch orientation, rename,
               or delete the artboard.
            


 Tip: To delete an artboard, select the artboard with the Artboard tool (), and either press Delete or click the Delete Artboard button () in the Properties panel. You can delete all but one artboard.
               



Click in the larger, original artboard in the center and choose View > Fit Artboard
               In Window to fit that artboard in the Document window.
            
Commands such as View > Fit Artboard In Window typically apply to the selected or
               active artboard.
            


Drag the bottom-middle point of the artboard up to resize it. When the point snaps
               to the bottom of the blue shape, release the mouse button.
            


 Tip: You can also transform multiple selected artboards at one time.
               



Click the Exit button at the top of the Properties panel to exit Artboard Editing
               mode.
            

Exiting Artboard Editing mode will deselect all artboards and also select the Selection
               tool () in the Tools panel on the left.
            

 Tip: To exit Artboard Editing mode, you can also select another tool in the Tools panel
                  besides the Artboard tool () or press Esc.
               



Choose View > Fit All In Window to fit all of the artboards in the Document window.


Aligning artboards
In order to organize the artboards in your document, maybe to keep similar artboards
         next to each other, you can move and align artboards to suit your working style. Next,
         you'll select all of the artboards and align them.
      


Select the Artboard tool () in the Tools panel on the left.
            
This is another way to enter Artboard Editing mode and can be useful when artwork
               is selected since you can't see the Edit Artboards button in the Properties panel
               with artwork selected.
            


Click in the leftmost artboard labeled 03-Front to select it. Press the Shift key,
               and click in the other two artboards to the right, one at a time, to select all three.
            

The Shift key allows you to add artboards to the selection, rather than draw an artboard,
               when the Artboard tool is selected.
            

 Tip: With the Artboard tool () selected, you can press the Shift key and drag across a series of artboards to select
                  them.
               



Click the Vertical Align Center option () in the Properties panel on the right to align the artboards to each other. Leave
               the artboards selected.
            



Renaming artboards
      
By default, artboards are assigned a number and a name, as you've seen. When you navigate
         the artboards in a document, it can be helpful to name them. Next, you're going to
         rename artboards so that the names are more useful.
      


While still in Artboard Editing mode, click to select the middle (largest) artboard.
               Click the Artboard Options button in the Properties panel.
            



In the Artboard Options dialog box, change the name to Inside, and click OK.
            
The Artboard Options dialog box has a lot of extra options for artboards, as well
               as a few you've already seen, like width and height.
            



Choose Window > Artboards to open the Artboards panel.
The Artboards panel allows you to see a list of all of the artboards in the document.
               It also allows you to reorder, rename, add, and delete artboards and to choose many
               other options related to artboards without being in Artboard Editing mode.
            



Choose File > Save, and keep the Artboards panel showing for the next steps.


Reordering artboards
      
You can navigate between artboards in your document using the Next artboard () and Previous artboard () buttons in the Properties panel with the Selection tool selected, nothing selected,
         and not in Artboard Editing mode, or below the Document window. By default, artboards
         are ordered according to the order in which they are created, but you can change that
         order. Next, you'll reorder the artboards in the Artboards panel so that if you use
         the Next or Previous artboard buttons, you navigate in an artboard order you determine.
      


With the Artboards panel open, double-click the number 2 to the left of the name "Back,"
               and then double-click the number 1 to the left of the name "Inside" in the Artboards
               panel.
            

Double-clicking the number to the left of an artboard name that isn't selected in
               the Artboards panel makes that artboard the active artboard and fits it in the Document window.
            


Drag the "Front" artboard name up until a line appears above the artboard named "Inside."
               Release the mouse button.
            
This makes the Front artboard the first artboard in the list.

 Tip: You can also reorder the artboards by selecting an artboard in the Artboards panel
                  and clicking the Move Up () or Move Down () button at the bottom of the panel.
               




Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window to fit the Front artboard in the Document window,
               if necessary.
            


Click the Exit button in the Properties panel to exit Artboard Editing mode.


Click the Next artboard button () in the Properties panel.
            

 Tip: The Artboard Options icon () appears to the right of the name of each artboard in the Artboards panel. It not
                  only allows access to the artboard options for each artboard but also indicates the
                  orientation (vertical or horizontal) of the artboard.
               


This fits the next artboard in the Artboards panel list, named "Inside," in the Document
               window. If you hadn't changed the order of the artboards in the Artboards panel, the
               Next artboard button in the previous step would have been dimmed (you couldn't select
               it) because the Front artboard was the last artboard in the Artboards panel list.
            


Click the X at the top of the Artboards panel group to close it.
Now that the artboards are set up, you will concentrate on transforming artwork to
               create the content for your project.
            



Rearranging artboards
In Artboard Editing mode (with the Artboard tool selected in the Tools panel), you
            can click the Rearrange All button in the Properties panel to open the Rearrange All
            Artboards dialog box.
         
In the Rearrange All Artboards dialog box, you can arrange your artboards in columns
            and set the spacing between each artboard to a set amount. For instance, if you had
            a document with six artboards and set the columns to 3, the artboards would be arranged
            in two rows (or two columns) of three artboards.
         
You can also click the Rearrange All Artboards button at the bottom of the Artboards
            panel (Window > Artboards) or choose Object > Artboards > Rearrange All Artboards.
         


Working with rulers and guides
With the artboards set up, next you'll learn about aligning and measuring content
         using rulers and guides. Rulers help you accurately place and measure objects and distances. They appear at the top
         and left in the Document window and can be shown and hidden. There are two types of
         rulers in Illustrator: artboard rulers and global rulers. The point on each ruler (horizontal and vertical) where the 0 (zero) appears is
         called the ruler origin. Artboard rulers, which are the default rulers, set the ruler origin to the upper-left
         corner of the active artboard. Global rulers set the ruler origin to the upper-left corner of the first artboard, or the artboard that is at the top of the list in the Artboards panel,
         no matter which artboard is active. By default, rulers are set to artboard rulers,
         which means the origin is in the upper-left corner of the active artboard.
      

 Note: You could switch between the artboard and global rulers by choosing View > Rulers
            > and selecting Change To Global Rulers or Change To Artboard Rulers (depending on
            which option is currently chosen), but don't do that now.
         

Creating guides
      
Guides are nonprinting lines created from the rulers that help you align objects. Next,
         you'll create a guide so later you could more accurately align content on an artboard.
      


With nothing selected and the Selection tool () selected, click the Show Rulers button in the Properties panel to the right to show
               the page rulers.
            


 Tip: You can also choose View > Rulers > Show Rulers.
               



Choose View > Fit All In Window.


Click each of the artboards, and as you do, look at the horizontal and vertical rulers
               (along the top and left sides of the Document window).
            

Notice that 0 (zero) for each ruler is always in the upper-left corner of the active
               (selected) artboard (the last artboard you clicked in). The point on each ruler (horizontal
               and vertical) where the 0 appears is called the ruler origin. By default, the ruler origin is in the upper-left corner of the active (selected) artboard. As you can see, the 0 point on both rulers corresponds to the
               edges of the active artboard.
            


With the Selection tool, click in the leftmost artboard, called "Front."
Notice the very subtle black outline around the Front artboard, with "1" showing in the Artboard
               Navigation menu (below the Document window) and in the Document section of the Properties
               panel to the right of the document, all of which indicate that the Front artboard
               is the currently active artboard. There can be only one active artboard at a time.
               Commands such as View > Fit Artboard In Window apply to the active artboard.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
That fits the active artboard in the window and the ruler origin (0,0) is in the upper-left
               corner of that same artboard. Next you'll create a guide on the active artboard.
            


Drag from the top ruler down, into the artboard. When the guide reaches 600 pixels
               on the ruler, release the mouse button. The units for this document are set at pixels.
            

 Tip: Dragging from a ruler with the Shift key pressed "snaps" a guide to the measurements
                  on the ruler.
               


 Tip: You can double-click the horizontal or vertical ruler to add a new guide.
               


After creating a guide, it's selected, and when selected, its color matches the color
               of the layer that it's associated with (darker blue in this case) when you move the
               pointer away from it.
            


With the guide still selected (in this case, it will be blue if selected), change
               the Y value in the Properties panel to 600, and press Return or Enter.
            



Click away from the guide to deselect it.


Click the Units menu in the Properties panel, and choose Inches to change the units
               for the entire document. You can now see that the rulers show inches instead of pixels.
            


 Tip: To change the units for a document (inches, points, etc.), you can also right-click
                  either ruler and choose the new units.
               



Choose File > Save.


Editing the ruler origin
On the horizontal ruler, measurements to the right of 0 (zero) are positive and to
         the left are negative. On the vertical ruler, measurements below 0 (zero) are positive
         and above are negative. You can move the ruler origin to start the horizontal and/or
         vertical measurements at another location, and that's what you'll do next.
      


Choose View > Zoom Out.


Drag from the upper-left corner of the Document window, where the rulers intersect
               (), to the lower-left corner of the Front artboard.
            
This sets the ruler origin (0,0) to the lower-left corner of the artboard. In other
               words, the measurements start in the lower-left corner of the artboard.
            



With the Selection tool () selected, click on the guide to select it.
            


Look in the Properties panel on the right to see the Y value. Right now, because you
               moved the ruler origin (0,0), the Y shows the vertical distance from the bottom of
               the artboard. Change the Y value to -1.75 (inches), and press Return or Enter.
            



Position the pointer in the upper-left corner of the Document window, where the rulers
               intersect (), and double-click to reset the ruler origin to the upper-left corner of the artboard.
            



Choose Select > Deselect to deselect the guide.


Click the Lock Guides button in the Properties panel to lock all guides and prevent
               them from being selected.
            


 Tip: You can also lock guides by choosing View > Guides > Lock Guides. You can hide guides
                  by clicking the Hide Guides button in the Properties panel or pressing Command+; (macOS)
                  or Ctrl+; (Windows).
               



Transforming content
      
In Lesson 4, "Editing and Combining Shapes and Paths," you learned how to take simple paths and shapes and create more complex artwork
         by editing and combining that content. That was a form of transforming artwork. In
         this lesson, you'll learn how to scale, rotate, and transform content in other ways,
         using a variety of tools and methods.
      
Working with the Bounding Box
As you've seen in this lesson and previous lessons, a bounding box appears around
         selected content. You can transform content using the bounding box, but you can also
         turn it off. This makes it so you can't resize content by dragging anywhere on the
         bounding box with the Selection tool.
      


With the Front artboard showing, choose View > Zoom Out until you see the group of
               artwork that contains the text headline "WINDY CONDITIONS" beneath the artboards.
            


With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the group. Move the pointer over the upper-left corner
               of the selected group. If you were to drag right now, you would resize the content.
            



Choose View > Hide Bounding Box.
This command hides the bounding box around the group and makes it so you can't resize
               the group by dragging anywhere on the bounding box with the Selection tool.
            


Move the pointer over the upper-left point of the group again, and drag it onto the
               upper-left corner of the Front artboard. You'll find that being zoomed out can make
               it more difficult to be precise with placement.
            



Choose View > Show Bounding Box.


Positioning artwork using the Properties panel
      
At times, you may want to position objects more precisely—relative either to other
         objects or to the artboard. You could use the alignment options, like you saw in Lesson 2, "Techniques for Selecting Artwork," but you can also use Smart Guides and Transform options in the Properties panel
         to move objects to exact coordinates on the x- and y-axes and to control the position
         of objects in relation to the edge of the artboard. Next, you'll add content to the
         background of an artboard and position that content precisely.
      


Choose View > Fit All In Window to see all of the artboards. Click in the blank artboard
               that's farthest to the right to make it the active artboard.
            
Transformation commands, like you are about to learn, apply to the active artboard.


Click to select the blue shape with the WINDMILL logo on top, beneath the artboards.
               In the Transform section of the Properties panel, click the upper-left point of the
               reference point locator (). Change the X value to 0 and the Y value to 0, and press Return or Enter.
            

The group of content is moved into the upper-left corner of the active artboard. The
               points in the Reference Point locator map to the points of the bounding box for the
               selected content. For instance, the upper-left reference point refers to the upper-left
               point of the bounding box.
            

 Tip: You could have also aligned the content to the artboard using the alignment options
                  available. You'll find there are at least a few ways to accomplish most tasks in Illustrator.
               



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Scaling objects
So far in this book, you've scaled most content with the selection tools. In this
         part of the lesson, you'll use several other methods for scaling artwork.
      


Press Command+- (macOS) or Ctrl+- (Windows) (or View > Zoom Out), if you need, to
               see the person in the raincoat off the bottom edge of the artboards.
            



With the Selection tool () selected, click the artwork of the person in the yellow raincoat.
            


Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) a few times to zoom in.


In the Properties panel, click the center reference point of the reference point locator
               (), if it's not selected, to resize from the center. Ensure that Constrain Width And
               Height Proportions is set (), type 30% in the Width (W) field, and then press Enter or Return to decrease the size of the
               artwork.
            


 Tip: When typing values to transform content, you can type different units such as percent
                  (%) or pixels (px), and they will be converted to the default unit, which is inches
                  (in) in this case.
               



Choose View > Hide Edges so you hide the inside edges.

Notice that the artwork is smaller, but the arms of the person are still the same
               width. That's because they are a path with a stroke applied. By default, strokes and
               effects, like drop shadows, are not scaled along with objects. For instance, if you enlarge a circle with a 1-pt stroke,
               the stroke remains 1 pt. By selecting Scale Strokes & Effects before you scale—and
               then scaling the object—that 1-pt stroke would scale (change) relative to the amount
               of scaling applied to the object.
            


Choose View > Show Edges so you show the inside edges again.


Choose Edit > Undo Scale.


In the Properties panel, click Show More () in the Transform section to see more options. Select Scale Strokes & Effects. Type
               30% in the Width (W) field and then press Enter or Return to decrease the size of the
               artwork.
            

Now, the stroke applied to the paths that make up the arms, are scaled as well.

 Note: The figure shows selecting the Scale Strokes & Effects option only.
               



Press the spacebar to select the Hand tool, and drag to the right so you can see the
               flower to the left of the person.
            


With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the flower artwork.
            
In the Tools panel on the left, you should see the Scale tool (). The Scale tool is used to scale content by dragging. For a lot of the transform
               tools, like the Scale tool, you can also double-click the tool to edit selected content
               in a dialog box. This is similar to choosing Object > Transform > Scale.


Double-click the Scale tool () in the Tools panel. In the Scale dialog box, change Uniform to 20%, and select Scale Strokes & Effects, if it isn't already selected. Toggle Preview
               on and off to see the change in size. Click OK.
            

This method of scaling artwork may be useful, for instance, if there is a lot of overlapping
               artwork, when precision matters, you need to scale content non-uniformly, and more.
            

 Tip: You could also choose Object > Transform > Scale to access the Scale dialog box.
               



Select the Selection tool, and drag the flower up onto the artboard, just above the
               gray line that the windmill and other artwork is sitting on. You may need to zoom
               out.
            



Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Press the Option key (macOS) or Alt key (Windows), and drag the flower to the right.
               Release the mouse button and then the key to make a copy. Do this several times to
               place copies along the line on the artboard.
            



Reflecting objects
When you reflect an object, Illustrator flips the object across an invisible vertical or horizontal
         axis. In a similar way to scaling and rotating, when you reflect an object, you either
         designate the reference point or use the object's center point, by default. Next,
         you'll copy artwork and use the Reflect tool () to flip artwork 90° across an axis.
      

 Tip: You could also choose Object > Transform > Reflect to access the Reflect dialog box.
         



Choose View > Fit All In Window.


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and drag from left to right across the curly green shape below
               the artboards to zoom in.
            


Select the Selection tool (), and click to select the curly green shape.
            


Choose Edit > Copy and then choose Edit > Paste In Place to create a copy on top of
               the selected shape.
            


Select the Reflect tool (), which is nested within the Rotate tool () in the Tools panel. Click the straight part of the path to set the invisible axis
               that the shape will reflect around, rather than the center, which is the default.
            


 Tip: If you want to copy artwork and reflect artwork as you drag, begin dragging artwork
                  with the Reflect tool. As you drag, hold down the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows)
                  key. When the artwork is where you want it, release the mouse button and then the
                  keys. Pressing Shift+Option (macOS) or Shift+Alt (Windows) will copy the reflected
                  artwork and constrain the reflection angle to 45 degrees.
               



With the artwork still selected, position the pointer off the right edge and drag
               clockwise. As you drag, press the Shift key to constrain the rotation to 45° as the
               artwork is reflected. When the artwork looks like the figure, release the mouse button
               and then release the modifier key.
            


 Tip: You can set the reference point, reflect, and even copy in one step. With the Reflect
                  tool () selected, Option-click (macOS) or Alt-click (Windows) to set the reference point
                  and to open the Reflect dialog box, where you can set options and copy.
               



Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and with the shape still selected, click More Options () in the Transform area of the Properties panel and make sure Scale Strokes & Effects
               is not selected.
            

 Tip: If all you want to do is flip content in place, you can also click either the Flip
                  Along Horizontal Axis button or Flip Along Vertical Axis button in the Properties
                  panel.
               




Drag the lower-right point of the bounding box away from the center to make the shape
               larger.
            



Drag across the two curly shapes and choose Object > Group to keep them together.


Choose View > Fit All In Window.


Drag the group onto the middle artboard.


Press the Option key (macOS) or Alt key (Windows) and drag the group to another area
               of the artboard. Release the mouse button and then the key to make a copy. You can
               do this several times to place copies around the artboard, if you like.
            



Rotating objects
      
There are lots of ways to rotate artwork, including methods that range from more precise
         to more freeform rotation. In previous lessons, you learned that you can rotate selected
         content with the Selection tool. By default, objects are rotated around a designated
         reference point in the center of content. In this part of the lesson, you'll learn
         about the Rotate tool and the Rotate command.
      


Choose View > Fit All In Window.


With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the artwork of the person in the yellow raincoat. Press
               Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) a few times to zoom in.
            


Move the pointer off of one of the corners of the bounding box, and when the rotate
               arrow () appears, click and drag counterclockwise to rotate it. As you drag, press the Shift
               key to constrain the rotation to 45 degrees. When you see 90 degrees in the measurement
               label next to the pointer, release the mouse button and then the key.
            

The Selection tool rotates content around the center, by default. Next, you'll use
               the Rotate tool, which allows you to rotate around a different point.
            


Press the spacebar to access the Hand tool, and drag to the right to see the group
               to the far left of the person (see the following figure).
            


With the Selection tool selected, click to select the group.


Select the Rotate tool () in the Tools panel (it's under the Reflect tool []). Position the pointer on the bottom edge of the selected artwork, and click to
               set the reference point (where it will rotate around). Look at the figure for where
               to click.
            

By default, the rotate-around point is in the center of selected artwork. The Rotate
               tool allows you to rotate content around a different reference point.


Move the pointer off the right side of the selected artwork and begin dragging clockwise.
               As you drag, press Option+Shift (macOS) or Alt+Shift (Windows) to copy the artwork
               as you rotate it, and constrain the rotation to 45 degrees. Release the mouse button
               and then the keys when you see -90 degrees in the measurement label.
            


 Note: The measurement label you see may look different than the figure, and that's okay.
               

The Properties panel (or Control panel or Transform panel) is another place to rotate
               artwork precisely. In the Transform panel, you can always see the angle of rotation
               and change it later for individual objects.
            


Choose Object > Transform > Transform Again, twice, to repeat the previous transformations on the selected shape.
            


Select the Selection tool (), and drag across all four groups to select them.
            


Choose Object > Group.


With the group still selected, double-click the Rotate tool in the Tools panel. In
               the Rotate dialog box that appears, change the Angle value to 45°, and click OK.
            


 Tip: After transforming content using various methods, including rotation, you will notice
                  that the bounding box may be rotated. You can choose Object > Transform > Reset Bounding
                  Box to reset the bounding box around the artwork again.
               



Choose View > Fit All In Window.


With the Selection tool () selected, drag the selected group up, on top of the windmill artwork.
            



Distorting objects with effects
      
You can distort the original shapes of objects in different ways, using various tools.
         Now you'll distort part of the flower and other artwork using effects. These are different
         types of transformations because they are applied as effects, which means you could
         ultimately edit the effect later or remove it in the Appearance panel.
      

 Note: To learn more about effects, see Lesson 12, "Exploring Creative Uses of Effects and Graphic Styles."
         



Select the Selection tool (), and click one of the flowers. Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) several
               times to zoom in closely.
            


Double-click the flower group to enter isolation mode; then click to select the larger
               orange circle.
            


Click the Effect button () in the Properties panel.
            



Choose Distort & Transform > Pucker & Bloat in the menu that appears.



In the Pucker & Bloat dialog box, select Preview, and drag the slider to the right
               to change the value to roughly 35%, which distorts the shape. Click OK.
            

Effects you apply to shapes are live, which means they can be edited or removed at
               any time. You can access the effect(s) applied to selected artwork in the Appearance
               panel (Window > Appearance).
            


Press Esc to exit Isolation mode.


Press the spacebar, and drag to the left to see the DAYS PER YEAR flags.


Click to select the top flag shape. You may need to zoom out.


Click the Effect button () in the Properties panel, and choose Distort & Transform > Twist.
            



In the Twist dialog box, change Angle to 20, select Preview to see the effect, and then click OK.
            


Click the banner below the selected banner; then press the Shift key, and click the
               remaining three banner shapes to select them all.
            


Choose Effect > Apply Twist.
Choosing Apply Twist applies the last applied effect with the same options. If you
               were to choose Effect > Twist, the last applied effect would be applied, but the dialog
               box would open so you could set options.
            



Transforming with the Free Transform tool
The Free Transform tool () is a multipurpose tool that allows you to distort an object, combining functions
         like moving, scaling, shearing, rotating, and distorting (perspective or free). The
         Free Transform tool is also touch-enabled, which means you can control transformation
         using touch controls on certain devices.
      

 Note: To learn more about touch controls, search for "Touch Workspace" in Adobe Help (Help
            > Illustrator Help).
         



Press the spacebar to select the Hand tool, and drag in the Document window until
               you see the "PERCENT OF YEAR" text to the left of the windmill.
            


With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the shape labeled "EAST WEST."
            



Click and hold down on the Puppet Warp tool (), and select the Free Transform tool () in the Tools panel.
            


 Note: To learn more about the options for the Free Transform tool, search for "Free Transform"
                  in Adobe Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
               

With the Free Transform tool selected, the Free Transform widget appears in the Document
               window. This widget, which is free-floating and can be repositioned, contains options
               to change how the Free Transform tool works. By default, the Free Transform tool allows
               you to move, shear, rotate, and scale objects. By selecting other options, like Perspective
               Distort, you can change how the tool works.
            


With the Free Transform tool selected, click the Perspective Distort option () in the Free Transform widget (circled in the following figure).
            


Choose View > Smart Guides to temporarily turn them off.
With the Smart Guides off, you can adjust the artwork without it snapping to everything
               else in the document.
            


Position the pointer over the lower-right corner of the bounding box, and the pointer
               changes in appearance (). Drag down a little, until it looks something like the figure.
            



Press the Command key (macOS) or Ctrl key (Windows) to temporarily select the Selection
               tool and click to select the shape labeled "NORTH SOUTH." Release the key to return
               to the Free Transform tool.
            


With the Perspective Distort option () in the Free Transform widget still selected, drag the lower-left point down a little,
               until it looks like the figure. Leave the group selected.
            



Choose View > Smart Guides to turn them back on.


Choose File > Save.


Shearing objects
      
Shearing an object slants, or skews, the sides of the object along the axis you specify, keeping
         opposite sides parallel and making the object asymmetrical. Next, you'll apply shear
         to the selected sign artwork.
      


With the group labeled "NORTH SOUTH" still selected, select the Shear tool (), nested within the Scale tool () in the Tools panel.
            

 Tip: You can set a reference point, shear, and even copy in one step. With the Shear tool
                  () selected, Option-click (macOS) or Alt-click (Windows) to set the reference point
                  and to open the Shear dialog box, where you can set options and even copy if necessary.
               



Move the pointer off the right side of the group, press the Shift key to constrain
               the artwork to its original width, and drag up. Release the mouse button and then
               the Shift key when you see a shear angle (S) of approximately -20.
            



Press the Command key (macOS) or Ctrl key (Windows) to temporarily select the Selection
               tool. Click to select the shape labeled "EAST WEST." Release the key to return to
               the Shear tool.
            


Press the Shift key to constrain the artwork to its original width, and drag from
               off the right side of the group, down. Release the mouse button and then the Shift
               key when you see a shear angle (S) of approximately -160.
            



Select the Selection tool (), and drag the "NORTH SOUTH" group and then the "EAST WEST" group so they are each
               aligned with the sign pole like you see in the following figure.
            



Click the NORTH SOUTH group to select it. Click the Ungroup button in the Properties
               panel to the right.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.


Click the NORTH text to select that group.
            


Choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front.



Drag each of the numbers with percent (%) next to the ends of the signs. I moved the
               flower to the right as well.
            



Choose View > Fit All In Window and then choose File > Save.


Using Puppet Warp
In Illustrator, you can easily twist and distort artwork naturally, into different
         positions, using the Puppet Warp tool. In this section, you'll warp the artwork of
         the person in the yellow raincoat using the Puppet Warp tool.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, drag the artwork of the person in the yellow rain jacket onto the artboard
               above, to the right of the windmill, like you see in the figure.
            
Make sure the hands of the person are directly on the flagpole. The idea is to have
               the person appear to be holding on to the DAYS PER YEAR flag pole, as the wind blows
               them to the right.
            


 Note: It's difficult to see exactly where to drag the person in the figure. If you look
                  at the figures on the next page, you may get a better idea of what I mean by "Make
                  sure the hands of the person are directly on the flagpole."
               



Press Command++ (macOS) or Control++ (Windows) several times to zoom in closely.


Press and hold on the Free Transform tool () in the Tools panel, and select the Puppet Warp tool ().
            
Using the Puppet Warp tool, you'll start by bending the arm of the person. To do that,
               you'll need to set pins. Pins are a way to hold part of the selected artwork to the
               artboard. You can rotate the artwork around a pin, reposition pins to move artwork,
               and more.
            


Move the pointer over the top hand of the person, and when the pointer shows a plus
               (+) next to it, click to add a pin. On the same arm, click roughly halfway down the
               arm, where the elbow might be. Finally, click to set a pin in the middle of the raincoat.
            

As you add pins, you can see a mesh showing on the artwork.


In the Properties panel on the right, you should see Puppet Warp options. Deselect
               Show Mesh. That will make it easier to see the pins and provide a clearer view of
               transformations you make.
            



Click the pin you added to the hand to select it. You can tell that a pin is selected
               because it has a white dot in the center. Drag the selected pin up to move the hand
               and not the rest of the artwork.
            

You set the pin on the hand so you could move it. The pin farther down the arm, near
               the "elbow," was for a pivot point or to ensure that only from that point to the hand
               moved. The third pin on the body was to keep the body in place without moving it.
               Setting at least three pins like this usually achieves a better result.
            

 Tip: You can press the Shift key and click multiple pins to select them or click the Select
                  All Pins button in the Properties panel to select all of the pins.
               



With the hand pin still selected, move the pointer over the dotted circle and drag
               counterclockwise a little to rotate around the pin.
            



Click between the feet to set a pin. Press the Shift key and click the pin in the
               body to select the pin at the feet and in the body. Drag either pin down a little
               to bend the body.
            



Click the pin at the feet to select only that pin. Make sure it's the only pin selected. Remember that selected pins have a white dot in the center. If the pin in the body
               is still selected, click the pin at the feet again. Drag the selected pin at the feet, up.
            



Move the pointer over the dotted circle of the selected pin, and drag counter-clockwise
               a little to rotate around the pin.
            



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose View > Fit All In Window.



Choose File > Save and then File > Close.

Review answers


To change the size of an existing artboard, you can do the following:


Double-click the Artboard tool (), and edit the dimensions of the active artboard in the Artboard Options dialog box.
                     


With nothing selected and the Selection tool selected, click the Edit Artboards button
                        to enter Artboard Editing mode. With the Artboard tool selected, position the pointer
                        over an edge or corner of the artboard, and drag to resize.
                     


With nothing selected and the Selection tool selected, click the Edit Artboards button
                        to enter Artboard Editing mode. With the Artboard tool selected, click in an artboard
                        in the Document window, and change the dimensions in the Properties panel.
                     




The ruler origin is the point where 0 (zero) appears on each ruler. By default, the
                  ruler origin is set to be 0 (zero) in the top-left corner of the active artboard.
               


There are two types of rulers in Illustrator: artboard rulers and global rulers. Artboard
                  rulers, which are the default rulers, set the ruler origin at the upper-left corner
                  of the active artboard. Global rulers set the ruler origin at the upper-left corner
                  of the first artboard, no matter which artboard is active.
               


The Scale Strokes & Effects option, which can be accessed from the Properties panel
                  or the Transform panel, scales any strokes and effects as the object is scaled. This
                  option can be turned on and off, depending on the current need.
               


In Illustrator, you can easily twist and distort artwork naturally, into different
                  positions, using the Puppet Warp tool.

An intro to drawing with the Pen tool
      
The Pen tool () is one of the main drawing tools in Illustrator that's used to create both freeform
         and more precise artwork and also plays a role in editing existing vector artwork.
         It's important to have an understanding of a tool like the Pen tool (or Curvature
         tool) when working with Illustrator. Just know that it takes plenty of practice to feel comfortable with the Pen tool!
In this first section, you'll begin to explore the Pen tool, and later in the lesson,
         you'll create artwork using the Pen tool and other tools and commands.
      

 Tip: Adobe has created a simple game for learning the Pen tool. Check it out here: https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/pen-tool-game.html.
         



Choose 1 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and click twice in the bottom half of the artboard to zoom in.
            


Choose View > Smart Guides to turn off the Smart Guides. Smart Guides can be useful
               when you draw, but you won't need them now.
            


In the Properties panel to the right of the document, click the Fill color box, make
               sure the Swatches option () is selected, and choose None (). Then, click the stroke color, and make sure that the Black swatch is selected.
               Make sure the stroke weight is also 1 pt in the Properties panel.
            
When you begin drawing with the Pen tool, it's usually best to have no fill on the
               path you create because the fill can cover parts of the path you are trying to create.
               You can add a fill later, if necessary.
            


Select the Pen tool () in the Tools panel. Position the pointer in the area labeled "Work Area" in the
               artboard, and notice the asterisk next to the Pen icon (), indicating that you'll create a new path if you begin drawing.
            


In the area labeled "Work Area," click and release on the orange point labeled 1,
               where you see "start," to set the first anchor point.
            

 Note: If you see  instead of the Pen icon (), the Caps Lock key is active. Caps Lock turns the Pen tool icon into  for increased precision. After you begin drawing, with the Caps Lock key active,
                  the Pen tool icon looks like this: .
               




Move the pointer away from the point you just created, and you'll see a line connecting
               the first point and the pointer, no matter where you move the pointer.
            
That line is called the Pen tool preview (or Rubber Band). Later, as you create curved
               paths, it will make drawing them easier because it is a preview of what the path will
               look like. Also notice that the asterisk has disappeared from next to the pointer,
               indicating that you are now drawing a path.
            



Position the pointer over the gray dot labeled 2. Click and release to create another
               anchor point.
            
You just created a path. A simple path is composed of two anchor points and a line
               segment connecting the anchor points. You use the anchor points to control the direction,
               length, and curve of the line segment.
            


 Note: If the path looks curved, you have accidentally dragged with the Pen tool; choose
                  Edit > Undo Pen and then click again without dragging.
               



Continue clicking points 3 through 7, releasing the mouse button every time you click
               to create an anchor point.
            
Notice that only the last anchor point is filled (not hollow like the rest of the
               anchor points), indicating that it is selected.
            


 Tip: You can toggle the Pen tool preview by choosing Illustrator CC > Preferences > Selection
                  & Anchor Display (macOS) or Edit > Preferences > Selection & Anchor Display (Windows)
                  to open the Preferences dialog box. In the dialog box, with the Selection & Anchor
                  Display category options showing, deselect Enable Rubber Band For: Pen Tool.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.


Selecting paths
The type of anchor point you created in the previous section is called a corner point.
         Corner points are not smooth like a curve; rather, they create an angle where the anchor point
         is. Now that you can create corner points, you will move on to adding other types
         of points such as smooth points to create curves in a path. But first, you'll learn
         a few more techniques for selecting paths.
      
In Lesson 2, "Techniques for Selecting Artwork," you were introduced to selecting content with the Selection and Direct Selection
         tools. Next, you'll explore a few more options for selecting artwork with those same
         Selection tools.
      


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and position the pointer over a straight line in the path you
               just created. When the pointer shows a solid black box () next to it, click.
            

This selects the entire path and all of the anchor points.

 Tip: You can also drag across a path to select it with the Selection tool.
               



Position the pointer over one of the straight lines in the path. When the pointer
               changes appearance (), drag the path to a new location anywhere on the artboard.
            
All the anchor points travel together, maintaining the shape of the path.



Choose Edit > Undo Move to move the path back to its original position.
            


With the Selection tool selected, click an empty area of the artboard to deselect
               the path.
            


Select the Direct Selection tool () in the Tools panel. Move the pointer anywhere over the path between anchor points.
               When the pointer changes (), click the path to reveal all of the anchor points.
            
You just selected a line segment (path). If you were to press Backspace or Delete
               (don't), only that part of the path between two anchor points would be removed.
            


 Tip: If the Pen tool () were still selected, you could Command-click (macOS) or Ctrl-click (Windows) in
                  a blank area of the artboard to deselect the path. This temporarily selects the Direct
                  Selection tool. When you release the Ctrl or Command key, the Pen tool is selected
                  again.
               



Move the pointer over the anchor point labeled 4; the anchor point will become a little
               larger than the others, and the pointer will show a small box with a dot in the center
               () next to it (the figure shows this). Both of these indicate that if you click, you
               will select the anchor point. Click to select the anchor point, and the selected anchor
               point is filled (looks solid), whereas the other anchor points are still hollow (deselected).
            


 Note: When you position the pointer over a line segment that is not already selected, a
                  black, solid square appears next to the Direct Selection tool pointer, indicating
                  that you will select a line segment.
               



Drag the selected anchor point up to reposition it.
The anchor point moves, but the others remain stationary. This is one method for editing
               a path, like you saw in Lesson 2, "Techniques for Selecting Artwork."
            



Click in a blank area of the artboard to deselect.


Position the Direct Selection pointer over the path between points 5 and 6. When the
               pointer changes (), click to select. Choose Edit > Cut.
            
This removes the selected segment between anchor points 5 and 6. Next, you'll learn
               how to connect the paths again.
            


 Note: If the entire path disappears, choose Edit > Undo Cut, and try again.
               



Select the Pen tool (), and move the pointer onto the blue anchor point labeled 5. Notice that the Pen
               tool shows a forward slash (), indicating that if you click, you will continue drawing from that anchor point.
               Click the point.
            



Position the pointer over the other anchor point (point 6) that was connected to the
               cut line segment. The pointer now shows a merge symbol next to it (), indicating that you are connecting to another path. Click the point to reconnect
               the paths.
            



Choose File > Save.


Drawing straight lines with the Pen tool
In previous lessons, you learned that using the Shift key as well as Smart Guides
         in combination with shape tools constrains the shape of objects. The Shift key and
         Smart Guides can also constrain paths drawn with the Pen tool to create straight paths
         in angles of 45˚. Next, you'll learn how to draw straight lines and constrain angles
         as you draw.
      


Choose 2 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and click twice in the bottom half of the artboard to zoom in.
            


Choose View > Smart Guides to turn on the Smart Guides.


With the Pen tool () selected, in the area labeled "Work Area," click on the point labeled 1, where you
               see "start," to set the first anchor point.
            
The Smart Guides most likely are attempting to "snap" the anchor point you create
               to other content on the artboard, possibly making it difficult to add an anchor point
               exactly where you want it. This is expected behavior and is sometimes why you might
               turn off the Smart Guides when drawing.
            


Move the pointer above the original anchor point to the point labeled 2. When you
               see 1.5 inches in the gray measurement label that appears next to the pointer, click
               to set another anchor point.
            
As you've learned in previous lessons, the measurement label and alignment guides
               are part of the Smart Guides. The measurement labels showing distance can be useful
               at times when drawing with the Pen tool.
            



Choose View > Smart Guides to turn off the Smart Guides.
            
Without Smart Guides on, to align points, you will need to press the Shift key, which
               is what you'll do next.


Press the Shift key, and click in the point labeled 3. Release the Shift key.
With Smart Guides turned off, there is no measurement label, and the point is only
               aligning with the previous point because you are holding down the Shift key.
            


 Note: The points you set don't have to be in exactly the same position as the path at the
                  top of the artboard.
               



Click to set point 4 and then click to set point 5.
Like you've already seen, without holding the Shift key, you can set an anchor point
               anywhere. The path is not constrained to angles of 45˚.
            



Press the Shift key, and click to set points 6 and 7.


Choose Select > Deselect.



Introducing curved paths

In this part of the lesson, you'll learn how to draw curved lines with the Pen tool.
         In vector drawing applications such as Illustrator, you can draw a curve, called a
         Bezier curve. Paths can have two kinds of anchor points: corner points and smooth points. At a corner point, a path abruptly changes direction. At a smooth point, path segments
         are connected as a continuous curve. By setting anchor points and dragging direction
         handles, you can define the shape of the curve. This type of anchor point, with direction
         handles, is called a smooth point.
      
Although drawing curves this way can take some time to learn, it gives you some of
         the greatest control and flexibility in creating paths. The goal for this exercise
         is not to create anything specific but to get accustomed to the feel of creating Bezier
         curves. First, you'll just get the feel for how to create a curved path.
      


Choose 3 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window. You will draw in the area labeled "Practice."
            


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and click twice in the bottom half of the artboard to zoom in.
            


Select the Pen tool () in the Tools panel. In the Properties panel, make sure that the fill color is None
               () and the stroke color is Black. Also, make sure the stroke weight is still 1 pt in the Properties panel.
            



With the Pen tool selected, click in a blank area of the artboard to create a starting
               anchor point. Move the pointer away after releasing the mouse button.
            



Click and drag to create a curved path.
As you drag away from the point, direction handles appear. Direction handles consist of direction lines that end in round direction points. The angle and length
               of the direction handles determine the shape and size of the curve. Direction handles
               do not print.
            



Move the pointer away from the anchor point you just created to see the rubber banding.
               Move the pointer around a bit to see how it changes.
            


Continue clicking and dragging in different areas to create a series of points.


Choose Select > Deselect. Leave the file open for the next section.



Components of a path
As you draw, you create a line called a path. A path is made up of one or more straight
            or curved segments. The beginning and end of each segment is marked by anchor points,
            which work like pins holding a wire in place. A path can be closed (for example, a
            circle) or open, with distinct endpoints (for example, a wavy line). You change the
            shape of a path by dragging its anchor points, the direction points at the end of
            direction lines that appear at anchor points, or the path segment itself.

Drawing a curve with the Pen tool
      
In this part of the lesson, you'll use what you just learned about drawing curves
         to trace a curved shape with the Pen tool.
      


Press the spacebar to temporarily select the Hand tool (), and drag down until you see the curve at the top of the current artboard (on Artboard
               3).
            


With the Pen tool () selected, click and drag from the point labeled 1, up to the red dot, and then release
               the mouse button.
            
This creates a direction line going in the same general direction as the path. Up
               to this point, you've started your paths by simply clicking to create an anchor point,
               not dragging, like you did in this step. To create a more "curved" path, dragging
               out direction lines on the very first anchor point can be helpful.
            


 Note: The artboard may scroll as you drag. If you lose visibility of the curve, choose
                  View > Zoom Out until you see the curve and anchor point. Pressing the spacebar allows
                  you to use the Hand tool to reposition the artwork.
               



Click point 2 and drag down. Release the mouse button when the pointer reaches the
               red dot and the path you are creating follows the gray arc.
            

If the path you created is not aligned exactly with the template, select the Direct
               Selection tool (), and select the anchor points one at a time to show the direction handles. You can
               then drag the ends of the direction handles (called direction points) until your path follows the template more accurately.
            

 Note: Pulling the direction handle longer makes a steeper curve; when the direction handle
                  is shorter, the curve is flatter.
               



Select the Selection tool (), and click the artboard in an area with no objects, or choose Select > Deselect.
            
Deselecting the first path allows you to create a new path. If you click somewhere
               on the artboard with the Pen tool while the path is still selected, the path connects
               to the next point you draw.
            

 Tip: While drawing with the Pen tool, to deselect objects, you can press the Command (macOS)
                  or Ctrl (Windows) key to temporarily switch to the Direct Selection tool and then
                  click the artboard where there are no objects. Another way to end a path is to press
                  the Escape key when you are finished drawing.
               



If you want to try drawing the curve for more practice, scroll down to the Practice
         area in the same artboard and trace the different curves.
      
Drawing a series of curves with the Pen tool
      
Now that you've experimented with drawing a curve, you will draw a shape that contains
         several continuous curves.
      


Choose 4 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window. Select the Zoom tool (), and click several times in the top half of the artboard to zoom in.
            


In the Properties panel to the right of the document, make sure that the fill color
               is None (), the stroke color is Black, and the stroke weight is still 1 pt.
            


Select the Pen tool (). Click and drag up on point 1, labeled "start," in the direction of the arc, stopping
               at the red dot.
            


Position the pointer over the point labeled 2 (to the right), and drag down to the
               red dot, adjusting the first arc (between points 1 and 2) with the direction handle
               before you release the mouse button.
            
When it comes to smooth points (curved), you'll find that you spend a lot of time
               focusing on the path segment behind (before) the current anchor point you are creating. Remember, by default there are
               two direction lines for an anchor point. The previous direction line controls the
               shape of the previous segment.
            


 Note: Don't worry if the path you draw is not exact. You can correct the line with the
                  Direct Selection tool () when the path is complete.
               


 Tip: As you drag out the direction handles for an anchor point, you can press and hold
                  the spacebar to reposition the anchor point. When the anchor point is where you want
                  it, release the spacebar.
               



Continue along the path, alternating between dragging up and down. Put anchor points
               only where there are numbers and finish with the point labeled 6.
            
If you make a mistake as you draw, you can undo your work by choosing Edit > Undo
               Pen and then draw the last point again. Note that your direction lines may not match
               the figures, and that's okay.
            



When the path is complete, select the Direct Selection tool (), and click to select any anchor point in the path.
            

 Note: For more information about these attributes, see Lesson 7, "Using Color to Enhance Signage."
               

When an anchor point is selected, the direction handles appear, and you can readjust
               the curve of the path if necessary. With a curve selected, you can also change the
               stroke and fill of the curve. When you do this, the next line you draw will have the
               same attributes. If you want to try drawing the shape again for more practice, scroll
               down to the bottom half of the same artboard (labeled Practice), and trace the shape
               down there.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Converting smooth points to corner points
      
When creating curves, the direction handles help to determine the shape and size of
         the curved segments, as you've already seen. Removing the direction lines from an
         anchor point can convert a smooth point into a corner point. In this next part of
         the lesson, you'll practice converting between smooth points and corner points.
      


Choose 5 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            
On the top of the artboard, you can see the path that you will trace. You'll use the
               top artboard as a template for the exercise, creating your paths directly on top of
               those. Use the Practice section at the bottom of the artboard for additional practice
               on your own.
            


Select the Zoom tool (), and click several times in the top part of the artboard to zoom in.
            


In the Properties panel, make sure that the fill color is None (), the stroke color is Black, and the stroke weight is still 1 pt.
            


Select the Pen tool (). Pressing the Shift key, click and drag up from point 1, labeled "start," in the
               direction of the arc, stopping at the red dot. Release the mouse button and then release
               the Shift key.
            
Pressing the Shift key when dragging constrains the direction handles to multiples
               of 45°.
            


Click point 2 (to the right), and begin dragging down to the gold dot. As you drag,
               press and hold the Shift key. When the curve looks correct, release the mouse button
               and then release the Shift key. Leave the path selected.
            
Now you need the curve to switch directions and create another arc. You will split the direction lines to convert a smooth point to a corner point.
            


Press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, and position the pointer over the last
               anchor point you created. When a convert-point icon (^) appears next to the Pen tool pointer (), click and drag a direction line up to the red dot above. Release the mouse button
               and then release the modifier key. If you do not see the caret (^), you might end
               up creating an additional loop.
            

 Note: The Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key essentially allows you to create a new direction
                  line that is independent of the other for that anchor point. If you don't hold down
                  the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, the direction handles would not be split,
                  so it would stay a smooth point.
               



 Tip: After you draw a path, you can also select single or multiple anchor points and click
                  the Convert Selected Anchor Points To Corner button () or Convert Selected Anchor Points To Smooth button () in the Properties panel.
               

You can also Option-drag (macOS) or Alt-drag (Windows) the end of the direction handle
               (called the direction point). An arrow is pointing to it in the first part of the figure. Either method "splits"
               the direction handles so they can go in different directions.
            



Move the Pen tool pointer over point 3 to the right on the template path, and drag
               down to the gold dot. Release the mouse button when the path looks similar to the
               template path.
            


Press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, and move the pointer over the last
               anchor point you created. When a convert-point icon (^) appears next to the Pen tool
               pointer (), click and drag a direction line up to the red dot above. Release the mouse button
               and then release the modifier key.
            
For the next point, you will not release the mouse button to split the direction handles,
               so pay close attention.
            


For anchor point 4, click and drag down to the gold dot until the path looks correct.
               This time, do not release the mouse button. Press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, and drag up to the red dot for the
               next curve. Release the mouse button and then release the modifier key.
            



Continue this process using the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key to create corner
               points until the path is completed.
            


Use the Direct Selection tool to fine-tune the path and then deselect the path.
If you want to try drawing the same shape for more practice, scroll down to the Practice
               area in the same artboard, and trace the shape down there.
            


Combining curves and straight lines
      
Of course in the real world, when you draw with the Pen tool, you won't just create
         either curves or straight lines. In this next section, you'll learn how to go from
         curves to straight lines and from straight lines to curves.
      


Choose 6 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window. Select the Zoom tool (), and click several times in the top half of the artboard to zoom in.
            


Select the Pen tool (). Click point 1, labeled "start," and drag up, stopping at the red dot. Release the
               mouse button.
            
Up to this point, you've been dragging to a gold or red dot in the templates. In the
               real world those obviously won't be there, so for the next point you will drag to
               create a point without much template guidance. Don't worry, you can always choose
               Edit > Undo Pen and try again!
            


Click and drag down from point 2, and release the mouse button when the path roughly
               matches the template.
            
This method of creating a curve should be familiar to you by now.


If you were to click point 3 (don't), even pressing the Shift key (to produce a straight line), the path would be curved.
               The last point you created is a smooth anchor point and has a leading direction handle.
               The figure to the right shows what the path would look like if you clicked with the
               Pen tool on the next point.
            
You will now continue the path as a straight line by removing the leading direction
               handle.
            


Position the pointer over the last point created (point 2). When the convert-point
               icon appears (), click. This deletes the leading direction handle from the anchor point (not the trailing direction handle), as shown
               in the second part of the following figure.
            



Press the Shift key, and click point 3 in the template path to the right to set the
               next point, creating a straight segment.
            



For the next arc, position the pointer over the last point created. When the convert-point
               icon appears (), click and drag down from that point to the red dot. This creates a new, independent
               direction line.
            

For the rest of this section, I'm going to ask you to complete the path, following
               the remaining part of the template. I don't include any figures, so go through the
               figures in the previous steps if you need guidance.
            


Click to create the next point (point 4), and drag up to complete the arc.


Click the last anchor point you just created to remove the direction line.


Shift-click the next point to create the second straight segment.


Click and drag up from the last point created to create a direction line.


Click and drag down on the end point (point 6) to create the final arc.
If you want to try drawing the same shape for more practice, scroll down to the Practice
               area in the same artboard, and trace the shape down there. Make sure you deselect
               the previous artwork first.
            


Choose File > Save and then choose File > Close.


Remember, you can always go back and work on those Pen tool templates in the L6_practice.ai
         file as many times as you need. Take it as slow as you need and practice, practice, practice.
      
Creating artwork with the Pen tool
      

 Tip: Don't forget, you can always undo a point you've drawn (Edit > Undo Pen) and then
            try again.
         

Next, you'll take what you've learned and create some artwork to be used in your project.
         To start, you'll draw a coffee cup, which combines curves and corners. Just take your
         time as you practice with this shape, and use the template guides provided to assist
         you in drawing it.
      


Choose File > Open, and open the L6_end.ai file in the Lessons > Lesson06 folder.


Choose View > Fit All In Window to see the finished artwork. (Use the Hand tool [] to move the artwork to where you want it.) If you don't want to leave the artwork
               open, choose File > Close.
            



Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson06 folder,
               and select the L6_start.ai file on your hard disk. Click Open to open the file.
            



Choose View > Fit All In Window.


Choose File > Save As, name the file CoffeeShop.ai, and select the Lesson06 folder in the Save As dialog box. Choose Adobe Illustrator
               (ai) from the Format menu (macOS) or choose Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) from the Save
               As Type menu (Windows), and click Save. In the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave
               the options set at the defaults and then click OK.
            


Choose 1 Main from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window, if it's not already chosen.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Select the Zoom tool (), and zoom in to the cup in the bottom half of the artboard.
            


In the Layers panel (Window > Layers), click to select the layer named "Artwork."



In the Properties panel (Window > Properties), make sure that the fill color is None
               () and the stroke color is Black. Also make sure the stroke weight is 1 pt in the Properties
               panel.
            


Drawing a coffee cup
      
Now that you have the file open and ready, you're going to put to use some of the
         Pen tool practice you did in previous sections, by drawing a coffee cup. This next
         section has more than the average number of steps, so take your time.
      


Select the Pen tool () in the Tools panel. Drag from the blue square labeled "A" to the red dot above it
               to set the starting anchor point and direction of the first curve.
            


 Note: You do not have to start at the blue square (point A) to draw this shape. You can
                  set anchor points for a path with the Pen tool in a clockwise or counterclockwise
                  direction.
               



Drag from point B to the red dot to create the first curve.
The next point you create will be a simple corner point.


Position the pointer over the point C, and click (don't drag) to set a corner point.
            



Press the Shift key, and click point D to create a straight line; then release the
               key.
            


 Note: If you find that the path you are drawing has a fill of white, part of the template
                  may be hidden. You can always change the fill to None () for the path you are drawing.
               



Position the Pen tool pointer over point D again. When the convert-point icon appears
               () next to the pointer, drag down from point D to the red dot. This creates a new direction
               line.
            

As you draw with the Pen tool, you may want to edit a curve you previously drew without
               ending the path you are drawing. Pressing a modifier key with the Pen tool selected,
               you can position the pointer over a previous path segment and drag to modify it, which
               is what you'll do next.
            


Position the pointer over the path between points C and D. Press the Option (macOS)
               or Alt (Windows) key. The pointer changes appearance (). Drag the path down to make the path curved, like you see in the figure. Release
               the mouse button and then the key. Now, you can continue drawing the path.
            

This adds direction handles to the top anchor points.

 Tip: You can also press the Option+Shift (macOS) or Alt+Shift (Windows) keys to constrain
                  the handles to a perpendicular direction, which ensures that the handles are the same
                  length.
               



Position the pointer over point E. Notice that as you move the pointer, you can see
               the Pen tool rubber banding, which means you are still drawing the path. Click point
               E to create a corner point, and release the mouse button.
            


With the Pen tool pointer over point E, click and drag up and to the right from that
               point to the red dot.
            

This creates a new leading direction handle and sets up the next path to be a curve.

 Note: After releasing the mouse button in the previous step, if you move the pointer away
                  and then bring it back to point E, the convert-point icon [^] will appear next to
                  the pointer.
               



Continue drawing by dragging from the anchor point at F to the red dot.

For the next point, G, you will create another smooth point, but you will edit the
               direction handles independently using a modifier key as you draw. For the next step,
               don't release the mouse button until you are told.
            


Begin dragging from point G to the gold dot. When the pointer reaches the gold dot,
               without releasing the mouse button yet, press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, and continue dragging from the gold
               dot to the red dot to make the leading direction handle longer. When the pointer reaches the red dot, release the mouse
               button and then release the key.
            

Next, you'll create a smooth point and split the direction handles.

 Note: You could also create the point in this step by dragging and releasing the mouse
                  button when the pointer reaches the gold dot. You could then position the Pen tool
                  icon over the anchor point. When the convert-point icon (^) appears next to the pointer,
                  you could drag out a new direction handle.
               



Continue drawing the point at H by first dragging from the anchor point to the gold
               dot. Without releasing the mouse button, press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key and drag from the gold dot to the
               red dot.
            



Continue drawing the point at I by first dragging from the anchor point to the gold
               dot. Without releasing the mouse button, press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key and continue dragging from the gold
               dot to the red dot.
            



Continue drawing the point at J by dragging from the anchor point to the red dot.



Begin dragging from point K to the red dot. As you drag, press the Shift key to constrain
               the direction handles. When you reach the red dot, release the mouse button and then
               the key.
            


 Note: If you press and hold the Shift key before you click and drag from a point, the point
                  will be aligned with the previous point. That's not what you want in this case.
               



Continue drawing by clicking and dragging from the point at L to the red dot.
Next, you'll complete the drawing of the coffee cup by closing the path.


Position the Pen tool over the starting point A without clicking.
Notice that an open circle appears next to the Pen tool pointer (), indicating that the path will close if you were to click the anchor point (don't
               click yet). If you were to click and drag, the direction handles on either side of
               the point would move as a single straight line. You need to extend one of the direction
               handles to match the template.
            



Press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key with the pointer still over point A.
               Click and drag up and to the left. Notice that a direction handle shows but is going
               in the opposite direction (it's going down and to the right). Drag until the curve
               looks right. Release the mouse button and then the key.
            
Normally, as you drag away from a point, direction lines appear before and after the
               point. Without the modifier key, as you drag away from closing point, you are reshaping
               the path before and after the anchor point. Pressing the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) modifier key
               on the closing point allows you to edit the previous direction handle independently.
            


 Tip: When creating a closing anchor point, you can press the spacebar to move the point
                  as you create it.
               



Command-click (macOS) or Ctrl-click (Windows) away from the path to deselect it and
               then choose File > Save.
            

 Note: This is a shortcut method for deselecting a path while keeping the Pen tool selected.
                  You could also choose Select > Deselect, among other methods.
               



Drawing with the Curvature tool
      
With the Curvature tool (), you can draw and edit paths quickly and visually to create paths with smooth refined
         curves and straight lines, without editing direction lines. Using the Curvature tool,
         you can also edit paths while drawing or after the path is complete using the same
         tool. The paths it creates are composed of anchor points and can be edited with any
         of the drawing or selecting tools. In this section, you'll explore the Curvature tool
         while creating a spoon.
      


Choose 3 Spoon from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window (if necessary).
Looking at the template path, you'll see a vertical guide running through points A
               and I. After you draw half of the spoon, you will copy and reflect it around the guide
               and then join the two halves together.
            

 Note: You may want to zoom in to the spoon template in this section.
               



Select the Curvature tool () in the Tools panel. Click the blue square at point A to set the starting anchor
               point and release the mouse button. See the first part of the following figure.
            

 Note: Like the Pen tool, you don't have to start at the blue square (point A) to draw this
                  shape. You can set anchor points for a path with the Curvature tool in a clockwise
                  or counterclockwise direction.
               



Click point B to create a point. After clicking, release the mouse button, and move
               the pointer away from point B. Notice the preview of the curve before and after point
               B.
            

The Curvature tool works by creating anchor points where you click. The drawing curve
               will "flex" around the points dynamically. Direction handles are created when necessary
               to curve the path for you.
            


Click point C and then click point D, releasing the mouse button. Move the pointer
               away from point D.
            
At this point, the path between points A and B will no longer be affected by new points
               (E, F, etc.), but the path is not following the template. While drawing with the Curvature
               tool, you can go back and edit points as well as add points.
            



Hover the pointer over the path segment between points A and B. When a plus sign (+)
               appears next to the pointer, click to create a new point. Drag the new point to the
               red dot in the template, repositioning it to match the shape of the dotted template.
            

 Note: The points you create with the Curvature tool can have three appearances, indicating
                  its current state: selected (), corner point (not selected []), and smooth point (not selected []).
               




Click point E and then click point F.


Shift-click to add point G.
Pressing the Shift key while clicking with the Curvature tool aligns the new point
               vertically (in this case) or horizontally with the previous point. Notice that the
               path segments before and after point F are curved, but they need to be straight to
               follow the template. To convert a default smooth point to a corner point, you can
               double-click a point you've made with the Curvature tool.
            


Hover the pointer over the anchor point at F. When the pointer changes (), double-click to convert the point to a corner point.
            
Double-clicking a point, which converts it to a corner point, has the effect of splitting
               the direction handles for the point.
            

Next, you'll add a new point and convert it to a corner point in one step.


Option-click (macOS) or Alt-click (Windows) point H.
By Option-clicking (macOS) or Alt-clicking (Windows) when you create a point with
               the Curvature tool, you create a corner point instead of the default smooth point.
            



Shift-click point I.


Press the Escape key to stop drawing and then choose Select > Deselect.


 Tip: To close a path with the Curvature tool, hover the pointer over the first point you
                  created in the path, and a circle appears next to the pointer (). Click to close the path.
               



Editing curves
In this part of the lesson, you'll adjust curves you've drawn using several methods
         learned previously and a few new ones.
      
Reflecting the spoon shape
Since the spoon you are creating is symmetrical, you drew only half of it. Now you'll
         copy, reflect, and join the spoon path to create a whole spoon.
      


Choose View > Smart Guides to turn them on.


Select the Selection tool (), and click to select the spoon path.
            


In the Layers panel, click the visibility column (eye icon ) for the layer named "Template" to hide the contents.
            


Click and hold down the mouse button on the Rotate tool () in the Tools panel, and select the Reflect tool ().
            



While holding down the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, position the pointer over
               point I (see the first part of the following figure). When you see the word "anchor"
               appear, click with the modifier key held down.
            


In the Reflect dialog box, select Vertical if necessary, and click Preview. Click
               Copy to copy the shape and reflect it in one step.
            


Select the Selection tool and Shift-click the original path to select both and press
               Cmd+J (macOS) or Ctrl+J (Windows) twice to join the paths together.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.



Rounding corner points
      
In Lesson 3, "Using Shapes to Create Artwork for a Postcard," you learned about Live Shapes and the ability to round corners. You can also round
         corner points on paths, which is what you'll do next.
      


Select the Zoom tool (), and click a few times on the top of the spoon to zoom in.
            


Select the Direct Selection tool (), and drag across the two points shown in the first part of the following figure
               to select them.
            
Notice that a Live Corners widget () shows next to each of the anchor points. With both points selected, you can edit
               the radius of both by dragging one of the Live Corners widgets or double-clicking
               one of them.
            


Drag either Live Corner widget toward the center of the spoon just a bit to make the
               corners round. When the measurement label shows a radius of roughly 0.1 in, release
               the mouse button.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.



Choose View > Smart Guides to turn off the Smart Guides.


Select the Selection tool (), and click to select the spoon path.
            


Choose Edit > Copy.


Choose 1 Main from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            


Click in a blank area of the artboard to ensure that it's the active artboard. Choose
               Edit > Paste to paste the spoon. Drag it off to the side for the moment.
            

 Note: You will need to select the spoon by its stroke since it doesn't have a fill.
               



Editing paths and points
Next, you'll edit a few of the paths and points for the coffee cup you created earlier.


Select the Direct Selection tool (), and starting at the red X you see in the figure, drag across the "handle" of the
               coffee cup to select just that part of the path.
            
Selecting with the Direct Selection tool in this way selects only the path segments
               and anchor points contained within the marquee selection. Clicking with the Selection
               tool () selects the entire path.
            



Choose Edit > Copy and then Edit > Paste In Front.
            


Press Command+J (macOS) or Ctrl+J (Windows) to close the path.


Select the Selection tool, and Shift-drag the right-middle bounding point to the left
               to make it smaller. Release the mouse button and then the key.
            



Select the Direct Selection tool, and click the anchor point you see in the figure
               to select it. Drag the anchor point to the right just a bit so it roughly matches
               the figure.
            



Position the pointer over the part of the path you see in the figure below, and click
               to select the path.
            
Notice that the pointer changes appearance () with the pointer over the path. This indicates that you can drag the path, which
               will adjust the anchor points and direction handles as you drag.
            


Drag the path up and to the left to make the curve a little less rounded. This is
               an easy way to make edits to a path.
            


 Tip: If you wanted to adjust the direction handles instead of dragging the path and wanted
                  to see the direction handles for all of the selected points, you could choose Illustrator
                  CC > Preferences > Selection & Anchor Display (macOS) or Edit > Preferences > Selection
                  & Anchor Display (Windows) and select Show Handles When Multiple Anchors Are Selected.
               


 Tip: As you are dragging a path with the Direct Selection tool, you can also press the
                  Shift key to constrain the handles to a perpendicular direction, which ensures that
                  the handles are the same length.
               



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Deleting and adding anchor points
      
Most of the time, the goal of drawing paths with a tool like the Pen tool or Curvature
         tool is to avoid adding more anchor points than necessary. You can reduce a path's
         complexity or change its overall shape by deleting unnecessary points (and therefore
         gain more control over the shape), or you can extend a path by adding points to it.
         Next, you'll delete and add anchor points to the coffee cup path so that it has a
         flatter bottom.
      


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and click twice, slowly, on the bottom of the cup to zoom in.
            


With the Direct Selection tool () selected, click the coffee cup path to select it.
            


Select the Pen tool () in the Tools panel, and position the pointer over the anchor point at the bottom
               center of the cup (see the figure). When a minus sign (-) appears to the right of
               the Pen tool pointer (), click to remove the anchor point.
            


 Tip: With an anchor point selected, you can also click Remove Selected Anchor Points () in the Properties panel to delete the anchor point.
               



Position the Pen tool pointer over the bottom of the cup shape again. Look at the
               first part of the following figure for where to position the pointer. This time, when
               a plus sign (+) appears to the right of the Pen tool pointer (), click to add an anchor point.
            


Move the pointer over to the right a bit, and click the path to add another point.
               Leave this last point selected.
            

Adding points to a curved path means that the anchor points will most likely have
               direction lines and be considered smooth points.
            


Converting between smooth points and corner points
      
To more precisely control the path you create, you can convert points from smooth
         points to corner points and from corner points to smooth points, using several methods.
      


Select the Direct Selection tool (), and with the last point still selected, Shift-click the other point you added to
               the left. In the second part of the following figure, arrows are pointing to the anchor
               points to select. Click the Convert Selected Anchor Points To Corner button () in the Properties panel.
            


 Tip: You could also convert between corner and smooth points by double-clicking an anchor
                  point (or Option-clicking [macOS] or Alt-clicking [Windows]) with the Curvature tool,
                  like you saw earlier.
               



With both points selected, click the Vertical Align Bottom button () in the Properties panel to align one point to the other.
            
As you saw in Lesson 2, "Techniques for Selecting Artwork," selected anchor points align to the last selected anchor point, which is known
               as the key anchor.
            

 Note: If the points align to the artboard after clicking the align button, try again. Make
                  sure that Align To Key Object is selected in the Properties panel first.
               



Press the Down arrow five times to move both points down.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.



With the Direct Selection tool, click the coffee cup path to show all of the anchor
               points. Click the anchor point labeled 1 in the figure first and then Shift-click
               the anchor point labeled 2. Click the Horizontal Align Left button () in the Properties panel to align them.
            


 Note: If you find it difficult to select the second anchor point, you can also drag a marquee
                  across the bottom of the coffee cup to select the two anchor points or enter Outline
                  mode (View > Outline).
               



Click the anchor point labeled 3 in the figure first and then Shift-click the anchor
               point labeled 4. Click the Horizontal Align Right button () to align them. Leave the path (and points) selected.
            



Working with the Anchor Point tool
      
Another way to convert anchor points between smooth and corner points is using the
         Anchor Point tool. Next, you'll convert anchor points using the Anchor Point tool
         ().
      


Position the pointer over the Pen tool () in the Tools panel, and click and hold down the mouse button to reveal more tools.
               Select the Anchor Point tool ().
            
You will also see the Add Anchor Point tool () and the Delete Anchor Point tool (), which are specifically for adding or removing anchor points.
            


Position the pointer over the point with an arrow pointing to it in the figure. Click
               to convert the point from a smooth point (with direction handles) to a corner point.
            



Position the pointer over the anchor point below the point you just converted. Click
               and drag up when the pointer looks like this: . As you drag, press the Shift key. Drag up until you reach the anchor point above
               it. Release the mouse button and then release the key.
            


 Note: Don't drag if the pointer looks like this: . This means that the pointer is not over the anchor point, and if you drag, you will
                  reshape the curve.
               

With the Anchor Point tool, you can perform tasks such as converting between smooth
               and corner points, splitting direction handles, and more. Next, you'll do the same
               thing to the right side of the bottom of the coffee cup.
            

 Tip: If you position the Anchor Point tool pointer over the end of a direction handle
                  that is split, you can press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key and, when the
                  pointer changes (), click to make the direction handles a single straight line again (not split).
               



Position the pointer over the point with an arrow pointing to it in the figure. Click
               to convert the point from a smooth point (with direction handles) to a corner point.
            



Position the pointer over the anchor point below the point you just converted. Click
               and drag down when the pointer looks like this: . As you drag, press the Shift key. Drag down until the end of the opposite direction
               handle reaches the point above. Release the mouse button and then release the key.
            



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Creating a dashed line
      
Dashed lines apply to the stroke of an object and can be added to a closed path or
         an open path. Dashes are created by specifying a sequence of dash lengths and the
         gaps between them. Next, you will add a dash to a line.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.



In the Layers panel, click the visibility column for the layer named "Text" to show
               the layer contents.
            


Select the Zoom tool (), and click twice to zoom in to the red circles that are now showing.
            


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and click the dark gray path in the center of the red circles.
            


Click the Properties panel tab to show the panel. Click the word "Stroke" in the Properties
               panel to show the Stroke panel. Change the following options in the Stroke panel:
            


Weight: 8 pt

 Tip: The Preserves Exact Dash And Gap Lengths button () allows you to retain the appearance of the dashes without aligning to the corners
                        or the dash ends.
                     



Dashed Line: Selected


First Dash value: 4 pt (This creates a 4-pt dash, 4-pt gap repeating pattern.)
                  


First Gap value: 2 pt (This creates a 4-pt dash, 2-pt gap repeating pattern.)
                  


Aligns Dashes To Corners And Path Ends (): Selected
                  





Press the Escape key to hide the Stroke panel.

 Note: Be careful about pressing the Escape key when you change a value in a panel, like
                  you just did. Sometimes the value may not be accepted. You can press Enter or Return
                  to both accept the last value in a panel and hide the panel.
               



Choose File > Save, and leave the line selected.


Adding arrowheads to a path
      
You can add arrowheads to both ends of a path using the Stroke panel. There are many
         different arrowhead styles to choose from in Illustrator, as well as arrowhead editing
         options. Next, you'll apply different arrowheads to the dashed path.
      


With the dashed line still selected, click the word "Stroke" again in the Properties
               panel to open the Stroke panel (or choose Window > Stroke). In the Stroke panel, change
               only the following options:
            


Choose Arrow 21 from the menu directly to the right of the word "Arrowheads." This
                     adds an arrowhead to the start (right end) of the line.
                  


Scale (beneath where you chose Arrow 21): 30%


Choose Arrow 17 from the arrowheads menu to the far right of the word "Arrowheads."
                     This adds an arrowhead to the end of the line.
                  


Scale (beneath where you chose Arrow 17): 50%


Click the Extend Arrow Tip Beyond End Of Path button ().
                  





Click the edge of the coffee cup path, and change the fill color to White.


Click the spoon shape, and change the fill color to a light gray (I chose the color
               with the tooltip that shows "C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=10").
            

 Note: You may need to zoom out to see your spoon.
               



With the spoon selected, choose Object > Transform > Rotate, change the Angle to 90, select Preview, and then click OK.
            


 Note: If the spoon is behind the coffee cup in the stacking order, you can choose Object
                  > Arrange > Bring To Front with the spoon selected.
               



Drag the spoon into the position you see in the following figure.



Working with the Pencil tool
      
The Pencil tool () lets you draw freeform open and closed paths that contain curves and straight lines.
         As you draw with the Pencil tool, anchor points are created on the path where necessary
         and according to the Pencil tool options you set. The path can easily be adjusted
         when the path is complete.
      
Drawing freeform paths with the Pencil tool
Next, you'll draw and edit a simple path using the Pencil tool.


Choose 2 Coffee Bean from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of
               the Document window.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window, if necessary.


In the Layers panel, click the visibility column for the layer named "Template" to
               show the layer contents.
            


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and click a few times, slowly, on the top of the artboard to
               zoom in where you see "A."
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


In the Properties panel, make sure that the fill color is None () and the stroke color is Black. Also make sure the stroke weight is 1 pt in the Properties
               panel.
            


Click and hold down on the Shaper tool () in the Tools panel to select the Pencil tool (). Double-click the Pencil tool. In the Pencil Tool Options dialog box, set the following
               options, leaving the rest at their default settings:
            


Drag the Fidelity slider to the right, one position closer to Smooth. This will reduce
                     the number of points on a path drawn with the Pencil tool and make the path smoother.
                  


Keep Selected: Selected (the default setting)
                  


Option Key (Alt Key on Windows) Toggles To Smooth Tool: Selected (The Smooth tool is used to smooth the path after it is drawn.)
                  


Close Paths When Ends Are Within: Selected (the default setting)
                  



 Tip: Tip: When it comes to the Fidelity value, dragging the slider closer to Accurate
                  usually creates more anchor points and more accurately reflects the path you've drawn.
                  Dragging the slider toward Smooth makes fewer anchor points and a smoother, less complex
                  path.
               




Click OK.
The asterisk (*) that appears next to the Pencil tool pointer indicates that you are
               about to create a new path. If you don't see the asterisk, it means that you are about
               to redraw a shape that the pointer is near.
            


Starting at the red X in the template, click and drag around the dashed template path.
               When the pointer gets close to the start of the path (at the red X), a small circle
               displays next to it () to indicate that if you release the mouse button, the path will close. When you
               see the circle, release the mouse button to close the path.
            

Notice that as you are drawing, the path may not look perfectly smooth. After releasing
               the mouse button, the path is smoothed based on the Fidelity value that you set in
               the Pencil Tool Options dialog box.
            

 Note: If you see an X () instead of the Pencil icon ( ), the Caps Lock key is active. Caps Lock turns the Pencil tool icon into an X for
                  increased precision.
               


 Note: When editing a path with the Pencil tool, you may find that a new path is created
                  instead of editing the original shape. You can always undo and make sure that you
                  finish back on the original path (or at least close to it).
               



Position the Pencil tool on or near the path to redraw it. When the asterisk disappears
               from the pointer, click and drag to reshape the path. Make sure you wind up back on
               the original path. Think of it as redrawing parts of the path.
            


 Tip: If you wanted to "smooth" parts of the path you drew, you could press the Option
                  key (macOS) or Alt key (Windows) and drag along the path. This can simplify the path
                  and remove anchor points. This is possible because you selected Option Key (Alt Key
                  on Windows) Toggles To Smooth Tool in the Pencil Tool Options dialog box earlier.
               



Drawing straight segments with the Pencil tool
Aside from drawing more freeform paths, you can also create straight lines that can
         be constrained to 45° angles with the Pencil tool. That's what you'll do next.
      


Scroll down the artboard to see the template shapes labeled "B" and "C," if you can't
               see them.
            


Position the pointer over the red X at the bottom of the path labeled "B." Click and
               drag around the left side of the shape and stop at the green X, but don't release the mouse button yet.
            


With the mouse button still down, press Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows), and drag
               a straight line that follows the flat edge of the shape. When you reach the red X
               again and a small circle displays next to the Pencil tool pointer (), release the mouse button and then the key to close the path.
            


 Note: When drawing the path, after reaching the green X, you could have released the mouse
                  button to stop drawing and then just started drawing from the same place later. You
                  can tell you are continuing a path with the Pencil tool when a line appears next to
                  the Pencil tool pointer ( ), with the pointer positioned over the end of a path.
               



Position the pointer over the red X at the top of the path labeled "C" (it's below
               "B"). Click and drag down around the right side of the shape and stop at the green
               X, but don't release the mouse button yet.
            


With the mouse button still down, press the Shift key, and drag a straight line that
               follows the flat edge of the shape. When you reach the red X again and a small circle
               displays next to the Pencil tool pointer (), release the mouse button and then the key to close the path.
            



With shape "C" selected, choose Object > Transform > Rotate. In the Rotate dialog
               box, change Angle to -25˚, select Preview, and then click OK.
            



Finishing the coffee bean
      
In this last part of the section, you'll take the shapes you created with the Pencil
         tool, bring them together to create a coffee bean, then add it to the final artwork.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Select the Selection tool (), and click to select the top shape labeled "A." Change the fill color to the swatch
               named "CoffeeBean" in the Properties panel.
            



Click to select shape B, and then Shift-click to select shape C. Change the fill color
               for both to the swatch named "CoffeeBean2" in the Properties panel.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.


Drag shape B and then shape C onto shape A, something like you see in the figure.
Feel free to adjust the individual shapes using any of the methods you've learned
               so far (I did).
            



Drag across all three shapes to select them, and choose Object > Group.


Choose View > Fit All In Window.


Drag the coffee bean group on front of the coffee cup and spoon. You may want to resize
               the coffee bean group a little.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.



Joining with the Join tool
In this lesson and earlier lessons, you've used the Join command (Object > Path >
         Join) to join as well as close paths. Using the Join tool (), you can easily join paths that cross, overlap, or have open ends using scrubbing
         gestures.
      


Choose View > Steam. This command will zoom in to the shapes above the coffee cup
               and also hide the layer named "Template."
            


Click and hold down the mouse on the Pencil tool (), and select the Join tool ().
            
Unlike the Join command (Object > Path > Join) you learned about in Lesson 3, "Using Shapes to Create Artwork for a Postcard," the Join tool can trim overlapping paths as it joins, and it doesn't simply create
               a straight line between the anchor points you are joining. The angle created by the
               two paths to be joined are taken into account.
            


With the Join tool selected, drag across the two ends of the path on the right (see
               the figure for which paths to drag across).
            

 Note: If you were to instead join the ends of the open path by pressing Cmd+J (macOS) or
                  Ctrl+J (Windows), a straight line would connect the ends.
               


When dragging (also called scrubbing) across paths, they will be either "extended and joined" or "trimmed and joined."
               In this example, the paths were extended and joined. The Join tool works on paths
               that are selected or not, but the result of joining is not selected to continue working
               on more paths.
            


Drag across (or scrub) the excess part of the paths on the shape to the left to remove
               them and close the path. In this case, the path was "trimmed and joined."
            



Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Select the Selection tool, and drag across the "steam" shapes above the cup to select
               them.
            


Change the Fill color to the swatch named "Steam" and the stroke weight to 0 in the Properties panel.
            


Choose Object > Group, and drag the group down like the following figure.


Choose Select > Deselect, and take a step back to admire all that you've accomplished!


Choose File > Save and then choose File > Close.

Review answers


To draw a straight line, click with the Pen tool () and then move the pointer and click again. The first click sets the starting anchor
                  point, and the second click sets the ending anchor point of the line. To constrain
                  the straight line vertically, horizontally, or along a 45˚ diagonal, press the Shift
                  key as you click to create the second anchor point with the Pen tool.
               


To draw a curved line with the Pen tool, click to create the starting anchor point,
                  drag to set the direction of the curve, and then click to end the curve.
               


To convert a smooth point on a curve to a corner point, use the Direct Selection tool
                  () to select the anchor point and then use the Anchor Point tool () to drag a direction handle to change the direction. Another method is to choose a point
                  or points with the Direct Selection tool and then click the Convert Selected Anchor
                  Points To Corner button () in the Properties panel.
               


To edit a segment on a curved line, select the Direct Selection tool, and drag the
                  segment to move it; or drag a direction handle on an anchor point to adjust the length
                  and shape of the segment. Dragging a path segment with the Direct Selection tool or
                  pressing the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key and dragging a path segment with
                  the Pen tool is another way to reshape a path.
               


To change the way the Pencil tool () works, double-click the Pencil tool in the Tools panel to open the Pencil Tool Options
                  dialog box. There you can change the fidelity and other options.
               


Unlike the Join command, the Join tool can trim overlapping paths as it joins, and
                  it doesn't simply create a straight line between the anchor points you are joining.
                  The angle created by the two paths to be joined are taken into account.

                  before choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
               



Exploring color modes
      
There are many ways to experiment with and apply color to your artwork in Adobe Illustrator
         CC. As you work with color, it's important to keep in mind the medium in which the
         artwork will be published, such as a print piece or a website. The colors you create
         need to be described in the correct way for the medium. This usually requires that
         you use the correct color mode and color definitions for your colors. The first part,
         color modes, will be described next.
      
Before starting a new document, you should decide which color mode the artwork should
         use, CMYK or RGB.
      


CMYK—Cyan, magenta, yellow, and black are the colors used in four-color process printing.
               These four colors are combined and overlapped in a screen pattern to create a multitude
               of other colors.
            


RGB—Red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to create an array
               of colors. Select this mode if you are using images for onscreen presentations, the
               Internet, or mobile apps.
            


When creating a new document by choosing File > New, each profile has a specific color
         mode. For instance, the Print profile uses the CMYK color mode. You can easily change
         the color mode by making a selection in the Color Mode menu.
      

 Tip: To learn more about color and graphics, search for "About color" in Illustrator Help
            (Help > Illustrator Help).
         


When a color mode is selected, colors in the document are displayed in the selected
         color mode. You can change the color mode of a document, after a file is created,
         by choosing File > Document Color Mode and then choosing either CMYK Color or RGB
         Color in the menu.
      
Working with color
      
In this lesson, you'll learn about the traditional methods of coloring (also called
         painting) objects in Illustrator using a combination of panels and tools, such as the Properties
         panel, Swatches panel, Color Guide panel, Color Picker, and the paint options in the
         Tools panel.
      
In previous lessons, you learned that objects in Illustrator can have a fill, a stroke,
         or both. At the bottom of the Tools panel (on the left), notice the Fill and Stroke
         boxes. The Fill box is white (in this case), and the Stroke box is Black. If you click
         those boxes one at a time, you'll see that whichever is clicked is brought in front
         of the other (it's selected). When a color is chosen, it is applied to the fill or
         stroke, whichever is selected. As you explore more of Illustrator, you'll see these
         fill and stroke boxes in lots of other places like the Properties panel, Swatches
         panel, and more.
      


 Note: The Tools panel you see may be a single column, and that just depends on the resolution
            of your screen.
         

As you will see in this section, Illustrator provides a lot of ways to arrive at the
         color you need. You'll start by applying an existing color to a shape and then work
         your way through the most widely used methods for creating and applying color.
      
Applying an existing color

 Note: Throughout this lesson, you'll be working on a document with a color mode that was
            set to CMYK when the document was created, which means that the majority of colors
            you create will, by default, be composed of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.
         

Every new document in Illustrator has a series of default colors available for you
         to use in your artwork in the form of swatches in the Swatches panel. The first method
         of working with color you'll explore is to paint a shape with an existing color.
      


Click the ArtSign.ai document tab at the top of the Document window, if you did not
               close the L7_end.ai document.
            


Choose 1 Art Sign from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window (if it's not chosen already) and then choose View > Fit Artboard In
               Window.
            


With the Selection tool (), click to select the large red shape in the background.
            


Click the Fill box in the Properties panel () on the right to reveal a panel. Click the Swatches option () in the panel, if it isn't already selected, to show the saved default swatches.
               Position the pointer over a swatch in the list to reveal a tooltip with the swatch
               name. Click to apply the blue swatch named "Sign Bg" to change the color of the fill
               for the selected artwork.
            



Press the Escape key to hide the panel.


Creating a custom color
There are lots of ways to create your own custom colors in Illustrator. Using the
         Color panel (Window > Color) or Color Mixer, you can apply color to an object's fill
         and stroke and also edit and mix colors using different color models (CMYK, for example).
         The Color panel and Color Mixer display the current fill and stroke of the selected
         content, and you can either visually select a color from the color spectrum bar at
         the bottom of the panel or mix your own colors, changing the color values in various
         ways. Next, you'll create a custom color using the Color Mixer.
      


With the Selection tool (), click the gray ellipse below the word "ART," toward the top of the artboard.
            



Click the Fill box in the Properties panel () on the right, to reveal a panel. Select the Color Mixer option () in the panel that appears.
            


Click in the light-green part of the color spectrum to sample a light-green color
               and apply it to the fill.
            
Since the spectrum bar is so small, you most likely won't achieve the same color as
               I did. That's okay, because you'll edit it shortly to match.
            

If artwork is selected when you create a color this way, the color is automatically
               applied.
            



In the Color Mixer panel, type the following values in the CMYK fields: C=52, M=0, Y=100, K=0. This ensures that we are all using the same green.
            
Colors created in the Color Mixer panel are not saved anywhere except for in the fill
               or stroke of the selected artwork. If you want to easily reuse the color you just
               created elsewhere in this document, you can save it as a swatch in the Swatches panel.
               All documents start with a default number of swatches, as mentioned earlier. Any colors
               you save or edit in the Swatches panel are available to the current document only
               (by default) since each document has its own defined swatches.
            

 Tip: Each CMYK value is a percentage of 100.
               



Saving a color as a swatch
You can name and save different types of colors, gradients, and patterns in the document
         as swatches so that you can apply and edit them later. Swatches are listed in the
         Swatches panel in the order in which they were created, but you can reorder or organize
         the swatches into groups to suit your needs.
      
Next, you'll save the green color you just created as a swatch so you can easily reuse
         it.
      


Click the Fill box in the Properties panel () on the right to reveal a panel. Click the Swatches button at the top of the panel
               to see the swatches. Click the New Swatch button () at the bottom of the panel to create a swatch from the fill color of the selected
               artwork.
            



In the New Swatch dialog box that appears, change the following options:



Swatch Name: Light Green

 Tip: Naming colors can be an art form. You can name them according to their value (C=45,
                        ...), appearance (Light Green), or description like "text header," among other attributes.
                     



Add To My Library: Deselected (In Lesson 13, "Creating Artwork for a T-Shirt," you'll learn all about Libraries.)
                  


Notice the "Global" option that is selected by default. New swatches you create are
               global by default. That means, if you later edit this swatch, everywhere it is applied,
               regardless of whether or not the artwork is selected, is updated.
            


Click OK to save the swatch.


 Note: If the panel is hidden, click the Fill box in the Properties panel.
               

Notice that the new Light Green swatch is highlighted in the Swatches panel (it has
               a white border around it). That's because it is applied to the selected shape automatically.
               Also notice the little white triangle in the lower-right corner of the swatch. This
               indicates that it's a global swatch.
            


Leave the Light Green filled shape selected for the next section.


Creating a copy of a swatch
One of the easiest ways to create and save a color as a swatch is to make a copy of
         a swatch and edit the copy. Next, you'll create another swatch by copying and editing
         the Light Green swatch.
      


With the shape still selected, click the Fill box in the Properties panel () on the right to reveal a panel. Click the Swatches button at the top of the panel
               to see the swatches, if they aren't showing. Once again, you should see that the Light
               Green swatch is highlighted because it's applied to the shape.
            


Choose Duplicate Swatch from the panel menu ().
            

This creates a new swatch from the fill color of the selected artwork (the Light Green
               swatch) that is now applied to the selected shape.
            

 Note: The figure shows where to click to show the panel menu.
               



Click to apply the original Light Green swatch to the selected shape.
            


With the Selection tool (), click the gray ellipse below the word "FINE" to select it.
            



Click the Fill box in the Properties panel, and double-click the green swatch copy to both apply it to the selected artwork and edit the color settings.
            



In the Swatch Options dialog box, change the name to Orange; change the values to C=6, M=51, Y=89, K=0; and make sure that Add To My Library is deselected. Select Preview and then click
               OK.
            

 Tip: In the Swatch Options dialog box, the Color Mode menu lets you change the color mode
                  of a specific color to RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, or another mode when you create it.
               


Make sure the new Orange swatch is applied to the selected shape.


Editing a global swatch
Next, you'll save a color as a swatch and learn about global color. When you edit a global color, all artwork with that swatch applied, regardless of
         whether it's selected, is updated.
      


With the Selection tool (), click to select the gray ellipse below the orange ellipse you just applied the
               Orange swatch to.
            



Click the Fill box () in the Properties panel, and click the New Swatch button () at the bottom of the panel.
            


In the New Swatch dialog box, change the following options:


Swatch Name: Pink


Global: Selected (the default setting)
                  


Change the CMYK values to C=5, M=100, Y=60, K=0


Add To My Library: Deselected





Click OK.
Notice that the new swatch is in the same row as the gray color swatches. When you
               selected the shape, it was filled with a gray swatch, which was selected in the Swatches
               panel. When you click the New Swatch button to make a new color, it duplicates the
               selected swatch and puts the new swatch next to the original in the Swatches panel.
            

 Note: If the panel is hidden, click the Fill box in the Properties panel.
               




Drag the Pink swatch to the right of the Orange swatch to keep them together.



With the Selection tool, click the ruler shape at the bottom of the artboard. Click
               the Fill box in the Properties panel, and select the new swatch named "Pink."
            



With the ruler shape still selected, click the Fill box () in the Properties panel. Double-click the swatch named "Pink." In the Swatch Options
               dialog box, change the Y value (Yellow) to 30, select Preview to see the changes (you may need to click in another field to see
               the change), and then click OK.
            

All of the shapes with the global swatch applied are updated, even if they weren't
               selected.
            


Editing a non-global swatch
The default colors that comes with Illustrator are not saved as global swatches by
         default. That means that editing one of those color swatches will not update artwork
         that uses the color, unless that artwork is selected. Next, you'll apply and edit
         a swatch that was not saved as a global swatch.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the large blue shape in the background that you first
               applied a fill color to.
            


Click the Fill box () in the Properties panel and then click the green color swatch with the tooltip that
               shows as "C=75 M=0 Y=75 K=0" to apply it.
            

You can tell that the green color swatch you applied is not a global swatch because it doesn't have the small white triangle in the lower-right
               corner of the swatch in the Swatches panel.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.
            


Choose Window > Swatches to open the Swatches panel as a separate panel. Double-click
               the swatch you just applied to edit it.
            

Most of the formatting options you find in the Properties panel can also be found
               in a separate panel in the Window menu. Opening the Swatches panel, for instance,
               can be a useful way to work with colors without having to select artwork.
            


In the Swatch Options dialog box, change the name to Background and the values to C=80, M=10, Y=45, K=2, and select Preview.
            

Notice that the color of the background shape doesn't change. That's because the swatch
               is not a global swatch (global is not selected in the Swatch Options dialog box for
               the swatch). Only selected shapes with the swatch applied will change if you edit
               a non-global swatch.
            

 Note: You can change an existing swatch into a global swatch, but it requires a bit more
                  effort. You either need to select all of the shapes with that swatch applied before
                  you edit the swatch and make it global, or you edit the swatch to make it global and
                  then reapply the swatch to the content.
               



Click OK. Click the X at the top of the Swatches panel group to close it.


Click to select the background shape. Click the Fill box () in the Properties panel, and notice that the green color swatch is no longer applied.
            


Click the green Background swatch you just edited to apply it again.



Using the Color Picker to create color
      
Another method for creating color is to use the Color Picker. The Color Picker lets
         you select a color in a color field and in a spectrum either by defining colors numerically
         or by clicking a swatch, and it is found in other Adobe applications like InDesign
         and Photoshop. Next, you will create a color using the Color Picker and then save
         that color as a swatch in the Swatches panel.
      


With the Selection tool (), click the gray ellipse to the right of the brown end of the paintbrush.
            


Double-click the gray Fill box at the bottom of the Tools panel, to the left of the
               document, to open the Color Picker.
            

In the Color Picker dialog box, the larger color field shows saturation (horizontally)
               and brightness (vertically). The color spectrum bar to the right of the color field
               shows the hue.
            


In the Color Picker dialog box, click and drag up and down in the color spectrum bar
               (labeled "B" in the following figure) to change the color range. Make sure that you
               wind up with the triangles in a blue color (it doesn't have to be exact).
            


Click and drag in the color field (labeled "A" in the following figure). As you drag
               right and left, you adjust the saturation, and as you drag up and down, you adjust
               the brightness. The color you create when you click OK (don't yet) appears in the
               New color rectangle, labeled "C" in the figure. Don't worry about matching the color
               in the figure yet.
            


 Tip: You can also change the color spectrum you see by selecting H, S, B, R, G, or B.
               



In the CMYK fields, change the values to C=90, M=15, Y=0, and K=0.
            

 Note: The Color Swatches button in the Color Picker shows you the swatches in the Swatches
                  panel and the default color books (the sets of swatches that come with Illustrator),
                  and it lets you select a color from one. You can return to the color spectrum by clicking
                  the Color Models button and then editing the swatch color values, if necessary.
               



Click OK, and you should see that the blue is applied to the fill of the shape.


Click the Fill box () in the Properties panel to show the swatches. Click the New Swatch button () at the bottom of the panel, and change the following options in the New Swatch dialog
               box:
            


Swatch Name: Blue


Global: Selected (the default setting)
                  


Add To My Library: Deselected




Click OK to see the color appear as a swatch in the Swatches panel.


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Using Illustrator swatch libraries

 Note: Sometimes it's practical to use process (typically CMYK) and spot inks (PANTONE,
            for instance) in the same job. For example, you might use one spot ink to print the
            exact color of a company logo on the same pages of an annual report where photographs
            are reproduced using process color. You can also use a spot-color printing plate to
            apply a varnish over areas of a process color job. In both cases, your print job would
            use a total of five inks—four process inks and one spot ink or varnish.
         

Swatch libraries are collections of preset colors, such as Pantone and TOYO, and thematic
         libraries, such as Earthtone and Ice Cream. Illustrator has default swatch libraries
         that appear as separate panels when you open them, and these cannot be edited. When
         you apply color from a library to artwork, the color in the library becomes a swatch
         that is saved in that document only and appears in the Swatches panel. Libraries are
         a great starting point for creating colors.
      
Next, you will create a spot color using a Pantone Plus library, which prints using
         a spot ink. You will then apply that color to artwork. When color is defined in Illustrator
         and later printed, the appearance of the color may vary. This is why most printers
         and designers rely on a color-matching system, like the PANTONE system, to help maintain
         color consistency and, in some cases, to give a wider range of colors.
      
Adding a spot color
In this section, you'll see how to open a color library, such as the PANTONE color
         system, and how to add a PANTONE MATCHING SYSTEM (PMS) color to the Swatches panel.
      


Choose Window > Swatch Libraries > Color Books > PANTONE+ Solid Coated.
The PANTONE+ Solid Coated library appears in its own panel.



Type 137 in the Find field. As you type, the list is filtered, showing a smaller and smaller
               range of swatches.


Click the swatch PANTONE 137 C, beneath the search field to add it to the Swatches
               panel for this document. Click the X to the right of the search field to stop the
               filtering.
            



Close the PANTONE+ Solid Coated panel.

 Note: If you exit Illustrator with the PANTONE library panel still open and then relaunch
                  Illustrator, the panel does not reopen. To automatically open the panel whenever Illustrator
                  opens, choose Persistent from the PANTONE+ Solid Coated panel menu ().
               



With the Selection tool (), Shift-click the three white pencil shapes under the letter "S" in "ARTISTRY."
            


Click the Fill box () in the Properties panel to show the swatches and select the PANTONE 137 C swatch
               to fill the shapes.
            



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.



PANTONE swatches vs. other swatches in the Swatches panel
In the Swatches panel, you can identify spot-color swatches by the spot-color icon
            () when the panel is in List view or by the dot in the lower corner () when the panel is in Thumbnail view. Process colors do not have a spot-color icon
            or a dot.
         

Creating and saving a tint of a color
      
A tint is a mixture of a color with white to make the color lighter. You can create a tint
         from a global process color, like CMYK, or from a spot color. Next, you'll create
         a tint of the Pantone swatch you added to the document.
      


With the Selection tool (), click the middle, yellow pencil shape.
            


Click the Fill box in the Properties panel () on the right. Click the Color Mixer button () at the top of the panel that appears.
            
In the section "Creating a custom color," you created a custom color using the Color
               Mixer sliders. In that section, you were creating a custom color from scratch—that's
               why there were CMYK sliders. Now you will see a single slider labeled "T" for tint.
               When using the color mixer for a global swatch, you will create a tint instead of mixing CMYK values.
            


Drag the tint slider to the left to change the tint value to 70%.



Click the Swatches option () at the top of the panel to show the swatches. Click the New Swatch button () at the bottom of the panel to save the tint.
            


Position the pointer over the swatch icon to see its name, which is PANTONE 137 C
               70%.
            



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Converting colors
      
When working with colors, Illustrator offers Edit Colors commands (Edit > Edit Colors)
         that allow you to convert colors between color modes, blend colors, invert colors,
         and much more, for selected artwork. Next, you'll change the pencil with the PANTONE
         137 C color applied to use CMYK colors instead of Pantone.
      


Choose Select > All On Active Artboard to select all artwork on the artboard, including
               the shapes with the Pantone color and tint applied.
            


Choose Edit > Edit Colors > Convert To CMYK.
Any colors in the selected shapes that had Pantone applied as a spot color are now
               composed of CMYK. Using this method for converting to CMYK does not affect Pantone color swatches (PANTONE 137 C and the tint, in this case) in the Swatches
               panel. It simply converts the selected artwork colors to CMYK. The swatches in the Swatches panel are no longer applied to the artwork.
            

 Note: Currently, Convert to RGB in the Edit Color menu is dimmed (you cannot select it).
                  That's because the Document Color Mode is CMYK. To convert selected content color
                  to RGB using this method, first choose File > Document Color Mode > RGB Color.
               



Copying appearance attributes
At times you may want to simply copy appearance attributes, such as text formatting,
         fill, and stroke, from one object to another. This can be done with the Eyedropper
         tool () and can really speed up your creative process.
      


Choose Select > Deselect.


Using the Selection tool (), select the last gray ellipse.
            


Select the Eyedropper tool () in the Tools panel on the left. Click the yellow/orange of the pencil (not the tint).
               See the figure.
            

The gray ellipse has the attributes from the pencil shape applied, including a 1-pt
               black stroke.
            

 Tip: You can double-click the Eyedropper tool in the Tools panel, before sampling, to
                  change the attributes that the Eyedropper picks up and applies.
               



Click the Stroke color () in the Properties panel, and change the color to None ().
            


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Creating a color group
      
In Illustrator, you can save colors in color groups, which consist of related color
         swatches in the Swatches panel. Organizing colors by their use, such as grouping all
         colors for a logo, can be helpful for organization and more, as you'll soon see. Color
         groups cannot contain patterns, gradients, the None color, or Registration color.
      
Next, you'll create a color group of some of the swatches you've created to keep them
         organized.
      


Choose Window > Swatches to open the Swatches panel. In the Swatches panel, click
               the swatch named "Sign Bg" to select it. Holding down the Shift key, click the swatch
               named "Blue" to the right to select five color swatches.
            


 Tip: You may want to drag the bottom of the Swatches panel down to see more of the content.
               



Click the New Color Group button () at the bottom of the Swatches panel. Change Name to Palette Colors in the New Color Group dialog box, and click OK to save the group.
            


 Note: If objects are selected when you click the New Color Group button, an expanded New
                  Color Group dialog box appears. In this dialog box, you can create a color group from
                  the colors in the artwork and convert the colors to global colors.
               



With the Selection tool () selected, click a blank area of the Swatches panel to deselect all in the panel.
            

Each swatch in a color group can still be edited independently by double-clicking
               a swatch in the group and editing the values in the Swatch Options dialog box.
            


Click and drag the swatch named "Sign Bg" in the color group to the right of the PANTONE
               137 C 70% swatch. Leave the Swatches panel open.
            


 Tip: Aside from dragging colors in or out of a color group, you can rename a color group,
                  reorder the colors in the group, and more.
               

You can drag colors into or out of a color group. When dragging into a color group,
               make sure that you see a line appear on the right edge of a swatch within the group.
               Otherwise, you may drag the swatch to the wrong place. You can always choose Edit
               > Undo Move Swatches and try again.
            


Creative inspiration with the Color Guide panel
The Color Guide panel can provide you with color inspiration as you create your artwork.
         You can use it to pick color tints, analogous colors, and much more, and then apply
         them directly to artwork, edit them using several methods, or save them as a group
         in the Swatches panel. Next, you'll use the Color Guide panel to select different
         colors for a few pencils that will become part of a logo, and then you'll save those
         colors as a color group in the Swatches panel.
      


Choose 2 Pencils 1 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window.
            


With the Selection tool (), click the darker green pencil body. Make sure that the Fill box is selected in
               the Tools panel or Swatches panel.
            



Choose Window > Color Guide to open the panel. Click the Set Base Color To The Current
               Color button () (see the following figure).
            
This allows the Color Guide panel to suggest colors based on the color showing in
               the Set Base Color To The Current Color button. The colors you see in the Color Guide
               panel may differ from what you see in the figure. That's okay.
            
Next, you'll experiment with colors using Harmony Rules.


Choose Analogous from the Harmony Rules menu (circled in the following figure) in
               the Color Guide panel.
            
A base group of colors is created to the right of the base color (darker green), and
               a series of tints and shades of those colors appears in the body of the panel. There
               are lots of harmony rules to choose from, each instantly generating a color scheme
               based on any color you want. The base color you set (green) is the basis for generating
               the colors in the color scheme.
            


 Tip: You can also choose a different color variation (different from the default Tints/Shades),
                  such as Show Warm/Cool, by clicking the Color Guide panel menu icon () and choosing one.
               



Click the Save Color Group To Swatch Panel button () at the bottom of the Color Guide panel to save the base colors (the five colors
               at the top) in the Swatches panel as a group. Leave the panel open.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.

In the Swatches panel you should see the new group added. You may need to scroll down
               in the panel.
            
Next, you'll experiment with the colors in the color group that you just created to
               create an alternate group of colors.
            


In the list of swatches in the Color Guide panel, select the fifth color from the
               left in the fourth row (see the figure). If the pencil body were still selected, it
               would now be filled with a yellow/green.
            


 Note: If you choose a different color variation than the one suggested, your color will
                  differ from those in the rest of this section.
               



Click the Set Base Color To The Current Color button () (circled in the following figure) to ensure that all colors that the panel creates
               are based on that same yellow/green.
            


Choose Triad 2 from the Harmony Rules menu.


Click the Save Color Group To Swatch Panel button () to save the colors as a group in the Swatches panel.
            



Editing a color group in the Edit Colors dialog box
When you create color groups in the Swatches panel or in the Color Guide panel, you
         can edit the swatches in the group either individually (by double-clicking each in
         the Swatches panel) or together. In this section, you'll learn how to edit the colors
         of a color group saved in the Swatches panel using the Edit Colors dialog box. Later,
         you will apply those colors to artwork.
      


Choose Select > Deselect (if it's available).
Deselecting right now is important! If artwork is selected when you edit the color group, the edits can apply to the
               selected artwork.
            


In the Swatches panel, click the Color Group icon () to the left of the colors in the bottom color group (the one you just saved) to ensure that it's selected. It's circled in
               the figure.
            


Click the Edit Color Group button () at the bottom of the Swatches panel to open the Edit Colors dialog box.
            

The Edit Color Group button () appears in multiple locations, like the Swatches and Color Guide panels. The Edit
               Colors dialog box allows you to edit a group of colors in various ways or even to
               create new color groups. On the right side of the Edit Colors dialog box, under the
               Color Groups section, all of the existing color groups in the Swatches panel are listed.
            

 Tip: With no artwork selected, you could also double-click the Color Group icon (the folder)
                  to open the Edit Colors dialog box.
               



Select the name "Color Group 2" in the field above the Color Groups section if not
               already selected (circled in the figure), and rename the group Pencil Colors. This is one way you can rename a color group.
            

Next, you'll make a few changes to the colors in the Pencil Colors group. On the left
               side of the Edit Colors dialog box, you can edit the colors of each color group, either
               individually or together, and edit them visually or precisely using specific color
               values. In the color wheel, you'll see markers (circles) that represent each color
               in the selected group.
            


In the color wheel on the left side of the dialog box, drag the blue circle, called
               a marker, in the lower-left section of the color wheel down and to the left just a little
               bit.
            

Moving the color markers away from the center of the color wheel increases saturation,
               and moving them toward the center decreases saturation. Moving a color marker around
               the color wheel (clockwise or counterclockwise) edits the hue.
            

 Note: The largest yellow/green marker is the base color of the color group that you set
                  in the Color Guide panel initially.
               


 Tip: You'll notice that all of the colors in the group move and change together. This
                  is because they are linked together by default.
               



Drag the Adjust Brightness slider below the color wheel to the right to brighten all
               the colors at once.
            

Next, you will edit the colors in the group independently and then save the colors
               as a new named group.
            

 Note: You can match the H, S, B (hue, saturation, brightness) values below the color wheel
                  in the Edit Colors dialog box to mimic what you see in the figure, if you want to
                  match exactly the color I achieved.
               



Click the Unlink Harmony Colors button () so it looks like this () in the Edit Colors dialog box to edit the colors independently.
            
The lines between the color markers (circles) and the center of the color wheel become
               dotted, indicating that you can edit the colors independently. Next, you'll edit just
               one of the colors, since they are now unlinked. You will edit that color by using
               specific color values rather than by dragging the color in the color wheel.
            


Click the Color Mode icon () to the right of the H, S, B values below the color wheel, and choose CMYK from the
               menu, if the CMYK sliders are not already visible.
            



Click to select the top red/purple marker on the right side of the color wheel. Change
               the CMYK values to C=29, M=80, Y=100, and K=28.
            

Notice that the marker has moved in the color wheel, and it's the only one that moved.
               That's because you clicked the Unlink Harmony Colors button. Leave the dialog box
               open.
            

 Note: It's okay if the color markers in your Edit Colors dialog box are different from
                  those shown in the figure.
               


 Note: The figure shows the result of changing the CMYK values.
               



Click the Save Changes To Color Group button () in the upper-right corner of the Edit Colors dialog box to save the changes to the
               color group.
            

If you decide to make changes to colors in another color group, you can select the
               color group you want to edit on the right side of the Edit Colors dialog box and edit
               the colors on the left side. You can then save the changes to the group by clicking the Save Changes To Color Group
               button () in the upper-right corner of the dialog box.
            


Click OK to close the Edit Colors dialog box.

The changes to the colors in the group should show in the Swatches panel. Don't worry
               if the colors you see don't exactly match the figure.
            

 Note: If a dialog box appears after clicking OK, click Yes to save the changes to the color
                  group in the Swatches panel.
               



Choose File > Save.


Editing colors in artwork
You can also edit the colors in selected artwork using the Recolor Artwork command.
         It's really useful when global swatches weren't used in the artwork. Without using
         global colors in your artwork, updating a series of colors in selected artwork may
         take a lot of time. Next, you will edit the colors for pencil artwork that was created
         with some colors that were not global swatches.
      


Choose Select > All On Active Artboard to select all of the artwork.


Click the Recolor button in the Properties panel to open the Recolor Artwork dialog
               box.
            


 Tip: You can also choose Edit > Edit Colors > Recolor Artwork.
               

The options in the Recolor Artwork dialog box allow you to edit, reassign, or reduce
               the colors in your selected artwork and to create and edit color groups. You'll probably notice that it looks
               an awful lot like the Edit Colors dialog box. The big difference is that instead of
               editing color and color groups, as well as creating color groups to apply later, you
               are dynamically editing colors in the currently selected artwork.
            


In the Recolor Artwork dialog box, click the Hide Color Group Storage icon () on the right side of the dialog box (circled in the following figure) to hide the
               color groups temporarily.
            
Like in the Edit Colors dialog box, all of the color groups in the Swatches panel
               appear on the right side of the Recolor Artwork dialog box (in the Color Groups storage
               area). In the Recolor Artwork dialog box, you can apply colors from these color groups
               to the selected artwork. In this part of the lesson, you just need to edit the colors
               found in the selected artwork.
            


Click the Get Colors From Selected Art icon () in the upper-right corner of the Recolor Artwork dialog box, to make sure that the
               colors from the selected artwork are showing in the Recolor Artwork dialog box.
            



Click the Edit tab to edit the colors in the artwork using the color wheel.


Make sure that the Link Harmony Colors icon is disabled so that you can edit all of
               the colors independently. The Link Harmony Colors icon should look like this: , not like this: .
            
The lines between the color markers (circles) and the center of the color wheel should
               be dotted. When you created a color group, you worked with the color wheel and the
               CMYK sliders to edit color. This time, you will adjust color using a different method.
            



Click the Display Color Bars button () to show the colors in the selected artwork as bars.
            


Click the darker orange color bar to select it.


At the bottom of the dialog box, change the M value (Magenta) to 100. If the Recolor Artwork dialog box isn't in the way, you should see the artwork changing.
            

 Tip: If you want to return to the original logo colors, click the Get Colors From Selected
                  Art button ().
               



Click the light orange color bar to the right of the currently selected color bar.
               With the pointer over the light orange color bar, right-click and choose Select Shade
               from the menu that appears. Click in the shade picker, and drag to change the color
               of the color bar. Click away from the shade menu to close it.
            

 Note: If you don't see the CMYK sliders, choose CMYK from the menu () to the right of the sliders in the Recolor Artwork dialog box.
               


Editing the colors as bars is just another way to view and edit the colors, and there
               are so many options for editing. To learn more about these options, search for "Color
               groups (harmonies)" in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
            

 Tip: You can save the edited colors as a color group by clicking the Show Color Group
                  Storage icon () on the right side of the dialog box and then clicking the New Color Group button
                  ().
               



Click OK in the Recolor Artwork dialog box.


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.

 Note: For more information about working with the Color Themes panel, search for "Color
                  themes" in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
               




Working with Adobe Color Themes
The Adobe Color Themes panel (Window > Color Themes) displays color themes you have
            created and synced with your account on the Adobe Color CC website (https://color.adobe.com/). The Adobe ID used in Illustrator CC is automatically used to sign in to the Adobe
            Color CC website, and the Adobe Color Themes panel is refreshed with your Adobe color
            themes.
         

Assigning colors to your artwork
In the previous section, you learned that you can edit colors in existing selected
         artwork in the Recolor Artwork dialog box. You can also "assign" colors from an existing
         color group to your artwork in the Recolor Artwork dialog box. Next, you'll assign
         a color group to other artwork.
      


Choose 3 Pencils 2 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window.
            


Choose Select > All On Active Artboard to select the colored pencil artwork.


Click the Recolor button in the Properties panel to open the Recolor Artwork dialog
               box.
            


 Tip: You can also choose Edit > Edit Colors > Recolor Artwork.
               



Click the Show Color Group Storage icon () on the right side of the dialog box to show the color groups, if they aren't already
               showing. Make sure that, in the top left of the dialog box, the Assign button is selected.
            
On the left side of the Recolor Artwork dialog box, notice that the colors from the
               selected pencil artwork are listed in the Current Colors (7) column, in what is called
               hue-forward sorting. That means they are arranged, from top to bottom, in the ordering of the
               color wheel: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.
            


Under Color Groups in the Recolor Artwork dialog box, select the Pencil Colors color
               group you created earlier. The selected artwork on the artboard should change in color.
            

 Note: If the artwork colors do not change, make sure that Recolor Art is selected in the
                  lower-left corner of the Recolor Artwork dialog box.
               


On the left side of the Recolor Artwork dialog box, notice that the colors from the
               Pencil Colors color group are assigned to the colors in the pencil artwork. The Current Colors column shows what the color
               originally was in the pencil artwork, and an arrow to the right of each of those colors
               points to the New column, which contains what the color has become (or has been reassigned to).
            

 Note: White, black, and grays are typically preserved, or unchanged, when you assign a
                  color group.
               



Click the Hide Color Group Storage icon () to hide the color groups. Drag the dialog box by the title bar at the top so that
               you can see the artwork.
            


Click the small arrow to the right of the cream-colored bar in the Current Colors
               column (see the following figure).
            
This tells Illustrator not to change that color in the selected artwork (the pencil artwork). You can see that
               reflected in the artwork on the artboard.
            

You also might not like how the colors in the Pencil Colors group were assigned to
               your artwork. You can edit the colors in the New column in different ways, even reassigning
               current colors. That's what you'll do next.
            


Drag the lighter blue bar up, on top of the darker blue bar in the Current Colors
               column.
            

Essentially, you just told Illustrator to replace the darker blue and the lighter blue with the magenta (red) color in the New column. Illustrator assigns
               both colors using the same tint values as the original colors.
            


In the New column, drag the top yellow color box in the column down on top of the
               blue color and release the mouse button.
            

This is one way that you can reassign the group colors to the colors in the artwork.
               The colors in the New column show what you see in the artwork. If you click one of
               the colors in the New column, notice that the CMYK sliders at the bottom of the dialog
               box let you edit that one color.


Click the burgundy (red) color box in the New column (circled in the figure). Change
               the Y value (Yellow) to 100, if necessary.
            


 Tip: You can also double-click a color in the New column to edit it in the Color Picker.
               



Click the Show Color Group Storage icon () on the right side of the dialog box to show the color groups.
            


Click the Save Changes To Color Group button () in the upper-right corner of the Recolor Artwork dialog box to save the changes
               to the color group without closing the dialog box.
            


Click OK to close the Recolor Artwork dialog box. The color changes that you just
               made to the color group are saved in the Swatches panel.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.

There are many kinds of color edits that can be made to selected artwork in the Recolor
               Artwork dialog box, including reducing the number of colors, applying other colors
               (like Pantone colors), and much more. You can close the Color Guide panel group and
               the Swatches panel group.
            

 Note: To learn more, search for "Working with color groups" in Illustrator Help (Help >
                  Illustrator Help).
               



Working with Live Paint
      

 Note: To learn more about Live Paint and all that it can do, search for "Live Paint groups"
            in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
         

Live Paint lets you paint vector graphics intuitively, by automatically detecting
         and correcting gaps that might otherwise affect the application of fills and strokes.
         Paths divide the drawing surface into areas that can be colored, whether the area
         is bounded by a single path or by segments of multiple paths. Painting objects with
         Live Paint is like coloring in a coloring book or using watercolors to paint a sketch,
         and the underlying shapes are not edited.
      
Creating a Live Paint group
Next, you will paint artwork using the Live Paint Bucket tool.


Choose 4 Live Paint from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of
               the Document window.
            


With the Selection tool () selected, drag across the artwork at the top of the artboard to select it.
            

The artwork is composed of a shape and three lines that were drawn on top of the shape.


Select the Live Paint Bucket tool () from the Shape Builder tool () group in the Tools panel.
            


Click the Fill box in the Properties panel on the right to reveal a panel. Click the
               Swatches option at the top of the panel to see the swatches. Click to select the green
               swatch named "Light Green" in the original Palette Colors color group.
            


 Note: You may need to Press Esc to hide the panel.
               



Position the pointer over the first part of the shape (on the left), and click to
               convert the selected shapes to a Live Paint group.
            

You can click any of the shapes to convert it to a Live Paint group, but the shape
               you click is filled with the green color. Clicking selected shapes with the Live Paint
               Bucket tool creates a Live Paint group that you can paint with that same tool. Once
               a Live Paint group is created, the paths are fully editable, but they are treated
               like a group. Colors are automatically reapplied to new regions created when you move
               or adjust a path's shape.
            

 Tip: You can convert selected artwork to a Live Paint group by choosing Object > Live
                  Paint > Make.
               



Painting with the Live Paint Bucket tool
      
After objects are converted to a Live Paint group, you can paint them using several
         methods, which is what you'll do next.
      


Position the pointer over the area to the right of the green area, in the Live Paint
               group.
            
A red highlight appears around the shape that will be painted, and three color swatches
               appear above the pointer. The selected color (light green) is in the middle, and the
               two adjacent colors in the Swatches panel are on either side.
            



Press the right arrow key once to select the orange swatch (shown in the three swatches
               above the pointer). Click to apply the orange color to the shape.
            


 Note: As you press the arrow key to change colors, notice, in the Swatches panel, that
                  the color is highlighted. You can press the up or down arrow key, along with right
                  or left arrow keys to select a new swatch to paint with.
               



Click the Fill box in the Properties panel on the right and click to select the swatch
               named "Pink." Click in the area to the right of the orange area. See the following
               figure.
            



Click the Fill box in the Properties panel on the right and click to select the swatch
               named "Blue," and then click in the area to the right of the pink area.
            
By default, you can only paint fills with the Live Paint Bucket tool. Next, you'll
               see how to enable painting of strokes with the Live Paint Bucket tool.
            


Double-click the Live Paint Bucket tool () in the Tools panel. This opens the Live Paint Bucket Options dialog box. Select
               the Paint Strokes option and then click OK.
            


 Tip: With the live Paint Bucket tool selected in the Tools panel, you can also click the
                  Tool Options button at the top of the Properties panel to open the tool options dialog
                  box.
               



Click the Stroke box in the Properties panel () on the right, and select None () for the stroke color. Press the Escape key to hide the panel.
            



Position the pointer directly over the path extending beyond the colored areas, as
               shown in the figure. When the pointer changes to a paintbrush (), click the stroke to remove the stroke color (by applying the None swatch). Do the
               same for the two other strokes extending out.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.



Modifying a Live Paint group
When you make a Live Paint group, each path remains editable. When you move or adjust
         a path, the colors that were previously applied don't just stay where they were, like
         they do in natural media paintings or with image-editing software. Instead, the colors
         are automatically reapplied to the new regions that are formed by the intersecting
         paths. Next, you will edit paths in a Live Paint group.
      


Select the Selection tool (), and drag across the gray rectangle and brown handle at the bottom of the artboard.
               See the first part of the following figure.
            


Choose Object > Live Paint > Make.


Drag the selected group straight up so that the group and the white rectangle above
               it overlap.
            


With the Selection tool, Shift-click the white rectangle to select both objects.


Choose Object > Live Paint > Merge to add the new white shape to the Live Paint group.



Select the Live Paint Bucket tool () in the Tools panel. Click the Fill color in the Properties panel and select a lighter
               gray color. Click to paint the top part of the paintbrush. Click to select a darker
               gray color for the fill color in the Properties panel and click the overlapping area.
            



Select the Selection tool, and with the Live Paint object selected, double-click the
               Live Paint object to enter Isolation mode.
            


Click the bottom gray shape (right above the brown "handle"). Drag the top-middle
               bounding point up to resize it.
            
Notice how the color fill and stroke changes every time you release the mouse button.


 Tip: You could also edit the anchor points of the selected artwork using the Direct Selection
                  tool (), for instance. The paths are still editable, and the colors are reapplied to the
                  new regions that are formed by edited paths.
               



Choose Select > Deselect and then press the Escape key to exit Isolation mode.


Choose Object > Show All to show the end of the paintbrush that I hid in the file.
               An arrow is pointing to it in the following figure.
            


Choose View > Fit All In Window.



Choose File > Save and then choose File > Close.

Review answers


A global color is a color swatch that, when you edit it, automatically updates all
                  artwork to which it is applied. All spot colors are global; however, process colors you save as swatches
                  are global by default, but they can be either global or local.
               


You can save a color for painting other objects in your artwork by adding it to the
                  Swatches panel by doing one of the following:
               


Drag the color from a Fill box, and drop it over the Swatches panel.


Click the New Swatch button () at the bottom of the Swatches panel.
                     


Choose New Swatch from the Swatches panel menu ().
                     


Choose Create New Swatch from the Color panel menu ().
                     




A tint is a mixture of a color with white to make the color lighter. You can create a tint
                  from a global process color, like CMYK, or from a spot color.
               


You can choose color harmonies from the Color Guide panel. Color harmonies are used
                  to generate a color scheme based on a single color.
               


You use the Recolor Artwork dialog box to change the colors used in selected artwork,
                  create and edit color groups, or reassign or reduce the colors in your artwork, among
                  other functions.
               


Live Paint lets you paint vector graphics intuitively by automatically detecting and
                  correcting gaps that might otherwise affect the application of fills and strokes.
                  Paths divide the drawing surface into areas, any of which can be colored, regardless
                  of whether the area is bounded by a single path or by segments of multiple paths.

Text as a design element plays a major role in your illustrations. Like other objects,
         type can be painted, scaled, rotated, and more. In this lesson, you'll discover how
         to create basic text and interesting text effects.
      
Starting the lesson
      
You'll be adding type to a poster during this lesson, but before you begin, restore
         the default preferences for Adobe Illustrator CC. Then open the finished art file
         for this lesson to see the illustration.
      


To ensure that the tools function and the defaults are set exactly as described in
               this lesson, delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CC preferences
               file. See "Restoring default preferences" in the "Getting Started" section at the
               beginning of the book.
            

 Note: If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson to your computer
                  from your Account page, make sure to do so now. See the "Getting Started" section
                  at the beginning of the book.
               



Start Adobe Illustrator CC.



Choose File > Open. Locate the file named L8_end.ai in the Lessons > Lesson08 folder.
               Click Open.
            
You will most likely see a Missing Fonts dialog box since the file is using a specific
               Typekit font. Simply click Close in the Missing Fonts dialog box. You will learn all
               about Typekit fonts later in this lesson.
            
Leave the file open for reference later in the lesson, if you like. I closed it.


Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson08 folder,
               and select the L8_start.ai file on your hard disk. Click Open to open the file.
            
This file already has nontext components in it. You will add all of the text elements
               to complete the poster (front and back).
            



Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the Lesson08 folder,
               and name the file FoodTruck.ai. Leave the Format option set to Adobe Illustrator (ai) (macOS) or the Save As Type
               option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows) and then click Save.
            


In the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the Illustrator options at their default
               settings and then click OK.

 Note: If you don't see Reset Essentials in the Workspace menu, choose Window > Workspace
            > Essentials before choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
         

Adding type to the poster
      
Type features are some of the most powerful tools in Illustrator. You can add a single
         line of type to your artwork, create columns and rows of text like you do in Adobe
         InDesign, place text, flow text into a shape or along a path, and work with letterforms
         as graphic objects. In Illustrator, you can create text in three main ways: as point
         type, area type, and type on a path.
      
Adding text at a point
Point type is a horizontal or vertical line of text that begins where you click and expands
         as you enter characters. Each line of text is independent—the line expands or shrinks
         as you edit it but doesn't wrap to the next line unless you add a paragraph return
         or a soft return. Entering text this way is useful for adding a headline or a few
         words to your artwork. Next, you will add some text to the poster as point type.
      


Ensure that 1 Poster 1 is chosen in the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left
               corner of the Document window.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window and then press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows)
               three or so times to zoom in.
            



Choose Window > Layers to show the Layers panel. Select the layer named "Text," if
               it's not already selected.
            


Click the Properties panel tab to show it.

 Note: Selecting a layer means any content you create going forward will be on that layer.
                  You'll learn all about layers and how to use them in Lesson 9, "Organizing Your Artwork with Layers."
               



Select the Type tool () in the Tools panel on the left. Click (don't drag) in a blank space on the artboard. Some selected placeholder text, "Lorem ipsum,"
               is now on the artboard. Type Pie Oh Pie ⋅ 123 Cheese ⋅ Plus Many More!.
            

To type in the bullet points between the words, you can press Option+8 (macOS) or,
               on Windows, press Alt+0149 (numeric keypad) or Alt+8. If the bullets prove difficult,
               you can also simply add a hyphen (-) or other character.
            


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and drag the lower-right bounding point of the text down and
               to the left.
            

 Note: Scaling point type this way will stretch the text if you drag any bounding point.
                  This may result in a font size that is not a round number (12.93 pt, for instance).
               




Choose Edit > Undo Scale.


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Adding area type
Area type uses the boundaries of an object (like a rectangle) to control the flow of characters,
         either horizontally or vertically. When the text reaches a boundary, it automatically
         wraps to fit inside the defined area. Entering text in this way is useful when you
         want to create one or more paragraphs, such as for a poster or a brochure.
      
To create area type, you click with the Type tool () where you want the text and drag to create an area type object (also called a text area, text object, or type object). You can also convert an existing shape or object to a type object by clicking the
         edge of an object (or inside the object) with the Type tool. When the cursor appears,
         you can type. Next, you'll create a type object and enter more text.
      


Select the Zoom tool () and drag from left to right, across the lower-left corner of the same artboard to
               zoom in.
            


Select the Type tool (). Move the pointer into a blank area of the artboard. Click and drag down and to
               the right to create a text area that is about an inch in width; the height should
               roughly match the following figure.
            


 Tip: Filling type objects with placeholder text is a preference you can change. Choose
                  Illustrator CC > Preferences (macOS) or Edit > Preferences (Windows), select the Type
                  category, and deselect "Fill New Type Objects With Placeholder Text" to turn the option
                  off.
               

By default, type objects are filled with selected placeholder text that you can replace
               with your own.
            



With the placeholder text selected, type Sat/Sun 2pm Highview Park.
            
Notice how the text wraps horizontally to fit within the type area.



Select the Selection tool (), and drag the lower-right bounding point to the left and then back to the right
               to see how the text wraps within.
            
You can drag any of the eight bounding points on the text area to resize it, not just
               the lower right.
            

Before you continue, make sure that the text looks like you see in the figure.


Working with Auto Sizing
By default, when you create area type by dragging with the Type tool, the type area
         will not resize to fit the text within (similar to how InDesign treats text frames
         by default). If there is too much text, the text that doesn't fit will not be visible
         and will be considered overset. For each type area, you can enable a feature called
         Auto Sizing so that area type will resize to fit the text within, and that's what you'll do next.
      


With the text area selected, look at the bottom-middle bounding point and you'll see
               a widget () indicating that the type area is not set to auto size. Hover the pointer over the box at the end of the widget (the pointer
               will change []), and double-click.
            


 Note: The figure shows just before double-clicking.
               

By double-clicking the widget, you turn Auto Sizing on. As the text is edited and
               re-edited, the frame shrinks and grows vertically (only) to accommodate the changing
               amount of copy and eliminates overset text (text that won't fit) without manually
               sizing and resizing frames.
            



Select the Type tool (), and position the pointer immediately after the word "Park." Make sure you see this pointer (), not this pointer (). Click to insert the cursor. Press Return or Enter, and type Raleigh, North Carolina.
            

 Tip: If Auto Sizing is enabled for a selected type area, dragging one of the bottom bounding
                  points on the type area down disables Auto Sizing for the type area.
               


 Tip: If you double-click text with the Selection tool () or Direct Selection tool (), the Type tool becomes selected.
               


 Note: In this instance, clicking when you see this pointer () will create a new point type area.
               


The type area will expand vertically to fit the new text. If you were to double-click
               the Auto Sizing widget, Auto Sizing would be turned off for the area type. The type
               area would remain the current size no matter how much text was added.
            


Select and delete the Raleigh, North Carolina text.

Notice that the type object shrank vertically to fit around the text because Auto
               Sizing is on for the type object.
            

 Note: You could have also chosen Edit > Undo Typing to remove the text. In this lesson,
                  I just want to give you more practice selecting text.
               



Converting between area type and point type
You can easily convert between area type objects and point type objects. This can
         be useful if you type a headline by clicking (creating point type) but later want
         to resize and add more text without stretching the text inside. This method is also
         useful if you paste text from InDesign into Illustrator because text pasted from InDesign
         into Illustrator (with nothing selected) is pasted as point type. Most of the time,
         it would be better suited as an area type object so that you could flow the text within.
         Next, you will convert a type object from area type to point type.
      


With the Selection tool selected, press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, and
               drag the type object you created in the previous section over to the right side of
               the artboard. Release the mouse button and then the key to make a copy.
            


 Tip: To see the soft return, you can show hidden characters by choosing Type > Show Hidden
                  Characters.
               



Move the pointer over the type area to the left, and double-click to insert the cursor
               and switch to the Type tool. Press Command+A (macOS) or Ctrl+A (Windows) to select
               all of the text in the type area; then type AUG 19th/20th.
            

 Tip: Clicking once in text inserts the cursor. Clicking twice in text selects a word.
                  Clicking three times selects the entire paragraph in Illustrator.
               



Click right before the "1" in "19th." Press Backspace or Delete to remove the space
               between "AUG" and "19th."
            


Press Shift+Enter (Shift+Return) to add a soft return.



Press Esc to select the Selection tool ().
            


Move the pointer over the annotator () off the right edge of the type object. A filled end on the annotator indicates that
               it's area type. When the pointer changes (), click once to see the message "Double-click to convert to Point Type." Double-click
               the annotator to convert the area type to point type.
            

 Tip: With a type object selected, you can also choose Type > Convert To Point Type or
                  Convert To Area Type, depending on what the selected text area is.
               


The annotator end should now be hollow (), indicating that it is a point type object. If you were to resize the bounding box,
               the text would scale as well.
            



Press the Shift key, and drag the lower-right bounding point down and to the right
               until the text just fits between the line above and the line below. Release the mouse
               button and then the key.
            
Because the text is point type, it stretches when the type area is resized. Pressing
               the Shift key is very important because otherwise the text would most likely be distorted.
            


Choose File > Save.


Importing a plain-text file
You can import text into artwork from a file that was created in another application.
         As of the writing of this book, Illustrator supports DOC, DOCX, RTF, Plain text (ASCII)
         with ANSI, Unicode, Shift JIS, GB2312, Chinese Big 5, Cyrillic, GB18030, Greek, Turkish,
         Baltic, and Central European encoding. One of the advantages of importing text from
         a file, rather than copying and pasting it, is that imported text retains its character
         and paragraph formatting (by default). For example, text from an RTF file retains
         its font and style specifications in Illustrator, unless you choose to remove formatting
         when you import the text. In this section, you'll place text from a plain-text file
         into your design.
      

 Tip: You can add placeholder text to your document if you don't have the final text ready
            yet. With the cursor in a type object or in text on a path, choose Type > Fill With
            Placeholder Text.
         



Choose 2 Poster 2 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window.
            



Choose File > Place. In the Lessons > Lesson08 folder, select the L8_text.txt file.
               In the Place dialog box on macOS, click the Options button to see the import options,
               if necessary. Select Show Import Options, and click Place.
            
In the Text Import Options dialog box that appears, you can set some options prior
               to importing text.
            


Leave the default settings and then click OK.

 Tip: You can place text into an existing type area as well.
               



Move the loaded text icon onto the aqua guide. When the word "Guide" appears, click
               and drag down and to the right and then release the mouse button. Use the figure as
               a guide.
            

If you were to simply click with the loaded text pointer, a type object would be created
               that was smaller than the size of the artboard.
            



With the Selection tool (), drag the bottom bounding point of the type object up until you see an overset text
               icon () in the out port. I didn't need to.
            

 Tip: When you place (File > Place) RTF (Rich Text Format) or Word documents (DOC or DOCX)
                  in Illustrator, the Microsoft Word Options dialog box appears. In the Microsoft Word
                  Options dialog box, you can select to keep the generated table of contents, footnotes
                  and endnotes, and index text, and you can even choose to remove the formatting of
                  the text before you place it (the styles and formatting are brought in from Word by
                  default).
               



Threading text

When working with area type (not point type), each area type object contains an in port and an out port. The ports enable you to link type objects and flow text between them.
      
An empty out port indicates that all the text is visible and that the type object
         isn't linked. An arrow in a port indicates that the type object is linked to another
         type object. A red plus sign () in an out port indicates that the object contains additional text, which is called
         overflow text. To show all of the overflow text, you can thread the text to another type object,
         resize the type object, or adjust the text. To thread, or continue, text from one object to the next, you have to link the objects. Linked
         type objects can be of any shape; however, the text must be entered in an object or
         along a path, not as point type (by simply clicking to create text).
      
Next, you will thread text between two type objects.
      


With the Selection tool (), click the out port (larger box) in the lower-right corner of the type object that
               has the red plus sign in it ().
            

The pointer changes to a loaded text icon () when you move it away.
            

 Note: It may be difficult to click the out port because of the guides. You can always zoom
                  in, remembering to zoom out again for the next steps.
               


 Note: If you double-click an out port, a new type object appears. If this happens, you
                  can either drag the new object where you would like it to be positioned or choose
                  Edit > Undo Link Threaded Text, and the loaded text icon reappears.
               



Position the pointer in the lower-left area of the artboard and click. An area type
               object is created that is the same size as the original.
            


 Tip: Another way to thread text between objects is to select an area type object, select
                  the object (or objects) you want to link to, and then choose Type > Threaded Text
                  > Create.
               


 Tip: You can split the threaded text so that each type area is no longer connected to
                  the next by selecting one of the threaded text areas (but the text remains) by choosing
                  Type > Threaded Text > Remove Threading. Choosing Type > Threaded Text > Release Selection
                  will break the thread to the selected type area and remove the text.
               

With the second type object still selected, notice the line connecting the two type
               objects. This line is the thread that tells you that the two objects are connected. If you don't see this thread (line),
               choose View > Show Text Threads.
            
The out port () of the top type object on the artboard and the in port () of the bottom type object on the artboard have small arrows in them indicating how
               the text is flowing from one to the other.
            


Click the top type object, and drag the bottom-middle point up to make it shorter.

The text will flow between the type objects. If you delete the second type object,
               the text is pulled back into the original object as overflow text. Although not visible,
               the overflow text is not deleted.
            


Formatting type
      
You can format text using character and paragraph formatting, apply fill and stroke
         attributes to it, and change its transparency. You can apply these changes to one
         character, a range of characters, or all characters in a type object that you select.
         As you'll soon see, selecting the type object, rather than selecting the text inside,
         lets you apply formatting options to all of the text in the object, including options
         from the Character and Paragraph panels, fill and stroke attributes, and transparency
         settings.
      
In this section, you'll discover how to change text attributes, such as size and font,
         and later learn how to save that formatting as text styles.
      
Changing font family and font style

 Note: The Creative Cloud desktop application must be installed on your computer, and you
            must have an Internet connection to initially sync fonts. The Creative Cloud desktop
            application is installed when you install your first Creative Cloud application, like
            Illustrator.
         

In this section, you'll apply a font to text. Aside from applying local fonts to text
         from your machine, Creative Cloud subscribers can apply Typekit fonts that have been
         synced with their computer. Typekit is a subscription service offering access to a
         library of fonts for use in desktop applications such as InDesign or Microsoft Word
         and on websites. A Typekit Portfolio plan is included with your Creative Cloud subscription,
         and trial Creative Cloud members have access to a selection of fonts from Typekit
         for web and desktop use. The fonts appear alongside other locally installed fonts
         in the fonts list in Illustrator, as you'll soon see. By default, Typekit is turned
         on in the Creative Cloud desktop application (version 1.9 and later) so that it can
         sync fonts and make them available in your desktop applications.
      

 Note: For questions about Typekit font licensing, visit https://helpx.adobe.com/typekit/using/font-licensing.html. For more information on working with Typekit fonts, visit https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/add-fonts-typekit.html.
         

Sync Typekit fonts
Next, you'll select and sync Typekit fonts to your machine so that you can use them
         in Illustrator.
      



Ensure that the Creative Cloud for desktop application is launched and you are signed
               in with your Adobe ID (this requires an Internet connection).
            

 Note: To learn about the Creative Cloud for desktop application, visit https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/desktop-app.html.
               



In Illustrator, choose Select > Deselect.


Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) a few times to zoom in to the text in
               the center of the artboard.
            


Select the Type tool () in the Tools panel, move the pointer over the text and click to insert the cursor
               in either threaded type object. Choose Select > All or press Command+A (macOS) or
               Ctrl+A (Windows) to select all of the text in both threaded type objects.
            



In the Properties panel to the right of the document, click the arrow to the right
               of the Font Family menu in the Properties panel, and notice the fonts that appear
               in the menu. These fonts are those that are installed locally.
            
In the font menu, an icon appears to the right of the font names in the list indicating
               what type of font it is (Tk is Typekit, O is OpenType, TT is TrueType, and a is Adobe Postscript).
            


Click the Add Fonts From Typekit button.
A browser will open and should open the Typekit.com website and log you in using your Adobe ID. If you do not have an Internet connection,
               you can choose any other font in the font menu in Illustrator instead.
            

 Note: If you are taken to the Typekit.com home page, you can simply click the Browse option on the page.
               



Once the Typekit.com website is open in your browser, click the Show Filters button if you don't see the
               Classification options on the right side of the page. Click the Sans Serif option
               in the Classification options to sort the fonts.
            


Hover over any font. If you wanted to use that font, you would click to explore which
               styles (bold, italic, etc.) you would sync.
            



Type Roboto in the Search Typekit field toward the top of the page. Choose Roboto from the results
               menu that appears.
            

 Note: Click the search glass () or press Enter or Return to search the site for the Roboto font if the results menu
                  doesn't appear, and select Roboto on the page that opens.
               




In the page that appears, click the Sync button to the right of Roboto Light, Roboto
               Italic, Roboto Bold, and Roboto Condensed Regular.
            


 Tip: The fonts are synced to all computers where you've installed the Creative Cloud application
                  and logged in. To view fonts, open the Creative Cloud desktop application, and click
                  the Assets > Fonts panel.
               



After syncing the Roboto font styles, follow the same process by searching for the
               font named Colt at the top of the page showing. When the Colt page opens, click the
               Sync button for Colt Bold. You can close the browser and return to Illustrator. Once
               the fonts are synced to your computer (be patient, it may take some time), you may
               begin to use them.
            


Apply fonts to text in Illustrator
Now that the Typekit fonts are synced with your machine, you can use them in any application,
         and that's what you'll do next.
      


Back in Illustrator, with the threaded text still selected, click the arrow to the
               right of the Font Family menu in the Properties panel to the right of the document.
               Click the Apply Typekit Filter button () to filter the font list and show only the Typekit fonts you just synced.
            


 Note: You may see other Typekit fonts in your menu (aside from the Roboto and Colt fonts),
                  and that's okay.
               



Move the pointer over the fonts in the menu, and you should see a preview of the font
               the pointer is over, applied to the selected text. Click the arrow to the left of
               Roboto in the menu, and choose Light.

 Tip: You could also use the arrow keys (Up and Down) to navigate the list of fonts. When
                  the font you want is chosen, you can press Enter or Return to apply it.
               



Choose 1 Poster 1 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window.
            



With the Selection tool () selected, click the "AUG 19th/20th" text toward the bottom of the artboard to select
               the type object. Press the Shift key and click the type object to the right to select
               both.
            
If you want to apply the same font to all of the text in a point type or area type
               object, you can simply select the object, not the text, and then apply the font.
            


With the type objects selected, click the font name in the Properties panel (I see
               Myriad Pro). Begin typing the letters col.
            

A menu appears beneath where you are typing. Illustrator filters through the list
               of fonts and displays the font names that contain "col," regardless of where "col"
               is in the font name and regardless of whether it's capitalized. The Typekit font filter
               is still turned on from before, so you will turn it off next.
            

 Tip: With the cursor in the font name field, you can also click the X on the right side
                  of the Font Family field to remove the current font shown.
               



Click the Clear Filter button () in the menu that is showing to see all of the available fonts, not just Typekit
               fonts. In the menu that appears beneath where you are typing, move the pointer over
               the fonts in the list. Illustrator shows a live font preview of the text. Click to
               select Colt Bold to apply the font.
            


 Tip: You can click the Eyeglass icon () to the left of the Font Name field and choose to search the first word only. You
                  can also open the Character panel (Window > Type > Character) and search for a font
                  by typing the name.
               



Click away from the content, in a blank area, to deselect all.


Fixing missing fonts 
To learn how to fix missing fonts, check out the video Fixing Missing Fonts that is a part of the Web Edition. For more information, see the "Web Edition" section
         of "Getting Started" at the beginning of the book.
      
Changing font size
By default, typeface size is measured in points (a point equals 1/72 of an inch).
         In this section, you will change the font size of text and also see what happens to
         point type that is scaled.
      


Click to select the type object that contains the text "SAT/SUN..."


Choose 36 pt from the Font Size menu in the Properties panel.


 Tip: You can dynamically change the font size of selected text using keyboard shortcuts.
                  To increase the font size in increments of 2 points, press Command+Shift+> (macOS)
                  or Ctrl+Shift+> (Windows). To reduce the font size, press Command+Shift+< (macOS)
                  or Ctrl+Shift+< (Windows).
               



Click the Down arrow to the left of font size field in the Properties panel twice
               to make the font size 34.
            


Choose View > Zoom In to see all of the text in the selected type object.



Drag the lower-right corner of the type object to make it bigger. See the figure.


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Double-click in the "AUG 19th/20th" text to switch to the Type tool and insert the
               cursor; then drag across the "19th/20th" text to select it.
            
Looking in the Character section of the Properties panel, you'll see that the font
               size is not a whole number. That's because you scaled the point type earlier by dragging.
            


Select the value in the Font Size field, and type 20. The idea is to make the "19th/20th" text as wide as the "AUG" text. Press Enter
               or Return.
            

 Note: If you need, change the font size so the "19th/20th" text is as wide as the "AUG"
                  text.
               




Select the Selection tool, and pressing the Shift key, drag a corner of the AUG type
               object to make it (and the text within) larger. Drag it into position like you see
               in the figure.
            



Changing font color
You can change the appearance of text by applying fills, strokes, and more. In this
         section, you'll simply change the fill of selected text by selecting type objects.
         Know that you can also select text with the Type tool to apply different color fills
         and strokes to text.
      


With the Selection tool () selected and with the AUG 19th/20th type object still selected, press the Shift
               key, and click the text to the right that begins with "SAT/SUN...."
            


Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel. With the Swatches option ()selected in the panel that appears, select the swatch named "Pink."
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


Choose File > Save.


Changing additional character formatting
      
In Illustrator you can change a lot of text attributes besides font, font size, and
         color. Like in InDesign, text attributes are split between character and paragraph
         formatting and can be found in the Properties panel, Control panel, and two main panels:
         the Character panel and the Paragraph panel.
      
The Character panel, which you can access by clicking More Options () in the Character section of the Properties panel or by choosing Window > Type >
         Character, contains formatting for selected text such as font, font size, kerning,
         and more. In this section, you will apply some of the many possible attributes to
         experiment with the different ways you can format text.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, click the SAT/SUN type object.
            


In the Properties panel, change Leading () to 63 pt.
            

Leading is the vertical space between lines of text. Adjusting the leading can be
               useful for fitting text into a text area. In this case, it adds space between the
               lines of text so the text fits better in the decorative lines on the artboard.
            


Drag both type objects into position like you see in the following figure.



Select the Type tool and drag across the word "PM" in "2 PM" to select it.


With the text selected, click More Options () in the Character section of the Properties panel to show the Character panel (circled
               in the following figure). Click the Superscript button () to superscript the word.
            


 Note: If the text wraps differently in the type object, select the Selection tool and drag
                  the right, middle point of the type object left or right to match the figure.
               



Select the Selection tool (), and click the type object that contains the "AUG 19th/20th" text.
            


Choose Edit > Copy and then Edit > Paste to paste a copy.



Double-click the text to insert the cursor. Press Command+A (macOS) or Ctrl+A (Windows)
               to select all of the text. Type CORRAL in capital letters.
            
You'll use this text later in the lesson when you modify text with the Touch Type
               tool.
            


Changing paragraph formatting
As with character formatting, you can set paragraph formatting, such as alignment
         or indenting, before you enter new type or change the appearance of existing type.
         Paragraph formatting applies to entire paragraphs rather than just selected content.
         Most of this type of formatting can be done in the Properties panel, Control panel,
         or Paragraph panel. You can access the Paragraph panel by clicking More Options () in the Paragraph section of the Properties panel or by choosing Window > Type >
         Paragraph.
      


Choose 2 Poster 2 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window.
            


With the Type tool () selected, click in the threaded text. Press Command+A (macOS) or Ctrl+A (Windows)
               to select all of the text between the two type objects.
            


Click the Justify With Last Line Aligned Right button () in the Paragraph section of the Properties panel to align the text to the right.
            



With the text selected, click More Options () in the Paragraph section of the Properties panel to show the Paragraph panel.
            



Change Space After Paragraph () to 6 pt in the Paragraph panel.
            
Setting a spacing value after paragraphs, rather than pressing the Enter or Return
               key, is useful for maintaining consistency and ease of editing later.
            


Press the Esc key to hide the Paragraph panel.


Choose 18 pt from the Font Size menu in the Properties panel.


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.

Modifying text with the Touch Type tool
Using the Touch Type tool (), you can modify the properties of a character, such as size, scale, and rotation,
         using a mouse cursor or touch controls. This is a very visual (and personally more
         fun) way of applying the character formatting properties: baseline shift, horizontal
         and vertical scale, rotation, and kerning.
      


Choose 1 Poster 1 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window.
            



Click the Layers panel tab to show the Layers panel. Click the visibility column to
               the left of the layer named "Background."
            


Click the Properties panel tab to show that panel again.


With the Selection tool (), click to select the "CORRAL" type object you created earlier and change the font
               size to 118 pt in the Properties panel to the right. Drag it into position like you see in the following
               figure.
            



Choose View > Zoom In a few times.


Select the Touch Type tool () by pressing and holding down on the Type tool () in the Tools panel and then selecting the Touch Type tool.
            
After selecting the Touch Type tool, a message briefly appears at the top of the Document
               window telling you to click a character to select it.
            


Click the first letter "R" in "CORRAL" to select it.
A box with a dot above it appears around the letter after you select it. The different
               points around the box allow you to adjust the character in different ways.
            



Click and drag the upper-right corner of the box away from the center to make the
               letter a little larger. Stop dragging when you see roughly 105% for H. Scale and V.
               Scale in the measurement label.
            

Notice that width and height change proportionally together. You just adjusted the
               horizontal scale and the vertical scale for the letter "R." If you were to look in
               the Character panel (Window > Type > Character), you would see that the Horizontal
               Scale and Vertical Scale values are roughly 105%.
            


Position the pointer over the rotate handle (the little circle above the letter "R").
               When the pointer changes (), drag clockwise until you see approximately -17° in the measurement label.
            



Drag the selected letter "R" down and to the left a little.

 Tip: You can also nudge a selected letter with the arrow keys or press Shift+arrow key
                  to move the letter in bigger increments.
               


By dragging a letter up or down, you are adjusting the baseline shift. Make sure the
               letter covers the brown path below it.
            

 Note: There are limits to how far you can drag in any direction. Those limits are based
                  on the kerning and baseline shift value limits.
               



Click to select the second letter "R" to the right. Drag the letter from its center
               to the left a little to close the gap between the two Rs.
            



Resizing and reshaping type objects
You can create unique type object shapes by reshaping them using a variety of methods,
         including adding columns to area type objects or reshaping type objects using the
         Direct Selection tool. To start this section, you'll copy some of the text at the
         bottom of the first artboard to the second artboard so you have more text to work
         with.
      


Choose View > Fit All In Window.


Select the Selection tool (). Press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key and drag a copy of the type object
               that contains the text "AUG 19th/20th" anywhere onto the artboard on the right. Release
               the mouse button and then the key.
            



Press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, and drag the type object that contains
               the text "SAT/SUN..." anywhere onto the artboard on the right. Release the mouse button
               and then the key.
            


Drag the type objects into position like you see in the following figure.

The threaded text will overlap the text. You'll fix that shortly.


Creating columns of text
      
You can easily create columns and rows of text by using the Type > Area Type Options
         command. This can be useful for creating a single type object with multiple columns
         or for organizing text, such as a table or simple chart, for instance. Next, you'll
         add a few columns to a type object.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


With the Selection tool () selected, click the text above the truck to select the top type object.
            


 Tip: To learn more about the large number of options in the Area Type Options dialog box,
                  search for "Creating Text" in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
               



Choose Type > Area Type Options. In the Area Type Options dialog box, change Number
               to 2 in the Columns section, and select Preview. Click OK.
            
The text in the top type object is now flowing between two columns.



Drag the bottom-middle bounding point up and down to see the text flow between the
               columns and the threaded text below it. Drag so that the text overlaps the truck artwork.
            


Reshaping type objects
In this next section, you'll reshape and resize a type object to better fit text.


With the Selection tool () selected, click the text in the type object at the bottom of the artboard. Drag
               the right-middle handle to the left. Stop dragging when the right edge of the type
               object is aligned with the rear of the truck.
            



Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) a few times to zoom in to the selected
               type object.
            


Select the Direct Selection tool (). Click the lower-right corner of the type object to select the anchor point.
            


Drag that point to the left to adjust the shape of the path so the text goes around
               the "SAT/SUN..." text. As you drag, press the Shift key. Release the mouse button
               and then the Shift key when finished.
            



Creating and applying text styles

 Note: If you place a Microsoft Word document and choose to keep the formatting, the styles
            used in the Word document may be brought into the Illustrator document and may appear
            in the Paragraph Styles panel.
         

Styles allow you to format text consistently and are helpful when text attributes
         need to be updated globally. Once a style is created, you only need to edit the saved
         style, and then all text formatted with that style is updated. Illustrator provides
         two types of text styles.
      


Paragraph—Retains character and paragraph attributes and applies them to an entire paragraph.
            


Character—Retains character attributes and applies them to selected text.
            


Creating and applying a paragraph style
You'll start by creating a paragraph style for the body copy.


Choose View > Fit All In Window.


Select the Type tool () by pressing and holding down on the Touch Type tool () in the Tools panel and then selecting the Type tool. Insert the cursor anywhere
               in the threaded text.
            
By inserting the cursor in text when you create a paragraph style, the formatting
               attributes from the paragraph that the cursor is in are saved.
            



Choose Window > Type > Paragraph Styles, and click the Create New Style button () at the bottom of the Paragraph Styles panel.
            
This creates a new paragraph style in the panel, called "Paragraph Style 1." The character
               and paragraph formatting from the paragraph with the cursor in it has been "captured"
               and saved in this new style.
            


Double-click directly on the style name "Paragraph Style 1" in the list of styles.
               Change the name of the style to Body, and press Enter or Return to edit the name inline.
            

By double-clicking the style to edit the name, you are also applying the new style
               to the paragraph (where the cursor is). This means that if you edit the Body paragraph
               style, this paragraph will update as well.
            


With the cursor in the text, choose Select > All to select all of the text.


Click the Body style in the Paragraph Styles panel to apply the style to the text.

The text should not change in appearance since the formatting for all of the text
               is currently the same.
            


 Note: As you saw after this step, the text did not change in appearance. Right now, you
                  are simply doing a little extra work to allow you to work faster later. If you decide
                  to change the "Body" style formatting later, all of the text that is currently selected
                  will update to match the style.
               



Select the Selection tool (), and click the text on the first artboard that begins with "Pie Oh Pie...." Click
               the Body style in the Paragraph Styles panel to apply the style to the text.
            


With the "Pie Oh Pie..." type object selected, change the font size to 24 in the Properties panel. Click the Fill color box, make sure the Swatches options
               is selected in the panel that appears, and select the Pink color.
            



Drag the text down into position on the artboard, like you see in the figure.


Editing a paragraph style
      
After creating a paragraph style, you can easily edit the style formatting. Then anywhere
         the style has been applied, the formatting will be updated automatically. Next, you'll
         edit the Body style to see firsthand why paragraph styles can save you time and maintain
         consistency.
      


Choose View > Fit All In Window. With the Selection tool selected, click one of the
               threaded type objects.
            



Double-click to the right of the style name "Body" in the Paragraph Styles panel list
               to open the Paragraph Style Options dialog box, select the Indents And Spacing category
               on the left side of the dialog box, and change the following:
            


Alignment: Left

 Tip: There are many more options for working with paragraph styles, most of which are
                        found in the Paragraph Styles panel menu, including duplicating, deleting, and editing
                        paragraph styles. To learn more about these options, search for "paragraph styles"
                        in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
                     



Since Preview is selected by default, you can move the dialog box out of the way to
               see the text change everywhere that the Body style is applied.
            


Click OK.


Leave the type object selected and choose File > Save.


Creating and applying a character style
Character styles, unlike paragraph styles, can be applied only to selected text and
         can contain only character formatting. Next, you will create a character style from
         text styling within the columns of text.
      


Choose View > Zoom In to zoom in to the selected type object.


Using the Type tool (), in the first column, select "Food Truck Rodeo."
            


Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel, and select the swatch named Brown.
               Choose Italic from the Font Style menu.
            



In the Paragraph Styles panel group, click the Character Styles panel tab.
            


In the Character Styles panel, Option-click (macOS) or Alt-click (Windows) the Create
               New Style button () at the bottom of the Character Styles panel.
            

Option-clicking (macOS) or Alt-clicking (Windows) the Create New Style button in a
               Styles panel lets you edit the style options before it is added to the panel.
            


In the dialog box that opens, change the following options:


Style Name: EventName


Add To My Library: Deselected




Click OK.
The style records the attributes applied to your selected text.


With the text still selected, click the style named "EventName" in the Character Styles
               panel to assign the style to that text so that it will update if the style formatting
               changes.
            


 Note: If you apply the character style and a plus appears next to the style name, you can
                  Option-click (macOS) or Alt-click (Windows) the style name to apply it.
               



In the rest of the text, anytime you see the text "Food Truck Rodeo," select it, and
               click the EventName style in the Character Styles panel to apply it.
            


 Note: You must select the entire phrase "Food Truck Rodeo," rather than just placing the
                  cursor in the text.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.


Editing a character style
      
After creating a character style, you can easily edit the style formatting, and, anywhere
         that style is applied, the formatting will be updated automatically.
      



Double-click to the right of the EventName style name in the Character Styles panel
               (not the style name itself). In the Character Style Options dialog box, click the
               Character Color category on the left side of the dialog box, and change the following:
            


Character Color: Black


Add To My Library: Deselected


Preview: Selected




Click OK.



Sampling text formatting
Using the Eyedropper tool (), you can quickly sample type attributes and copy them to text without having to
         create a type style.
      


Choose 1 Poster 1 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window.
            


With the Type tool () selected, click in the blank area above the "CORRAL" text. Type FOOD TRUCK RODEO.
            



Click the new text three times to select it.
The text you type may be italic, which means the character style named EventName is
               applied.
            


Select the Eyedropper tool () in the Tools panel, and click the "C" in the "CORRAL" text. Be careful not to click
               either letter "R" because all of the text modifications you applied with the touch
               Type tool would also be sampled.
            

This applies the formatting from the "CORRAL" text to the selected text.


Change the font size to 55 in the Properties panel to the right of the document.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.
You'll work with the "FOOD TRUCK..." text shortly.


Wrapping text
In Illustrator, you can easily wrap text around objects, such as type objects, imported
         images, and vector artwork, to avoid text running over those objects or to create
         interesting design effects. Next, you'll wrap text around part of the artwork. In
         Illustrator, like InDesign, you apply text wrap to the content that the text will
         wrap around.
      


Choose 2 Poster 2 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window.
            


Select the Selection tool (), and click the ice cream truck artwork.
            



Choose Object > Text Wrap > Make. Click OK if a dialog box appears.
To wrap text around an object, that object must be in the same layer as the text that
               will wrap around it, and the object must also be located above the text in the layer
               hierarchy.
            



With the truck selected, choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front.

 Note: Your text may wrap differently, and that's okay.
               

The truck should now be on top of the text in the stacking order and the text is wrapping
               around the ice cream truck artwork.
            


Choose Object > Text Wrap > Text Wrap Options. In the Text Wrap Options dialog box,
               change Offset to 20 pt, and select Preview to see the change. Click OK.
            

You may see a red plus in the bottom type object now. The text is flowing around the
               truck artwork, and some was pushed into the bottom type object. In the real world,
               you would need to "copyfit" the text by changing appearance properties like font size
               and leading or editing the text.
            


Warping text
You can create some great design effects by warping text into different shapes using
         envelopes. You can make an envelope out of an object on your artboard, or you can
         use a preset warp shape or a mesh grid as an envelope. As you explore warping with
         envelopes, you'll also discover that you can use envelopes on any object except graphs,
         guides, or linked objects.
      
Reshaping text with a preset envelope warp

 Note: For more information about envelopes, see "Reshape using envelopes" in Illustrator
            Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
         

Illustrator comes with a series of preset warp shapes that you can warp text with.
         Next, you'll apply one of the preset warp shapes that Illustrator provides.
      


Choose 1 Poster 1 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the
               Document window.
            


Click the "FOOD TRUCK RODEO" type object with the Selection tool to select it.


Choose Object > Envelope Distort > Make With Warp.


In the Warp Options dialog box that appears, select Preview. The text appears as an
               arc, by default. Make sure Arc Upper is chosen in the Style menu. Drag the Bend, Horizontal,
               and Vertical Distortion sliders to see the effect on the text. When you are finished
               experimenting, drag both Distortion sliders to 0%, make sure that Bend is 30%, and then click OK.
            



Editing the envelope warp
If you want to make any changes, you can edit the text and shape that make up the
         envelope warp object separately. Next, you will edit the text and then the warp shape.
      



With the envelope object still selected, click the Edit Contents button () at the top of the Properties panel.
            


Select the Type tool (), and move the pointer over the warped text. Notice that the unwarped text appears
               in blue. Double-click the word "RODEO" to select it. Press Delete or Backspace twice
               to remove the "RODEO" text and the space before it.
            

You can also edit the preset shape, which is what you'll do next.

 Tip: If you double-click with the Selection tool instead of with the Type tool, you enter
                  Isolation mode. This is another way to edit the text within the envelope warp object.
                  Press the Escape key to exit Isolation mode if that is the case.
               



Select the Selection tool (), and make sure that the envelope object is still selected. Click the Edit Envelope
               button () at the top of the Properties panel.
            

 Tip: To take the text out of the warped shape, select the text with the Selection tool,
                  and choose Object > Envelope Distort > Release. This gives you two objects: the type
                  object and an arc upper shape.
               



Click the Warp Options button in the Properties panel to show the same Warp Options
               dialog box you saw when you first applied the warp. Change the Bend to 20%, make sure that H (horizontal) Distortion is 0 and V (vertical) Distortion is 0,
               and click OK.
            

 Note: The warp object will most likely scale smaller when you edit the Warp Options. That's
                  due to editing the text within.
               




With the Selection tool, Shift-drag a corner to make envelope object (warped text)
               larger. Drag it into the approximate center of the poster, making sure to closely
               match the position you see in the figure.
            



Working with type on a path
In addition to having text in point and type areas, you can have type along a path.
         Text can flow along the edge of an open or closed path and can lead to some really
         creative ways to display text.
      
Creating type on a path
In this section, you'll add some text to an open path.


With the Selection tool (), select the brown curved path below the two trucks.
            


Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) a few times to zoom in to it.


Select the Type tool () and position the cursor over the middle of the path to see an insertion point with
               an intersecting wavy path () (see the figure). Click when this cursor appears.
Placeholder text is added to the path, and it starts where you clicked. Your text
               may have different formatting than you see in the previous figure and that's okay.
               Also, the stroke attributes of the path change to None.
            



Choose Window > Type > Paragraph Styles to open the Paragraph Styles panel. Click
               the [Normal Paragraph Style] to apply the style. Close the panel.
            

 Note: You may see less text on the path and that's okay.
               



Type Over 30 Local food truck vendors. The new text follows the path.
            


Press Command+A (macOS) or Ctrl+A (Windows) to select all of the text.


In the Properties panel to the right of the document, change the following formatting
               options:
            


Fill color: Pink


Font Family: Roboto


Font Style: Bold


Font Size: 40 pt





Choose Type > Change Case > Upper Case.


Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) to zoom in further.

 Tip: With the path or the text on the path selected, you can choose Type > Type On A Path
                  > Type On A Path Options to set more options.
               



Select the Selection tool, and position the pointer over the line on the left edge
               of the text (just to the left of the "O" in "Over"). When you see this cursor (), click and drag to the left, trying to center the text as best you can on the path.
               Use the following figure as a guide.
            
From where you click a path to the end of the path is where the text can flow. If
               you align the text left, center, or right, it's aligned within that area on the path.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Creating type on a closed path
Next, you'll add text around a circle and explore some of the text on a path options
         available.
      


Press Command+0 (macOS) or Ctrl+0 (Windows) to fit the artboard in the Document window.


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and zoom in to the white circle toward the top of the artboard
               (above the "FOOD TRUCK" text).
            



Select the Type tool (), and position the pointer over the top edge of the white circle. The Type cursor
               () changes to a Type cursor with a circle (). This indicates that if you click (don't click), text will be placed inside of the circle, creating a type object in the shape of a circle.
            
Instead of adding text to the inside of a shape, you want to add text to the path,
               which is what you'll do next.
            



While pressing the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, position the pointer over
               the top of the white circle (use the figure as a guide). The insertion point with
               an intersecting wavy path () appears. Click and placeholder text that is selected, appears.
            


 Note: Instead of pressing the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key to allow the Type tool
                  to type on a path, you can select the Type On A Path tool () by holding down the Type tool in the Tools panel.
               



Type CELEBRATING LOCAL in all caps.
            


Click three times on the text to select it. Change the font size to 16 pt and the font to Roboto Bold (if it isn't already).
            
Next, you'll edit the type on a path options for the text.



Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel. With the path type object selected, choose Type > Type On A
               Path > Type On A Path Options. In the Type On A Path Options dialog box, select Preview,
               and change Spacing to 20 pt.
            

 Note: To learn about the Type On A Path options like "Flip," search for "Creating type
                  on a path" in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
               



Click OK.


Move the pointer over the line on the left end of the word "CELEBRATING." That line
               you see is called a bracket. When you see this cursor (), with an arrow pointing to the left, drag down and to the left around the circle in a counterclockwise fashion. That
               moves the end of the text, giving you room to move the beginning. See the first two parts of the
               following figure.
            

 Note: Brackets appear at the beginning of the type, at the end of the path, and at the
                  midpoint between the start and end brackets. All of these brackets can be adjusted
                  to reposition the text in the path.
               



Move the pointer over the line on the left end of the word "CELEBRATING" again. When
               you see this cursor (), with an arrow pointing to the right, drag down and to the left around the circle just a little in a counterclockwise
               fashion. That moves the beginning of the text. See the last part of the following figure.
            



Creating text outlines
Converting text to outlines means converting text into vector shapes that you can edit and manipulate as you would any other graphic object. Text
         outlines are useful for changing the look of large display type, but they are rarely
         useful for body text or other type at small sizes. The file recipient doesn't need
         to have your fonts installed to open and view the file correctly if you convert all
         text to outlines.
      
When you create outlines from text, you should consider that text is no longer editable.
         Also, bitmap fonts and outline-protected fonts cannot be converted to outlines, and
         outlining text that is less than 10 points in size is not recommended. When type is
         converted to outlines, the type loses its hints—instructions built into outline fonts to adjust their shape to display or print optimally
         at many sizes. You must also convert all type in a selection to outlines; you cannot
         convert a single letter within a type object. Next, you will convert the main heading
         to outlines.

Review answers


The following methods can be used for creating text:


With the Type tool (), click the artboard and start typing when the cursor appears. A point type object
                        is created to accommodate the text.
                     


With the Type tool, drag to create a text area. Type when a cursor appears.


With the Type tool, click a path or closed shape to convert it to text on a path,
                        or click in a text area. Option-clicking (macOS) or Alt-clicking (Windows) when crossing
                        over the stroke of a closed path creates text around the shape.
                     




The Touch Type tool () allows you to visually edit certain character formatting options for individual
                  characters in text. You can edit the character rotation, kerning, baseline shift,
                  and horizontal and vertical scale of text and the text remains editable.
               


Overflow text is text that does not fit within an area type object or path. A red
                  plus sign () in an out port indicates that the object contains additional text.
               


Text threading allows you to flow text from one object to another by linking type
                  objects. Linked type objects can be of any shape; however, the text must be entered
                  in an area or along a path (not at a point).
               


A character style can be applied to selected text only. A paragraph style is applied
                  to an entire paragraph. Paragraph styles are best for indents, margins, and line spacing.
               


Converting text to outlines eliminates the need to send the fonts along with the Illustrator
                  file when sharing with others and makes it possible to add effects to type that aren't
                  possible when the type is still editable (live).

Layers let you organize your work into distinct levels that can be edited and viewed
         individually or together. Every Adobe Illustrator CC document has at least one layer.
         Creating multiple layers in your artwork lets you easily control how artwork is printed,
         displayed, selected, and edited.
      
Starting the lesson
      
In this lesson, you'll organize the artwork for a real estate app design as you explore
         the various ways to use the Layers panel.
      


To ensure that the tools function and the defaults are set exactly as described in
               this lesson, delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CC preferences
               file. See "Restoring default preferences" in the "Getting Started" section at the
               beginning of the book.
            

 Note: If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson to your computer
                  from your Account page, make sure to do so now. See the "Getting Started" section
                  at the beginning of the book.
               



Start Adobe Illustrator CC.



Choose File > Open, and open the L9_end.ai file in the Lessons > Lesson09 folder,
               located on your hard disk.
            


Choose View > Fit All In Window.


Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.

 Note: If you don't see Reset Essentials in the Workspace menu, choose Window > Workspace
                  > Essentials before choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
               



Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson09 folder,
               and select the L9_start.ai file on your hard disk. Click Open.
            
The Missing Fonts dialog box may appear, indicating that a font (ProximaNova) was used in the file that Illustrator
               can't find on your machine. The file uses a Typekit font that you most likely don't
               have synced with your machine, so you will fix the missing font before moving on.
            



In the Missing Fonts dialog box, ensure that Sync is selected for each font in the
               Sync column, and click Sync Fonts. After some time, the font should be synced with
               your machine, and you should see a success message in the Missing Fonts dialog box.
               Click Close.
            
This will sync the Typekit font to your computer and ensure that the font shows as
               intended in Illustrator.
            

 Note: If you see a warning message in the Missing Fonts dialog box or cannot select Sync,
                  you can click Find Fonts to replace the font with a local font. In the Find Font dialog
                  box, make sure that Proxima Nova is selected in the Fonts in Document section, and
                  choose System from the Replace With Font From menu. This shows all the local fonts
                  that are available to Illustrator. Select a font from the Fonts In System section,
                  and click Change All to replace the font. Do the same for Proxima Nova Bold. Click
                  Done.
               


 Note: If the font is unable to sync, you may not have an Internet connection or you may
                  need to launch the Creative Cloud desktop application, sign in with your Adobe ID,
                  choose Assets > Fonts, and click Turn Typekit On. If you went through Lesson 8, "Adding Type to a Poster," you would have this already turned on. For more information, visit http://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/add-fonts-typekit.html.
               



Choose File > Save As, name the file RealEstateApp.ai, and select the Lesson09 folder. Leave the Format option set to Adobe Illustrator
               (ai) (macOS) or the Save As Type option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows)
               and then click Save. In the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the Illustrator
               options at their default settings and then click OK.

Understanding layers
Layers are like invisible folders to help you hold and manage all of the items (some of
         which can be difficult to select or track) that make up your artwork. If you shuffle
         those folders, you change the stacking order of the items in your artwork. (You learned
         about stacking order in Lesson 2, "Techniques for Selecting Artwork.")
      
The structure of layers in your document can be as simple or as complex as you want.
         When you create a new Illustrator document, all of the content you create is organized
         in a single layer. However, you can create new layers and sublayers (like subfolders)
         to organize your artwork, as you'll learn about in this lesson.
      


Click the L9_end.ai tab at the top of the document window to show that document.


Click the Layers panel tab on the right side of the workspace, or choose Window >
               Layers.
            
In addition to organizing content, the Layers panel offers an easy way to select,
               hide, lock, and change your artwork's appearance attributes. In the following figure,
               the Layers panel is showing the content for the L9_end.ai file and won't match what
               you see in the RealEstateApp.ai file. You can refer to this figure as you progress
               through the lesson.
            

 Note: The figure shows the top and bottom of the Layers panel. The Layers panel in the
                  Essentials workspace is very tall, which is why the figure shows a split in the panel.

Creating layers and sublayers
      
By default, every document begins with one layer, named "Layer 1." As you create artwork,
         you can rename and add layers and sublayers at any time. Placing objects on separate
         layers lets you more easily select and edit them. For example, by placing type on
         a separate layer, you can focus on the type without affecting the rest of the artwork.
      
Creating new layers

 Note: How many layers you create, what you name them, and how content is organized within
            those layers varies depending on the project you are working on. For this lesson,
            I thought about what would make sense for layer organization, so you're creating layers
            based on that. There is no "wrong" layer structure, but, as you gain more experience
            with layers, you'll see what makes more sense for you.
         

Next, you'll change the default layer name and then create new layers using different
         methods. The idea for this project is to organize the artwork so you can more easily
         work with it later. In a real-world situation, you'll set up layers before you begin
         working on the artwork or as you create your artwork. In this lesson, you'll organize
         artwork with layers after the artwork is created, which can be a bit more challenging.
      


Click the RealEstateApp.ai tab at the top of the document window.


If the Layers panel isn't visible, click the Layers panel tab on the right side of
               the workspace, or choose Window > Layers. Layer 1 (the default name for the first
               layer) is highlighted, indicating that it is active.
            



In the Layers panel, double-click directly on the layer name "Layer 1" to edit it
               inline. Type Phone Body and then press Enter or Return.
            
Instead of keeping all the content on one single layer, you'll create several layers
               and sublayers to better organize the content and to make it easier to select content
               later.
            



Click the Create New Layer button () at the bottom of the Layers panel.
            
Layers and sublayers that aren't named are numbered in sequence. For example, the
               new layer is named Layer 2. When a layer or sublayer in the Layers panel contains
               other items, a disclosure triangle () appears to the left of the layer or sublayer name. You can click the disclosure
               triangle to show or hide the contents. If no triangle appears, the layer has no content
               on it.
            

 Tip: You can easily delete a layer by selecting the layer or sublayer and clicking the
                  Delete Selection button () at the bottom of the Layers panel. This deletes the layer or sublayer and all content
                  on it.
               



Double-click the layer thumbnail for Layer 2 (the white box) or to the right of the
               layer name "Layer 2" in the Layers panel to open the Layer Options dialog box. Change
               the name to Phone Content, and notice all the other options available. Click OK.
            


 Note: The Layer Options dialog box has a lot of the options you've already worked with,
                  including naming layers, Preview or Outline mode, locking layers, and showing and
                  hiding layers. You can also deselect the Print option in the Layer Options dialog
                  box, and any content on that layer will not print.
               

By default, the new layer is added above the currently selected layer (Phone Body,
               in this case) in the Layers panel and becomes active. Notice that the new layer has
               a different layer color (a light red) to the left of the layer name. This will become
               more important later, as you select content. Next, you will create a new layer and
               name it in one step, using a modifier key.
            


Option-click (macOS) or Alt-click (Windows) the Create New Layer button () at the bottom of the Layers panel. In the Layer Options dialog box, change the name
               to Menu Icons and then click OK.
            


 Tip: Choosing New Layer from the Layers panel menu () will also create a new layer and open the Layer Options dialog box.
               



With the "Menu Icons" layer selected in the Layers panel, click the Layers panel menu
               () and choose Duplicate "Menu Icons" to create a copy of the layer.
            


Double-click directly on the new layer name in the panel, and change it to Design Content. Press Enter or Return to accept the change.
            


 Note: The layer copy has the same layer color as the original layer (Menu Icons). In this
                  lesson, that's okay, but in the real world you may want to make the layer color different
                  for each layer. This can be helpful when selecting artwork later.
               



Creating sublayers
      
Next, you'll create a sublayer, which is a layer nested within a layer. Sublayers
         can be useful for organizing content within a layer without grouping or ungrouping
         content.
      



Click the layer named "Phone Content" to select it and then click the Create New Sublayer
               button () at the bottom of the Layers panel.
            
A new sublayer is created on the Phone Content layer and is selected. You can think
               of this new sublayer as a "child" of the "parent" layer named "Phone Content."
            


 Note: To create a new sublayer and name it in one step, Option-click (macOS) or Alt-click
                  (Windows) the Create New Sublayer button or choose New Sublayer from the Layers panel
                  menu to open the Layer Options dialog box.
               



Double-click the new sublayer name (Layer 5, in my case), change the name to Main Menu, and then press Enter or Return.
            
Creating a new sublayer opens the selected layer to show existing sublayers and content.



Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Phone Content layer to hide the content of the layer.
            


Drag the left edge of the Layers panel to the left to make it wider.



Editing layers and objects
      
By rearranging the layers in the Layers panel, you can change the stacking order of
         objects in your artwork. On an artboard, objects in layers that are higher in the
         Layers panel list are in front of objects located on layers lower in the list, and
         each layer has its own stacking order as well. Layers are useful for a variety of
         reasons, including the ability to move objects between layers and sublayers to organize
         and more easily select your artwork.
      
Locating layers
When working in artwork, there may be times when you select content on the artboard
         and then want to locate that same content in the Layers panel. This can help you to
         determine how content is organized.
      


With the Selection tool (), click to select the green rectangle with text on it toward the bottom of the left
               artboard. Click the Locate Object button () at the bottom of the Layers panel to reveal the group of objects within the Layers
               panel.
            


Clicking the Locate Object button will open the layer that the layer content is on,
               and the Layers panel will scroll, if necessary, to reveal the selected content.
            
In the Layers panel, you'll see a selection indicator () to the far right of the layer that the selected content is on, the <Group> object,
               as well as the objects in the group.
            



In the Layers panel, double-click the <Group> text, and rename it Description.
            
When content is grouped, a group object (<Group>) is created that contains the grouped
               content. Look at the top of the Properties panel to see the word "Group" in the Selection
               Indicator. Renaming a group doesn't change the fact that it's a group, but it can
               make it easier to find in the Layers panel.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.
            


Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Description group to collapse the group and then click the disclosure
               triangle () to the left of the Phone Body layer name to collapse the layer and hide the contents
               of the entire layer.
            

Keeping layers, sublayers, and groups collapsed is a great way to make the Layers
               panel less visually cluttered. The Phone Content layer and Phone Body layer are the
               only layers with a disclosure triangle because they're the only layers with content
               on them.
            


Moving content between layers
Next, you'll move the artwork to the different layers to take advantage of the layers
         and sublayers you've created.
      


In the artwork, using the Selection tool (), click the text "FOR SALE $450,000" to select a group of content.
            
In the Layers panel, notice that the Phone Body layer name has the selected-art indicator
               (the color square); it's circled in the figure.
            

Also notice that the color of the bounding box, paths, and anchor points of the selected
               artwork matches the color of the layer.
            
If you want to move selected artwork from one layer to another, you can either drag
               the selected-art indicator to the right of each sublayer or drag the selected-art
               indicator to the right of the layer name. That's what you'll do next.
            



Drag the selected-art indicator (the little blue box) from the far right of the Phone
               Body layer name straight up to the right of the target icon () on the Design Content layer.
            
This action moves all of the selected artwork to the Design Content layer. The color
               of the bounding box, paths, and anchor points in the artwork changes to the color
               of the Design Content layer, which is green (in my case).
            


 Tip: You can also press Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) and drag the selected-art indicator
                  to another layer to duplicate the content. Remember to release the mouse button and
                  then the key.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.


Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Phone Body layer to show the layer content.
            


Click the top <Group> object that contains the top navigation artwork. Press the Shift
               key and click the <Image> object to select the <Group>, Description, and <Image> layers
               without selecting the artwork on the artboard.
            


Drag any of the selected objects to the Design Content layer at the top of the list.
               When the Design Content layer shows a highlight, release the mouse button.
            


 Note: This is another way to move artwork between layers. Any content that is dragged to
                  another layer is automatically at the top of the layer stack on that layer.
               



Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Phone Body layer to hide the layer contents.
            


Viewing layers
      
The Layers panel lets you hide layers, sublayers, or individual objects from view.
         When a layer is hidden, the content on the layer is also locked and cannot be selected
         or printed. You can also use the Layers panel to display layers or objects individually,
         in either Preview or Outline mode. In this section, you'll learn how to view layers
         in Outline mode to make artwork potentially easier to select.
      



Choose View > Outline. This displays the artwork so that only its outlines (or paths)
               are visible. You should be able to see the menu icons that are hidden beneath the
               green shape. An arrow is pointing to them in the figure.
            

Notice the eye icons () in the Layers panel now. They indicate that the content on that layer is in Outline
               mode.
            


Choose View > GPU Preview or View > Preview On CPU (or Preview) if GPU Preview is
               not available to see the painted artwork.
            
Sometimes, you may want to view part of the artwork in outline mode while retaining
               the strokes and fills for the rest of the artwork. This can be useful if you need
               to see all artwork in a given layer, sublayer, or group.
            


In the Layers panel, click the disclosure triangle () for the Design Content layer to reveal the layer content. Command-click (macOS)
               or Ctrl-click (Windows) the eye icon () to the left of the Design Content layer name to show the content for only that layer in Outline mode.
            


 Tip: To view layer artwork in Outline mode, you can also double-click either the layer
                  thumbnail or just to the right of the layer name to open the Layer Options dialog
                  box. You can then deselect Preview and click OK.
               

Displaying a layer in Outline mode is also useful for selecting the anchor points
               or center points on objects.
            



Select the Selection tool (), and click one of the mobile icons to select the group.
            


Click the Locate Object () button at the bottom of the Layers panel to see where the selected group is in the
               Layers panel.
            


Choose Edit > Cut to cut the mobile icon group from the document.
Cutting content or deleting content will remove it from the Layers panel.


Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Design Content layer and the Phone Body layer to hide the layer
               content for each.
            


Click to select the Menu Icons layer, and choose Edit > Paste In Place to paste the
               group into that layer.
            

Selecting a layer before you create or paste content is something you will be doing
               a lot of in Illustrator. This way, you can organize content, keeping it on the layer
               you think is best, as you go.
            

 Note: In the figure, all of the layers are toggled closed. Yours may look different, and
                  that's okay.
               


 Note: The Paste In Place and Paste on All Artboards commands paste artwork on the active
                  artboard at the same position as the artboard from where the artwork is copied.
               



Command-click (macOS) or Ctrl-click (Windows) the eye icon () to the left of the Design Content layer name to show the content for that layer
               in Preview mode again.
            



The menu icons will be behind the design content now since the Menu Icons layer is
         beneath the Design Content layer in the Layers panel. You'll fix that next.
      
Reordering layers
      
In earlier lessons, you learned that objects have a stacking order, depending on when
         and how they were created. That stacking order applies to each of the layers in the
         Layers panel. By creating multiple layers in your artwork, you can control how overlapping
         objects are displayed. Next, you'll reorder layers to achieve a different stacking
         order.
      


Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Design Content layer to show the layer content.
            


Option-click (macOS) or Alt-click (Windows) the eye icon () to the left of the Design Content layer to hide the other layers.
            

Hiding all layers except those that you want to work with can be very useful so you
               can focus on the content at hand.
            



With the Selection tool () selected, click in a blank area, away from artwork to deselect, if necessary. Shift-drag
               the image off the left edge of the artboard into the approximate center of the artboard.
               Release the mouse button and then the Shift key.
            
Notice the <Image> object in the Design Content layer in the Layers panel.


Choose Object > Arrange > Send To Back.


 Tip: You can also drag the <Image> object down below the <Group> object beneath it in
                  the Layers panel. When a highlight line appears, release the mouse button to reorder
                  the layers. The Arrange commands work within the layer that the selected content is
                  on.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.


Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Design Content layer to hide the layer content.
            
It's a good idea to get in the practice of collapsing layers in my opinion so you
               can more easily find content and work with layers in the Layers panel later.
            


Choose Show All Layers from the Layers panel menu () or Option-click (macOS) or Alt-click (Windows) the eye icon () to the left of the Design Content layer to show all layers again.
            


Click the Design Content layer to select it in the Layers panel, if necessary. Shift-click
               the Menu Icons layer to select both.
            


Drag either layer down on top of the Phone Content layer. When the layer is highlighted,
               release the mouse button to move the layers into the Phone Content layer. They are
               now sublayers of the parent Phone Content layer.
            



Collecting into a new layer
      
To streamline your artwork, you can merge layers, sublayers, content, or groups to
         combine the contents into one layer or sublayer. Note that items will be merged into
         the layer or group that you selected last. Next, you will merge content into a new
         layer and then merge a few sublayers into one.
      


Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Phone Content layer to hide the layer content. Click the disclosure
               triangle () to the left of the Phone Body layer to show the layer content.
            


Press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, and click the <Path> object that has
               a circle in the thumbnail to select the content on the artboard.
            

This can be helpful if you are looking at content in the Layers panel and need to
               select it or, in the least, see where it is in your document. You could also click
               the Selection column (where the selection indicator appears) to select content without
               selecting the layer.
            



In the content for the Phone Body layer, with the <Path> layer selected, Shift-click
               the <Path> object above it to select both objects. See the figure.
            

 Tip: You can also Command-click (macOS) or Ctrl-click (Windows) layers or sublayers in
                  the Layers panel to select multiple, nonsequential layers.
               



Click the Layers panel menu icon (), and choose Collect In New Layer to create a new sublayer (in this case) and put
               the selected content in it.
            
The objects in the new sublayer retain their original stacking order.

 Tip: Choose Merge Selected from the Layers panel menu to merge selected content into a
                  single layer. The last layer you select determines the name and color of the merged
                  layer. Layers can only merge with other layers that are on the same hierarchical level
                  in the Layers panel. Likewise, sublayers can only merge with other sublayers that
                  are in the same layer and on the same hierarchical level. Objects can't be merged
                  with other objects.
               





Double-click the new sublayer name (mine is Layer 6), and change the name to Front. Press Enter or Return. The layer color you see may be different from what you see
               in the figure and that's okay.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.


Choose File > Save.


Duplicating layer content
You can also use the Layers panel as another method for duplicating layers and other
         content. Next, you'll duplicate the Front sublayer, then move the content onto the
         right-hand artboard, and finally duplicate content between layers.
      


Drag the Front sublayer down to the Create New Layer button () to make a copy of the layer. Double-click the new layer name (Front copy) and name
               it Back.
            
The <Compound Path> object at the top of the Phone Body layer also needs to be in
               the Front sublayer and the Back sublayer. Next, you'll drag a copy into the Back sublayer
               and then drag the original into the Front sublayer.
            




Click to select the <Compound Path> object. Pressing Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows),
               drag the object onto to the Back sublayer. When the layer is highlighted, release
               the mouse button and then the key.
            
This copies the <Compound Path> content (the shape of the phone) onto the Back sublayer.
               Dragging with the modifier key copies the selected content. This is the same as selecting
               the content on the artboard, choosing Edit > Copy, selecting the Back sublayer in
               the Layers panel, and then choosing Edit > Paste In Place.
            
Next, you'll move the Back sublayer content onto the artboard on the right.
            

 Tip: You can also Option-drag (macOS) or Alt-drag (Windows) the selected-art indicator
                  to duplicate content. You can also select the <Compound Path> row in the Layers panel
                  and choose Duplicate "<Compound Path>" from the Layers panel menu to create a copy
                  of the same content.
               



Click the Selection column to the far right of the Back layer name. Even if you already
               see a color box, click it again to select all content on the layer.
            



Choose 2 Phone Back from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of
               the Document window to center that artboard in the window and select it.
            


Click the Properties panel tab to open the Properties panel. Choose Align To Artboard
               from the Align To Selection menu in the Properties panel. Then click the Horizontal
               Align Center button () to align the contents of the Back sublayer to the horizontal center of the 2 Phone
               Back artboard.
            




Click the Layers panel tab to show the Layers panel again. Click to select the original
               <Compound Path> object in the Layers panel. Drag it onto to the Front sublayer to
               move it onto that sublayer.
            

 Note: I dragged the left edge of the Layers panel to the left to see more of the layer
                  names.
               



Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Phone Body layer to hide the contents.
            


Choose View > Fit All In Window.


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Pasting layers
To complete the app design, you'll copy and paste the remaining pieces of artwork
         from another file. You can paste a layered file into another file and even keep the
         layers intact. In this section, you'll also learn a few new things, including how
         to apply appearance attributes to layers and how to reorder layers.
      


Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.


Choose File > Open. Open the Menu.ai file in the Lessons > Lesson09 folder on your
               hard disk.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Click the Layers panel tab to show the panel. To see how the objects in each layer
               are organized, Option-click (macOS) or Alt-click (Windows) the eye icon () for one layer at a time in the Layers panel to show one layer and hide the others.
               You can also click the disclosure triangle () to the left of each layer name to expand and collapse the layers for further inspection.
               When you're finished, make sure that both layers are showing and that they are collapsed.
            



Choose Select > All and then choose Edit > Copy to select and copy the content to
               the clipboard.
            


Choose File > Close to close the Menu.ai file without saving any changes. If a warning
               dialog box appears, click No (Windows) or Don't Save (macOS).
            


In the RealEstateApp.ai file, choose Paste Remembers Layers from the Layers panel
               menu (). A checkmark next to the option indicates that it's selected.
            
When Paste Remembers Layers is selected, artwork is pasted into the layer(s) from
               which it was copied, regardless of which layer is active in the Layers panel. If the
               option is not selected, all objects are pasted into the active layer, and the layers
               from the original file are not pasted in.
            

 Note: If the target document has a layer of the same name, Illustrator combines the pasted
                  content into a layer of the same name.
               



Choose Edit > Paste to paste the content into the center of the Document window.

The Paste Remembers Layers option causes the Menu.ai layers to be pasted as two separate
               layers at the top of the Layers panel (Text and Background). Now you'll move the newly
               pasted layers into the Main Menu sublayer of the Phone Content layer and then change
               the ordering of the layers.
            


Select the Text layer (if it's not already selected), and Shift-click the Background
               layer name in the Layers panel to select both layers.
            


Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Phone Content layer to show the layer contents.
            



Drag either of the selected layers (Text or Background) down on top of the Main Menu
               sublayer to move the content to the new layer.
            
The two pasted layers become sublayers of the Main Menu sublayer. Notice that they
               keep their individual layer colors.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.


Changing layer order
      
As you've seen, you can easily drag layers, sublayers, groups, and other content in
         the Layers panel to reorganize the layer ordering. There are also several Layers panel
         options for commands such as reversing layer ordering and more that can make reorganizing
         layers easier.
      


Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Main Menu sublayer to hide the contents.
            


Click the Design Content sublayer, and Shift-click the Main Menu sublayer name to
               select all three layers (Design Content, Menu Icons, and Main Menu).
            


Choose Reverse Order from the Layers panel menu () to reverse the layer ordering.
            



Click the Selection column to the far right of the Main Menu layer name to select
               the layer content.
            


With the Selection tool selected, drag the content onto the artboard on the left.



Choose Select > Deselect (if available).


Applying appearance attributes to layers
      

 Note: To learn more about working with appearance attributes, see Lesson 12, "Exploring Creative Uses of Effects and Graphic Styles."
         


 Note: I dragged the left edge of the Layers panel to the left to make it easier to see
            the names.
         

You can apply appearance attributes, such as styles, effects, and transparency, to
         layers, groups, and objects, using the Layers panel. When an appearance attribute
         is applied to a layer, any object on that layer takes on that attribute. If an appearance
         attribute is applied only to a specific object on a layer, it affects only that object,
         not the entire layer. Next, you'll apply an effect to artwork on one layer.
      



Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Main Menu sublayer to show the layer contents, if necessary.
               Click the target icon () to the right of the Background sublayer in the target column.
            

 Note: Clicking the target icon also selects the object(s) on the artboard. You could simply
                  select the content on the artboard to apply an effect.
               

Clicking the target icon indicates that you want to apply an effect, style, or transparency
               change to that layer, sublayer, group, or object. In other words, the layer, sublayer,
               group, or object is targeted. The content is also selected in the Document window. When the target button appears
               as a double-ring icon (either  or ), the item is targeted; a single-ring icon indicates that the item is not targeted.
            


Click the Properties panel tab to show the Properties panel. Change the Opacity to
               75 in the Properties panel.
            

The target icon () for the Background layer in the Layers panel is now shaded, indicating that the
               layer has at least one appearance attribute (an opacity change) applied to it. All
               content on the layer has the opacity change applied.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.


Creating a clipping mask
      
The Layers panel lets you create clipping masks to control whether artwork on a layer
         (or in a group) is hidden or revealed. A clipping mask is an object or group of objects that masks (with its shape) artwork below it in
         the same layer or sublayer so that only artwork within the shape is visible. In Lesson 14, "Using Illustrator CC with Other Adobe Applications," you will learn about creating clipping masks that are independent of the Layers
         panel. Now you'll create a clipping mask for the phone content.
      


Click the Layers panel tab to show the Layers panel. Click the disclosure triangle
               () to the left of the Phone Body layer to show its contents, and click the disclosure
               triangle () to the left of the Phone Content layer to hide its contents.
            


 Note: Once again, collapsing the Phone Content layer will keep the Layers panel a little
                  neater.
               



Drag the layer named <Path> onto the Phone Content layer to move it to that layer.
This path will be used as the clipping mask for all of the content on the layer.


Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Phone Content layer to show the layer content.
            
In the Layers panel, a masking object must be above the objects it masks. In the case
               of a layer mask, the masking object must be the topmost object on the layer. You can
               create a clipping mask for an entire layer, a sublayer, or a group of objects. You
               want to mask all of the content in the Phone Content layer, so the clipping object
               needs to be at the top of the Phone Content layer, which is what you just did.
            


Press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, and click the <Path> object at the
               top of the Phone Content layer to select the content on the artboard.
            

You don't need to select the shape to make a mask. I really just wanted you to see
               how big it was and see where it was positioned.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.


Select the Phone Content layer to highlight it in the Layers panel. Click the Make/Release
               Clipping Mask button () at the bottom of the Layers panel.
            

The name of the <Path> sublayer is underlined to indicate that it is the masking shape,
               and it has been renamed to "Clipping Path." On the artboard, the <Path> sublayer has
               hidden the parts of the phone content that extended outside of the shape.
            
Now that the artwork is complete, you may want to combine all the layers into a single
               layer and then delete the empty layers. This is called flattening artwork. Delivering finished artwork in a single-layer file can prevent accidents,
               such as hiding layers or omitting parts of the artwork during printing. To flatten
               specific layers without deleting hidden layers, you can select the layers you want
               to flatten and then choose Merge Selected from the Layers panel menu ().
            

 Note: For a complete list of shortcuts that you can use with the Layers panel, see "Keyboard

Review answers


The benefits of using layers when creating artwork include organizing content, selecting
                  content more easily, protecting artwork that you don't want to change, hiding artwork
                  that you aren't working with so that it's not distracting, and controlling what prints.
               


You reorder layers by selecting a layer name in the Layers panel and dragging the
                  layer to its new location. The order of layers in the Layers panel controls the document's
                  layer order—topmost in the panel is frontmost in the artwork.
               


The color for a layer controls how selected anchor points and direction lines are
                  displayed on a layer and helps you identify which layer an object resides on in your
                  document.
               


The paste commands paste layered files or objects copied from different layers into
                  the active layer by default. The Paste Remembers Layers option keeps the original
                  layers intact when the objects are pasted.
               


Create a clipping mask on a layer by selecting the layer and clicking the Make/Release
                  Clipping Mask button () in the Layers panel. The topmost object in the layer becomes the clipping mask.

To add texture and interest to your artwork in Illustrator, you can apply gradient
         fills, which are graduated blends of two or more colors, patterns, and blends of shapes
         and colors. In this lesson, you'll explore how to work with each of these to complete
         a project.
      
Starting the lesson
      
In this lesson, you'll explore various ways to work with gradients, blend shapes and
         colors, and create and apply patterns. Before you begin, you'll restore the default
         preferences for Adobe Illustrator CC. Then you'll open the finished art file for this
         lesson to see what you'll create.
      


To ensure that the tools function and the defaults are set exactly as described in
               this lesson, delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CC preferences
               file. See "Restoring default preferences" in the "Getting Started" section at the
               beginning of the book.
            

 Note: If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson to your computer
                  from your Account page, make sure to do so now. See the "Getting Started" section
                  at the beginning of the book.

            Workspace > Essentials before choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
         

Working with gradients
      
A gradient fill is a graduated blend of two or more colors, and it always includes a starting color
         and an ending color. You can create different types of gradient fills in Illustrator,
         including linear, in which the beginning color blends into the ending color along a line, and radial, in which the beginning color radiates outward, from the center point to the ending
         color. You can use the gradients provided with Adobe Illustrator CC or create your
         own gradients and save them as swatches for later use.
      

You can use the Properties panel to access the Gradient panel (Window > Gradient)
         or the Gradient tool () to apply, create, and modify gradients. In the Gradient panel, the Gradient Fill
         box or Stroke box displays the current gradient colors and gradient type applied to
         the fill or stroke of an object.
      

 Note: The Gradient panel you see won't match the figure, and that's okay.

In the Gradient panel under the gradient slider (labeled "E" in the previous figure),
         the leftmost gradient stop (labeled "F") is called a color stop. This marks the starting
         color; the right gradient stop marks the ending color. A color stop is the point at which a gradient changes from one color to the next. You can add
         more color stops by clicking below the gradient slider, and double-clicking a color
         stop opens a panel where you can choose a color from swatches, or color sliders.
      
Applying a linear gradient to a fill
With the simplest, two-color linear gradient, the starting color (leftmost color stop)
         blends into the ending color (rightmost color stop) along a straight line. To begin
         the lesson, you'll apply a gradient fill that comes with Illustrator to the green
         background shape.
      


Using the Selection tool (), click to select the large green rectangle in the background of the artboard on
               the left.
            


Click the Fill color () in the Properties panel, select the Swatches option (), and select the gradient swatch named "White, Black." Leave the swatches showing.
            

The default black-and-white gradient is applied to the fill of the selected shape.


Editing a gradient
Next, you'll edit the colors in the default black and white gradient you applied.


Click the Fill color in the Properties panel again to show the swatches, if it's not
               still showing. Click the Gradient Options button in the Swatches panel that appears
               to open the Gradient panel (Window > Gradient), and perform the following:
            


Make sure that the Fill box is selected (circled in the figure).


Double-click the white, leftmost gradient stop to select the starting color of the
                     gradient (an arrow is pointing to it in the figure).
                  


Click the Swatches button () in the panel that appears.
                  


Click to select the light brown swatch named "BG 10%."





Click in a blank area of the Gradient panel to hide the Swatches panel.


In the Gradient panel, perform the following:
            


Double-click the black color stop on the right side of the gradient slider to edit
                     the color in the Gradient panel (circled in the figure). In the panel that appears,
                     click the Color button () to open the Color panel.
                  


Click the menu icon (), and choose CMYK from the menu, if CMYK values aren't showing.
                  


Change the CMYK values to C=25, M=25, Y=25, and K=0.
                  

 Tip: To move between text fields, press the Tab key. Press Enter or Return to apply the
                        last value typed.
                     



After entering the last value, click in a blank area of the Gradient panel.





Saving a gradient
Next, you'll save the gradient you just edited as a swatch, in the Swatches panel.
         Saving a gradient is a great way to be able to apply it to other artwork easily and
         maintain consistency in the gradient appearance.
      


In the Gradient panel, click the Gradient menu arrow () to the left of the word "Type," and click the Add To Swatches button () at the bottom of the panel that appears.
            

The Gradient menu you just saw lists all the default and saved gradients that you
               can apply.
            

 Tip: Like most things in Illustrator, there is more than one method for saving a gradient
                  swatch. You can also save a gradient by selecting an object with a gradient fill or
                  stroke, clicking the Fill box or Stroke box in the Swatches panel (whichever the gradient
                  is applied to), and then clicking the New Swatch button () at the bottom of the Swatches panel.
               



Click the X at the top of the Gradient panel to close it.



With the background shape still selected, click the Fill color box in the Properties
               panel. With the Swatches option () selected, double-click the "New Gradient Swatch 1" thumbnail to open the Swatch
               Options dialog box.
            


In the Swatch Options dialog box, type Background in the Swatch Name field and then click OK.
            



Click the Show Swatch Kinds Menu button () at the bottom of the Swatches panel, and choose Show Gradient Swatches from the
               menu to display only gradient swatches in the Swatches panel.
            
The Swatches panel lets you sort colors based on type, like gradient swatches.


With the rectangle still selected on the artboard, apply some of the different gradients
               to the shape fill by selecting them in the Swatches panel.
            


Click the gradient named "Background" (the one you just saved) in the Swatches panel
               to make sure it's applied before continuing to the next step.
            


Click the Show Swatch Kinds Menu button () at the bottom of the Swatches panel, and choose Show All Swatches from the menu.
            


Choose File > Save, and leave the rectangle selected.


Adjusting a linear gradient fill
Once you have painted an object with a gradient, you can adjust the direction, the
         origin, and the beginning and end points of the gradient applied to the artwork, using
         the Gradient tool. Now you'll adjust the gradient fill in the background shape.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, double-click the background shape to isolate it.
            
This is a great way to enter Isolation mode for a single shape so you can focus on
               it without the other content (in this case) on top of it.
            


Choose View > Zoom Out.



Select the Gradient tool () in the Tools panel.
            

 Tip: You can hide the gradient annotator (bar) by choosing View > Hide Gradient Annotator.
                  To show it again, choose View > Show Gradient Annotator.
               

With the Gradient tool, you can apply a gradient to the fill of an object or edit
               an existing gradient fill. Notice the horizontal gradient annotator (bar) that appears
               in the middle of the rectangle, which indicates the direction of the gradient. The
               larger circle on the left shows the starting point of the gradient (the first color
               stop), and the smaller square on the right is the ending point (the last color stop).


Move the pointer over the bar in the gradient annotator.

The bar turns into the gradient slider, much like the one found in the Gradient panel.
               You can use the gradient slider on the art to edit the gradient without opening the
               Gradient panel.
            

 Note: If you move the pointer to different areas of the gradient slider, the appearance
                  of the pointer may change. This indicates that different functionality has been activated.
               


 Note: Holding down the Shift key constrains the gradient to 45-degree angles.
               



With the Gradient tool selected, pressing the Shift key, drag from the top of the
               artboard down to the bottom of the artboard to change the position and direction of
               the starting and ending colors of the gradient in the rectangle. Release the mouse
               button and then release the key.
            



With the Gradient tool, move the pointer just off the small white square at the bottom of the gradient annotator. A rotation icon () appears. Drag to the right to rotate the gradient in the rectangle and then release
               the mouse button.
            



Double-click the Gradient tool in the Tools panel to open the Gradient panel. Ensure
               that the Fill box is selected in the panel (circled in the figure) and then choose
               -60 from the Angle menu.
            


 Note: Entering the gradient rotation in the Gradient panel, rather than adjusting it directly
                  on the artboard, is useful when you want to achieve consistency and precision.
               



Choose Object > Lock > Selection to lock the rectangle so you don't accidentally move
               it later and to make selecting other artwork easier.
            


Select the Selection tool, and press Esc to exit Isolation mode. You should see all
               of the artwork again.
            


Choose File > Save.


Applying a linear gradient to a stroke
You can also apply a gradient blend to the stroke of an object. Unlike a gradient
         applied to the fill of an object, you cannot use the Gradient tool to edit a gradient
         on the stroke of an object. A gradient on a stroke, however, has more options available
         in the Gradient panel than a gradient fill. Next, you will add a series of colors
         to a stroke gradient to create a frame for the artwork.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, click the red stroke of the shape around the cake to select that shape.
            

 Note: The Color panel group may open. If it does, you can close it.
               



Click the Stroke box at the bottom of the Tools panel, and click the Gradient box
               below the Fill box to apply the last used gradient.
            


 Note: Depending on the resolution of your screen, you may see a single-column Tools panel.
               



Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and drag across the stroke of the selected shape to zoom in
               to it. Select the Selection tool.
            


Editing a gradient on a stroke
For a gradient on a stroke, you can choose how to align the gradient to the stroke:
         within, along, or across. In this section, you'll explore how to align a gradient
         to the stroke and also edit the colors of the gradient.
      


In the Gradient panel, click the Stroke box (if not already selected; it's circled
               in the figure) to edit the gradient applied to the stroke. Leave Type as Linear, and
               click the Apply Gradient Across Stroke button () to change the gradient type.
            

Next, you'll add colors to the gradient using a few methods.
            

 Note: You can apply a gradient to a stroke in three ways: within a stroke (default) (), along a stroke (), and across a stroke ().
               



Position the pointer below the gradient slider, between the two color stops. When
               the pointer with a plus sign () appears, click to add another color stop like you see in the middle part of the
               following figure.
            



Double-click that new color stop and, with the swatches selected (), click the swatch named "BG 10%." Press the Escape key to hide the swatches and
               return to the Gradient panel.
            



With the color stop still selected, change Location to 50%.
For the next few steps, you'll discover how to add a new color to the gradient by
               dragging to create a copy of a color stop in the Gradient panel.
            



Pressing the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, drag the color stop on the far right
               to the left; release the mouse button when you see roughly 25% in the Location value and then release the modifier key.
            
There are now four color stops. Next you'll see how to remove a color stop.



Drag the color stop on the far left down, away from the gradient slider. When you
               see that it's gone from the slider, release the mouse to remove it.
            



Click the X at the top of the Gradient panel to close it.


Applying a radial gradient to artwork
As previously noted, with a radial gradient, the starting color (leftmost color stop) of the gradient defines the center point
         of the fill, which radiates outward to the ending color (rightmost color stop). Next,
         you'll create and apply a radial gradient fill to a shape to make a shadow underneath
         the cake.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


With the Selection tool () selected, click the orange ellipse.
            


Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) a few times to zoom in.


Change the fill color to the White, Black gradient in the Properties panel. Leave
               the Swatches panel showing.
            



Click the Gradient Options button in the Swatches panel to open the Gradient panel.
               In the Gradient panel, make sure the Fill box is selected. Choose Radial from the
               Type menu to convert the linear gradient to a radial gradient.
            



Editing the colors in the radial gradient
      
Previously in this lesson, you edited gradient colors in the Gradient panel. You can
         also edit the colors in a gradient using the Gradient tool, which is what you'll do
         next.
      


In the Gradient panel, with the ellipse still selected, click the Reverse Gradient
               button () to swap the white and black colors in the gradient.
            



Select the Gradient tool () in the Tools panel.
            


Position the pointer over the gradient annotator (bar) in the ellipse to reveal the
               gradient slider, and perform the following:
            


Double-click the black color stop in the center of the ellipse to edit the color.


In the panel that appears, click the Swatches button (), if it's not already selected.
                  


Select the swatch named "Radial 1."



Notice that the gradient annotator starts from the center of the ellipse and points
               to the right. The dashed circle around the gradient annotator when the pointer is
               over it indicates that it is a radial gradient. You can set additional options for
               radial gradients, as you'll soon see.
            


Press Escape to hide the panel.


Position the pointer beneath the gradient slider, in the middle. When the pointer
               with a plus sign () appears, click to add another color to the gradient (see the first part of the following
               figure).
            


Double-click the new color stop. In the panel that appears, click the Swatches button
               (), and select the swatch named "Radial 2." Change Location to 45%. Press Enter or Return to change the value and hide the panel.
            

 Tip: When you edit a color stop that has a swatch applied, you can easily see which swatch
                  is applied because it is highlighted in the panel.
               




Choose File > Save.


Adjusting the radial gradient
Next, you'll change the aspect ratio of the radial gradient and change the radius
         and the origin of the radial gradient.
      


With the Gradient tool () selected and the ellipse still selected, move the pointer over the right end of
               the gradient annotator (see the first part of the following figure). When the pointer
               changes (), drag to the right, stopping at the right edge of the ellipse shape, and release
               the mouse button to lengthen the gradient.
            


 Note: You may not see the dotted circle as you drag the end of the gradient annotator.
                  That's okay. It appears if you position the pointer over the gradient annotator bar
                  first, before dragging the right end point.
               


 Tip: You can also drag the gradient slider to reposition the gradient in the ellipse.
               


 Tip: You can drag the small white dot to the left of the larger white dot to reposition
                  the center of the gradient without moving the entire gradient bar. This also changes
                  the radius of the gradient.
               



In the Gradient panel, ensure that the Fill box is selected and then change the Aspect
               Ratio () to 30% by selecting it from the menu. Leave the panel open.
            

The aspect ratio changes a radial gradient into an elliptical gradient and makes the
               gradient better match the shape of the artwork. Another way to edit the aspect ratio
               is to do so visually. If you position the pointer over the gradient on the selected
               artwork with the Gradient tool selected and then position the pointer over the top
               black circle that appears on the dotted path, the pointer changes to . You can then drag to change the aspect ratio of the gradient.
            

 Note: The aspect ratio is a value between 0.5% and 32,767%. As the aspect ratio gets smaller,
                  the ellipse flattens and widens.
               



Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and double-click the Scale tool () in the Tools panel. Change the Uniform Scale value to 80%, and click OK.
            

If you transform a shape with a gradient applied, such as scaling or rotating the
               shape (among other types of transformations), the gradient transforms as well. By
               the way, double-clicking the Scale tool, like other Transform tools, is the same as
               choosing Object > Transform > Scale (in this case).
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Applying gradients to multiple objects
You can apply a gradient to multiple objects by selecting all the objects, applying
         a gradient color, and then dragging across the objects with the Gradient tool.
      
Now you'll apply a linear gradient fill to the two shapes that make up the cake.


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


With the Selection tool () selected, click the cream-colored cake shape and, pressing the Shift key, click
               the other cake shape to select both.
            


Click the Fill color in the Properties panel. In the panel that appears, make sure
               the Swatches option () is selected, and select the Background gradient swatch.
            



Select the Gradient tool () in the Tools panel. Choose View > Hide Gradient Annotator so the bars that appear
               in the shapes are temporarily hidden.
            


Drag from the middle of the upper shape to the bottom shape. Leave the shapes selected.

Dragging across multiple shapes with the Gradient tool allows you to apply a gradient
               across the shapes.
            


Adding transparency to gradients
By specifying varying opacity values for the different color stops in your gradient,
         you can create gradients that fade in or out and that show or hide underlying artwork.
         Next, you'll apply a gradient that fades to transparent on the cake shapes. To do
         that, you'll copy the cake shapes and apply a gradient to the copies.
      


Select the Selection tool (). With the cake shapes still selected, choose Edit > Copy and then choose Edit >
               Paste In Front.
            



Choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front to bring them on top of the other cake shapes.



In the Gradient panel, ensure that the Fill box is selected. Click the Gradient menu
               arrow () and then select White, Black to apply the generic gradient to the fill.
            


Click the Reverse Gradient button () in the Gradient panel so the gradient starts with black (black will be the color
               stop on the left of the gradient slider).
            



Select the Gradient tool () in the Tools panel, and drag from the left edge of the widest cake shape to the
               right, going to the middle of the shapes.
            



In the Gradient panel, click the black color stop in the Gradient panel. Change Opacity
               to 40% Click the white color stop and change Opacity to 0%.
            



Drag the gradient midpoint (the diamond shape) to the right until you see a value
               of approximately 60% in the Location field.
            



Choose Object > Hide > Selection.

Working with blended objects
      
You can blend two distinct objects to create and distribute shapes evenly between
         two objects. The two shapes you blend can be the same or different. You can also blend
         between two open paths to create a smooth transition of color between objects, or
         you can combine blends of colors and objects to create color transitions in the shape
         of a particular object.
      
The following are examples of different types of blended objects you can create:

When you create a blend, the blended objects are treated as one object, called a blend object. If you move one of the original objects or edit the anchor points of the original
         object, the blend changes accordingly. You can also expand the blend to divide it
         into distinct objects.
      
Creating a blend with specified steps
Next, you'll use the Blend tool () to blend two shapes that you will use to create a pattern for the cake decoration.
      


Choose View > Zoom In a few times to zoom in closely. Make sure you can still see
               the two small maroon shapes on the cake (see the following figure).
            

 Tip: You can add more than two objects to a blend.
               



Select the Blend tool () in the Tools panel. Move the little box part of the pointer () over the center of the small maroon shape on the left side of the cake and click.
            

 Note: If you wanted to end the current path and blend other objects, you would first click
                  the Blend tool in the Tools panel and then click the other objects, one at a time,
                  to blend them.
               



Move the pointer away from the shape and a you'll see a plus sign next to the pointer
               (), indicating that you can add an object to the blend. Move the little box part of
               the pointer (not the plus) over the center of the small maroon shape on the right
               side of the cake and click to create a blend between these two objects.


With the blended object still selected, choose Object > Blend > Blend Options. In
               the Blend Options dialog box, choose Specified Steps from the Spacing menu, change
               Specified Steps to 9, and then click OK.
            


 Tip: To edit the blend options for an object, you can also select the blend object and
                  then double-click the Blend tool. You can also double-click the Blend tool () in the Tools panel to set tool options before you create the blend object.
               



Modifying a blend
Now you'll edit the spine of the blend you just created so the shapes blend along
         a curve.
      


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and click anywhere on the blend object to select it, if it's
               not already selected. Choose View > Zoom In, making sure you can still see the whole
               blend object.
            


Double-click anywhere on the blend object to enter Isolation mode.
This temporarily ungroups the blended objects and lets you edit each original shape,
               as well as the spine. The spine is a path along which the steps in a blended object
               are aligned. By default, the spine is a straight line.
            


Choose View > Outline.
In Outline mode, you can see the outlines of the two original shapes and a straight
               path (spine) between them. These three objects are what a blend object is composed
               of, by default. It can be easier to edit the path between the original objects in
               Outline mode.
            


Click and drag the edge of the smaller shape on the right up until it touches the
               cake decoration above it. See the following figure.
            

Make sure you drag the shape and not the path between the shapes.


Choose Select > Deselect, and remain in Isolation mode.


Select the Pen tool () in the Tools panel. Press the Option key (macOS) or Alt key (Windows), and position
               the pointer over the path between the shapes. When the pointer changes (), drag the path up, like in the first part of the figure.
            


 Tip: Another way to reshape the spine of a blend is to blend the shapes along another
                  path. You can draw another path, select the blend as well, and then choose Object
                  > Blend > Replace Spine.
               



Choose View > GPU Preview if supported, or View > Preview On CPU (Preview) if not,
               to see the change.
            


 Tip: If the maroon shapes don't align with the points on the cake shape above, you can
                  press the arrow keys (left or right) after dragging with the Pen tool to reshape the
                  path. You can also press the Option/Alt key with Pen tool selected, and drag the path
                  again.
               



Press Esc to exit Isolation mode.


Choose Select > Deselect, and choose File > Save.


Creating and editing a smooth color blend
      

You can choose several options for blending the shapes and colors of objects to create
         a new object. When you choose the Smooth Color blend option in the Blend Options dialog
         box, Illustrator combines the shapes and colors of the objects into many intermediate
         steps, creating a smooth, graduated blend between the original objects, like you see
         in the figure on the right.
      
If objects are filled or stroked with different colors, the steps are calculated to
         provide the optimum number of steps for a smooth color transition. If the objects
         contain identical colors or if they contain gradients or patterns, the number of steps
         is based on the longest distance between the bounding box edges of the two objects.
      
Now you'll combine two shapes into a smooth color blend to make the trunk of a tree
         that is the leg of the cake stand.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Select the Zoom tool (), and drag across the paths under the cake.
            
Both brown paths have a stroke color and no fill. Objects that have strokes blend
               differently than those that have no stroke.
            


Select the Selection tool () and click on the path on the left. Press the Shift key and click on the path on
               the right to select both.
            


Choose Object > Blend > Make.
This is another way to create a blend and can be useful if creating a blend using
               the Blend tool proves challenging. The blend you created is using the last settings
               from the Blend Options dialog box (Specified Steps: 9).
            

Next, you'll change the blend settings for the tree trunk so that it blends as smooth
               color, rather than in specified steps.
            


With the blend object still selected, double-click the Blend tool () in the Tools panel. In the Blend Options dialog box, choose Smooth Color from the
               Spacing menu to set up the blend options, which will remain set until you change them.
               Select Preview and then click OK.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.

 Note: Creating smooth color blends between paths can be difficult in certain situations.
                  For instance, if the lines intersect or the lines are too curved, unexpected results
                  can occur.
               


 Tip: If you're having a hard time selecting the path, choose View > Outline to enter Outline
                  mode. Select the path, and then choose View > GPU Preview if supported or View > Preview
                  On CPU (Preview) if not.
               

Once you've applied a smooth color blend to objects, you can edit it. Next, you'll
               edit the paths that make up the blend.
            


With the Selection tool () selected, double-click within the color blend to enter Isolation mode. Click the
               path on the left to select it, and change the Stroke color in the Properties panel
               to any color you want. Press the Escape key to hide the panel. Notice how the colors
               are blended.
            



Choose Edit > Undo Apply Swatch until the original stroke color is showing.


Double-click away from the blend to exit Isolation mode, and deselect all.


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Choose File > Save.


Painting with patterns
      
In addition to process colors, spot colors, and gradients, the Swatches panel can
         also contain pattern swatches. Illustrator provides sample swatches of each type in
         the default Swatches panel as separate libraries and lets you create your own patterns
         and gradients. In this section, you will focus on creating, applying, and editing
         patterns.
      
Applying an existing pattern
A pattern is artwork saved in the Swatches panel that can be applied to the stroke or fill
         of an object. You can customize existing patterns and design patterns from scratch
         with any of the Illustrator tools. All patterns start with a single tile that is tiled (repeated) within a shape, starting at the ruler origin and continuing to the right.
         Next, you will apply an existing pattern to a shape.
      


Choose Object > Unlock All.


Choose Select > Deselect.


With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the background rectangle behind all of the other artwork.
            



Click More Options () in the Appearance section of the Properties panel to open the Appearance panel (or
               choose Window > Appearance). Click the Add New Fill button at the bottom of the panel.
               This adds a second gradient fill to the rectangle and layers it on top of the first.
            


 Note: You'll learn all about the Appearance panel in Lesson 12, "Exploring Creative Uses of Effects and Graphic Styles."
               



In the Appearance panel, click the top fill box to the right of the word "Fill" to show a panel of swatches. An arrow is
               pointing to it in the figure. Select the Pompadour swatch.
            
The pattern swatch fills the shape as a second fill on top of the first. The swatch
               named "Pompadour" is included in the swatches for a Print document. You can find so
               many more pattern swatches in Illustrator by choosing Window > Swatch Libraries >
               Patterns and choosing a pattern library.
            



In the Appearance panel, click the arrow to the left of the top word "Fill." Click the word "Opacity" that appears to open the Transparency panel
               (or choose Window > Transparency). Change the Opacity value to 20. Press the Escape key to hide the panel.
            


Close the Appearance panel.


Choose Object > Lock > Selection and then choose File > Save.


Creating your own pattern
In this section, you'll create your own custom pattern. Patterns you create are saved
         as a swatch in the Swatches panel for the document you're working in.
      



With nothing selected, click the Next Artboard button in the Properties panel to show
               the smaller artboard on the right.
            


With the Selection tool () selected, choose Select > All On Active Artboard to select the artwork you'll use
               to create a pattern.
            


Choose Object > Pattern > Make. Click OK in the dialog box that appears.

When you create a pattern, Illustrator enters Pattern Editing mode, which is similar
               to the Isolation mode you've worked with in previous lessons. Pattern Editing mode
               allows you to create and edit patterns interactively, while previewing the changes
               to the pattern on the artboard. All other artwork is dimmed and cannot be edited while
               in this mode. The Pattern Options panel (Window > Pattern Options) also opens, giving
               you all the necessary options to create your pattern.
            

 Note: You don't need to have anything selected when you create a pattern. You can add content
                  to the pattern when you edit it in Pattern Editing mode, as you'll see.
               



Choose Select > All On Active Artboard to select the artwork.
            

 Note: A pattern can be composed of shapes, symbols, or embedded raster images, among other
                  objects that you can add in Pattern Editing mode. For instance, to create a flannel
                  pattern for a shirt, you can create three overlapping rectangles or lines, each with
                  varying appearance options.
               



Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) to zoom in.
The series of lighter-colored objects around the artwork in the center are the pattern
               repeat. They are there for a preview and are a little dimmed to let you focus on the
               original. The blue box around the original group of objects is the pattern tile (the area that repeats).
            



In the Pattern Options panel, change the Name to Cake Top, and try choosing different options from the Tile Type menu to see the effect on
               the pattern. Before continuing, make sure Grid is selected.
            
The name in the Pattern Options panel becomes the name of the swatch saved in the
               Swatches panel and can be useful to distinguish multiple versions of a pattern swatch,
               for instance. Tile Type determines how the pattern is tiled. You have three main Tile
               Type choices: the default grid pattern, a brick-style pattern, or the hex pattern.
            


Choose 1 x 1 from the Copies menu at the bottom of the Pattern Options panel. This
               will remove the repeat and let you temporarily focus on the main pattern artwork.
            


Click in a blank area to deselect the artwork.


Option+Shift-drag (macOS) or Alt+Shift-drag (Windows) the blue circle in the center
               to a little outside the upper-right corner of the blue pattern tile box.
            



In the Pattern Options panel, change the following options:
            

 Tip: The H Spacing and V Spacing values can be either positive or negative values, and
                  they move the tiles apart or bring them closer together, either horizontally (H) or
                  vertically (V).
               




Choose 5 x 5 from the Copies menu to see the repeat again.


Notice that the circle you dragged outside of the pattern tile is not repeated. That's
               because it's not within the pattern tile. Only artwork within the pattern tile is
               repeated.
            



Select the Size Tile To Art option in the Pattern Options panel.


The Size Tile To Art selection fits the tile area (the blue square) to the bounds
               of the artwork, changing the spacing between the repeated objects. With Size Tile
               To Art deselected, you could manually change the width and the height of the pattern
               definition area in the Width and Height fields to include more content or to edit
               the spacing between. You can also edit the tile area manually with the Pattern Tile
               Tool button () in the upper-left corner of the Pattern Options panel.
            

 Note: To learn more about the Pattern Options panel, search for "Create and edit patterns"
                  in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
               


 Tip: If you want to create pattern variations, you can click Save A Copy in the bar along
                  the top of the Document window when in Pattern Editing mode. This saves the current
                  pattern in the Swatches panel as a copy and allows you to continue creating.
               

If you set the spacing values (H Spacing or V Spacing) to negative values, the artwork
               in the pattern tile will overlap. By default, when objects overlap horizontally, the
               left object is on top; when objects overlap vertically, the top object is on top.
               You can set the overlap values: Left In Front, Right In Front to change overlap horizontally
               or Top In Front, Bottom In Front to change the overlap vertically.
            



Click Done in the bar along the top of the Document window. If a dialog box appears,
               click OK.
            


Choose File > Save.


Applying your pattern
      
You can assign a pattern using a number of different methods. In this section, you'll
         apply your pattern using the fill color in the Properties panel.
      


With nothing selected, click the Previous Artboard button () in the Properties panel to show the larger artboard on the left.
            


With the Selection tool (), click the top cake shape (see the following figure). Choose Edit > Copy and then
               Edit > Paste In Front.
            


Select the swatch named "Cake Top" from the fill color in the Properties panel.


 Note: Instead of making a copy of the shape, you could have applied a second fill to the
                  shape like you did previously.
               



Editing your pattern
Next, you'll edit the Cake Top pattern swatch in Pattern Editing mode.


With the shape still selected, click the Fill color in the Properties panel. Double-click
               the Cake Top pattern swatch to edit it in Pattern Editing mode.
            


Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) several times to zoom in.


In Pattern Editing mode, with the Selection tool () selected, click one of the blue circles; then pressing the Shift key, click to select
               the other.
            


In the Properties panel, change the fill color to the brown swatch named "BG."



Click Done in the gray bar along the top of the Document window to exit Pattern Editing
               mode.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Click the top cake shape with the pattern fill to select it, if necessary.



With the shape selected, double-click the Scale tool () in the Tools panel to scale the pattern but not the shape. In the Scale dialog box,
               change the following options (if not already set):
            


Uniform Scale: 50%

 Tip: In the Scale dialog box, if you wanted to scale the pattern and the shape, you can select Transform Objects and select Transform Patterns. You can
                        also transform patterns in the Transform panel (Window > Transform) by choosing Transform
                        Pattern Only, Transform Object Only, or Transform Both from the panel menu () before applying a transformation.
                     



Scale Corners: Deselected (the default setting)
                  


Scale Strokes & Effects: Deselected (the default setting)

Review answers


A gradient is a graduated blend of two or more colors or of tints of the same color.
                  Gradients can be applied to the stroke or fill of an object.
               


To adjust the blend between colors in a gradient, with the Gradient tool () selected and with the pointer over the gradient annotator or in the Gradient panel,
                  you can drag the diamond icons or the color stops of the gradient slider.
               


To add colors to a gradient, in the Gradient panel, click beneath the gradient slider
                  to add a gradient stop to the gradient. Then, double-click the color stop to edit
                  the color, using the panel that appears to mix a new color or to apply an existing
                  color swatch. You can select the Gradient tool in the Tools panel, position the pointer
                  over the gradient-filled object, and then click beneath the gradient slider that appears
                  in the artwork to add a color stop.
               


Drag with the Gradient tool to adjust the direction of a gradient. Dragging a long
                  distance changes colors gradually; dragging a short distance makes the color change
                  more abrupt. You can also rotate the gradient using the Gradient tool and change the
                  radius, aspect ratio, starting point, and more.
               


The difference between a gradient and a blend is the way that colors combine together—colors
                  blend together within a gradient and between objects in a blend.
               


When you save a pattern in Illustrator, it is saved as a swatch in the Swatches panel.
                  By default, swatches are saved with the currently active document.

         can work with the Blob Brush tool; choose from the Art, Calligraphic, Pattern, Bristle,
         or Scatter brushes; or create new brushes based on your artwork.
      
Starting the lesson
      
In this lesson, you will learn how to work with the different brush types in the Brushes
         panel and how to change brush options and create your own brushes. Before you begin,
         you'll restore the default preferences for Adobe Illustrator CC. Then you'll open
         the finished art file for the lesson to see the finished artwork.
      


To ensure that the tools function and the defaults are set exactly as described in
               this lesson, delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CC preferences
               file. See "Restoring default preferences" in the "Getting Started" section at the
               beginning of the book.
            

 Note: If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson to your computer
                  from your Account page, make sure to do so now. See the "Getting Started" section
                  at the beginning of the book.
               



Start Adobe Illustrator CC.



Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson11 folder,
               and select the L11_end.ai file on your hard disk. Click Open to open the file.
            


If you want, choose View > Zoom Out to make the finished artwork smaller and then
               adjust the window size and leave the artwork on your screen as you work. (Use the
               Hand tool [] to move the artwork to where you want it in the Document window.) If you don't want
               to leave the artwork open, choose File > Close.
            
To begin working, you'll open an existing art file.



Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson11 folder,
               and select the L11_start.ai file on your hard disk. Click Open to open the file.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, name the file CruisePoster.ai, and select the Lesson11 folder. Leave the Format option set to Adobe Illustrator
               (ai) (macOS) or the Save As Type option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows)
               and then click Save.
            


In the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the Illustrator options at their default
               settings and then click OK.
            


Choose Reset Essentials from the workspace switcher in the Application bar to reset
               the workspace.
            

 Note: If you don't see Reset Essentials in the workspace switcher menu, choose Window >
                  Workspace > Essentials before choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
               



Working with brushes
      
Using brushes you can decorate paths with patterns, figures, brush strokes, textures,
         or angled strokes. You can modify the brushes provided with Illustrator and create
         your own brushes.
      
You can apply brush strokes to existing paths, or you can use the Paintbrush tool
         to draw a path and apply a brush stroke simultaneously. You can change the color,
         size, and other features of a brush, and you can edit paths after brushes are applied
         (including adding a fill).
      


Calligraphic brush
Art brush
Bristle brush
Pattern brush
Scatter brush


 Tip: To learn more about Scatter brushes, search for "Scatter brushes" in Illustrator
            Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
         

There are five types of brushes that appear in the Brushes panel (Window > Brushes):
         Calligraphic, Art, Bristle, Pattern, and Scatter. In this lesson, you will discover
         how to work with all of these except for the Scatter brush.

Using Calligraphic brushes
The first type of brush you'll learn about is a Calligraphic brush. Calligraphic brushes
         resemble strokes drawn with the angled point of a calligraphic pen. Calligraphic brushes
         are defined by an elliptical shape whose center follows the path, and you can use
         these brushes to create the appearance of hand-drawn strokes made with a flat, angled
         pen tip.
      

Calligraphic brush examples
Applying a Calligraphic brush to artwork
To get started, you'll filter the type of brushes shown in the Brushes panel so that
         it shows only Calligraphic brushes.
      


Choose Window > Brushes to show the Brushes panel. Click the Brushes panel menu icon
               (), and choose List View.
            


Click the Brushes panel menu icon () again, and deselect Show Art Brushes, Show Bristle Brushes, and Show Pattern Brushes,
               leaving only the Calligraphic brushes visible in the Brushes panel. You can't deselect
               them all at once, so you'll have to keep clicking the menu icon () to access the menu.
            

 Note: A checkmark next to the brush type in the Brushes panel menu indicates that the brush
                  type is visible in the panel.
               



Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and Shift-click both of the two curved pink paths above the
               orange/yellow shape of a ship to select both of them.
            


Select the 5 pt. Flat brush in the Brushes panel to apply it to the pink paths.



Change the Stroke weight to 6 pt in the Properties panel. Click the Stroke color in the Properties panel, make sure
               the Swatches option () is selected, and select White. Press the Escape key to hide the Swatches panel,
               if necessary.
            


 Note: Like drawing with an actual calligraphic pen, when you apply a Calligraphic brush,
                  such as the 5 pt. Flat brush, the more vertically the path is drawn, the thinner the
                  path's stroke appears.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.


With the Selection tool, click the smaller of the white paths (an arrow is pointing
               to it in the figure) that you just applied the brush to. Change the stroke color to
               a light gray in the Properties panel (I chose the color with the tooltip value "C=0,
               M=0, Y=0, K=10").
            



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Drawing with the Paintbrush tool
      
As mentioned earlier, the Paintbrush tool allows you to apply a brush as you paint.
         Painting with the Paintbrush tool creates vector paths that you can edit with the
         Paintbrush tool or other drawing tools. Next, you'll use the Paintbrush tool to paint
         waves in the water with a calligraphic brush from a default brush library. Your waves
         won't look identical to what you see in the lesson, and that's okay—just have some fun.
      


With the Selection tool (), click the darker blue water shape below the ship.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.
The water shape is on a sublayer behind the ship. Selecting the water shape selects
               that sublayer in the Layers panel, which means that all of the waves you create will
               also be on the same sublayer as the water shape.
            


Select the Paintbrush tool () in the Tools panel.
            



Click the Brush Libraries Menu button () at the bottom of the Brushes panel, and choose Artistic > Artistic_Calligraphic.
               A brush library panel with various brushes appears.
            
Illustrator comes with a host of brush libraries that you can use in your artwork.
               Each of the brush types discussed previously has a series of libraries to choose from.
            



Click the Artistic_Calligraphic panel menu icon (), and choose List View. Click the brush named "50 pt. Flat" to add it to the Brushes
               panel.
            


Close the Artistic_Calligraphic brush library.
Selecting a brush from a brush library, such as the Artistic_Calligraphic library,
               adds that brush to the Brushes panel for the active document only.
            


Change the fill color to None (), the stroke color to the swatch named "Dark Blue," and the stroke weight to 1 pt (if necessary) in the Properties panel.
            
Notice that the Paintbrush pointer has an asterisk next to it (), indicating that you are about to paint a new path.
            


Position the pointer off the left side of the artboard, just below the ship. Paint
               a long, curving path from left to right, stopping about halfway across the water (see
               the figure). Try creating three more paths, painting from left to right, going all
               the way across the water. You can see the figure for ideas on how I painted.
            

 Note: This Calligraphic brush creates random angles on the paths, so yours may not look
                  like what you see in the figures, and that's okay.
               




Choose Select > Deselect (if necessary) and then choose File > Save.


Editing paths with the Paintbrush tool
Now you'll use the Paintbrush tool to edit one of the paths you painted.


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and click to select the first path you drew on the water (the
               one that is just below the bottom of the ship).
            


Select the Paintbrush tool () in the Tools panel. Position the pointer near the right end of the selected path.
               An asterisk will not appear next to the pointer when it's positioned over a selected path. Drag to the
               right to extend the path all the way to the right edge of the artboard. The selected
               path is edited from the point where you began drawing.
            


 Tip: You can also edit paths drawn with the Paintbrush tool using the Smooth tool () and the Path Eraser tool (), located under the Pencil tool () in the Tools panel.
               



Press and hold the Command (macOS) or Ctrl (Windows) key to toggle to the Selection
               tool, and click to select another curved path you drew with the Paintbrush tool. After
               clicking, release the key to return to the Paintbrush tool.
            


With the Paintbrush tool, move the pointer over some part of the selected path. When
               the asterisk disappears next to the pointer, drag to the right to redraw the path.
            


Choose Select > Deselect (if necessary) and then choose File > Save.
Next, you will edit the Paintbrush tool options.



Double-click the Paintbrush tool () in the Tools panel to display the Paintbrush Tool Options dialog box, and make the
               following changes:
            


Fidelity: Drag the slider all the way to Smooth (to the right).


Keep Selected: Selected.
                  




Click OK.
The Paintbrush Tool Options dialog box changes the way the Paintbrush tool functions.
               For the Fidelity option, the closer to Smooth you drag the slider, the smoother the
               path will be with fewer points. Also, because you selected Keep Selected, the paths
               remain selected after you finish drawing them.
            


Change the stroke color to the swatch named "Medium Blue," and change the stroke weight
               to 0.5 pt in the Properties panel.
            



With the Paintbrush tool selected, paint three or four more paths from either left
               to right or right to left across the water shape below the ship.
            
Notice that after painting each path, the path is still selected, so you could edit
               it if you needed. I already deselected in the figure.
            


Double-click the Paintbrush tool in the Tools panel. In the Paintbrush Tool Options
               dialog box, deselect the Keep Selected option, and then click OK.
            
Now the paths will not remain selected after you finish drawing them, and you can draw overlapping paths
               without altering previously drawn paths.
            

 Note: When the Keep Selected option is deselected, you can edit a path by selecting it
                  with the Selection tool () or by selecting a segment or point on the path with the Direct Selection tool () and then redrawing part of the path with the Paintbrush tool, like you saw previously.
               



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Editing a brush
To change the options for a brush, you can double-click the brush in the Brushes panel.
         When you edit a brush, you can also choose whether to change artwork to which the
         brush has been applied. Next, you'll change the appearance of the 50 pt. Flat brush
         you've been painting with.
      


In the Brushes panel, double-click the brush thumbnail to the left of the text "50
               pt. Flat" or to the right of the name in the Brushes panel to open the Calligraphic
               Brush Options dialog box.
            

 Note: The edits you make will change the brush for this document only.
               





In the dialog box, make the following changes:


Name: 30 pt. Flat


Angle: 0°


Choose Fixed from the menu to the right of Angle. (When Random is chosen, a random
                     variation of brush angles is created every time you draw.)
                  


Roundness: 5% (the default setting)
                  


Size: 30 pt



 Tip: The Preview window in the dialog box (below the Name field) shows the changes that
                  you make to the brush.
               



Click OK.


In the dialog box that appears, click Leave Strokes so as not to apply the brush change
               to the existing waves that have the brush applied.
            


Change the stroke color to the swatch named "Light Blue," and change the stroke weight
               to 1 pt in the Properties panel.
            



Click the 30 pt. Flat brush in the Brushes panel to ensure that you will paint with
               it applied. With the Paintbrush tool () selected, paint three paths across the water to create more waves, overlapping the
               existing waves.
            


Choose Select > Deselect, if necessary, and then choose File > Save.

 Note: The artwork should be deselected already, and, if it is, the Deselect command will
                  be dimmed (you can't select it).
               



Removing a brush stroke
You can easily remove a brush stroke applied to artwork where you don't want it. Now
         you'll remove the brush stroke on the cloud.
      


Select the Selection tool (), and click the blue cloud with the white stroke.
            



Click the Remove Brush Stroke button () at the bottom of the Brushes panel.
            
Removing a brush stroke doesn't remove the stroke color and weight; it just removes
               the brush applied.
            

 Note: The figure shows the result of clicking the Remove Brush Stroke button.
               



Change the stroke weight to 0 pt in the Properties panel.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Using Art brushes
      
Art brushes stretch artwork or an embedded raster image evenly along the length of
         a path. As with other brushes, you can edit the brush options to affect how the brush
         is applied to artwork.
      

Art brush examples
Applying an existing Art brush
Next, you'll apply an existing Art brush to waves at the front of the boat.


In the Brushes panel, click the Brushes panel menu icon (), and deselect Show Calligraphic Brushes. Then select Show Art Brushes from the same
               panel menu to make the art brushes visible in the Brushes panel.
            


Click the Brush Libraries Menu button () at the bottom of the Brushes panel, and choose Artistic > Artistic_Paintbrush.
            



Click the Artistic_Paintbrush panel menu icon (), and choose List View. Click the brush named "Brush 3" in the list to add the brush
               to the Brushes panel for this document. Close the Artistic_Paintbrush panel group.
            


Select the Paintbrush tool () in the Tools panel.
            


Change the fill color to None (), the stroke color to White (if necessary), and the stroke weight to 1 pt (if necessary) in the Properties panel.
            



Click the Layers panel tab on the right side of the workspace to open the Layers panel.
               Click the Spray/Tree sublayer so that the new artwork is on that layer. Click the
               Properties panel tab to show that panel again.
            


Position the Paintbrush pointer () at the bottom front of the ship in the red area (marked with an X in the following
               figure). Drag to the left along the bottom of the red strip on the ship, just along
               the water line. See the figure for how I painted it, and don't worry about being exact.
               You can always choose Edit > Undo Art Stroke and repaint the path.
            


 Tip: With the Paintbrush pointer selected, press the Caps Lock key to see a precise cursor
                  (X). In certain situations, this can help to paint with more precision.
               



Paint a path from the same starting point (the red X in the previous figure), but drag to the right this time.
            


Paint a "U" shape from left to right to cover any red showing. See the figure—start
               at the X in the figure for the "U" shape.
            



Try adding a few more painted paths, always starting from the same point as the original
               path you painted.
            



Choose File > Save.


Creating an Art brush using a raster image

 Note: To learn about guidelines for creating brushes, see "Create or modify brushes" in
            Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
         


 Note: You may need to click the Options button on macOS to see the Link option.
         

In this section, you'll place a raster image and embed it so you can create a new
         Art brush from it. Images you use in an art brush cannot be linked.
      


Choose File > Place. In the Place dialog box, navigate to the Lesson11 folder, and
               select the image named tree.psd. Make sure to deselect the Link option. Click Place.
            




Move the pointer off of the right edge of the artboard. Click to place the image.
Next, you'll make an Art brush from the selected artwork. You can make an Art brush
               from vector artwork or from embedded raster images, but that artwork must not contain
               gradients, blends, other brush strokes, mesh objects, graphs, linked files, masks,
               or text that has not been converted to outlines.
            


 Note: When dealing with embedded images and brushes, there is a direct impact on the performance
                  of the document in Illustrator. There is a fixed limit to the size of the embedded
                  image that can be used for a brush. You may see a dialog box telling you that the
                  image needs to be resampled before you can make a brush from it.
               



Select the Selection tool (). Choose Window > Brushes to open the Brushes panel, if it isn't open already. With
               the placed image still selected, click the New Brush button () at the bottom of the Brushes panel. This begins the process of creating a new brush
               from the selected raster artwork.
            


In the New Brush dialog box, select Art Brush and then click OK.



In the Art Brush Options dialog box that appears, change the name to Palm Tree. Click OK.
            


Delete the image you placed off the right side of the artboard since you don't need
               it anymore.
            


With the Selection tool selected, click to select the curved black line to the right
               of the ship.
            



Click the brush named "Palm Tree" in the Brushes panel to apply it.
Notice that the original tree image is stretched along the path. This is the default
               behavior of an Art brush.
            


Editing an Art brush
      
Next, you'll edit the Palm Tree Art brush and update the appearance of the palm tree
         on the artboard.
      



With the curved path still selected on the artboard, double-click the brush thumbnail
               to the left of the text "Palm tree" or to the right of the name in the Brushes panel
               to open the Art Brush Options dialog box.
            


 Tip: To learn more about the Art Brush Options dialog box, see "Art brush options" in
                  Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
               



In the Art Brush Options dialog box, select Preview to see the changes as you make
               them, and move the dialog box so you can see the curvy line with the brush applied.
               Make the following changes:
            


Stretch Between Guides: Selected


Start: 5 in


End: 6 in


Flip Across: Selected




Click OK.


In the dialog box that appears, click Apply To Strokes to apply the change to the
               curvy line that has the Palm Tree brush applied.
            


Click the word "Opacity" in the Properties panel, and choose Multiply from the Blend
               Mode menu. Press Enter or Return to close the Transparency panel.
            



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Using Bristle brushes
      
Bristle brushes allow you to create strokes with the appearance of a natural brush
         with bristles. Painting with a Bristle brush, using the Paintbrush tool, creates vector
         paths with the Bristle brush applied.
      
In this section, you'll start by adjusting options for a brush to change how it appears
         in the artwork and then paint with the Paintbrush tool and a Bristle brush to create
         smoke.
      

Bristle brush examples
Changing Bristle brush options

 Note: To learn more about the Bristle Brush Options dialog box and its settings, see "Using
            the Bristle brush" in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
         

As you've seen, you can change the appearance of a brush by adjusting its settings
         in the Brush Options dialog box, either before or after brushes have been applied
         to artwork. In the case of Bristle brushes, it's usually best to adjust the brush
         settings prior to painting since it can take some time to update the brush strokes.
      


In the Brushes panel, click the panel menu icon (), choose Show Bristle Brushes, and then deselect Show Art Brushes.
            


Double-click the thumbnail for the default Mop brush or double-click directly to the
               right of the brush name in the Brushes panel to change the options for that brush.
               In the Bristle Brush Options dialog box, make the following changes:
            



Shape: Round Fan (the default setting)
                  

 Tip: Illustrator comes with a series of default Bristle brushes. Click the Brush Libraries
                        Menu button () at the bottom of the Brushes panel, and choose Bristle Brush > Bristle Brush Library.
                     



Size: 7 mm (The brush size is the diameter of the brush.)
                  


Bristle Length: 150% (the default setting) (The bristle length starts from the point where the bristles
                     meet the handle of the bristle tip.)
                  


Bristle Density: 20% (The bristle density is the number of bristles in a specified area of the brush neck.)
                  


Bristle Thickness: 75% (the default setting) (The bristle thickness can vary from fine to coarse [between
                     1% and 100%].)
                  


Paint Opacity: 75% (the default setting) (This option lets you set the opacity of the paint being used.)
                  


Stiffness: 50% (the default setting) (Stiffness refers to the rigidness of the bristles.)
                  




Click OK.


Painting with a Bristle brush
      
Now you'll use the Mop brush to draw some smoke above the ship. Painting with a Bristle
         brush can create an organic, fluid path. To constrain the painting, you will paint
         inside a shape. This will mask (hide) part of the painting to be in the shape of smoke.
      


Select the Zoom tool () in the Tools panel, and click a few times, slowly, on the smoke shape above the
               ship (not the cloud) to zoom in on it.
            



Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and click to select the smoke shape. This selects the layer
               that the shape is on so that any artwork you paint will be on the same layer.
            


Click the Draw Inside button () at the bottom of the Tools panel.
            

 Note: To learn more about the drawing modes, see Lesson 3, "Using Shapes to Create Artwork for a Postcard."
               


 Note: If the Tools panel appears as one column, click the Drawing Modes button () at the bottom of the Tools panel, and then choose Draw Inside from the menu that
                  appears.
               



With the smoke shape still selected, change the fill color to None () in the Properties panel (press the Escape key to hide the Swatches panel). Leave
               the stroke as is.
            


Choose Select > Deselect to deselect the smoke shape.
The dotted lines on the corners of the shape indicate that any paths you paint will
               be masked by the smoke shape.
            



Select the Paintbrush tool () in the Tools panel. Choose the Mop brush from the Brush menu in the Properties panel,
               if it's not already chosen.
            


Make sure that the fill color is None () and the stroke color is White in the Properties panel. Press the Escape key to hide
               the Swatches panel. Make sure that the stroke weight is 1 pt in the Properties panel.
            


Position the pointer at the top of the largest smokestack. (See the red X in the following
               figure.) Drag up and then down and to the left to loosely follow the edge of the smoke
               shape. Release the mouse button when you reach the end of the smoke shape.
            

 Tip: If you don't like what you just painted, you can choose Edit > Undo Bristle Stroke.
               

When you release the mouse button, notice that part of the path you just painted is
               masked (hidden) by the smoke shape.
            

 Tip: If you want to edit paths as you draw, you can select the Keep Selected option in
                  the Paintbrush Tool Options for the Paintbrush tool or you can select paths with the
                  Selection tool. You don't need to completely fill the shape.
               



Use the Paintbrush tool to paint more paths inside the smoke shape, using the Mop
               brush. Try drawing from each of the smokestacks, following the smoke shape. The idea
               is to fill up the smoke shape with the paths you paint.
            

 Note: In the first part of the figure, I dimmed the shape paths so you could more easily
                  see the smoke paths.
               




Cleaning up the shapes
Next, you'll remove the stroke on the smoke shape.


Choose View > Outline to see all of the paths you just created when painting.



Choose Select > Object > Bristle Brush Strokes to select all of the paths created
               with the Paintbrush tool using the Mop brush.
            


Choose Object > Group and then choose View > GPU Preview if supported or View > Preview
               On CPU if not.
            

 Note: If the Tools panel appears as one column, click the Drawing Modes button at the bottom
                  of the Tools panel and then choose Draw Normal from the menu that appears.
               


 Note: Be careful you don't double-click on the path with the Palm Tree brush applied, since
                  it may overlap the smoke shape.
               



Click the Draw Normal button () at the bottom of the Tools panel.
            


Select the Selection tool in the Tools panel. Choose Select > Deselect.


Double-click in the smoke shape to enter Isolation mode. Click the edge of the original
               smoke shape to select it. Change the stroke color to None () in the Properties panel.
            



Press the Escape key several times to hide the panel and to exit Isolation mode.


 Tip: You can also double-click away from the artwork to exit Isolation mode.
               



Click the Layers tab on the right side of the workspace to show the Layers panel.
               Click the eye icon () to the left of the Spray/Tree sublayer name to hide the artwork on that layer. Click
               the Properties panel tab to show that panel again.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.
When saving, you may see a warning dialog box indicating that the document contains
               multiple Bristle brush paths with transparency. As mentioned earlier, painting with
               a Bristle brush creates a series of individual vector paths with the brush applied.
               This can lead to issues with printing or saving to EPS/PDF or legacy versions of Illustrator
               documents. In order to reduce the complexity and number of the Bristle Brush paths,
               you can rasterize paths with a Bristle brush applied. Select the path(s) with the
               Bristle brush applied, and choose Object > Rasterize.
            



The Bristle brush and graphic tablets
When you use Bristle brush with a graphic tablet, Illustrator interactively tracks
            the movements of the stylus over the tablet. It interprets all aspects of its orientation
            and pressure input at any point along a drawing path. Illustrator provides the output
            that is modeled on the stylus's x-axis position, y-axis position, pressure, tilt,
            bearing, and rotation.

Using Pattern brushes
      
Pattern brushes paint a pattern made up of separate sections, or tiles. When you apply a Pattern brush to artwork, different tiles of the pattern are applied
         to different sections of the path, depending on where the section falls on the path—the
         end, middle, or corner. There are hundreds of interesting Pattern brushes that you
         can choose from when creating your own projects, from grass to cityscapes. Next, you'll
         apply an existing Pattern brush to a path to create windows on the ship.
      

Pattern brush examples


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


In the Brushes panel, click the panel menu icon (), choose Show Pattern Brushes, and then deselect Show Bristle Brushes.
            
The brush named "Windows" that appears in the Brushes panel is a brush that I created
               and saved with the file. Next, you'll apply a Pattern brush, and then edit its properties.
            

 Tip: Just like other brush types, there is a series of default Pattern brush libraries
                  that come with Illustrator. To access them, click the Brush Libraries Menu button
                  (), and choose a library from one of the menus (the Decorative menu, for example).
               



With the Selection tool () selected, Shift-click the two black paths on the orange/yellow shape to select them
               both.
            



Select the Windows Pattern brush from the Brushes panel to apply the Pattern brush.
Next, you'll edit the brush properties for one of the paths.


Choose Select > Deselect and then click the bottommost path with the Windows brush
               applied to select it.
            



Click the Options Of Selected Object button () in the Properties panel to edit the brush options for only the selected path on
               the artboard.
            



 Tip: To change the size of the windows, you can also change the stroke weight of the lines
                  on the artboard, with the brush applied.
               

Select Preview in the Stroke Options (Pattern Brush) dialog box. Change the Scale
               to 110% either by dragging the Scale slider or by typing in the value. Click OK.
            


 Tip: You'll also see the Options Of Selected Object button () at the bottom of the Brushes panel.
               

When you edit the brush options of the selected object, you only see some of the brush
               options. The Stroke Options (Pattern Brush) dialog box is used to edit the properties
               of the brushed path without updating the corresponding brush.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Creating a Pattern brush
You can create a Pattern brush in several ways. For a simple pattern applied to a
         straight line, for instance, you can select the content that you're using for the
         pattern and click the New Brush button () at the bottom of the Brushes panel.
      
To create a more complex pattern to apply to objects with curves and corners, you
         can select artwork in the Document window to be used in a pattern brush, create swatches
         in the Swatches panel from the artwork that you are using in the Pattern brush, and
         even have Illustrator autogenerate the Pattern brush corners. In Illustrator, only
         the side tile needs to be defined. Illustrator automatically generates four different
         types of corners based on the art used for the side tile. These four autogenerated
         options fit the corners perfectly. Next, you'll create a Pattern brush for the border
         around the poster.
      


Choose View > Pattern objects. This should show you a zoomed-in view of the life preserver
               and the rope off the right edge of the artboard.
            

 Note: You'll find Pattern Objects at the bottom of the View menu.
               



With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the brown rope group.
            


Click the panel menu icon () in the Brushes panel, and choose Thumbnail View.
            
Notice that Pattern brushes in the Brushes panel are segmented in Thumbnail view.
               Each segment corresponds to a pattern tile.
            



In the Brushes panel, click the New Brush button () to create a pattern out of the rope.
            


In the New Brush dialog box, select Pattern Brush. Click OK.
A new Pattern brush can be made regardless of whether artwork is selected. If you
               create a Pattern brush without artwork selected, it is assumed that you will add artwork
               by dragging it into the Brushes panel later or by selecting the artwork from a pattern
               swatch you create as you edit the brush. You will see the latter method later in this
               section.
            


In the Pattern Brush Options dialog box, name the brush Border.
            
Pattern brushes can have up to five tiles—the side, start, and end tiles, plus an
               outer-corner tile and an inner-corner tile to paint sharp corners on a path.

 Note: Some brushes have no corner tiles because they are designed for curved paths.
               


You can see all five tiles as buttons below the Spacing option in the dialog box.
               The tile buttons let you apply different artwork to different parts of the path. You
               can click a tile button for the tile you want to define, and then you select an autogenerated
               selection (if available) or a pattern swatch from the menu that appears.
            


 Tip: Selected artwork becomes the side tile, by default, when creating a Pattern brush.
               



Under the Spacing option, click the Side Tile box (the second tile from the left).
               The artwork that was originally selected is in the menu that appears, along with None
               and any pattern swatches found in the Swatches panel. Choose Pompadour from the menu.
            
In the Preview area below the tiles, you will see how the new artwork affects a path.

 Tip: Position the pointer over the tile squares in the Pattern Brush Options dialog box
                  to see a tooltip indicating which tile it is.
               



Click the Side Tile box again, and choose the option called "Original."



Click the Outer Corner Tile box to reveal the menu.
The outer-corner tile has been generated automatically by Illustrator, based on the
               original rope artwork. In the menu, you can choose from four types of corners that
               are generated automatically:
            


Auto-Centered. The side tile is stretched around the corner and centered on it.
                  

 Tip: To save a brush and reuse it in another file, you can create a brush library with
                        the brushes you want to use. For more information, see "Work with brush libraries"
                        in Illustrator Help.
                     



Auto-Between. Copies of the side tile extend all the way into the corner, with one copy on each
                     side. Folding elimination is used to stretch them into shape.
                  


Auto-Sliced. The side tile is sliced diagonally, and the pieces come together, similar to a miter
                     joint in a wooden picture frame.
                  


Auto-Overlap. Copies of the tiles overlap at the corner.
                  




Choose Auto-Between from the menu. This generates the outer corner of any path that
               the Pattern brush will be applied to from the rope.
            



Click OK. The Border brush appears in the Brushes panel.


Applying a Pattern brush
In this section, you'll apply the Border Pattern brush to a rectangular border around
         the artwork. As you've seen, when you use drawing tools to apply brushes to artwork,
         you first draw the path with the drawing tool and then select the brush in the Brushes
         panel to apply the brush to the path.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


With the Selection tool () selected, click the white stroke of the rectangle on the border.
            


In the Tools panel, click the Fill box, and make sure that None () is selected. Then click the Stroke box and select None ().
            


With the rectangle selected, click the Border brush in the Brushes panel.



Choose Select > Deselect.
The rectangle is painted with the Border brush, with the side tile on the sides and
               the outer-corner tile on each corner.
            


Editing the Pattern brush

 Tip: For more information on creating pattern swatches, see "About patterns" in Illustrator
            Help.
         

Now you'll edit the Border Pattern brush using a pattern swatch that you create.


Choose Window > Swatches to open the Swatches panel.


Choose View > Pattern objects to zoom in to the life preserver off the right edge
               of the artboard.
            



With the Selection tool (), drag the life preserver into the Swatches panel.
            
The new pattern swatch appears in the Swatches panel. After you create a pattern brush,
               you can delete the pattern swatches from the Swatches panel, if you don't plan to
               use them for additional artwork.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.
            


In the Swatches panel, double-click the pattern swatch that you just created to enter
               Pattern Editing mode.
            



In the Pattern Options dialog box, name the swatch Corner.
            
You don't have to name the pattern swatch, but it can make it easier to select when
               you edit the brush.
            


Click Done in the gray bar, along the top of the Document window, to finish editing
               the pattern.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


In the Brushes panel (Window > Brushes), double-click the Border Pattern brush to
               open the Pattern Brush Options dialog box.
            



Click the Outer Corner Tile box, and choose the Corner pattern swatch from the menu
               that appears (you'll need to scroll). Change Scale from 100% to 70%, and click OK. The figure shows choosing the outer-corner tile.
            

 Tip: You can also change the pattern tiles in a Pattern brush by pressing the Option (macOS)
                  or Alt (Windows) key and dragging artwork from the artboard onto the tile of the Pattern
                  brush you want to change in the Brushes panel.
               



In the dialog box that appears, click Apply To Strokes to update the border on the
               artboard.
            



With the Selection tool selected, click to select one of the paths that contains a
               row of windows. Click the Border brush in the Brushes panel to apply it.
            
Notice that the life preservers are not applied to the path. The path is painted with
               the side tile from the Border brush. Because the path does not include sharp corners,
               outer-corner and inner-corner tiles are not applied to the path.
            


Choose Edit > Undo Apply Pattern Brush to remove the brush from the path.

 Note: Earlier in the lesson, you learned how to remove a brush from an object by clicking
                  the Remove Brush Stroke button () in the Brushes panel. In this case, you chose Edit > Undo Apply Pattern Brush instead,
                  because clicking the Remove Brush Stroke button would strip the previous formatting
                  from the path, leaving it with a default fill and stroke.
               



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Working with the Blob Brush tool
      
You can use the Blob Brush tool () to paint filled shapes that intersect and merge with other shapes of the same color.
         With the Blob Brush tool, you can draw with Paintbrush tool artistry. Unlike the Paintbrush
         tool, which lets you create open paths, the Blob Brush tool lets you create a closed
         shape with a fill only (no stroke) that you can then easily edit with the Eraser or
         Blob Brush tool. Shapes that have a stroke cannot be edited with the Blob Brush tool.
      

Path created with the Paintbrush tool

Shape created with the Blob Brush tool
Drawing with the Blob Brush tool
Next, you'll use the Blob Brush tool to create part of a cloud.


Click the Layers panel tab on the right side of the workspace to show the Layers panel.
               Click the eye icon () to the left of the Ship sublayer to hide the contents of the layer. Click the Background
               sublayer to select it.
            



In the Swatches panel, select the Fill color box and then select the swatch named
               "Light Blue." Select the Stroke color box and select None () to remove the stroke.
            

When drawing with the Blob Brush tool, if a fill and stroke are set before drawing,
               the stroke color becomes the fill color of the shape made by the Blob Brush tool.
               If only a fill is set before drawing, it ultimately becomes the fill of the shape
               created.
            


Click and hold down on the Paintbrush tool () in the Tools panel, and select the Blob Brush tool (). Double-click the Blob Brush tool in the Tools panel. In the Blob Brush Tool Options
               dialog box, change the following:
            


Keep Selected: Selected


Size: 70 pt
                  




Click OK.



Position the pointer to the left of the little blue cloud in the sky. Drag to create
               a cloud shape that doesn't touch the little cloud to the right of it (see the figure).
            

When you draw with the Blob Brush tool, you create filled, closed shapes. Those shapes
               can contain any type of fill, including gradients, solid colors, patterns, and more.
               Notice that the Blob Brush pointer has a circle around it before you begin painting.
               That circle indicates the size of the brush (70 pt, which you set in the previous
               step).
            

 Tip: You can also change the Blob Brush size by pressing the right bracket key ( ] ) or
                  left bracket key ( [ ) several times to increase or decrease the size of the brush.
               



Merging paths with the Blob Brush tool
      
In addition to drawing new shapes with the Blob Brush tool, you can use it to intersect
         and merge shapes of the same color. Objects merged with the Blob Brush tool need to
         have the same appearance attributes, have no stroke, be on the same layer or group,
         and be adjacent to each other in the stacking order.
      

 Note: To learn more about Blob Brush tool guidelines, search for "Painting with fills and
            strokes" in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help). On that Help page, go to the
            section titled "Draw and merge paths with the Blob Brush tool."
         


 Note: In the figure, the cloud you drew has a blue outline. You may not see that, and that's
            okay.
         

Next, you will merge the cloud you just created with the little cloud to the right
         of it to create one big cloud.
      


Choose Select > Deselect.


With the Blob Brush tool () selected, drag from inside the cloud shape you created to the inside of the little
               cloud to the right, connecting the two shapes.
            


 Note: If you find that the shapes are not merging, it may be that they have different strokes
                  and fills. You can select both the cloud you created and the small cloud with the
                  Selection tool () and ensure that the fill color is the light blue swatch and the stroke is None in
                  the Properties panel. Then you can select the Blob Brush tool and try dragging from
                  one cloud to the other.
               



Continue drawing with the Blob Brush tool to make the two clouds look more like a
               single cloud.
            
If you find that new shapes are being made instead of the existing cloud shape being
               edited, undo what you've created. Then, with the Selection tool (), reselect and deselect the cloud shape and continue.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.



Editing with the Eraser tool
      

 Tip: As you draw with the Blob Brush and Eraser tools, it is recommended that you use
            shorter strokes and release the mouse button often. You can undo the edits that you
            make, but if you draw in one long stroke without releasing the mouse button, an undo
            removes the entire stroke.
         

As you draw and merge shapes with the Blob Brush tool, you may draw too much and want
         to edit what you've done. You can use the Eraser tool () in combination with the Blob Brush tool to mold the shape and to correct any changes
         you don't like.
      


With the Selection tool (), click to select the cloud shape.
            
Selecting the shape(s) before erasing limits the Eraser tool to erasing only the selected
               shape(s).
            


Double-click the Eraser tool () in the Tools panel. In the Eraser Tool Options dialog box, change Size to 40 pt, and click OK.
            



Position the pointer over the edge of the cloud shape and, with the Eraser tool, drag
               along the bottom of the cloud shape to remove some of it. Try switching between the
               Blob Brush tool and the Eraser tool to edit the cloud.
            
The Blob Brush and Eraser tools both have pointers that include a circle, indicating
               the diameter of the brush.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


Click the Layers panel tab on the right side of the workspace to show the Layers panel,
               if necessary. Click the visibility columns to the left of all the sublayers to ensure
               that they are all showing. Click to select the main layer named "Mask" at the top
               of the Layers panel. Click the Make/Release Clipping Mask button () at the bottom of the Layers panel.
            

By clicking the Make/Release Clipping Mask button, you are taking an existing rectangle
               shape and using it to mask content. To learn more about masking, see Lesson 14, "Using Illustrator CC with Other Adobe Applications."
            


Choose Object > Show All to show some poster text.


Choose Select > Deselect.


Choose File > Save, and close all open files.




Review questions
         


What is the difference between applying a brush to artwork using the Paintbrush tool
                  () and applying a brush to artwork using one of the drawing tools?
               


Describe how artwork in an Art brush is applied to content.


Describe how to edit paths with the Paintbrush tool as you draw. How does the Keep
                  Selected option affect the Paintbrush tool?
               


What must be done to a raster image in order for it to be used in certain brushes?


For which brush types must you have artwork selected on the artboard before you can
                  create a brush?
               


What does the Blob Brush tool () allow you to create?
               




Review answers


When painting with the Paintbrush tool (), if a brush is chosen in the Brushes panel and you draw on the artboard, the brush
                  is applied directly to the paths as you draw. To apply brushes using a drawing tool,
                  you select the tool and draw in the artwork. Then you select the path in the artwork and choose a brush in the Brushes panel. The brush
                  is applied to the selected path.
               


An Art brush is made from artwork (vector or embedded raster). When you apply an Art
                  brush to the stroke of an object, the artwork in the Art brush, by default, is stretched
                  along the selected object stroke.
               


To edit a path with the Paintbrush tool, drag over a selected path to redraw it. The
                  Keep Selected option keeps the last path selected as you draw with the Paintbrush
                  tool. Leave the Keep Selected option selected when you want to easily edit the previous
                  path as you draw. Deselect the Keep Selected option when you want to draw layered
                  paths with the paintbrush without altering previous paths. When Keep Selected is deselected,
                  you can use the Selection tool () to select a path and then edit it.
               


In order to be used in certain brushes (Art, Pattern, and Scatter), a raster image
                  must be embedded.
               


For Art (and Scatter) brushes, you need to have artwork selected in order to create
                  a brush using the New Brush button () in the Brushes panel.
               


Use the Blob Brush tool () to edit filled shapes that you can intersect and merge with other shapes of the
                  same color or to create artwork from scratch.

This lesson takes approximately 60 minutes to complete. Please log in to your account
            on peachpit.com to download the lesson files for this chapter, or go to the "Getting Started" section
            at the beginning of this book and follow the instructions under "Accessing the lesson
            files and Web Edition."
         
Your Account page is also where you'll find any updates to the chapters or to the
            lesson files. Look on the Lesson & Update Files tab to access the most current content.
         


You can change the look of an object without changing its structure simply by applying
         attributes, such as fills, strokes, and effects, from the Appearance panel. And because
         the effects themselves are live, they can be modified or removed at any time. This
         allows you to save the appearance attributes as graphic styles and apply them to another
         object.
      
Starting the lesson
      
In this lesson, you'll change the appearance of artwork using the Appearance panel,
         various effects, and graphic styles. Before you begin, you'll need to restore the
         default preferences for Adobe Illustrator. Then you'll open a file containing the
         finished artwork to see what you'll create.
      


To ensure that the tools function and the defaults are set exactly as described in
               this lesson, delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CC preferences
               file. See "Restoring default preferences" in the "Getting Started" section at the
               beginning of the book.
            

 Note: If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson to your computer
                  from your Account page, make sure to do so now. See the "Getting Started" section
                  at the beginning of the book.
               



Start Adobe Illustrator CC.



Choose File > Open, and open the L12_end.ai file in the Lessons > Lesson12 folder
               on your hard disk.
            
This file displays a completed illustration of a flyer for a bike tour company.


In the Missing Fonts dialog box that most likely will appear, click Sync Fonts to
               sync all of the missing fonts to your computer. After they are synced and you see
               the message stating that there are no more missing fonts, click Close.
            

If you can't get the fonts to sync, you can go to the Creative Cloud desktop application
               and choose Assets > Fonts to see what the issue may be (refer to the section "Changing
               font family and font style" in Lesson 8, "Adding Type to a Poster," for more information on how to resolve it).
            
You can also just click Close in the Missing Fonts dialog box and ignore the missing
               fonts as you proceed. A third method is to click the Find Fonts button in the Missing
               Fonts dialog box and replace the fonts with a local font on your machine. You can
               also go to Help (Help > Illustrator Help) and search for "Find missing fonts."
            

 Note: You will need an Internet connection to sync fonts.
               



Choose View > Zoom Out to make the finished artwork smaller. Adjust the window size,
               and leave it on your screen as you work. (Use the Hand tool [] to move the artwork where you want it in the window.) If you don't want to leave
               the image open, choose File > Close.
            
To begin working, you'll open an existing art file.



Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson12 folder,
               and select the L12_start.ai file on your hard disk. Click Open to open the file.
            
The L12_start.ai file uses the same fonts as the L12_end.ai file. If you've synced
               the fonts already, you don't need to do it again. If you didn't open the L12_end.ai
               file, then the Missing Fonts dialog box will most likely appear for this step. Click
               Sync Fonts to sync all of the missing fonts to your computer. After they are synced
               and you see the message stating that there are no more missing fonts, click Close.
            

 Note: For help on resolving any missing fonts, refer to step 4.
               



Choose File > Save As, name the file BikeTours.ai, and select the Lesson12 folder. Leave the Format option set to Adobe Illustrator
               (ai) (macOS) or the Save As Type option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows)
               and then click Save.
            


In the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the Illustrator options at their default
               settings and then click OK.
            


Choose Reset Essentials from the workspace switcher in the Application bar to reset
               the workspace.
            

 Note: If you don't see Reset Essentials in the workspace switcher menu, choose Window >
                  Workspace > Essentials before choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
               



Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Using the Appearance panel
      
An appearance attribute is an aesthetic property—such as a fill, stroke, transparency, or effect—that affects
         the look of an object but does not affect its basic structure. Up to this point, you've
         been changing appearance attributes in the Properties panel, Swatches panel, and more.
         Appearance attributes like these can also be found in the Appearance panel for selected
         artwork. In this lesson, you'll focus on using the Appearance panel to apply and edit
         appearance attributes.
      


Select the Selection tool (), and click to select the orange shape in the background, behind the "CALL 1-800..."
               text.
            


Click More Options () in the Appearance section of the Properties panel on the right (an arrow is pointing
               to it in the following figure) to open the Appearance panel.
            

The Appearance panel shows what the object is (a path) and the appearance attributes
               applied to it (Stroke, Fill, Drop Shadow, and Opacity).
            

 Tip: You may want to drag the bottom of the Appearance panel down to make it taller, like
                  I did.
               

The different options available in the Appearance panel are described here:

 Tip: You can also choose Window > Appearance to see the Appearance panel.
               



Selected object and thumbnail
Attribute row
Visibility column
Link to options
Add New Stroke
Add New Fill
Add New Effect
Clear Appearance
Duplicate Selected Item
Delete Selected Item
Indicates an effect applied

The Appearance panel (Window > Appearance) can be used to view and adjust the appearance
               attributes for a selected object, group, or layer. Fills and strokes are listed in
               stacking order; top to bottom in the panel correlates to front to back in the artwork.
               Effects applied to artwork are listed from top to bottom in the order in which they
               are applied to the artwork. An advantage of using appearance attributes is that they
               can be changed or removed at any time without affecting the underlying artwork or
               any other attributes applied to the object in the Appearance panel.
            


Editing appearance attributes
You'll start by changing the appearance of artwork using the Appearance panel.


With the orange shape selected, in the Appearance panel, click the orange Fill color
               box in the fill attribute row as many times as needed, until the Swatches panel appears.
               Select the swatch named "Mountain1" to apply it to the fill. Press the Escape key
               to hide the Swatches panel.
            


 Note: You may need to click the Fill box more than once to open the Swatches panel. The
                  first click on the Fill box selects the Fill row in the panel, and the next click
                  shows the Swatches panel.
               



Click the words "1 pt" in the Stroke row to show the Stroke Weight option. Change
               the stroke weight to 0 to remove it (the Stroke Weight field will be blank or show
               "0 pt" when it's 0).
            



Click the visibility column () to the left of the Drop Shadow attribute name in the Appearance panel.
            

 Tip: In the Appearance panel, you can drag an attribute row, such as Drop Shadow, to the
                  Delete Selected Item button () to delete it, or you can select the attribute row and click the Delete Selected
                  Item button.
               


Appearance attributes can be temporarily hidden or deleted so that they no longer
               are applied to the selected artwork.
            

 Tip: You can view all hidden attributes (attributes you have turned off) by choosing Show
                  All Hidden Attributes from the Appearance panel menu ().
               



With the Drop Shadow row selected (click to the right of the link "Drop Shadow" if
               it isn't selected), click the Delete Selected Item button () at the bottom of the panel to completely remove the shadow, rather than just turning
               off the visibility.
            



Adding another stroke and fill to artwork
      
Artwork in Illustrator can have more than one stroke and fill applied. This can be
         a great way to add interesting design elements. You'll now add another fill to an
         object using the Appearance panel.
      



With the shape still selected, click the Add New Fill button () at the bottom of the Appearance panel.
            
The figure shows what the panel looks like after clicking the Add New Fill button.
               A second Fill row is added to the Appearance panel. By default, new fill or stroke
               attribute rows are added directly above a selected attribute row or, if no attribute
               rows are selected, at the top of the Appearance panel list.
            


Click the bottom (original) Fill color box in the fill attribute row a few times, until the Swatches
               panel appears. Click the pattern swatch named "USGS 22 Gravel Beach" to apply it to
               the original fill. Press the Escape key to hide the Swatches panel.
            

The pattern won't show in the selected artwork because the second fill you added in
               the first step is covering the "USGS 22 Gravel Beach" fill. The two fills are stacked
               on each other.
            

 Tip: Other ways to close panels that appear when clicking an underlined word, like "Stroke,"
                  include pressing the Escape key, clicking the Stroke attribute row, or pressing Enter
                  or Return.
               



Click the eye icon to the left of the top fill attribute row to hide it.
            

You should now see the pattern fill in the shape. In the next section, you'll reorder
               the attribute rows in the Appearance panel so the pattern will be on top of the color
               fill.
            


Click where the eye icon was to the left of the top fill attribute row to show it.
            
Next, you'll add another stroke to a shape using the Appearance panel. This can be
               a great way to achieve interesting design effects with just one object.
            


With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the black circle that will become a bicycle tire.
            


Click the Add New Stroke button () at the bottom of the Appearance panel.
            

A second stroke, which is a copy of the original, is now applied to the selected circle.
               This is a great way to add interest to your designs without having to make copies
               of shapes, changing the formatting (stroke in this case), and putting them on top
               of each other.
            


With the new (top) stroke attribute row selected, change the stroke weight to 10 pt.
            


Click the word "Stroke" in the same attribute row to open the Stroke panel. Click
               the Align Stroke To Center button (), select Dashed Line, and ensure that Dash is set to 12 pt. Press the Escape key
               to hide the Stroke panel.
            

Clicking underlined words in the Appearance panel, as in the Properties panel, shows
               more formatting options—usually a panel such as the Swatches or Stroke panel. Appearance
               attributes, such as Fill or Stroke, can have other options, such as Opacity or an
               effect applied to only that attribute. These additional options are listed as a subset
               under the attribute row and can be shown or hidden by clicking the disclosure triangle
               () on the left end of the attribute row.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.


Adding another stroke and fill to text
Adding multiple strokes and fills to text can be a great way to add interest to your
         text. Next, you'll add another fill to text.
      


Select the Type tool (), and select the text "MTN RIDGES."
            

Notice that "Type: No Appearance" appears at the top of the Appearance panel. This
               is referring to the type object, not the text within.
            
You will also see the word "Characters." Formatting for the text (not the type object)
               is listed below the word "Characters." You should see the stroke (none) and the fill
               (white). Also notice that you cannot add another stroke or fill to the text since
               the Add New Stroke and Add New Fill buttons are dimmed at the bottom of the panel.
               To add a new stroke and/or fill to text, you need to select the type object, not the
               text within.
            


Select the Selection tool (). The type object will now be selected (not the text).
            

 Tip: You could also click "Type: No Appearance" at the top of the Appearance panel to
                  select the type object (not the text within).
               



Click the Add New Fill button () at the bottom of the Appearance panel to add another fill above the word "Characters."
            

Once again, "Characters" refers to the formatting for the text within the text object.
               If you were to double-click the word "Characters," you would select the text and see
               the formatting options for it (fill, stroke, etc.).
            


Click the fill attribute row to select it, if it's not already selected. Click the
               Fill color box, and select the pattern swatch named "USGS 8B Intermit. Pond." Press
               the Escape key to hide the swatches.
            


 Note: If you are wondering why I would name a swatch "USGS 8B Intermit. Pond," know that
                  I didn't. That pattern swatch can be found in Illustrator by default (Window > Swatch
                  Libraries > Patterns > Basic Graphics > Basic Graphics_Textures).
               



Click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the same fill row to show other properties, if necessary. Click the
               word "Opacity" to show the Transparency panel and change Opacity to 20%. Press the Escape key to hide the Transparency panel.
            

Each appearance row (stroke, fill) has its own opacity that you can adjust. The bottom
               Opacity appearance row affects the transparency for the entire selected object.
            

 Tip: Depending on which attribute row is selected in the Attributes panel, the options
                  in panels, such as the Properties panel, Gradient panel, and others, will affect the
                  attribute selected.
               



Leave the type object selected.


Reordering appearance attributes
The ordering of the appearance attribute rows can greatly change how your artwork
         looks. In the Appearance panel, fills and strokes are listed in stacking order—top
         to bottom in the panel correlates to front to back in the artwork. You can reorder
         attribute rows in a way similar to dragging layers in the Layers panel to rearrange
         the stacking order. Next, you'll change the appearance of artwork by reordering attributes
         in the Appearance panel.
      


Select the Selection tool () and click to select the bottom tan shape behind the "CALL 1-800..." text.
            


In the Appearance panel, drag the bottom fill attribute row (with the pattern swatch
               applied) up above the original Fill attribute row. When a line appears above the Fill
               attribute row, release the mouse button to see the result.
            

Moving the new Fill attribute above the original Fill attribute changes the look of
               the artwork. The pattern fill is now on top of the solid color fill.
            


 Tip: You can also apply blending modes and opacity changes to each Fill row to achieve
                  different results.
               



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Using live effects
      

 Note: When you apply a raster effect, the original vector data is rasterized using the
            document's raster effects settings, which determine the resolution of the resulting
            image. To learn about document raster effects settings, search for "Document raster
            effects settings" in Illustrator Help.
         

Effects alter the appearance of an object without changing the underlying artwork.
         Applying an effect adds the effect to the object's appearance attribute, which you
         can edit, move, delete, or duplicate, at any time, in the Appearance panel.
      

Artwork with a drop-shadow effect applied.
There are two types of effects in Illustrator: vector effects and raster effects. In Illustrator, click the Effect menu item to see the different types of effects
         available.
      


Illustrator Effects (vector): The top half of the Effect menu contains vector effects. You can apply these effects
               only to vector objects or to the fill or stroke of a bitmap object in the Appearance
               panel. The following vector effects can be applied to both vector and bitmap objects:
               3D effects, SVG filters, Warp effects, Transform effects, Drop Shadow, Feather, Inner
               Glow, and Outer Glow.
            


Photoshop Effects (raster): The bottom half of the Effect menu contains raster effects. You can apply them to
               either vector or bitmap objects.
            


In this section, you will first explore how to apply and edit effects. You will then
         explore a few of the more widely used effects in Illustrator to get an idea of the
         range of effects available.
      
Applying an effect
Effects are applied using the Properties panel, the Effect menu, and the Appearance
         panel, and they can be applied to objects, groups, or layers. You are first going
         to learn how to apply an effect using the Effect menu, and then you will apply an
         effect using the Properties panel.
      



With the Selection tool () selected, click the yellow background shape and Shift-click the grayish-brown background
               shape beneath it on the artboard. Arrows are pointing to them in the figure.
            


Choose Object > Group.
By grouping the objects before applying an effect, the effect is applied to the group,
               not the individual objects. You'll see later that if you ungroup, the effect will be
               removed.
            


Choose Effect > Stylize > Drop Shadow from the Illustrator Effects section of the
               menu that appears. In the Drop Shadow dialog box, change the following options:
            


Mode: Multiply (the default setting)
                  


Opacity: 50%


X Offset: 0 in


Y Offset: 0 in


Blur: 0.25 in


Color: Selected




Select Preview to see the drop shadow applied to the group. Click OK.


Since the drop shadow is applied to the group, it appears around the perimeter of
               the group, not on each object independently. If you look in the Appearance panel right
               now, you'll see the word "Group" at the top and the Drop Shadow effect applied. The
               word "Contents" refers to the content within the group. Each object in a group can
               have its own appearance properties.
            


Choose File > Save, and leave the group selected.


Editing an effect
      

 Note: If you attempt to apply an effect to artwork that already has the same effect applied,
            Illustrator will warn you that you are about to apply the same effect.
         

Effects are live, so they can be edited after they are applied to an object. You can
         edit the effect in the Properties panel or Appearance panel by selecting the object
         with the effect applied and then clicking the name of the effect or, in the Appearance
         panel, double-clicking the attribute row. This displays the dialog box for that effect.
         Changes you make to the effect update in the artwork. In this section, you will edit
         the Drop Shadow effect applied to the group of background shapes.
      



With the group still selected, choose Object > Ungroup to ungroup the shapes, and
               leave them both selected.
            
Notice that the drop shadow is no longer applied to the artwork. When an effect is
               applied to a group, it affects the group as a whole. If the objects are no longer
               grouped together, the effect is no longer applied. In the Appearance panel, you'll
               see "Mixed Appearances." This means that more than one path is selected currently
               and they have different appearances (different fills, for instance).
            


With the shapes selected (and ungrouped), choose Effect > Apply Drop Shadow.

The Apply Drop Shadow menu item applied the last used effect with the same options
               set. The Drop Shadow effect is now applied to each selected object independently.
            

 Tip: If you were to choose Effect > Drop Shadow, the Drop Shadow dialog box would appear,
                  allowing you to make changes before applying the effect.
               



With the shapes still selected, click the text "Drop Shadow" in the Appearance panel.

 Note: You could also select each shape independently to edit the Drop Shadow effect in
                  the Appearance panel.
               



In the Drop Shadow dialog box, change Opacity to 75%. Select Preview to see the change and then click OK.
            


Styling text with a Warp effect
      
Text can have all sorts of effects applied, including Warp, like you saw in Lesson 8, "Adding Type to a Poster." Next, you will use a Warp effect to warp text. The difference between the warp
         you applied in Lesson 8 and this Warp effect is that this one is an effect and can be turned on and off,
         edited, or removed easily.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, click the text "MTN RIDGES" and Shift-click the "BIKE TOURS" text.
            


Click the Effect option () in the Appearance section of the Properties panel. Choose Warp > Arc.
            



In the Warp Options dialog box, to create an arcing effect, set Bend to 65%. Select Preview to preview the changes. Try choosing other styles from the Style
               menu and then return to Arc. Try adjusting the Horizontal and Vertical Distortion
               sliders to see the effect. Make sure that the Distortion values are returned to 0 and then click OK.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


Click the "BIKE TOURS" text. In the Appearance panel, click the "Warp: Arc" text in
               the Properties panel (or Appearance panel) to edit the effect. In the Warp Options
               dialog box, change Bend to {{#}}8211;65%. Click OK.
            



Editing text with a Warp effect
You can edit text with a Warp effect applied, but sometimes it's easier to turn off
         the effect, make the change to the text, and then turn the effect back on.
      



With the Selection tool () selected, click the "MTN RIDGES" type object. Click the visibility icon () to the left of the Warp: Arc row in the Appearance panel to temporarily turn off
               the effect.
            
Notice that the text is no longer warped on the artboard (see the following figure).


Select the Type tool () in the Tools panel, and change the text to "MTN RIDGE."
            



Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel. This selects the type object, not the text.
            


Click the visibility column to the left of the Warp: Arc row in the Appearance panel
               to turn on visibility for the effect so that the text is once again warped.
            


In the Appearance panel, click the "Warp: Arc" text to edit the effect. In the Warp
               Options dialog box, change Bend to 64%. Click OK.
            

 Note: You may want to move the text closer or farther from the black wheel shape by pressing
                  an arrow key a few times.
               



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Applying the Offset Path effect
      
Next, you will offset the dashed stroke you applied to the bicycle tire (the black
         circle). This process allows you to create the appearance of multiple stacked shapes.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, click the black circle to select it.
            


Click the Stroke row in the Appearance panel with the 10 pt Dashed stroke applied
               to select it.
            


With the stroke attribute row selected in the Appearance panel, click the Add New
               Effect button () at the bottom of the panel, and choose Path > Offset Path.
            



In the Offset Path dialog box, change Offset to 0.57 in, select Preview, and then click OK.
            




In the Appearance panel, click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the words "Stroke: 10 pt Dashed" to toggle it open (if it's not already
               open).
            
Notice that the Offset Path effect is a subset of Stroke. This indicates that the
               Offset Path effect is applied to only that stroke.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.


Choose File > Save.


Applying a Photoshop effect
      
As described earlier in the lesson, raster effects generate pixels rather than vector
         data. Raster effects include SVG filters, all of the effects in the bottom portion
         of the Effect menu, and the Drop Shadow, Inner Glow, Outer Glow, and Feather commands
         in the Effect > Stylize submenu. You can apply them to either vector or bitmap objects.
         Next, you'll apply a Photoshop effect (raster) to some of the background shapes.
      



In the Layers panel (Window > Layers), click the selection column to the right of
               the Mountains layer to select the layer contents.
            


Click the Properties panel tab to show the panel again.


Click the Effect option () in the Appearance section of the Properties panel. Choose Texture > Texturizer.
            
When you choose most of the raster (Photoshop) effects (not all), the Filter Gallery
               dialog box opens. Similar to working with filters in Adobe Photoshop, where you can
               also access a Filter Gallery, in the Illustrator Filter Gallery, you can try different
               raster effects to see how they affect your artwork.
            


With the Filter Gallery dialog box open, you can see the type of filter (Texturizer)
               showing at the top. Choose Fit In View from the view menu in the lower-left corner
               of the dialog box. That should fit the artwork in the preview area so you can see
               how the effect alters one of the shapes.
            
The Filter Gallery dialog box, which is resizable, contains a preview area (labeled
               A), effect thumbnails that you can click to apply (labeled B), settings for the currently
               selected effect (labeled C), and the list of effects applied (labeled D). If you want
               to apply a different effect, expand a category in the middle panel of the dialog box
               (labeled B), and click an effect thumbnail.
            



Change the Texturizer settings in the upper-right corner of the dialog box as follows
               (if necessary):
            



Texture: Sandstone


Scaling: 145


Relief: 4 (the default setting)
                  


Light: Top (the default setting)
                  



 Tip: You can click the eye icon () to the left of the name "Texturizer" in the section labeled "D" to see the artwork
                  without the effect applied.
               


 Note: The Filter Gallery lets you apply only one effect at a time. If you want to apply
                  multiple Photoshop effects, you can click OK to apply the current effect and then
                  choose another from the Effect menu.
               



Click OK to apply the raster effect to all four shapes.


Choose Select > Deselect.


Working with 3D effects 
To learn about other working with 3D effects, check out the video Working with 3D Effects that is a part of the Web Edition. For more information, see the "Web Edition" section
         of "Getting Started" at the beginning of the book.
      
Using graphic styles
A graphic style is a saved set of appearance attributes that you can reuse. By applying graphic styles,
         you can quickly and globally change the appearance of objects and text.
      
The Graphic Styles panel (Window > Graphic Styles) lets you create, name, save, apply,
         and remove effects and attributes for objects, layers, and groups. You can also break
         the link between an object and an applied graphic style to edit that object's attributes
         without affecting other objects that use the same graphic style.
      
The different options available in the Graphic Styles panel are described here:


Graphic Style thumbnail
Graphic Styles Libraries menu
Break Link To Graphic Style
New Graphic Style
Delete Graphic Style

For example, if you have a map that uses a shape to represent a city, you can create
         a graphic style that paints the shape green and adds a drop shadow. You can then use
         that graphic style to paint all the city shapes on the map. If you decide to use a
         different color, you can change the fill color of the graphic style to blue. All the
         objects that use that graphic style are then updated to blue.
      
Applying an existing graphic style
      
You can apply graphic styles to your artwork from graphic style libraries that come
         with Illustrator. Next, you'll explore some of the built-in graphic styles and apply
         a few to artwork.
      


Choose Window > Graphic Styles. Click the Graphic Styles Libraries Menu button () at the bottom of the panel, and choose Vonster Pattern Styles.
            

 Tip: Use the arrows at the bottom of the Vonster Pattern Styles library panel to load
                  the previous or next Graphic Styles library in the panel.
               



With the Selection tool (), select the bottom background mountain shape.
            


Click the Splatterz 2 style and then click the Splatterz 3 graphic style in the Vonster
               Pattern Styles panel. Close the Vonster Pattern Styles panel.
            

Clicking the styles applies the appearance attributes to the selected artwork and
               adds both graphic styles to the Graphic Styles panel for the active document.
            



With the artwork still selected, look in the Appearance panel to see the fills applied
               to the selected artwork. Also notice "Path: Splatterz 3" at the top of the panel.
               This indicates that the graphic style named Splatterz 3 is applied.
            


Click the Graphic Styles panel tab to show the panel again.
You should see the two graphic styles, Splatterz 2 and Splatterz 3, listed in the
               panel now.
            



Right-click and hold down the mouse button on the Splatterz 2 graphic style thumbnail
               in the Graphic Styles panel to preview the graphic style on the selected artwork.
               When you're finished previewing, release the mouse button.
            
Previewing a graphic style is a great way to see how it will affect the selected object,
               without actually applying it.
            


Creating and applying a graphic style
      
Now you'll create a new graphic style and apply that graphic style to artwork.


With the Selection tool selected, click the yellow shape that the arrow is pointing
               to in the following figure.
            


 Tip: To create a graphic style, you can also click to select the object that you are using
                  to make the graphic style. You can then either drag the object directly into the Graphic
                  Styles panel or, in the Appearance panel, drag the appearance thumbnail at the top
                  of the listing into the Graphic Styles panel. The panels can't be in the same panel
                  group.
               



Click the New Graphic Style button () at the bottom of the Graphic Styles panel.
            
The appearance attributes from the selected shape are saved as a graphic style.


In the Graphic Styles panel, double-click the new graphic style thumbnail. In the
               Graphic Style Options dialog box, name the new style Mountain. Click OK.
            



Click the Appearance panel tab, and at the top of the Appearance panel you'll see
               "Path: Mountain."
            
This indicates that a graphic style named "Mountain" is applied to the selected artwork.


With the Selection tool, click the bottom rectangle shape in the background (beneath
               the "Call 1-800..." text). In the Graphic Styles panel, click the graphic style named
               "Mountain" to apply the styling.
            



Leave the shape selected and then choose File > Save.



Applying a graphic style to text
         
When you apply a graphic style to a type area, the fill color of the graphic style
            overrides the fill color of the text by default. If you deselect Override Character
            Color from the Graphic Styles panel menu (), the fill color (if there is one) in the text will override the color of the graphic
            style.
         
If you choose Use Text For Preview from the Graphic Styles panel menu (), you can then right-click and hold down the mouse button on a graphic style to preview
            the graphic style on the text.
         

Updating a graphic style
Once you create a graphic style, you can update the graphic style, and all artwork
         with that style applied will update its appearance as well. If you edit the appearance
         of artwork that a graphic style is applied to, the graphic style is overridden, and
         the artwork will not update when the graphic style is updated.
      



With the bottom yellow shape still selected, look in the Graphic Styles panel; you
               will see that the Mountain graphic style thumbnail is highlighted (has a border around
               it), indicating that it's applied.
            


Click the Appearance panel tab. Notice the text "Path: Mountain" at the top of the
               panel, indicating that the Mountain graphic style is applied. Like you saw earlier,
               this is another way to tell whether a graphic style is applied to selected artwork.
            


Click the yellow fill color box a few times to open the Swatches panel. Select the
               swatch named Mountain2. Press the Escape key to hide the swatches.
            

Notice that the "Path: Mountain" text at the top of the Appearance panel is now just
               "Path," telling you that the graphic style is no longer applied to the selected artwork.
            


Click the Graphic Styles panel tab to see that the Mountain graphic style no longer
               has a highlight (border) around it, which means that the graphic style is no longer
               applied.
            


Press the Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) key, and drag the selected shape on top
               of the Mountain graphic style thumbnail in the Graphic Styles panel. Release the mouse
               button and then release the modifier key when the thumbnail is highlighted. Both mountain
               shapes now look the same since the Mountain graphic style was applied to both objects.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


Click the Appearance panel tab. You should see "No Selection: Mountain" at the top
               of the panel (you may need to scroll up).
            
When you apply appearance settings, graphic styles, and more to artwork, the next
               shape you draw will have the same appearance settings listed in the Appearance panel
               as the previous one.
            


Click to select the top shape in the background that has the Mountain graphic style
               applied. An arrow is pointing to it in the following figure.
            


Click the fill color for the Fill appearance row, and in the Swatches panel that appears,
               select the Mountain1 swatch.
            



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Applying a graphic style to a layer
      

 Note: If you apply a graphic style to artwork and then apply a graphic style to the layer
            (or sublayer) that it's on, the graphic style formatting is added to the appearance
            of the artwork—it's cumulative. This can change the artwork in ways you didn't expect,
            since applying a graphic style to the layer will be added to the formatting of the
            artwork.
         


 Tip: In the Layers panel, you can drag a target icon to the Trash button () at the bottom of the Layers panel to remove the appearance attributes.
         

When a graphic style is applied to a layer, everything added to that layer has that
         same style applied to it. Now you'll apply a drop shadow graphic style to the layer
         named Block Text; this will apply the style to all the contents of that layer at once.
      



In the Layers panel, click the target icon () for the Block Text layer.
            
This selects the layer content and targets the layer for any appearance attributes.


Click the Graphic Styles panel tab, and then click the graphic style named "Shadow"
               to apply the style to the layer and all its contents.
            

The target icon in the Layers panel for the Block Text layer is now shaded.



Click the Appearance panel tab, and you should see, with all of the artwork on the
               Block Text layer still selected, the words "Layer: Shadow."
            
This is telling you that the layer target icon is selected in the Layers panel and
               that the Shadow graphic style is applied to that layer.
            

 Note: If you want to edit the drop shadow applied to either of the text objects, you can
                  do this a few ways. You can click the target icon in the Layers panel to see the Drop
                  Shadow effect in the Appearance panel, or you can select the artwork (text object
                  in this case) and click Layer: Shadow in the Appearance panel to see the appearance
                  properties for the layer and then click Drop Shadow.
               


 Tip: In the Graphic Styles panel, graphic style thumbnails that show a small box with
                  a red slash () indicate that the graphic style does not contain a stroke or fill. It may just be
                  a drop shadow or outer glow, for instance.
               



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.



Applying multiple graphic styles
         
You can apply a graphic style to an object that already has a graphic style applied.
            This can be useful if you want to add properties to an object from another graphic
            style. After you apply a graphic style to selected artwork, you can then Option-click
            (macOS) or Alt-click (Windows) another graphic style thumbnail to add the graphic
            style formatting to the existing formatting, rather than replacing it.
         

Scaling strokes and effects
In Illustrator, by default, when scaling (resizing) content, any strokes and effects
         that are applied do not change. For instance, suppose you scale a circle with a 2-pt.
         stroke from small to the size of the artboard. The shape may change size, but the
         stroke will remain 2 pt. by default. That can change the appearance of scaled artwork
         in a way that you didn't intend, so you'll need to watch out for that when transforming
         artwork. Next, you'll make the spokes group larger.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window, if necessary.



In Layers panel, click in the visibility column for the layer named "Spokes" to show
               the artwork.
            
This shows a large group of wheel spokes on the artboard.


Click the spokes artwork, and notice the stroke weight of 6 pt in the Properties panel.




Click More Options in the Transform section of the Properties panel, and select Scale
               Strokes & Effects at the bottom of the panel that appears.
            
Without this option selected, scaling the spokes would not affect the stroke weights
               or effects when it is scaled. You are selecting this option so that the spokes will
               scale smaller and not remain the same stroke weight.
            


Click the Constrain Width And Height Proportions button () to ensure it's active (). Change Width (W) to 5 inches. Press the Tab key to move to the next field. The height should change proportionally
               with the width.
            

After scaling the spokes, if you look at the stroke weight in the Properties panel,
               you will see that it has changed (scaled).
            


Choose Select > Deselect.



Choose File > Save and then choose File > Close.

Review answers


To add a second fill or stroke to artwork, click the Add New Stroke button () or Add New Fill button () at the bottom of the Appearance panel, or choose Add New Stroke/Add New Fill from
                  the Appearance panel menu. A stroke is added to the top of the appearance list. It
                  has the same color and stroke weight as the original.
               


You can apply an effect to an object by selecting the object and then choosing the
                  effect from the Effect menu. You can also apply an effect by selecting the object,
                  clicking the Add New Effect button () in the Properties panel or at the bottom of the Appearance panel, and then choosing
                  the effect from the menu that appears.
               


Applying a Photoshop effect to artwork generates pixels rather than vector data. Photoshop
                  effects include all of the effects in the bottom portion of the Effect menu and the
                  Drop Shadow, Inner Glow, Outer Glow, and Feather commands in the Effect > Stylize
                  submenu. You can apply them to either vector or bitmap objects.
               


You can edit effects applied to selected artwork by clicking the effect link in the
                  Properties panel or Appearance panel to access the effect options.
               


When a graphic style is applied to a single object, other objects on that layer are
                  not affected. For example, if a triangle object has a Roughen effect applied to its
                  path and you move it to another layer, it retains the Roughen effect.
               
After a graphic style is applied to a layer, everything you add to the layer has that
                  style applied to it. For example, if you create a circle on Layer 1 and then move
                  that circle to Layer 2, which has a Drop Shadow effect applied, the circle adopts
                  that effect.

               and name the file TShirt.ai. Leave the Format option set to Adobe Illustrator (ai) (macOS) or the Save As Type
               option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows) and then click Save.
            


In the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the Illustrator options at their default
               settings and then click OK.
            


Choose Reset Essentials from the workspace switcher in the Application bar.



 Note: If you don't see Reset Essentials in the menu, choose Window > Workspace > Essentials
            before choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
         

Working with symbols
      

 Note: Illustrator comes with a series of symbol libraries, which range from tiki icons
            to hair to web icons. You can access those symbol libraries in the Symbols panel or
            by choosing Window > Symbol Libraries and easily incorporate them into your own artwork.
         

A symbol is a reusable art object that is stored in the Symbols panel (Window > Symbols).
         For example, if you create a symbol from a flower you drew, you can then quickly add
         multiple instances of that flower symbol to your artwork, which saves you from having to draw each flower.
         All instances in the document are linked to the original symbol in the Symbols panel.
         When you edit the original symbol, all instances of the flower (in this example) that
         are linked to it are updated. You can turn all those flowers from white to red instantly!
         Not only do symbols save time, but they also greatly reduce file size.
      


Choose Window > Symbols to open the Symbols panel. The symbols you see in the Symbols
               panel are the symbols you can use with this document. Each document has its own set
               of saved symbols. The different options available in the Symbols panel are described
               here:

Delete Symbol

Using existing Illustrator symbol libraries
You'll start by adding a symbol from an existing symbol library to the artwork.



Click the Artboards menu in the Properties panel to the right of the document and
               choose 1 from the menu. The larger artboard with the black T-shirt on it will show
               in the Document window.
            



Click the Hide Smart Guides option in the Properties panel to turn the Smart Guides
               off temporarily.
            


 Tip: You can also choose View > Smart Guides to turn them off.
               



Click the Layers panel tab to show the Layers panel. Click the Content layer to make
               sure it is selected. Make sure that both of the layers are collapsed by clicking the
               disclosure triangles to the left of the layer names (if necessary).
            
When adding symbols to a document, the layer that is selected when they are added
               is the same layer they become a part of.
            


In the Symbols panel (Window > Symbols), click the Symbol Libraries Menu button () at the bottom of the panel, and choose Tiki from the menu.
            

The Tiki library opens as a free-floating panel. The symbols in this library are not
               part of the file that you are working on, but you can import any of the symbols into
               the document and use them in the artwork.
            



Position the pointer over the symbols in the Tiki panel to see their names as tooltips.
               Click the symbol named "Guitar" to add it to the Symbols panel. Close the Tiki panel.
            
When you add symbols to the Symbols panel, they are saved with the active document
               only.
            

 Tip: If you want to see the symbol names along with the symbol pictures, click the Symbols
                  panel menu icon (), and then choose Small List View or Large List View.
               


 Tip: You can also copy a symbol instance on the artboard and paste as many as you need.
                  This is the same as dragging a symbol instance out of the Symbols panel onto the artboard.
               



Using the Selection tool (), drag the Guitar symbol from the Symbols panel onto the artboard into the center
               of the black T-shirt. Do this twice to create two instances of the guitar on the T-shirt.
            

Each time you drag a symbol like the guitar onto the artboard, an instance of the original symbol is created. Next, you'll resize one of the symbol instances.
            



Click to select the Guitar instance on the right, if it's not already selected. Shift-drag
               the upper-right bounding point toward the center to make it a little smaller, while
               constraining its proportions. Release the mouse button and then the key.
            
A symbol instance is treated like a group of objects and can have only certain transformation
               and appearance properties changed (such as scale, rotate, move, transparency, etc.).
               You cannot edit the individual artwork that makes up an instance without breaking
               the link to the original symbol. With the symbol instance still selected on the artboard,
               notice that, in the Properties panel, you see "Symbol (Static)" and symbol-related
               options.
            

 Note: Although you can transform symbol instances in many ways, specific properties of
                  instances from static symbols like the guitar cannot be edited. For example, the fill
                  color is locked because it is controlled by the original symbol in the Symbols panel.
               



With the same instance still selected, click the Flip Along Horizontal Axis option
               () in the Properties panel to flip the guitar horizontally.
            



Editing a symbol
In this next section, you'll edit the Guitar symbol, and all instances in the document
         will be updated. There are several ways to edit a symbol, and in this section you
         will focus on one method.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, double-click the selected Guitar symbol instance on the artboard. A warning
               dialog box appears, stating that you are about to edit the original symbol and that
               all instances will update. Click OK.
            

This takes you into Symbol Editing mode, so you can't edit any other objects on the
               page. The Guitar symbol instance you double-clicked will appear larger and will no
               longer be reflected. That's because in Symbol Editing mode, you are looking at the
               original symbol artwork. You can now edit the artwork that makes up the symbol.
            

 Tip: Another way to edit a symbol is to select the symbol instance on the artboard and
                  then click the Edit Symbol button in the Properties panel.
               



Select the Zoom tool (), and drag across the symbol content to zoom in closely.
            


Select the Direct Selection tool (), and click to select the blue body of the guitar artwork. An arrow is pointing to
               it in the following figure.
            


Click the Fill color box in the Properties panel, make sure the Swatches option is
               selected, and select the brown swatch with the tooltip "C=25 M=40 Y=65 K=0."
            



Double-click away from the symbol content, or click the Exit Symbol Editing Mode button
               () in the upper-left corner of the Document window until you exit Symbol Editing mode,
               so that you can edit the rest of the content.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window, and notice that both of the Guitar symbol instances
               on the artboard have been changed.
            


Working with dynamic symbols
As you just saw, editing a symbol updates all of the instances in your document. Symbols
         can also be dynamic, which means you can change certain appearance properties of instances using the
         Direct Selection tool () without editing the original symbol. In this section, you'll edit the properties
         of the Guitar symbol so that it is dynamic, and then you'll edit each instance separately.
      


In the Symbols panel, click the Guitar symbol thumbnail to select it, if it's not
               already selected. Click the Symbol Options button () at the bottom of the Symbols panel.
            


In the Symbol Options dialog box, select Dynamic Symbol, and click OK. The symbol
               and its instances are now dynamic.

 Tip: You can tell if a symbol is dynamic by looking at the thumbnail in the Symbols panel.
                  If there is a small plus sign (+) in the lower-right corner of the thumbnail, it is
                  a dynamic symbol.
               



Select the Zoom tool (), and drag across the symbol content (guitars) to zoom in.
            


Select the Direct Selection tool () in the Tools panel. Click to select the blue, curved body shape of the guitar instance
               on the right. See the following figure.
            
With part of the symbol instance selected, notice the words "Symbol (Dynamic)" at
               the top of the Properties panel telling you it's a dynamic symbol.
            


Change the fill color to a darker brown swatch in the Properties panel.

The guitar on the right now looks a little different from the one on the left. Know
               that if you were to edit the original symbol like you did previously, both symbol
               instances would still update, but that darker brown part of the right guitar instance
               would remain different.
            

 Tip: After making edits to a dynamic symbol instance with the Direct Selection tool, you
                  can reselect the entire instance with the Selection tool and click the Reset button
                  in the Properties panel to reset the appearance to the same as the original symbol.
               



Creating a symbol
Illustrator also lets you create and save your own symbols. You can make symbols from
         objects, including paths, compound paths, text, embedded (not linked) raster images,
         mesh objects, and groups of objects. Symbols can even include active objects, such
         as brush strokes, blends, effects, or other symbol instances. Next, you'll create
         your own symbol from existing artwork.
      


Choose 2 Symbol Artwork from the Artboard menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            


With the Selection tool () selected, click the top "musical note" shape on the artboard to select it.
            


Click the New Symbol button () at the bottom of the Symbols panel to make a symbol from the selected artwork.
            

 Tip: You can also drag the selected content into a blank area of the Symbols panel to
                  create a symbol.
               




In the Symbol Options dialog box that opens, change the name to Note1. Ensure that Dynamic Symbol is selected, just in case you want to edit the appearance
               of one of the instances later. Click OK to create the symbol.
            


 Tip: You can drag the symbol thumbnails in the Symbols panel to change their ordering.
                  Reordering symbols in the Symbols panel has no effect on the artwork. It can simply
                  be a way to organize your symbols.
               

In the Symbol Options dialog box, you'll see a note that explains that there is no
               difference between a movie clip and a graphic type in Illustrator. If you don't plan
               on exporting this content to Adobe Animate CC, you don't need to worry about choosing
               an export type. After creating the symbol, the note artwork on the artboard is converted
               to an instance of the Note1 symbol. The symbol also appears in the Symbols panel.
            


Choose 1 T-Shirt from the Artboard menu in the lower-left corner of the Document window.


Drag the Note1 symbol from the Symbols panel onto the artboard four times, and position
               the instances around the guitars like you see in the following figure.
            



Resize a few of the Note1 instances on the artboard using the Selection tool.


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Duplicating symbols
      
Often you will want to add a series of symbol instances to your artwork. After all,
         one of the reasons for using symbols is for storing and updating frequently used content
         like trees or clouds. In this section, you'll create, add, and duplicate a symbol
         that happens to be another musical note.
      


Choose 2 Symbol Artwork from the Artboard menu in the lower-left corner of the Document
               window.
            


Using the Selection tool (), click and drag the bottom "musical note" shape from the artboard into a blank area
               of the Symbols panel to create a new symbol.
            


In the Symbol Options dialog box, change the name to Note2, and make sure Dynamic Symbol is selected. Leave the remaining settings at their
               defaults, and click OK to create the symbol.
            



Choose 1 T-Shirt from the Artboard menu in the lower-left corner of the Document window
               to go back to the T-shirt artwork.
            


Drag one instance of the Note2 symbol from the Symbols panel onto the T-shirt, near
               the other notes.
            



Press Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows), and drag the Note2 symbol instance on the artboard
               to create a copy. When the new instance is in position (see the figure), release the
               mouse button and then the modifier key.
            

 Note: Your symbol instances may not be in the same position on the artboard, and that's
                  fine.
               



Create a few more copies by pressing Option (macOS) or Alt (Windows) and dragging
               any of the note symbol instances.
            



Resize and move a few of the symbol instances, making some smaller and some a bit
               larger, so they look different from each other.
            


Choose File > Save.


Replacing symbols
      
You can easily replace a symbol instance in the document with another symbol. Next,
         you'll replace a few of the Note2 symbol instances.
      


With the Selection tool (), select one of the Note2 symbol instances on the artboard.
            
When you select a symbol instance, you can tell which symbol it came from because
               the symbol for the selected instance is highlighted in the Symbols panel.
            


In the Properties panel, click the arrow to the right of the Replace Symbol field
               to open a panel showing the symbols in the Symbols panel. Click the Note1 symbol in
               the panel.
            

If the original symbol instance you were replacing had a transformation applied, such
               as a rotation, the symbol instance replacing it would have the same transformations
               applied.
            


Double-click the Note2 symbol thumbnail in the Symbols panel to edit the symbol.

A temporary instance of the symbol appears in the center of the Document window. Editing
               a symbol by double-clicking the symbol in the Symbols panel hides all artboard content
               except the symbol artwork. This is just another way to edit a symbol.
            


Select the Selection tool () in the Tools panel, and click the note shape. Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++
               (Windows) a few times to zoom in.
            


Change the fill color in the Properties panel to a light gray swatch with the tooltip
               that shows "C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=30."
            



Double-click away from the symbol content to exit Symbol Editing mode so that you
               can edit the rest of the content.
            


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Select the Selection tool (), and click one of the note symbol instances. It doesn't matter which symbol (Note1
               or Note2) it is. Choose Select > Same > Symbol Instance.
            
This is a great way to select all instances of a symbol in the document. You can see
               that the symbol instance on the right artboard was also selected.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.



Symbol layers
When you edit a symbol using any of the methods described, open the Layers panel,
            and you will see that the symbol has its own layering.
         

Similar to working with groups in Isolation mode, you see the layers associated with
            that symbol only, not the document's layers. In the Layers panel, you can rename,
            add, delete, show/hide, and reorder content for a symbol.
         

Breaking a link to a symbol
At times, you need to edit specific instances on the artboard. As you've learned,
         you can make changes, such as scaling, opacity, and flipping, only to a symbol instance,
         and saving the symbol as dynamic only lets you edit certain appearance attributes
         using the Direct Selection tool. In certain cases, you may need to break the link
         between a symbol and an instance. This breaks the instance into the original artwork
         on the artboard, and that instance will no longer update if the symbol is edited.
      
Next, you'll break the link to one of the guitar symbol instances.


With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the Guitar symbol instance on the left. In the Properties
               panel, click the Break Link button.
            

 Tip: You can also break the link to a symbol instance by selecting the symbol instance
                  on the artboard and then clicking the Break Link To Symbol button () at the bottom of the Symbols panel.
               


This object is now a series of paths; if you click to select the artwork, you'll see
               "Group" at the top of the Properties panel. You should be able to edit the artwork
               directly now. This content will no longer update if the Guitar symbol is edited.
            


Select the Zoom tool (), and drag across the top of the selected guitar artwork on the artboard to zoom
               in.
            


Choose Select > Deselect.



Select the Direct Selection tool, and click the top small blue circle toward the top
               of the guitar. Option-drag (macOS) or Alt-drag (Windows) the circle up to create a
               copy. Release the mouse button and then the modifier key.
            

 Note: I have you select the Direct Selection tool and not the Selection tool because the
                  guitar is a group. Selecting with the Direct Selection tool usually allows you to
                  select individual artwork in a group.
               



Choose Select > Deselect.


Choose File > Save.



The Symbolism Tools
The Symbol Sprayer tool () in the Tools panel allows you to spray symbols on the artboard, creating symbol
            sets.
         
A symbol set is a group of symbol instances that you create with the Symbol Sprayer
            tool. This can be really useful if, for instance, you were to create grass from individual
            blades of grass. Spraying the blades of grass speeds up this process greatly and makes
            it much easier to edit individual instances of grass or the sprayed grass as a group.
            You can create mixed sets of symbol instances by using the Symbol Sprayer tool with
            one symbol and then using it again with another symbol.
         
You use the symbolism tools to modify multiple symbol instances in a set. For example,
            you can disperse instances over a larger area using the Symbol Scruncher tool or gradually
            tinting the color of instances to make them look more realistic.

Working with Creative Cloud libraries
      
Creative Cloud libraries are an easy way to create and share stored content such as
         images, colors, text styles, Adobe Stock assets, Creative Cloud Market assets, and
         more between many Adobe applications like Adobe Photoshop CC, Adobe Illustrator CC,
         Adobe InDesign CC, and certain Adobe mobile apps.
      

 Note: In order to use Creative Cloud libraries, you will need to be signed in with your
            Adobe ID and have an Internet connection.
         

Creative Cloud libraries connects to your Creative Profile, putting the creative assets
         you care about at your fingertips. When you create content in Illustrator and save
         it to a Creative Cloud library, that asset is available to use in all of your Illustrator
         files. Those assets are automatically synced and can be shared with anyone with a
         Creative Cloud account. As your creative team works across Adobe desktop and mobile
         apps, your shared library assets are always up to date and ready to use anywhere.
      
In this section, you'll explore CC libraries and use them in your project.
Adding assets to CC libraries
The first thing you'll learn about is how to work with the Libraries panel (Window
         > Libraries) in Illustrator and add assets to a Creative Cloud library. You'll open
         an existing document in Illustrator to capture assets from.
      


Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson13 folder,
               and select the Sample.ai file on your hard disk. Click Open.
            

 Note: The Missing Fonts dialog box may appear. You need an Internet connection to sync
                  the fonts. The syncing process may take a few minutes. Click Sync Fonts to sync all
                  of the missing fonts to your computer. After they are synced and you see the message
                  stating that there are no more missing fonts, click Close. If you have an issue syncing,
                  you can go to Help (Help > Illustrator Help) and search for "Find missing fonts."
               



Choose View > Fit All In Window.
Using this document, you will capture artwork, text, colors, and type formatting to
               be used in the TShirt.ai document.
            


Choose Window > Libraries, or click the Libraries panel tab to open the Libraries
               panel.
            
To start, you have one library to work with called "My Library." You can add your
               design assets to this default library, or you can create more libraries—maybe to save
               assets according to clients or projects.
            


Choose Select > Deselect, if necessary.


Select the Selection tool (), and click the type area that contains the text "Rock On." In the Libraries panel,
               click the Add Content icon (+) and make sure all of the options are selected, except
               for Graphic. Click Add to capture the text and formatting, and save it in the default
               library. If you see a warning dialog box about text appearance, click OK.
            

 Note: The menu that appears after clicking the Add Content icon (+) is contextual. It changes
                  depending on what can be saved from the selected artwork.
               



 Tip: You can change the appearance of the items (icons or list) by clicking the buttons
                  in the upper-right corner of the Libraries panel.
               

The paragraph style formatting, text object, and fill color will be saved in the currently
               selected library. In this case, it is adding the assets to my default library called
               "My Library." As you save assets and formatting in the Libraries panel, notice how
               it is organized by asset type.
            


Double-click the name "Text 1" in the Libraries panel, and change it to Heading. Press Enter or Return to accept the name change.
            

You can change the name of the color, character style, and paragraph style saved in
               the Libraries panel as well. In the case of the character and paragraph styles saved,
               you can move the pointer over the asset and see a tooltip that shows the saved formatting.
            



Drag across the black artwork in the lower-right corner with the text "Guitar" on
               it to select all of the artwork.
            


Drag the selected artwork into the Libraries panel. When a plus sign (+) and a name
               (such as "Artwork 1") appears, release the mouse button to add the artwork as a graphic.
            

The assets you store as a graphic in a Creative Cloud library retain their vector
               form wherever you use the graphic.
            



Drag the amp artwork, below the "Rock On" text, into the Libraries panel to save it
               as a graphic asset.
            


Choose File > Close to close the Sample.ai file and return to the TShirt.ai file.
               Don't save the file if asked.
            
Notice that the Libraries panel still shows the assets in the library. The libraries
               and their assets are available no matter which document is open in Illustrator.
            



 Tip: You can share a copy of your library with others by choosing the library you want
            to share in the Libraries panel and then choosing Share Link from the panel menu.
         

Using library assets
      
Now that you have some assets in the Libraries panel, once synced, those assets will
         be available to other applications and apps that support libraries, as long as you
         are signed in with the same Creative Cloud account. Next, you will use some of those
         assets in the TShirt.ai file.
      


While still on the 1 T-Shirt artboard, choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.

 Tip: To apply the color or styles saved in the Libraries panel, select artwork or text
                  and click to apply. When it comes to text styles in the Libraries panel, if you apply
                  them to text in a document, a style of the same name and formatting will appear in
                  the Paragraph Styles panel or Character Styles panel (depending on which you selected
                  in the Libraries panel).
               



Drag the Heading text asset from the Libraries panel onto the artboard.


 Tip: As you'll learn in the next section, graphics you drag from the Libraries panel are
                  linked. If you Option-drag (macOS) or Alt-drag (Windows) the artwork from the Libraries
                  panel into a document, it will be embedded by default.
               



Click to place the text.



Press Esc to select the Selection tool and the type object. Click the Properties panel
               tab and change the fill color to white.
            


Double-click the "Rock On" text to switch to the Type tool. Press Command+A (macOS)
               or Ctrl+A (Windows) to select the text.
            



Change the text to ROCK ON! (with an exclamation point).
            


Click the Libraries panel tab to show the panel. Drag the pick graphic asset and then
               the amp graphic asset from the Libraries panel onto the artboard. Don't worry about
               position for now.
            


 Note: You will most likely need to click to place the assets, like you did with the text.
               



Updating a library asset
      
When you drag a graphic from your Creative Cloud library to an Illustrator project,
         it is automatically placed as a linked asset. If you make a change to a library asset,
         the linked instances will update in your projects. Next, you'll see how to update
         the asset.
      



 Tip: You can edit a linked library asset like the guitar pick by clicking Edit Original
                  () at the bottom of the Links panel.
               

Select the Selection tool (), and click the pick asset on the artboard and look at the top of the Properties
               panel (you'll need to click the Properties panel tab to show it). Click the words
               "Linked File" to open the Links panel.
            

In the Links panel that appears, you will see the name of the pick asset, as well
               as a cloud icon to the right of the name. The cloud icon indicates that the artwork
               is a linked library asset.
            


 Note: You'll learn more about the Links panel in Lesson 14, "Using Illustrator CC with Other Adobe Applications."
               



Back in the Libraries panel, double-click the pick asset thumbnail. The artwork will
               appear in a new, temporary document.
            


With the Direct Selection tool, click to select the black shape. Change the fill color
               to a gray with the tooltip "C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=70" in the Properties panel.
            



Choose File > Save and then choose File > Close.
            

In the Libraries panel, the graphic thumbnail should update to reflect the appearance
               change you made. Back in the TShirt.ai document, the pick graphic on the artboard
               should have updated. If it hasn't, with the pick artwork still selected on the artboard, click the Linked File link
               in the Properties panel. In the Links panel that shows, with the pick asset row selected,
               click the Update Link button () at the bottom of the panel.
            


With the artwork selected, click the Embed button back in the Properties panel.

The artwork is no longer linked to the original library item and will not update if
               the pick library item is updated. That also means it is now editable in the TShirt.ai
               document. Just know that Libraries panel artwork that is embedded after it has been
               placed will typically have a clipping mask applied.
            


With the Selection tool, click the amp artwork and, to send it behind everything else,
               click the Arrange button in the Properties panel and choose Send To Back.
            


Drag all of the artwork like you see in the following figure. You may want to resize
               the pick and amp artwork to make them each a little smaller. If you resize any of
               the artwork, make sure you press the Shift key to constrain the proportions as you
               scale; then release the mouse button and key when finished.
            



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.



Review questions
         


What are three benefits of using symbols?


How do you update an existing symbol?


What is a dynamic symbol?


In Illustrator, what type of content can you save in a library?


Explain how to embed a linked library graphic asset.




Review answers


Three benefits of using symbols are as follows:


You can edit one symbol, and all instances are updated.


You can map artwork to 3D objects (not discussed in the lesson).


Using symbols reduces file size.




To update an existing symbol, double-click the symbol icon in the Symbols panel, double-click
                  an instance of the symbol on the artboard, or select the instance on the artboard
                  and then click the Edit Symbol button in the Properties panel. Then you can make edits
                  in Isolation mode.
               


When a symbol is saved as Dynamic, you can change certain appearance properties of
                  instances using the Direct Selection tool () without editing the original symbol.
               


In Illustrator, currently you can save colors (fill and stroke), type objects, graphic
                  assets, and type formatting.
               


By default in Illustrator, when a graphic asset is dragged from the Libraries panel
                  into a document, a link is created to the original library asset. In order to embed
                  a graphic asset, select the asset in the document, and click Embed in the Properties
                  panel. Once embedded, the graphic will no longer update if the original library asset
                  is edited.

You can easily add images created in an image-editing program to an Adobe Illustrator
         file. This is a great way to incorporate raster images into your vector artwork to
         combine the two.
      
Starting the lesson
      
Before you begin, you'll need to restore the default preferences for Adobe Illustrator
         CC. Then you'll open the finished art file for this lesson to see what you'll create.
      

 Note: If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson to your computer
            from your Account page, make sure to do so now. See the "Getting Started" section
            at the beginning of the book.
         



To ensure that the tools function and the defaults are set exactly as described in
               this lesson, delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CC preferences
               file. See "Restoring default preferences" in the "Getting Started" section at the
               beginning of the book.
            


Start Adobe Illustrator CC.



Choose File > Open. Locate the file named L14_end.ai in the Lessons > Lesson14 folder
               that you copied onto your hard disk.
            
This is a small poster for a vacation destination.


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window and leave it open for reference, or choose File
               > Close.
            

 Note: The fonts in the L14_end.ai file have been converted to outlines (Type > Create Outlines)
                  to avoid having missing fonts, and the images have been embedded.
               




Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson14 folder,
               and select the L14_start.ai file on your hard disk. Click Open to open the file.
            
This is an unfinished version of the poster for a travel company. You will add and
               edit graphics to it in this lesson.
            


 Note: You need an Internet connection to sync the fonts. The syncing process may take a
                  few minutes.
               



The Missing Fonts dialog box will most likely appear. Click Sync Fonts to sync all
               the missing fonts to your computer. After they are synced and you see the message
               stating that there are no more missing fonts, click Close.
            
If you can't get the fonts to sync (a "Syncing Typekit fonts..." message doesn't go
               away), you can go to the Creative Cloud desktop application and choose Assets > Fonts
               to see what the issue may be (refer to the section "Changing font family and font
               style" in Lesson 8, "Adding Type to a Poster," for more information on how to resolve it). You can also just click Close in the Missing Fonts dialog box and ignore the missing
               fonts as you proceed. A third method is to click the Find Fonts button in the Missing
               Fonts dialog box and replace the fonts with a local font on your machine.
            

 Note: You can also go to Help (Help > Illustrator Help) and search for "Find missing fonts.
               



Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the Lesson14 folder,
               and open it. Name the file GreenIsle.ai. Leave the Format option set to Adobe Illustrator (ai) (macOS) or the Save As Type
               option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows) and then click Save. In the Illustrator
               Options dialog box, leave the Illustrator options at their default settings. Click
               OK.

Working with Adobe Bridge
Adobe Bridge CC is an application available with your Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.
            Bridge provides you with centralized access to all the media assets you need for your
            creative projects.
         

Bridge simplifies your workflow and keeps you organized. You can batch edit with ease,
            add watermarks, and even set centralized color preferences. You can access Adobe Bridge
            from within Illustrator by choosing File > Browse In Bridge.
         

Combining artwork
You can combine Illustrator artwork with images from other graphics applications in
         a variety of ways for a wide range of creative results. Sharing artwork among applications
         lets you combine continuous-tone paintings and photographs with vector art. Illustrator
         lets you create certain types of raster images, and Adobe Photoshop excels at many
         additional image-editing tasks. The images edited or created in Photoshop can then
         be inserted into Illustrator.
      

 Note: To learn more about working with vector and raster images, see the "Introducing Adobe
            Illustrator" section in Lesson 1, "Getting to Know the Work Area."
         

This lesson steps you through the process of creating a composite image, including
         combining bitmap images with vector art and working between applications. You will
         add photographic images created in Photoshop to a small poster created in Illustrator.
         Then you'll mask an image, update a placed image and then package the file.
      
Placing image files
      
You can bring raster artwork from Photoshop or other applications into Illustrator
         using the Open command, the Place command, the Paste command, drag-and-drop operations,
         and the Libraries panel. Illustrator supports most Adobe Photoshop data, including
         layer comps, layers, editable text, and paths. This means that you can transfer files
         between Photoshop and Illustrator without losing the ability to edit the artwork.
      

 Note: Illustrator includes support for DeviceN rasters. For instance, if you create a Duotone
            image in Photoshop and place it in Illustrator, it separates properly and prints the
            spot colors.
         

When placing files using the File > Place command, no matter what type of image file
         it is (JPG, GIF, PSD, AI, etc.), it can be either embedded or linked. Embedding files stores a copy of the image in the Illustrator file, and the Illustrator file
         size increases to reflect the addition of the placed file. Linked files remain separate external files, and a link to the external file is placed in
         the Illustrator file. A linked file does not add significantly to the size of the
         Illustrator file. Linking to files can be a great way to ensure that image updates
         are reflected in the Illustrator file. The linked file must always accompany the Illustrator
         file, or the link will break and the placed file will not appear in the Illustrator
         artwork.
      
Placing an image
First, you will place a JPEG (.jpg) image into your document.



Click the Layers panel tab to open the Layers panel. In the Layers panel, select the
               layer named "Pictures."
            
When you place an image, it is added to the selected layer. The layer already includes
               several shapes in the document.
            


Choose File > Place.


 Note: You may need to click the Options button in the Place dialog box to reveal the Link
                  option.
               



Navigate to the Lessons > Lesson14 > images folder, and select the Kayak.jpg file.
               Make sure that Link is selected in the Place dialog box. Click Place.
            
The pointer should now show the loaded graphics cursor. You can see "1/1" next to
               the pointer, indicating how many images are being placed (1 of 1), and a thumbnail
               so you can see what image you are placing.
            


Position the loaded graphics cursor near the upper-left corner of the artboard, and
               click to place the image. Leave the image selected.
            

 Tip: The X on a selected image indicates that the image is linked (with edges showing,
                  View > Show Edges).
               


Position the loaded graphics cursor.

Click to place the image.
The image appears on the artboard, with the upper-left corner of the image placed
               where you clicked. The image is 100% of its original size. You could also have dragged
               with the loaded graphics cursor to size the image as you placed it.
            
Notice in the Properties panel that, with the image selected, you see the words "Linked
               File," indicating that the image is linked to its source file, together with other
               information about the image. By default, placed image files are linked to their source
               file. So, if the source file is edited (outside of Illustrator), the placed image
               in Illustrator is updated. Deselecting the Link option while placing embeds the image
               file in the Illustrator file.
            


Transforming a placed image
You can duplicate and transform placed images just as you do other objects in an Illustrator
         file. Unlike vector artwork, you need to consider the resolution of the raster image
         content in your document since raster images without enough resolution may look pixelated
         when printed. Working in Illustrator, if you make an image smaller, the resolution
         of the image increases. If you make an image larger, the resolution decreases. Next,
         you will transform the Kayak.jpg image.
      

 Note: Transformations performed on a linked image in Illustrator, and any resulting resolution
            changes, do not change the original image. The changes apply only to the image within
            Illustrator.
         


 Tip: To transform a placed image, you can also open the Properties panel or Transform
            panel (Window > Transform) and change settings in either.
         




Holding down the Shift key, use the Selection tool () to drag the lower-right bounding point toward the center of the image until the
               measurement label shows a width of approximately 5 in. Release the mouse button and
               then release the key.
            

Tip: Much like other artwork, you can also Option+Shift-drag (macOS) or Alt+Shift-drag
                  (Windows) a bounding point around an image to resize from the center, while maintaining
                  the image proportions.
               



Click the Properties panel tab to show that panel.



Click the text "Linked File" at the top of the Properties panel to see the Links panel.
               With the Kayak.jpg file selected in the Links panel, click the Show Link Info arrow
               in the lower-left corner of the panel to see information about the image.
            
You can see the scale percentage as well as rotation information, size, and much more.
               Specifically, notice the PPI (Pixels Per Inch) value is approximately 150. PPI refers
               to the resolution of the image. Other transformations like rotation can also be applied
               to images using the various methods you learned in Lesson 5, "Transforming Artwork."
            


Press the Escape key to hide the panel.


Click the Flip Along Horizontal Axis option () in the Properties panel to flip the image horizontally, across the center.
            



Leave the image selected, and choose File > Save.


Cropping an image
In Illustrator, you can mask or hide part of an image, as you'll learn about in this
         lesson, but you can also crop images to permanently remove part of an image. While
         cropping an image, you can define the resolution, which can be a useful way to reduce
         file size and improve performance. Next, you'll crop part of the image of the kayakers.
      


 Tip: To crop a selected image, you can also choose Object > Crop Image or choose Crop
            Image from the context menu (right-click or Ctrl-click on the image).
         



With the image still selected, click the Crop Image button in the Properties panel.
               Click OK in the warning dialog box that appears.
            

Linked images, like the kayak image, become embedded after you crop them. That means
               that if you update the original image, Kayak.jpg, outside of Illustrator, say in Photoshop,
               the image in Illustrator will not be affected. You should now see a dotted box with
               eight handles around the selected image. The rest of the artwork is dimmed, and you
               cannot select it until you are finished cropping.
            



Drag the top crop handle down to cut off a bit of the trees at the top of the image.
You can drag the handles that appear around the image to crop different parts of the
               image. You can also define a size in the Properties panel (width and height) to crop
               to.
            


 Note: A lower PPI may result in an image that is not suitable for printing.
               


 Note: Depending on the size of your kayak image, the "Medium (150 ppi)" option may not
                  be dimmed and that's okay.
               



Click the PPI (resolution) menu in the Properties panel.
The PPI is the resolution of the image. Any options in the PPI menu that are higher
               than the original resolution of the image you are cropping are disabled. The maximum
               value that you can enter equals the resolution of the original image or 300 PPI for
               linked artwork. Choosing a lower resolution than the original can be useful if you
               want to save file size.
            



Move the pointer over the image, and drag the crop area to make it more centered,
               vertically on the image.
            


Click Apply in the Properties panel to permanently crop the image.


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Placing a Photoshop image with Show Import Options
      
When you place image files in Illustrator, you have the ability to change image options
         when the file is imported (when available). For instance, if you place a Photoshop
         file (.psd), you can choose to flatten the image or even to preserve the original
         Photoshop layers in the file. Next, you'll place a Photoshop file, set import options,
         and embed it in the Illustrator file.
      



In the Layers panel, click the eye icon () for the Pictures layer to hide the content, and then select the Background layer.
            


Choose File > Place.


In the Place dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson14 > images folder, and select
               the Lilypads.psd file. In the Place dialog box, set the following options (if you
               don't see the options, click the Options button):
            


Link: Deselected (Deselecting the Link option embeds an image file in the Illustrator file. Embedding
                     the Photoshop file allows for more options when it is placed, as you'll see.)
                  


Show Import Options: Selected (Selecting this option will open an import options dialog box where you can set import
                     options before placing.)
                  




Click Place.

The Photoshop Import Options dialog box appears because you selected Show Import Options
               in the Place dialog box.
            

 Note: Even though you select Show Import Options in the Place dialog box, the Import Options
                  dialog box will not appear if the image doesn't have multiple layers.
               




 Tip: To learn more about layer comps, see "Importing artwork from Photoshop" in Illustrator
                  Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
               


 Note: A color mode warning may appear in the Photoshop Import Options dialog box. This
                  indicates that the image you are placing may not be the same color mode as the Illustrator
                  document. For this image (and going forward), if a color warning dialog box appears,
                  click OK to dismiss it.
               



In the Photoshop Import Options dialog box, set the following options:
            


Layer Comp: All (A layer comp is a snapshot of a state of the Layers panel that you create in Photoshop.
                     In Photoshop, you can create, manage, and view multiple versions of a layout in a
                     single Photoshop file. Any comments associated with the layer comp in Photoshop will
                     appear in the Comments area.)
                  


Show Preview: Selected (Preview displays a preview of the selected layer comp.)
                  


Convert Layers To Objects: Selected (This option and the next one are available only because you deselected the Link
                     option and chose to embed the Photoshop image.)
                  


Import Hidden Layers: Selected (to import layers hidden in Photoshop)
                  




Click OK.


 Note: When the pointer snaps to the upper-left corner of the artboard, the word "intersect"
                  may appear. It may also be hidden by the top edge of the Document window.
               



Position the loaded graphics cursor in the upper-left corner of the artboard, and
               click to place the image.
            
Rather than flatten the file, you have converted the Lilypads.psd Photoshop layers
               to layers that you can show and hide in Illustrator. When placing a Photoshop file
               in particular, if you had left the Link option selected (to link to the original PSD
               file), the only option in the Options section of the Photoshop Import Options dialog
               box would have been to flatten the content.
            



In the Layers panel, click the Locate Object button () to reveal the image content in the Layers panel.
            
Notice the sublayers of Lilypads.psd. These sublayers were layers in Photoshop and
               appear in the Layers panel in Illustrator because you chose not to flatten the image
               when you placed it. Also notice that, with the image still selected on the page, the
               Properties panel shows the word "Group" at the top.
            
When you place a Photoshop file with layers and you choose to convert the layers to
               objects in the Photoshop Import Options dialog box, Illustrator treats the layers
               as separate sublayers in a group. This particular image had a layer mask in Photoshop
               applied to Layer 0, which is why the image appears to fade.
            

 Note: The Color Fill 1 sublayer was a layer in Photoshop that was filled with a green color
                  and blended via Blend Mode into the lily pad image beneath it.
               



In the Layers panel, click the eye icon () to the left of the Color Fill 1 sublayer to hide it. You may want to drag the left
               edge of the Layers panel to see more of the layer names.
            



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Placing multiple images
In Illustrator you can also place multiple files in a single action. Next, you'll
         place two images at once and then position them.
      



In the Layers panel, click the disclosure triangle () to the left of the Background layer to collapse the layer contents. Click the visibility
               column of the layers named "Pictures" and "Text" to show the contents for each and
               then ensure that the Background layer is selected.
            


Choose File > Place.


 Tip: You could also select a range of files in the Place dialog box by pressing the Shift
                  key.
               



In the Place dialog box, select the Water.jpg file in the Lessons > Lesson14 > images
               folder. Command-click (macOS) or Ctrl-click (Windows) the image named Text.psd to
               select both image files. On macOS, click the Options button, if necessary, to reveal
               other options. Deselect Show Import Options, and make sure that the Link option is
               not selected. Click Place.
            

 Note: The Place dialog box you see in Illustrator may show the images in a different view,
                  like a List view, and that's okay.
               


Tip: To discard an asset that is loaded and ready to be placed, use the arrow keys to
                  navigate to the asset, and then press the Escape key.
               



Position the loaded graphics cursor on the left side of the artboard. Press the Right
               or Left Arrow key (or Up and Down Arrow keys) a few times to see that you can cycle
               between the image thumbnails. Make sure that you see the water image thumbnail, and
               click the left edge of the artboard, about halfway down, to place the image.
            

Whichever thumbnail is showing in the loaded graphics cursor when you click in the
               Document window is placed.
            


Press and hold the spacebar and drag to the left so that you see the area off the
               right side of the artboard. Release the spacebar.
            


Move the loaded graphics cursor off the right side of the artboard. Click and drag
               down and to the right, stopping when the image is roughly as big as you see in the
               figure. Leave the image selected.
            

You can either click to place an image at 100% or click and drag to place an image
               and size it as you place it in the Document window. By dragging when you place an
               image, you are resizing the image. Resizing an image in Illustrator will most likely
               result in a different resolution than the original.
            



With the Text.psd image (the image of the green leaf) still selected, drag the selected
               art indicator (the colored box) in the Layers panel up from the Background layer to
               the Text layer to move the image to the Text layer.
            
Later, you will mask the image with text on the Text layer.


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Masking images
      


 Note: You will hear people use the phrases "clipping mask," "clipping path," and "mask."
            The way most of us refer to them, they mean the same thing.
         

To achieve certain design effects, you can apply a clipping mask (clipping path) to
         content. A clipping mask is an object whose shape masks other artwork so that only areas that lie within the
         shape are visible. In the first part of the figure to the right is an image with a
         white circle on top. In the second part of the figure, the white circle was used to
         mask or hide part of the image.
      
Only vector objects can be clipping paths; however, any artwork can be masked. You
         can also import masks created in Photoshop files. The clipping path and the masked
         object are referred to as the clipping set.
      
Applying a simple mask to an image
In this section, you'll see how to let Illustrator create a simple mask for you on
         the Kayak.jpg image so that you can hide part of the image.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, click the Kayak.jpg image to select it (the first image you placed).
            

 Tip: You can also apply a clipping mask by choosing Object > Clipping Mask > Make.
               



Click the Properties panel tab to show that panel. Click the Mask button in the Properties
               panel.
            

Clicking the Mask button applies a clipping mask to the image in the shape and size
               of the image. In this case, the image itself does not look any different.
            


 Note: You may need to drag the left edge of the Layers panel to the left to see more of
                  the names, like I did for the figure.
               



In the Layers panel, click the Locate Object button () at the bottom of the panel.
            
Notice the <Clipping Path> and <Image> sublayers that are contained within the <Clip
               Group> sublayer. The <Clipping Path> object is the clipping path (mask) that was created,
               and the <Clip Group> is a set that contains the mask and the object that is masked
               (the cropped, embedded image).
            


Editing a clipping path (mask)
In order to edit a clipping path, you need to be able to select it. Illustrator offers
         several ways to do this. Next, you'll edit the mask you just created.
      


Tip: You can also double-click a clip group (object masked with a clipping path) to enter
               Isolation mode. You can then either click the masked object (the image in this case)
               to select it or click the edge of the clipping path to select the clipping path. After
               you are finished editing, you can then exit Isolation mode using a variety of methods
               as discussed in previous lessons (like pressing the Escape key).Click the Properties
               panel tab to show the panel. With the kayak image still selected on the artboard,
               click the Edit Contents button () at the top of the Properties panel.
            


Click the Layers panel tab, and notice that the <Image> sublayer (in the <Clip Group>)
               is showing the selected-art indicator (small color box) to the far right of the sublayer
               name.
            



Back in the Properties panel, click the Edit Clipping Path button () at the top of the Properties panel, and <Clipping Path> will now be selected in
               the Layers panel.
When an object is masked, you can edit the mask, the object that is masked, or both.
               Use these two buttons to select which to edit. When you first click to select an object
               that is masked, you will edit both the mask and the masked object.
            


Choose View > Outline.



Tip: You can also edit a clipping path with transformation options, like rotate, skew,
               etc., or by using the Direct Selection tool ().With the Selection tool () selected, drag the top-middle bounding point of the selected mask down until the
               measurement label shows a height of approximately 3.25 in.
            


Choose View > GPU Preview (or Preview On CPU if that is all that is available).


Make sure that the center of the reference point is selected () in the Properties panel. Make sure that Constrain Width And Height Proportions is
               off (), and change Width to 3.5 in. If you see that Height is not 3.25 in, go ahead and make it so.
            



Click the Edit Contents button () at the top of the Properties panel to edit the Kayak.jpg image, not the mask.
            

 Tip: You can also press the arrow keys on the keyboard to reposition the image.
               



With the Selection tool (), be careful to drag from within the bounds of the mask down a little bit and release
               the mouse button. Notice that you are moving the image and not the mask.
With the Edit Contents button () selected, you can apply many transformations to the image, including scaling, moving,
               rotating, and more.
            



Choose Select > Deselect and then click the image again to select the entire clip
               group. Drag the image onto the light gray rectangle, and position it like you see
               in the figure.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Masking an object with text
In this section, you'll use text as a mask for an image you placed. To create a mask
         from text, the text needs to be on top of the image, as you'll see.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, drag the green leaf image (Text.psd) from off the right side of the artboard
               on top of the "ISLE" text.
            

 Note: If the image Text.psd is not as wide as the "ISLE" text, make sure you resize the
                  image, holding down the Shift key to constrain the proportions. Don't worry if it's
                  larger than you see in the figure.
               



Choose Object > Arrange > Send To Back. You should see the "ISLE" text now. Make sure
               that the image is positioned roughly like you see in the figure.
            


With the image still selected, Shift-click the "ISLE" text to select them both.


Click the Make Clipping Mask button in the Properties panel.


 Tip: You can also right-click over the selected content and choose Make Clipping Mask
                  from the context menu or choose Object > Clipping Mask > Make.
               

You can edit the Text.psd image and the clipping mask separately, just as you did
               previously with the masked Kayak.jpg image.
            


With the text still selected, choose Window > Graphic Styles to open the Graphic Styles
               panel. Select the Text Shadow graphic style to apply a drop shadow. Close the Graphic
               Styles panel.
            



Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.



Masking an object with multiple shapes
         
You can easily create a mask from either a single shape or multiple shapes. In order
            to create a clipping mask with multiple shapes, the shapes first need to be converted
            to a compound path. This can be done by selecting the shapes that will be used as
            the mask and choosing Object > Compound Path > Make. Ensure that the compound path
            is on top of the content to be masked and both are selected. Choose Object > Clipping
            Mask > Make.
         

Creating an opacity mask
An opacity mask is different from a clipping mask because it allows you to mask an object and also alter the transparency of artwork.
         You can make and edit an opacity mask using the Transparency panel. In this section,
         you'll create an opacity mask for the Water.jpg image so that it fades into the water
         lilies image.
      


In the Layers panel, click the disclosure triangles for all layers () to hide the content for each layer, if necessary. Click the eye icon () to the left of the Text and Pictures layers to hide their contents.
            



Choose View > Zoom Out.


With the Selection tool selected, drag the water image into the center of the artboard.
               Make sure the bottom of the image is aligned with the bottom of the artboard.
            



Select the Rectangle tool () in the Tools panel, and click in the approximate center of the artboard. In the
               Rectangle dialog box, make sure the Constrain Width And Height Proportions is off
               (), change Width to 9 in and Height to 8 in. Click OK. This will become the mask.
            



Press the D key to set the default stroke (black, 1 pt) and fill (white) for the new
               rectangle to more easily select and move it.
            

 Note: The object that is to become the opacity mask (the masking object) needs to be the
                  top selected object on the artboard. If it is a single object, like a rectangle, it
                  does not need to be a compound path. If the opacity mask is to be made from multiple
                  objects, they need to be grouped.
               



Select the Selection tool (), and drag the rectangle to align it into the bottom center of the artboard.
            



Press the Shift key, and click the Water.jpg image to select it as well.


Choose Window > Transparency to open the Transparency panel. Click the Make Mask button,
               and leave the artwork selected.
            

After clicking the Make Mask button, the button now shows as "Release." If you were
               to click the button again, the image would no longer be masked.
            



 Tip: You can also click the word "Opacity" in the Properties panel to reveal the Transparency
            panel.
         


 Note: If you wanted to create a mask that was the same dimensions as the image, instead
            of drawing a shape, you could have simply clicked the Make Mask button in the Transparency
            panel.
         

Editing an opacity mask
      
Next, you'll adjust the opacity mask that you just created.


 Tip: To disable and enable an opacity mask, you can also choose Disable Opacity Mask or
            Enable Opacity Mask from the Transparency panel menu.
         



In the Transparency panel, Shift-click the mask thumbnail (as indicated by the white
               rectangle on the black background) to disable the mask.
            
Notice that a red X appears on the mask in the Transparency panel and that the entire
               Water.jpg image reappears in the Document window.
            


In the Transparency panel, Shift-click the mask thumbnail to enable the mask again.


 Tip: To show the mask by itself (in grayscale if the original mask had color in it) on
                  the artboard, you can also Option-click (macOS) or Alt-click (Windows) the mask thumbnail
                  in the Transparency panel.
               



Click to select the mask thumbnail on the right side of the Transparency panel. If
               the mask isn't selected on the artboard, click to select it with the Selection tool
               ().
            
Clicking the opacity mask in the Transparency panel selects the mask (the rectangle
               path) on the artboard. With the mask selected, you can't edit other artwork on the
               artboard. Also, notice that the document tab shows (<Opacity Mask>/Opacity Mask),
               indicating that you are now editing the mask.
            



Click the Layers panel tab and click the disclosure triangle () for the <Opacity Mask> layer to reveal the contents, if necessary.
            
In the Layers panel, notice that the layer <Opacity Mask> appears, indicating that
               the mask—rather than the artwork that is being masked—is selected.
            


With the mask selected in the Transparency panel and on the artboard, change the fill
               color to a white-to-black linear gradient, called White, Black, in the Properties
               panel.
            

You'll now see that where there is white in the mask, the Water.jpg image is showing,
               and where there is black, it is hidden. The gradient mask gradually reveals the image.
            


Make sure that the Fill box toward the bottom of the Tools panel is selected.


Select the Gradient tool () in the Tools panel. Holding down the Shift key, position the pointer close to the
               bottom of the Water.jpg image. Click and drag up to just below the top of the mask
               shape, as shown in the figure. Release the mouse button and then release the Shift
               key.
            

Notice how the mask has changed appearance in the Transparency panel. Next, you'll
               move the image but not the opacity mask. With the image thumbnail selected in the
               Transparency panel, both the image and the mask are linked together by default so
               that if you move the image, the mask moves as well.
            


 Note: You have access to the link icon only when the image thumbnail, not the mask thumbnail,
                  is selected in the Transparency panel.
               



In the Transparency panel, click the image thumbnail so that you are no longer editing
               the mask. Click the link icon () between the image thumbnail and the mask thumbnail. This allows you to move just
               the image or the mask but not both.
            


 Note: The position of Water.jpg does not have to match the figure exactly.
               



With the Selection tool, drag the Water.jpg image down. After dragging a little, release
               the mouse button to see where it's positioned.
            


In the Transparency panel, click the broken link icon () between the image thumbnail and the mask thumbnail to link the two together again.
            


Choose Object > Arrange > Send To Back to send the Water.jpg image behind the Lilypads.psd
               image.
            
It probably won't look like anything has changed on the artboard, but later you will
               attempt to select the Lilypads.psd image, and it will need to be on top of the Water.jpg
               image.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Working with image links

 Note: Learn about working with links and Creative Cloud library items, in Lesson 13, "Creating Artwork for a T-Shirt."
         

When you place images in Illustrator and either link to them or embed them, you can
         see a listing of these images in the Links panel. You use the Links panel to see and
         manage all linked or embedded artwork. The Links panel displays a small thumbnail
         of the artwork and uses icons to indicate the artwork's status. From the Links panel,
         you can view the images that have been linked to and embedded, replace a placed image,
         update a linked image that has been edited outside of Illustrator, or edit a linked
         image in the original application, such as Photoshop.
      
Finding link information
When you place an image, it can be helpful to see where the original image is located,
         what transformations have been applied to the image (such as rotation and scale),
         and more information. Next, you'll explore the Links panel to discover image information.
      



In the Layers panel, make sure that all of the layers are collapsed and then click
               the visibility column to the left of the Text and Pictures layers to show the layer
               contents on the artboard.
            


Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.


Choose Window > Links to open the Links panel.

 Tip: You can also double-click the image in the Layers panel list to see the image information.
               


 Note: The link information you see may be different than what you see in the figure, and
                  that's okay.
               



Select the Kayak.jpg image in the Links panel. Click the toggle arrow in the lower-left
               corner of the Links panel to reveal the link information at the bottom of the panel.
            

Looking in the Links panel, you'll see a listing of all the images you've placed.
               You can tell whether an image has been embedded by the embedded icon (). You'll also see information about the image, such as the fact that it's embedded
               (Embedded File), the resolution, transformation information, and more.
            


Click the Go To Link option () below the list of images.
            

The Kayak.jpg image will be selected and centered in the Document window.


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Embedding and unembedding images
As was mentioned previously, if you choose not to link to an image when placing it,
         the image is embedded in the Illustrator file. That means that the image data is stored
         within the Illustrator document. You can choose to embed an image later, after placing
         and linking to it, if you choose. Also, you might want to use embedded images outside
         of Illustrator or to edit them in an image-editing application like Photoshop. Illustrator
         allows you to unembed images, which saves the embedded artwork to your file system
         as a PSD or TIFF file (you can choose) and automatically links it to the Illustrator
         file. Next, you will unembed an image in the document.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Click to select the water image at the bottom of the artboard.
The water image was embedded when you originally placed it. With an image embedded,
               you may realize that you need to make an edit to that image in a program like Adobe
               Photoshop. You can just as easily unembed an image, which is what you'll do next to
               the water image.
            


 Tip: You can also choose Unembed from the Links panel menu ().
               


 Note: The embedded Water.jpg image data is unembedded from the file and saved as a PSD
                  file in the images folder. The water image on the artboard is now linked to the PSD
                  file.
               



Click the Unembed button in the Properties panel.


In the Unembed dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson14 > images folder (if
               you are not already there). Make sure Photoshop (*.PSD) is chosen in the File Format
               menu (macOS) or the Save As Type (Windows) menu, and click Save.
            



Choose Select > Deselect.


Replacing a linked image
      
You can easily replace a linked or embedded image with another image to update the
         artwork. The replacement image is positioned exactly where the original image was,
         so no adjustment should be necessary if the new image is of the same dimensions. If
         you scaled the image that you are replacing, you may need to resize the replacement
         image to match the original. Next, you'll replace an image.
      



Select the Selection tool () and drag the gradient-filled rectangle off the left edge of the artboard on top
               of the Kayak.tif image, centering it on the image using the Smart Guides.
            


Choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front to bring the gradient-filled rectangle on
               top of the image.
            



In the Layers panel, click the edit column to the left of the Background layer to
               lock the layer content on the artboard.
            



Drag across the kayak image, the gradient-filled rectangle, and the light gray rectangle
               beneath it to select the artwork. Make sure not to select the text.
            


Choose Object > Group.


Choose Edit > Copy and then choose Edit > Paste to paste a copy.


 Note: The figure shows the image already replaced. The pointer is simply pointing to the
                  Relink button for reference.
               



In the Links panel, with one of the kayak images selected, click the Relink button
               () below the list of images. In the Place dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson14
               > images folder, and select another image like People.psd. Make sure that the Link
               option is selected. Click Place to replace the kayak image with the People.psd image.
            



Drag the kayak image group and the image group with the people into position like
               you see in the figure.
            


Position the pointer just off the upper-right corner, and when you see the rotate
               arrows (), click and drag to rotate. Alternate the rotation like you see in the figure.
            


Choose File > Save.


Packaging a file
When you package a file, you create a folder that contains a copy of the Illustrator document, any
         necessary fonts, copies of the linked graphics, and a report that contains information
         about the packaged files. This is an easy way to hand off all necessary files for
         an Illustrator project. Next, you'll package the poster file.
      

 Note: If the file needs to be saved, a dialog box will appear to notify you.
         



Choose File > Package. In the Package dialog box, set the following options:


Click the folder icon (), and navigate to the Lesson14 folder, if you are not already there. Click Choose
                     (macOS) or Select Folder (Windows) to return to the Package dialog box.
                  


Folder name: GreenIsle (remove "_Folder" from the name)
                  


Options: Leave at default settings.





Click Package.

 Note: The Create Report option, when selected, will create a package report (summary) in
                  the form of a .txt (text) file, which is placed in the package folder by default.
               

The Copy Links option copies all the linked files to the new folder it creates. The Collect Links In Separate
               Folder option creates a folder called Links and copies the links into there. The Relink
               Linked Files To Document option updates the links within the Illustrator document
               to link to the new copies.
            


In the next dialog box that discusses font-licensing restrictions, click OK.
Clicking Back would allow you to deselect Copy Fonts Used In Document (Except CJK
               & Typekit fonts).
            


In the final dialog box to appear, click Show Package to see the package folder.
In the package folder should be a copy of the Illustrator document and a folder named
               Links that contains all the linked images. The GreenIsle Report (.txt file) contains
               information about the document contents.
            


Return to Illustrator.


Creating a PDF
      
Portable Document Format (PDF) is a universal file format that preserves the fonts,
         images, and layout of source documents created on a wide range of applications and
         platforms. Adobe PDF is the standard for the secure, reliable distribution and exchange
         of electronic documents and forms around the world. Adobe PDF files are compact and
         complete and can be shared, viewed, and printed by anyone with software such as the
         free Adobe Reader.
      
You can create different types of PDF files from within Illustrator. You can create
         multipage PDFs, layered PDFs, and PDF/x-compliant files. Layered PDFs allow you to
         save one PDF with layers that can be used in different contexts. PDF/X-compliant files
         ease the burden of color, font, and trapping issues in printing. Next, you'll save
         this project as a PDF so that you can send it to someone else to view.
      


Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, choose Adobe PDF (pdf) from the
               Format menu (macOS) or Adobe PDF (*.PDF) from the Save As Type menu (Windows). Navigate
               to the Lessons > Lesson14 folder, if necessary. Notice that you have the option, at
               the bottom of the dialog box, to save all of the artboards in the PDF or a range of
               artboards. Click Save.
            


Note: If you want to learn about the options and other presets in the Save Adobe PDF dialog
               box, choose Help > Illustrator Help and search for "Creating Adobe PDF files."In the
               Save Adobe PDF dialog box, click the Adobe PDF Preset menu to see all of the different
               PDF presets available. Ensure that [Illustrator Default] is chosen, and click Save
               PDF.
            

There are many ways to customize the creation of a PDF. Creating a PDF using the [Illustrator
               Default] preset creates a PDF in which all Illustrator data is preserved. PDFs created
               with this preset can be reopened in Illustrator without any loss of data. If you are
               planning on saving a PDF for a particular purpose, such as viewing on the Web or printing,
               you may want to choose another preset or adjust the options.
            

 Note: You may notice that the file currently open is the PDF (GreenIsle.pdf).
               



Choose File > Save, if necessary, and then choose File > Close.

Review answers


A linked file is a separate, external file connected to the Illustrator file by a link. A linked
                  file does not add significantly to the size of the Illustrator file. The linked file
                  must accompany the Illustrator file to preserve the link and to ensure that the placed
                  file appears when you open the Illustrator file. An embedded file is included in the Illustrator file. The Illustrator file size reflects the addition
                  of the embedded file. Because the embedded file is part of the Illustrator file, no
                  link can be broken. You can update linked and embedded files using the Relink button
                  () in the Links panel.
               


A mask can be a simple or compound path, and masks (such as an opacity mask) may be
                  imported with placed Photoshop files. You can also create layer clipping masks with
                  any shape that is the topmost object of a group or layer.
               


You create an opacity mask by placing the object to be used as a mask on top of the
                  object to be masked. Then you select the mask and the object(s) to be masked, and
                  either click the Make Mask button in the Transparency panel or choose Make Opacity
                  Mask from the Transparency panel menu.
               


To replace a placed image with a different image, select the image in the Links panel.
                  Then click the Relink button (), and locate and select the replacement image. Click Place.
               


Packaging is used to gather all of the necessary pieces for an Illustrator document. Packaging
                  creates a copy of the Illustrator file, the linked images, and the necessary fonts
                  (if desired), and it gathers the copies into a folder.

                  from your Account page, make sure to do so now. See the "Getting Started" section
                  at the beginning of the book.
               



Start Adobe Illustrator CC.


Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson15 folder.
               Select the L15_start.ai file, and click Open. This lesson contains a fictitious business
               name, address, and website address for the purposes of the project.
            



The Missing Fonts dialog box will most likely appear. Click Sync Fonts to sync all
               the missing fonts to your computer (your list may not match the figure). After they
               are synced and you see the message stating that there are no more missing fonts, click
               Close.
            

 Note: If you can't get the fonts to sync, you can go to the Creative Cloud desktop application
                  and choose Assets > Fonts to see what the issue may be (refer to the section "Changing
                  font family and font style" in Lesson 8, "Adding Type to a Poster," for more information on how to resolve it). You can also just click Close in the
                  Missing Fonts dialog box and ignore the missing fonts as you proceed. A third method
                  is to click the Find Fonts button in the Missing Fonts dialog box and replace the
                  fonts with a local font on your machine.

               Options dialog box, leave the Illustrator options at their default settings and then
               click OK.
            


Choose Select > Deselect, if necessary.


Creating Pixel-Perfect Drawings
      
When creating content for use on the Web, in mobile apps, in onscreen presentations,
         and more, it's important that images saved from vector art look sharp. To enable designers
         to create pixel-accurate designs, you can align artwork to the pixel grid using the
         Snap To Pixel option. The pixel grid is a grid of 72 squares per inch, vertically and horizontally, that is viewable when
         you zoom to 600% or higher with Pixel Preview mode enabled (View > Pixel Preview).
      
Pixel-aligned is an object-level property that enables an object to have its vertical
         and horizontal paths aligned to the pixel grid. This property remains with the object
         when the object is modified. Any vertical or horizontal path in the object gets aligned
         to the pixel grid as long as the property is set for it.
      
Aligning new artwork to the pixel grid
When Snap To Pixel (View > Snap To Pixel) is enabled, shapes that are drawn, modified,
         or transformed appear crisp. This makes most artwork, including most Live Shapes,
         align to the pixel grid automatically. In this first section, you'll explore the pixel
         grid and how to align new content to it.
      


In the AssetExport.ai file, choose File > Document Color Mode, and you will see that
               RGB Color is selected.
            

 Tip: After you create a document, you can change the document color mode using File >
                  Document Color Mode. This sets the default color mode for all new colors you create
                  and the existing swatches. RGB is the correct color mode to use when creating content
                  for the Web, for apps, or for onscreen presentations.
               

When designing for onscreen viewing (web, apps, etc.), RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is the
               preferred color mode for documents in Illustrator. When you create a new document
               (File > New), you can choose which color mode to use with the Color Mode option. In
               the New Document dialog box, choosing any document profile, except for Print, sets Color Mode to RGB by default.
            


Select the Selection tool (), and click to select the brown circle with the word "ACCESSORIES" beneath it. Press
               Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) several times to zoom in closely to the selected
               artwork.
            


Choose View > Pixel Preview to preview a rasterized version of the design.

When you export assets in a format such as GIF, JPG, or PNG, any artwork that was
               vector is rasterized in the resulting file. Turning on Pixel Preview is a great way
               to be able to see what the artwork will look like when it's rasterized.
            



Choose 600% from the View menu in the lower-left corner of the Document window (in
               the Status bar), and make sure you can still see the brown circle above the "ACCESSORIES"
               text.
            
By zooming in to at least 600% and with Pixel Preview turned on, you can see a pixel
               grid appear. The pixel grid divides the artboard into 1 pt. (1/72-inch) increments.
               For the next steps, you need to see the pixel grid (zoom level of 600% or greater).
            

 Tip: You can turn off the pixel grid by choosing Illustrator CC > Preferences > Guides
                  & Grid (macOS) or Edit > Preferences > Guides & Grid (Windows) and deselecting Show
                  Pixel Grid (Above 600% Zoom).
               



Click to select one of the white paths on the brown circle.
This is an easy way to set the stroke and fill formatting for the next object drawn
               to match the selected artwork.
            



Select the Rectangle tool () in the Tools panel. Draw a simple rectangle on the brown circle.
            
You might notice that the edges of the rectangle look a little "fuzzy." That's because
               in this document, Snap To Pixel is turned off.
            

 Note: As of the writing of this book, the creation tools affected by Snap To Pixel are
                  the Pen tool, the Curvature tool, shape tools like the Ellipse tool and the Rectangle
                  tool, the Line Segment tool, the Arc tool, Grid tools, and the Artboard tool.
               



Press Delete or Backspace to remove the rectangle.


Choose View > Snap To Pixel to turn on Snap To Pixel.
Now, any shapes that are drawn, modified, or transformed will snap to the pixel grid
               if possible. By default, Snap To Pixel is turned on when you create a new document
               that uses the Web or Mobile document profile.
            


 Tip: You can also click the Snap To Pixel option in the Properties panel with nothing
                  selected and the Selection tool selected, or you can select the Align Art To Pixel
                  Grid option () on the right end of the Control panel (Window > Control).
               



With the Rectangle tool selected, draw a simple rectangle to complete the coffee cup
               on the brown circle, and notice that the edges are "cleaner."
            
The vertical and horizontal segments of the drawn artwork snap to the pixel grid.
               In the next section, you'll see that you can snap existing artwork to the pixel grid.
               In this case, I had you redraw the shape just to see the difference.
            



Select the Selection tool (), and drag the rectangle into position like you see in the figure. You may need to
               resize the rectangle to look better.
            


Aligning existing artwork to the pixel grid
You can also align existing artwork to the pixel grid in several ways, as you will
         do in this section.
      


Select the Selection tool (), and click to select the rounded rectangle above the rectangle you drew.
            


Click the Align To Pixel Grid button in the Properties panel to the right (or choose
               Object > Make Pixel Perfect).
            

The rounded rectangle was created when Align To Pixel Grid wasn't selected. After
               the rectangle was aligned to the pixel grid, the horizontal and vertical straight
               edges were snapped to the closest pixel grid lines. Live Shapes and Live Corners are
               preserved when doing this.
            
Objects that you pixel-align that do not have any straight vertical or horizontal
               segments are not modified to align to the pixel grid. For example, because a rotated
               rectangle does not have straight vertical or horizontal segments, it is not nudged
               to produce crisp paths when the pixel-aligned property is set for it.
            


Click to select one of the wavy white lines above the rounded rectangle, which selects
               a group of lines. Choose Object > Make Pixel Perfect.
            

 Note: The Align To Pixel Grid button does not appear in the Properties panel when an open
                  path is selected.
               


You will see a message in the Document window, "Selection Contains Art That Cannot
               Be Made Pixel Perfect." In this case, this means there are no vertical or horizontal
               straight edges to align.
            


Click the white "handle" shape on the right side of the coffee mug. Press Command++
               (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) several times to zoom in closely to the selected artwork.
            


Drag the upper-right corner bounding point to make the handle a bit larger.

After dragging, notice that resizing the shape using the corner or side handles fixes
               the corresponding edges (snaps them to the pixel grid) but not all of them.
            



Choose Object > Make Pixel Perfect to ensure that all of the vertical or horizontal
               straight edges are aligned to the pixel grid.
            

 Note: Moving artwork is constrained to be in whole pixels when transforming via the Selection
                  tool, Direct Selection tool, Live Shape center widget, arrow keys, and Artboard tool.
                  The Direct Selection tool snaps anchor points and handles to pixel or subpixel locations
                  depending on the stroke settings of the path. This snap is similar to the Pen tool
                  snap during creation.
               



Choose Select > Deselect (if available) and then choose File > Save.


Exporting artboards and assets
      

 Tip: To learn more about working with web graphics, search for "File formats for exporting
            artwork" in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
         

In Illustrator, using the File > Export > Export For Screens command and the Asset
         Export panel, you can export entire artboards, perhaps to show a design in progress,
         or selected assets. The exported content can be saved in several file formats, such
         as JPEG, SVG, PDF, and PNG. These formats are optimized for use on the Web, devices,
         and onscreen presentations and are compatible with most browsers, yet each has different
         capabilities. The selected artwork is automatically isolated from the rest of the
         design and saved as an individual file.
      

 Note: To learn more about creating slices, search for "Create slices" in Adobe Illustrator
            Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
         


Slicing content
In the past, before the Export For Screens command or the Asset Export panel, you
            needed to isolate artwork you wanted to export. This was done by placing the artwork
            on its own artboard or by slicing the content. In Illustrator, you can create slices
            to define the boundaries of different web elements in your artwork. When you save
            the artwork using the File > Export > Save For Web (Legacy) command, you can choose
            to save each slice as an independent file with its own format and settings.
         

It is not necessary to isolate artwork by slicing when using the File > Export > Export
            For Screens command or Asset Export panel since artwork is isolated automatically.
         

Exporting artboards
In this section, you'll see how to export artboards in your document. This could be
         useful if you want to show someone a design you are working on or to capture a design
         for use in a presentation, website, app, or other.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.


Choose File > Export > Export For Screens.
In the Export For Screens dialog box that appears, you can choose between exporting
               artboards and exporting assets. Once you decide what to export, you can set export
               settings on the right side of the dialog box.
            


With the Artboards tab selected, on the right side of the dialog box, ensure that
               All is selected.
            

You can choose to export all or a specific range of artboards. This document has only
               one artboard, so selecting All is the same as selecting a range of 1. Selecting Full
               Document will export all artwork in a single file.
            


Click the folder icon () to the right of the Export To field. Navigate to the Lessons > Lesson15 folder,
               and click Choose (macOS) or Select Folder (Windows).
            


Click the Format menu, and choose JPG 80.

In the Formats section of the Export For Screens dialog box, you can set a Scale factor
               for the exported asset, create (or in this case edit) a suffix for the filename, and
               change the format. You can also export multiple versions with different scale factors
               and formats by clicking the + Add Scale button.
            


Click Export Artboard.

 Tip: To avoid creating subfolders, like the folder "1x," you can deselect Create Sub-folders
                  in the Export For Screens dialog box when exporting.
               

The Lesson15 folder should open, and you should see a folder named "1x" and, in that
               folder, an image named "Artboard 1-80.jpg." The "-80" suffix refers to the quality
               you set when exporting.
            


Close the folder, and return to Illustrator.


Exporting assets
      

 Note: There are several methods for exporting artwork in a variety of formats. You can
            select artwork in your Illustrator document and choose File > Export Selection. This
            adds the selected artwork to the Asset Export panel and opens the Export For Screens
            dialog box. You can choose from the same formats you saw in the previous section.
         

You can also quickly and easily export individual assets in file formats such as JPG,
         PNG, and SVG using the Asset Export panel. The Asset Export panel lets you collect
         assets that you might export frequently and can be a great tool for web and mobile
         workflows because it allows for the export of multiple assets with a single click.
         In this section, you'll open the Asset Export panel and see how to both collect artwork
         in the panel and use it to export that collected artwork.
      


With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the white "Pluralist" logo at the top of the artboard.
            


Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) several times to zoom in closely to the
               logo.
            


With the logo selected, choose Window > Asset Export to open the Asset Export panel.
The Asset Export panel is where you can save content for export now or later. It can
               work in conjunction with the Export For Screens dialog box to set export options for
               the selected assets, as you'll see.
            

 Tip: To add artwork to the Asset Export panel, you can also right-click the artwork in
                  the Document window and choose Collect For Export > either As Single Asset or As Multiple
                  Assets.
               



Drag the selected Pluralist logo into the top part of the Asset Export panel. When
               you see a plus sign (+) appear, release the mouse button to add the artwork to the
               Asset Export panel.
            

 Tip: To delete an asset from the Asset Export panel, you can either delete the original
                  artwork in the document or select the asset thumbnail in the Asset Export panel and
                  click the Remove Selected Assets From This Panel button.
               


The artwork you added to the panel is now called "pluralist" or something similar.
               The asset is tied to the original artwork in the document. In other words, if you
               update the artwork in the document, the asset is updated in the Asset Export panel.
               Every asset you add to the Asset Export panel is saved with the panel and will be
               in there until you delete it from either the document or the Asset panel. You can
               also drag multiple objects into the Asset Export panel, and each will be saved as
               a separate asset.
            

 Tip: If you Option-drag (macOS) or Alt-drag (Windows) multiple objects into the Asset
                  Export panel, the selected content will become a single asset in the Asset Export
                  panel.
               



Click the name of the asset in the Asset Export panel, and rename it PluralistLogo.
            

 Note: You may need to double-click to edit the name.
               


The asset name that appears is based on what the artwork is named in the Layers panel.
               Also, how you name assets in the Asset Export panel is up to you. I name them so later
               I can more easily keep track of what each asset is used for.
            


Click the Pluralist logo asset thumbnail to select it in the Asset Export panel.
As you add more and more assets to the panel using various methods, you will need
               to first select the assets you'd like to export.
            


In the Export Settings area of the Asset Export panel, choose SVG from the Format
               menu, if necessary.
            
The SVG is perfect for the website, but in this case, a co-worker has asked for a
               PNG version of the same logo as well.
            

 Note: If you are creating assets for use on iOS or Android, you could also click the iOS
                  or Android options to create a series of scaled export options, by default.
               



Click the + Add Scale button below the SVG option in the panel to export the artwork
               in another format (in this case). Change Scale to 1x and ensure that Format is PNG.
            

This sets the format for all of the selected assets in the Asset Export panel. You
               can also set a scale (1x, 2x, etc.) if you need multiple scaled versions of the selected
               assets—perhaps for Retina and non-Retina displays when it comes to formats like JPEG
               or PNG. You can also add a suffix to the exported file name. A suffix could be something
               like "@1x" to indicate the 100% scaled version of an exported asset.
            


With the PluralistLogo thumbnail selected at the top of the Asset Export panel, click
               the Export button at the bottom of the Asset Export panel to export the selected asset.
               In the dialog box that appears, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson15 > Asset_Export
               folder, and click Choose (macOS) or Select Folder (Windows) to export the assets.
            

Both the SVG file (PluralistLogo.svg) and the PNG file (PluralistLogo.png) will be
               exported to the Asset_Export folder in separate folders.
            
You can also click the Launch The Export For Screens Dialog button () at the bottom of the Asset Export panel. This will open the Export For Screens dialog
               box where you can set all of the same settings, including a few more.
            


Creating CSS from your design
      

 Note: Exporting or copying CSS from Illustrator CC does not create HTML for a web page. It is intended to create CSS that is applied to HTML
            you create elsewhere, such as in Adobe Dreamweaver.
         

If you are building a website or want to hand off content to a developer, you can
         transform the visual designs you create in Illustrator to Cascading Style Sheets styles
         using the CSS Properties panel (Window > CSS Properties) or File > Export > Export
         As command. Cascading Style Sheets is a specification for formatting rules, much like paragraph and character styles
         in Illustrator, that control the appearance of content in a web page. Unlike paragraph
         and character styles in Illustrator, CSS can control not only the look and feel of
         text but also the formatting and positioning of page elements found in HTML.
      

The great thing about generating CSS from your Illustrator artwork is that it allows
         for flexible web workflows. You can export all of the styling from a document, or
         you can just copy the styling code for a single object or a series of objects and
         paste it into an external web editor, like Adobe Dreamweaver. This can be a great
         way to move the styling from your web design in Illustrator straight to your HTML
         editor or to hand it off to a web developer. But creating CSS styling and using it
         effectively requires a bit of setup in your Illustrator CC document, and that's what
         you'll learn about next.
      

 Note: To learn more about CSS, visit the "Understand Cascading Style Sheets" section of
            Adobe Dreamweaver Help (https://helpx.adobe.com/dreamweaver/using/cascading-style-sheets.html).
         

Setting up your design for generating CSS
      
If you intend to export or copy and paste CSS from Illustrator CC, setting up the
         Illustrator CC file properly before creating CSS allows you to name the CSS styles
         that are generated. In this section, you'll look at the CSS Properties panel and see
         how you can set up the content for style export using named or unnamed content.
      


Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.


Choose Select > Deselect, if available.


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window and then press Command+- (macOS) or Ctrl+- (Windows)
               to zoom out.
            



Choose Window > CSS Properties to open the CSS Properties panel. Using the CSS Properties
               panel, you can do the following:
            


Preview CSS code for selected objects.


Copy CSS code for selected objects.


Export generated styling for selected objects to a CSS file (along with any images
                     used).
                  


Change options for the CSS code exported.


Export the CSS for all objects to a CSS file.




With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the blue rectangle behind the navigation and logo at the
               top of the artboard (see the following figure).
            
In the CSS Properties panel you'll see a message in the preview area. Instead of CSS
               code (which is what the preview area typically shows), the message states that the
               object needs to be named in the Layers panel or you need to allow Illustrator to create
               styling from "unnamed objects."
            



Open the Layers panel (Window > Layers), and click the Locate Object button () at the bottom of the panel to easily find the selected object in the panel.
            


Double-click directly on the name of the selected <Rectangle> object in the Layers
               panel, and change the name to navbar (lowercase). Press Return or Enter to make the change.
            

 Note: You may need to drag the left edge of the Layers panel to the left to see the entire
                  name of the object.
               


 Note: The content for the sublayer named "pluralist" may be showing in your Layers panel
                  and that's okay.
               




Look in the CSS Properties panel again, and you should see a style named .navbar in
               the preview area. Drag the bottom of the panel down to show more.
            


 Note: If you see a style named ".navbar_1_," it's usually because there is an extra space
                  after the name "navbar" in the Layers panel.
               


 Tip: You can tell a style is a class in CSS because the name has a period (.) before it.
               

When content is unnamed in the Layers panel (it has the default naming), a CSS style
               is not created for it, by default. If you name the object in the Layers panel, the
               CSS is generated, and the name of the style created matches the object name in the
               Layers panel. Illustrator creates styles called classes for most content.
            
For objects in the design (not including text objects, as you will see), the name
               you give them in the Layers panel should match the class name in the HTML that is
               created in a separate HTML editor, like Dreamweaver. But, you can also forgo naming
               the objects in the Layers panel and simply create generic styles that you can then
               export or paste into an HTML editor and name there. You will see how to do that next.
            



With the Selection tool, click to select the brown circle behind the cup you worked
               with earlier. In the CSS Properties panel, a style will not appear since the object
               is unnamed in the Layers panel (it just has the generic <Path> name).
            


Click the Export Options button () at the bottom of the CSS Properties panel.
            
The CSS Export Options dialog box that appears contains export options that you can
               set, such as which units to use, which properties to include in the styles, and other
               options, such as which Vendor prefixes to include.
            


Select Generate CSS For Unnamed Objects, and click OK.



With the brown circle still selected, a style named ".st0" appears in the preview
               area of the CSS Properties panel.
            

.st0 is short for "style 0" and is a generic name for the formatting that is generated.
               Every object that you don't name in the Layers panel will now be named .st1, .st2,
               and so on, after turning on Generate CSS For Unnamed Objects. This type of style naming
               can be useful if, for instance, you are creating the web page yourself and you are
               going to paste or export the CSS from Illustrator and name it in your HTML editor
               or if you simply needed some of the CSS formatting for a style you already have in
               your HTML editor.
            


Choose Select > Deselect and then choose File > Save.


Working with character styles and CSS code
      
Illustrator will create CSS styles based on text formatting, as well. Formatting,
         such as font family, font size, leading (called line-height in CSS), color, kerning and tracking (collectively called letter-spacing in CSS), and more, can be captured in the CSS code. Any character styles that are
         applied to text in your design are listed in the CSS Properties panel as a CSS style
         and have the same name as the character style. Text that has formatting applied, without
         a character style applied, will have a generic CSS style name when Illustrator generates
         the style.
      

 Note: Currently, paragraph styles are not taken into account when naming styles in the
            CSS code that is generated.
         

Next, you'll create and then apply a character style to text.


In the CSS Properties panel, notice the style named [Normal Character Style], toward
               the top of the panel.
            
In the CSS Properties panel, only character styles that are applied to text appear.
               The Normal Character Style is applied to text by default, so it appears in the CSS
               Properties panel. If you create character styles but don't apply them to text, they
               will not appear in the CSS Properties panel.
            


Choose Window > Type > Character Styles to open the Character Styles panel.


With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the paragraph of text below the heading "BRAND," on the left end of the footer.
            


Press Command++ (macOS) or Ctrl++ (Windows) several times to zoom in to the text.


Select the Type tool () in the Tools panel. Select the entire paragraph that begins with "The Pluralist
               is a lifestyle brand...."
            


Click the style named "p" in the Character Styles panel to apply it to the selected
               text.
            



Select the Selection tool (), and with the text object still selected, you will see the character style named
               "p" in the CSS Properties panel list. This indicates that it is applied to text in
               the design. You will also see CSS code in the preview area of the panel.
            

 Tip: You can also use the character styles listed in the CSS Properties panel as a way
                  to apply the styles to text.
               


Selecting a text object (not the text) will show all the generated CSS code for the
               styling used in the entire text area. With the text selected, the CSS is not shown
               in the CSS Properties panel.
            


With the Selection tool, click the type object in the footer that contains the "Shopping"
               heading. Look in the CSS Properties panel, and you will see a series of CSS styles
               listed. These are the styles applied to all the text in the type area. You may want to drag the bottom of the CSS Properties
               panel down to see more of the styling.
            
Selecting a type area gives you the ability to see all the CSS code generated from
               the styling. It is also a great way to be able to copy or export all the text formatting
               from a selected type area.
            


 Note: The ordering of the styles you see in the CSS Properties panel may not match the
                  figure and that's okay.
               



Working with graphic styles and CSS code
      
CSS code can also be copied or exported for any graphic styles that are applied to
         content. Next, you'll apply a graphic style and see the generated CSS code.
      


Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window. With the Selection tool (), click to select the blue rectangle behind the ship. You may want to zoom out a
               bit.
            


Choose Window > Graphic Styles. In the Graphic Styles panel, click the graphic style
               named "GradientBox." You can close the Graphic Styles panel group.
            


 Tip: Like selecting a character style in the CSS Properties panel to apply the formatting,
                  you can also select content and select a graphic style listed in the CSS Properties
                  panel to apply it.
               

Looking in the CSS Properties panel, you will see the graphic style named "GradientBox"
               now listed, because it is applied to content in your document.
            
You will also see CSS code for a style. Mine is named ".content_1_," but yours may
               be different. The CSS code is generated from the GradientBox graphic style you just
               saw since that graphic style is applied. But it's not naming the style with the "GradientBox"
               name since the graphic style is just a way to apply formatting. Remember, this is
               an unnamed CSS style because you didn't rename the selected object (the rectangle)
               in the Layers panel.
            



Leave the rectangle selected and then choose File > Save.


Copying CSS
      
At times, you may need to capture only a bit of CSS code from part of your design
         to paste into your HTML editor or to send to a web developer. Illustrator lets you
         copy and paste CSS code easily. Next, you'll copy the CSS for a few objects and learn
         about how grouping can change the way CSS code is generated.
      



With the rectangle still selected, click the Copy Selected Style button () at the bottom of the CSS Properties panel. This copies the CSS code currently showing
               in the panel.
            
Next, you will select multiple objects and copy the generated CSS code at the same
               time.
            

 Note: You may see a yield sign icon () at the bottom of the panel when certain content is selected. It indicates that not
                  all of the Illustrator appearance attributes (such as the multiple strokes applied
                  to the shape) can be written in the CSS code for the selected content.
               



With the Selection tool () selected and the rectangle still selected, Shift-click the brown circle to select
               both objects.
            
In the CSS Properties panel, you will not see any CSS code since you need to tell
               Illustrator to generate CSS code for more than one selected object.
            

 Tip: When CSS code appears in the CSS Properties panel for selected content, you can also
                  select part of the code, right-click the selected code, and then choose Copy to copy
                  just that selection.
               



Click the Generate CSS button () at the bottom of the panel.
            

The code for two CSS styles, .st0 and .content_1_, now appears in the preview area
               of the CSS Properties panel. Your style names may be different, and that's okay. To
               see both styles, you may need to scroll down in the panel. Yours may also be in a
               different order, and that's okay.
            

 Note: The styling or naming you see may be different, and that's okay.
               

With both styles showing in the CSS Properties panel, you could copy the styles and
               paste them into your HTML editor code or paste them into an email to send to a web
               developer, for instance.
            


With the Selection tool, click to select the ship.
            

In the CSS Properties panel, you will see CSS code for an .image style. That code
               contains a background-image property. When Illustrator encounters artwork (or raster
               images) that it can't make CSS code from or a group of objects, it rasterizes the
               exported content (not the artwork on the artboard) when you export the CSS code. The CSS code that is generated
               can be applied to an HTML object, like a div, and the PNG image will be applied as
               a background image in the HTML object.
            



Drag a marquee selection across the brown circle and cup shapes to select them.


Click the Generate CSS button () at the bottom of the CSS Properties panel to generate the CSS code for the selected
               artwork.
            

You will see the CSS code for all the selected objects in the panel. If you were to
               copy the CSS code now, the images would not be created, only the code referring to
               them. To generate the images, you need to export the code, which you will do in the
               next section.

 Note: The styling you see may be different, and that's okay.
               



Choose Object > Group to group the objects together. Leave the group selected for
               the next section.
            
Notice that, in the CSS Properties panel, a single CSS style is now showing (.image).
               Grouping content tells Illustrator to create a single image (in this case) from the
               grouped content. Having a single web image would most likely be better if you intend
               on placing it on a web page.
            



Exporting CSS
You can also export part or all of the CSS code for your page design. Exporting CSS
         code has the distinct advantages of creating a CSS file (.css) and exporting PNG files
         for content that is considered unsupported. In this section, you will see both methods.
      



With the group still selected, click the Export Selected CSS button () at the bottom of the CSS Properties panel.
            


In the Export CSS dialog box, make sure that the filename is AssetExport. Navigate
               to the Lessons > Lesson15 > CSS_Export folder, and click Save to save a CSS file named
               AssetExport.css and a PNG image file.
            

 Tip: You can choose a resolution for rasterized artwork in the CSS Export Options dialog
                  box. By default, it uses the Document Raster Effects resolution (Effect > Document
                  Raster Effects Settings).
               



In the CSS Export Options dialog box, leave all settings at default, and click OK.

 Note: You can also export all of the CSS from your design by choosing Export All from the
                  CSS Properties panel menu. If you want to change the export options first, you can
                  set them by clicking the Export Options button () at the bottom of the CSS Properties dialog box.
               



Go to the Lessons > Lesson15 > CSS_Export folder on your hard drive. In that folder,
               you should now see the AssetExport.css file and an image named image.png.
            
As stated earlier, the CSS code that was generated assumes that you are going to apply
               the CSS styling to an object in your HTML editor and that the image will become a
               background image for the object. With the image generated, you can use it for other
               parts of your web page as well. Next, you'll export all the CSS from the design.
            


Back in Illustrator, choose File > Export > Export As. In the Export dialog box, set
               the Format option to CSS (css) (macOS) or the Save As Type option to CSS (*.CSS) (Windows).
               Change the filename to AssetExport_all, and make sure that you navigate to the Lessons > Lesson15 > CSS_Export folder. Click
               Export.
            


In the CSS Export Options dialog box, leave all the options at their default settings,
               and click OK. You most likely will see a dialog box telling you that images will be
               overwritten. Click OK.
            
Position and size properties are not added to the CSS code by default. In certain
               situations, you will need to export CSS with those options selected. The Include Vendor
               Pre-fixes option is selected by default. Vendor prefixes are a way for certain browser makers (each is listed in the dialog box) to add support
               for new CSS features. You can choose to exclude these prefixes by deselecting them.
            


Go to the Lessons > Lesson15 > CSS_Export folder, and you will see the new CSS file
               named AssetExport_all.css and a series of images created because the Rasterize Unsupported
               Art option was selected in the CSS Export Options dialog box.
            


 Note: Your file sorting and icons may look different in the CSS_Export folder, and that's
                  okay.
               



Return to Illustrator, and choose Select > Deselect.


Choose File > Close to close the file. Save the file if asked.

Review answers


Aligning content to the pixel grid is useful for providing a crisp appearance to the
                  edges of artwork. When Snap To Pixel is enabled for supported artwork, all the horizontal
                  and vertical segments in the object are aligned to the pixel grid.
               


The image file types that can be chosen in the Export For Screens dialog box and the
                  Asset Export panel are PNG, JPEG, SVG, and PDF.
               


In order to export assets using the Asset Export panel, the artwork to be exported
                  needs to be collected in the Asset Export panel. Once in the panel, you can select
                  the asset(s) to be exported, set the export settings, and then export.
               


If you are building a website or want to hand off content to a developer, you can
                  transform the visual designs you create in Illustrator to CSS styles using the CSS
                  Properties panel (Window > CSS Properties) or File > Export > Export As command. Cascading
                  Style Sheets is a specification of formatting rules, much like paragraph and character
                  styles in Illustrator, that control the appearance of content in a web page. Unlike
                  paragraph and character styles in Illustrator, CSS can control not only the look and
                  feel of text but also the formatting and positioning of page elements found in HTML.
               


Named content is content whose layer name in the Layers panel has been changed. When
                  content is unnamed in the Layers panel (the default layer name is used), a CSS style
                  is not created for the content by default. If you name the object in the Layers panel,
                  the CSS is generated, and the name of the style created matches the object name in
                  the Layers panel. To generate CSS styles for unnamed content, you need to enable this
                  in the CSS Export Options dialog box by clicking the Export Options button () in the CSS Properties panel.
