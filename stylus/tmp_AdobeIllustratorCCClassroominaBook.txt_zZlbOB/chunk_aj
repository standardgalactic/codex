In the package folder should be a folder called Links that contains all of the linked images. The GreenIsle Report (.txt file) contains information about the document contents.
5. Return to Illustrator, and choose File > Close.

Review questions
1. Describe the difference between linking and embedding in Illustrator.

2. What kinds of objects can be used as masks?
3. How do you create an opacity mask for a placed image?
4. What color modifications can you apply to a selected object using effects?
5. Describe how to replace a placed image with another image in a document.
6. Describe what packaging does.

Review answers
1. A linked file is a separate, external file connected to the Illustrator file by a link. A linked file does not add significantly to the size of the Illustrator file. The linked file must accompany the Illustrator file to preserve the link and to ensure that the placed file appears when you open the Illustrator file. An embedded file is included in the Illustrator file. The Illustrator file size reflects the addition of the embedded file. Because the embedded file is part of the Illustrator file, no link can be broken. You can update linked and embedded files using the Relink button () in the Links panel.

2. A mask can be a simple or compound path. You can use type as a mask. You can import opacity masks with placed Photoshop files. You can also create layer clipping masks with any shape that is the topmost object of a group or layer.
3. You create an opacity mask by placing the object to be used as a mask on top of the object to be masked. Then you select the mask and the objects to be masked, and either click the Make Mask button in the Transparency panel or choose Make Opacity Mask from the Transparency panel menu.
4. You can use effects to change the color mode (RGB, CMYK, or grayscale) or to adjust individual colors in a selected object. You can also saturate or desaturate colors or invert colors in a selected object. You can apply color modifications to placed images, as well as to artwork created in Illustrator.
5. To replace a placed image with a different image, select the image in the Links panel. Then click the Relink button () and locate and select the replacement image. Click Place.
6. Packaging is used to gather all of the necessary pieces for an Illustrator document. Packaging creates a copy of the Illustrator file, the linked images, and the necessary fonts (if desired), and gathers them all into a folder.







15. Preparing Content for the Web

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you'll learn how to do the following:
• Align content to the pixel grid.
• Work with the Slice and Slice Selection tools.
• Use the Save For Web command.
• Generate, export, and copy/paste CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) code.
• Save artwork as SVG.

This lesson takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.
Download the project files for this lesson from the Lesson & Update Files tab on your Account page at www.peachpit.com and store them on your computer in a convenient location, as described in the Getting Started section of this book.
Your Account page is also where you'll find any updates to the chapters or to the lesson files. Look on the Lesson & Update Files tab to access the most current content.



You can optimize your Illustrator CC content for use on the Web and in screen presentations using various methods. For example, you can slice artwork and save it for the Web, export CSS and image files, and generate SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) in the form of an .SVG file or SVG code.


Getting started
You'll be working in multiple art files during this lesson, but before you begin, restore the default preferences for Adobe Illustrator CC.


 Note
If you have not already downloaded the project files for this lesson to your computer from your Account page, make sure to do so now. See the "Getting Started" section at the beginning of this book.

1. To ensure that the tools and panels function exactly as described in this lesson, delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CC preferences file. See "Restoring default preferences" in the Getting Started section at the beginning of the book.
2. Double-click the Adobe Illustrator CC icon to start Adobe Illustrator.
3. Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials to ensure that the workspace is set to the default settings.
4. Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson15 folder. Select the L15_start.ai file and click Open.

 Note
If you don't see "Reset Essentials" in the Workspace menu, choose Window > Workspace > Essentials before choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.

This lesson contains a fictitious business name, address, and website address made up for the purposes of the project.
5. The Missing Fonts dialog box may appear. Click Sync Fonts to sync all of the missing fonts to your computer (your list may not match the figure). After they are synced and you see the message stating that there are no more missing fonts, click Close.

If you can't get the fonts to sync (a "Syncing Typekit fonts..." message doesn't go away), you can go to the Creative Cloud desktop application and choose Assets > Fonts to see what the issue may be (refer to the section "Changing font family and font style" in Lesson 7, "Adding type to a Poster," for more information on how to resolve it).
You can also just click Close in the Missing Fonts dialog box and ignore the missing fonts as you proceed. A third method is to click the Find Fonts button in the Missing Fonts dialog box and replace the fonts with a local font on your machine. You can also go to Help (Help > Illustrator Help) and search for "Find missing fonts."
6. Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
This fits the active artboard into the Document window so that you can see the entire artboard.

7. Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson15 folder and name the file WebDesign.ai. Leave the Format option set to Adobe Illustrator (ai) (Mac OS) or the Save As Type option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows), and then click Save. In the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the Illustrator options at their default settings, and then click OK.

Saving content for the Web
Using Illustrator CC, you can save your artwork for the Web using a variety of methods and formats. If you need Web images for use in a website or an onscreen presentation, you can use the File > Save For Web command. Images can be saved in several file formats, such as GIF, JPEG, and PNG. These three formats are optimized for use on the Web and are compatible with most browsers, yet each has different capabilities.


 Tip
To learn more about working with Web graphics, search for "File formats for exporting artwork" in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).

If you are building a website or wish to hand off content to a developer, you can transform the visual designs in Illustrator to CSS styles using the CSS Properties panel (Window > CSS Properties) or File > Export command. Illustrator allows you to easily export CSS or copy and paste CSS from Illustrator into your HTML editor. You can also export Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) using a variety of methods.
In the first part of the section on creating Web content, you will focus on the pixel grid and on slicing content for export using the Save For Web command. Then you will translate your design into CSS for use in a website.

Aligning content to the pixel grid
Before you save content for the Web, it's important to understand the pixel grid in Illustrator. It's critical that raster images look sharp, especially standard Web graphics at 72 pixels per inch (PPI) resolution. To enable Web designers to create pixel-accurate designs, you can align artwork to the pixel grid. The pixel grid is a grid of 72 squares per inch, vertically and horizontally, that is viewable when you zoom to 600% or higher with Pixel Preview mode enabled (View > Pixel Preview).


 Tip
To learn about working with text and anti-aliasing, see the PDF named "TextAntiAliasing.pdf" in the Lessons > Lesson_extras folder.

When the pixel-aligned property is enabled for an object, all the horizontal and vertical segments in the object get aligned to the pixel grid, which makes strokes appear especially crisp. When you create a new document, you can set the Align New Objects To Pixel Grid option at the document level by choosing Web from the Profile menu in the New Document dialog box. This makes all artwork (that can be aligned to the pixel grid) align to it automatically. You can also align content to the pixel grid after the content has been created, as you will do in this section.
1. Choose File > New. In the New Document dialog box, choose Web from the Profile menu. Click the triangle to the left of the Advanced content, toward the bottom of the dialog box.
In the Advanced settings, you can see that the Color Mode is RGB for all artwork you create, the Raster Effects are Screen (72 ppi), and Align New Objects To Pixel Grid is selected.

2. Click Cancel.
3. In the WebDesign.ai file, choose File > Document Color Mode and you will see that "RGB Color" is selected.
After you create a document, you can change the document color mode. This sets the default color mode for all new colors you create and the existing swatches. RGB is the correct color mode to use when creating content for the Web or for onscreen presentations.
4. Select the Zoom tool (), and drag a marquee around the Bella Casa logo in the upper-left corner of the artboard, to zoom in very closely.
5. Choose View > Pixel Preview to preview a rasterized version of the design.

6. Choose 600% from the View menu in the lower-left corner of the Document window (in the Status bar).
By zooming in to at least 600%, and with Pixel Preview turned on, you can see a pixel grid appear, as in the figure. The pixel grid divides the artboard into 1 pt. (1/72-inch) increments.


 Tip
You can turn off the pixel grid by choosing Illustrator > Preferences > Guides & Grid (Mac OS) or Edit > Preferences > Guides & Grid (Windows) and deselecting Show Pixel Grid (Above 600% Zoom).

7. Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
8. Select the Zoom tool (), and drag a marquee around the "Make Your Reservation Now" button at the bottom of the artboard to zoom in very closely. Click several times on the lower-left corner of the button until you see 800% in the View menu in the lower-left corner of the Document window.
For the next steps, you need to see the pixel grid (zoom level of 600% or greater) and the stroke of the button.

9. Select the Selection tool (), and click to select the gray button shape (the rounded rectangle).
10. Choose View > Hide Edges so you can see the edge of the button more easily. Notice how the left edge of the button looks a little "fuzzy."

11. Click the word "Transform" (or X, Y, W, or H) in the Control panel, and select Align To Pixel Grid at the bottom of the Transform panel.

Objects that are pixel-aligned, but do not have any straight vertical or horizontal segments, are not modified to align to the pixel grid. For example, because a rotated rectangle does not have straight vertical or horizontal segments, it is not nudged to produce crisp paths when the pixel-aligned property is set for it.
12. Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
13. Choose View > Show Edges.
14. Choose Select > Object > Not Aligned To Pixel Grid to select all artwork in the document that is eligible to be, but is not currently, aligned to the pixel grid.
15. Click the word "Transform" (or X, Y, W, or H) in the Control panel, and select Align To Pixel Grid. Leave the Transform panel showing.
16. Click the Transform panel menu icon ().
Notice that Align New Objects To Pixel Grid is selected. This option sets all new artwork to be aligned to the pixel grid automatically. If this document were created using a Print profile, it would not be selected, but you could turn it on here. Bringing non-aligned objects into documents with the Align New Objects To Pixel Grid option enabled does not automatically pixel-align those objects. To make such objects pixel-aligned, select the object and then select the Align To Pixel Grid option from the Transform panel. You cannot pixel-align objects such as rasters, raster effects, and text objects because such objects do not have real paths.
17. Press the Escape key to hide the Transform panel.
18. Choose Select > Deselect (if available), and then choose File > Save.

Slicing content
If you create artwork on an artboard and choose File > Save For Web, Illustrator creates a single image file the size of the artboard. One way around that would be to create multiple artboards for artwork, each containing a piece of the Web page, like a button, and save each artboard as a separate image file.


 Note
To learn more about creating slices, search for "Create slices" in Adobe Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).

You can also design your artwork on an artboard and slice the content. In Illustrator, you can create slices to define the boundaries of different Web elements in your artwork. For example, if you design an entire Web page on an artboard and you want to save a particular vector shape as a button for your website, that artwork can be optimized in GIF or PNG format, while the rest of the image is optimized as a JPEG file. You can isolate the button image by creating a slice. When you save the artwork as a Web page using the Save For Web command, you can choose to save each slice as an independent file with its own format and settings.
Next, you will create a new layer that will contain the slices, and then you will create slices for different parts of the artwork.
1. Click the Layers panel icon () to open the Layers panel. Click to select the Text layer. Option-click (Mac OS) or Alt-click (Windows) the Create New Layer button () at the bottom of the Layers panel. In the Layer Options dialog box that appears, change the name of the layer to Slices and click OK. Make sure that the new layer named Slices is selected and is at the top of the layer stack.

 Note
To learn more about creating layers, see the section "Creating layers" in Lesson 8, "Organizing Your Artwork with Layers."


 Note
The new layer you create may have a different layer color, and that's okay.

When you create slices, they are treated as objects and are listed in the Layers panel and can be selected, deleted, resized, and more. It helps to keep them on their own layer so that you can more easily manage them, but this isn't necessary.

2. Select the Zoom tool (), and drag a marquee around the Bella Casa logo in the upper-left corner of the artboard. The "Bella Casa" text in the logo has been converted to outlines (paths).
3. Select the Slice tool () in the Tools panel. Click and drag a slice around the circle, "Bella Casa" text shapes, and the "Luxury Venetian Holiday Rental" text, stopping the bottom of the slice below the bottom curve of the "e" in "Bella." See the figure for help. Don't worry about it fitting perfectly right now; you will edit it later.

When you create a slice, Illustrator divides the surrounding artwork into automatic slices to maintain the layout of the page. Auto slices account for the areas of your artwork that you did not define as a slice. Illustrator regenerates auto slices every time you add or edit your own slices. Also, notice the number (3, in our case) in the upper-left corner of the slice you created. Illustrator numbers slices from left to right and from top to bottom, beginning in the upper-left corner of the artwork.
Next, you will create a slice based on selected content.
4. Press the Spacebar and drag down in the Document window using the Hand tool (), until you can see the nav bar above the logo (at the top of the artboard).
5. Choose Select > Deselect.
6. Select the Selection tool (), and Shift-click the "CHECK AVAILABILITY" text and the button shape beneath it.
7. Select the Slices layer in the Layers panel to place the new slice on that layer.
8. Choose Object > Slice > Create From Selection.


 Tip
Use the Object > Slice > Make command when you want the slice dimensions to match the boundary of an element in your artwork. Using the Make command, if you move or modify the element, the slice area automatically adjusts to encompass the new artwork.

Illustrator can create slices based on guides you create or on content that you select in the Document window. When using the Create From Selection command, effects such as drop shadows will be included in the slice area.
9. Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.

Selecting and editing slices
Editing user created slices is necessary, for instance, when sliced content changes or when what is included in the slice needs to change.

1. If necessary, scroll down the artboard so that you can see the Bella Casa logo in the upper-left corner of the artboard again.
2. Select the Slice Selection tool () from the Slice tool group in the Tools panel by clicking and holding down on the Slice tool ().
3. Click in the center of the first slice you created over the Bella Casa logo. The selected slice is highlighted, and four corner bounding points appear.
The Slice Selection tool allows you to edit slices you've created using different methods. You can also select a user slice with the Selection () or Direct Selection () tools by clicking the stroke (edge) of the slice or from within the Layers panel.
4. Position the pointer over the lower-right corner of the selected slice. When a double arrow appears, click and drag toward the center of the logo until it fits tighter around the logo content. Make sure to include all of the logo content within the slice area.

When adjusting slices manually, you should contain all appearance attributes, like drop shadows, in the slice area. This can be difficult if the shadow is very blurry. Using the Object > Slice > Create From Selection command creates a slice that surrounds all appearance properties, like effects, if those effects are applied directly to the artwork and not to the layer the artwork is on (with multiple objects on the same layer). Using the Slice Selection tool, you can click and drag a slice, copy and paste it, delete it, and much more.
5. Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose View > Lock Slices so that you cannot select them.
6. Choose File > Save.

Using the Save For Web command
After slicing your artwork, if necessary, you can then optimize that artwork for use on the Web. You can use the File > Save For Web command to select optimization options and to preview optimized artwork. The key to the effective use of images on a website is finding the balance of resolution, size, and color to achieve optimal quality.

1. Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window, and then choose View > Hide Slices.
While working on your artwork, you don't have to have the slices showing. This allows you to concentrate on selecting artwork without selecting slices. You can also hide the layer that the slices are on if you created a layer for them in the Layers panel.
2. Select the Selection tool (), and Shift-click the orange bar behind the top navigation, the white semi-transparent rectangle behind the Bella Casa logo, and the large image behind the Bella Casa logo.

3. Choose Object > Hide > Selection.
When you save sliced content using the Save For Web command, all content that is showing in a slice will be flattened into a raster image. If you want to have transparency in the selected artwork (part of the image will be see-through), you need to first hide what you don't want to save. The areas where you see the artboard in a slice can be transparent, depending on the type of image you choose.
4. Choose Select > Deselect, if necessary.
5. Choose View > Show Slices, and ensure that the artwork and drop shadows are contained within the slices (you may want to zoom in). If not, you can resize either slice using the Slice Selection tool.

 Note
To resize the slices, you need to make sure that they are unlocked. Choose View > Lock Slices. (If a check mark appears to the left of the menu item, they are locked.)

6. Choose File > Save For Web.
7. In the Save For Web dialog box, click the 2-Up tab at the top of the dialog box to select that display option, if it's not already selected.
This shows a split window with the original artwork on the left and the optimized artwork on the right (usually). You can tell which is the original artwork because it shows "Original: 'WebDesign.ai'" along with a file size below one of the preview areas. The optimized preview shows a file type like "GIF" and a file size below the preview area.
8. With the Slice Select tool () selected (by default), click in the optimized area on the right. Click to select the slice that covers the Bella Casa logo at the top of the artboard, if it isn't selected already. A red arrow is pointing to it in the figure.
You can tell when a slice is selected because the artwork isn't dimmed and it has a light-brown border around it.
9. In the Preset area on the right side of the dialog box, choose PNG-24 from the Optimized File Format menu (below Name).

You can choose from four file formats, including GIF, JPEG, PNG-8, and PNG-24, as well as set the options for each in the Preset area. The available options change depending on the file format you select. If your image contains multiple slices that you are going to save, be sure to select each separately in the preview area and optimize all the slices.
10. Choose Selected Slices from the Export menu, if necessary.
Any slices that you select in the Save For Web dialog box will be exported. You can select multiple slices, after you've assigned optimization settings to them, by Shift-clicking the desired slices. By choosing All User Slices from the Export menu, all slices that you created will be exported.
11. Click the Preview button in the lower-left corner of the dialog box to launch the default Web browser on your computer and to preview the sliced content. After previewing the content, close the browser and return to Illustrator.


 Note
If nothing happens after clicking the Preview button, try clicking again. You may also need to click the Select Browser Menu button () to the right of the Preview button and choose Edit List to add a new browser.

12. In the Save For Web dialog box, click Save. In the Save Optimized As dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson15 folder and open it. Change the name to Logo, and click Save.
In your Lesson15 folder is a new images folder that Illustrator created. In that folder, you can see the single image that is labeled according to the name entered in the Save Optimized As dialog box, with the slice number appended to the end.
13. Choose View > Hide Slices.
14. Choose Object > Show All.
15. Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.

Creating CSS code
As was mentioned earlier, you can transform the visual designs in Illustrator to CSS styles using the CSS Properties panel (Window > CSS Properties) or the File > Export command. This is a great way to move the styling from your Web design in Illustrator straight to your HTML editor or to hand it off to a Web developer.


 Note
Exporting or copying CSS from Illustrator CC does not create HTML for a Web page. It is intended to create CSS that is applied to HTML you create elsewhere, such as in Adobe Dreamweaver®.

Cascading Style Sheets are a collection of formatting rules, much like paragraph and character styles in Illustrator, that control the appearance of content in a Web page. Unlike paragraph and character styles in Illustrator, CSS can control the look and feel of text, as well as the formatting and positioning of page elements found in HTML.


An example of CSS code.


 Note
To learn more about CSS, visit the "Understanding Cascading Style Sheets" section of Adobe Dreamweaver Help (http://helpx.adobe.com/dreamweaver/using/cascading-style-sheets.html). You can also check out the CSS video series on Adobe Dreamweaver Developer Center: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/understanding_css_basics.html.

The great thing about generating CSS from your Illustrator artwork is that it allows for flexible Web workflows. You can export all of the styling from a document, or you can just copy the styling code for a single object or a series of objects and paste it into an external Web editor, like Adobe Dreamweaver. But creating CSS styling and using it effectively requires a bit of setup in your Illustrator CC document, and that's what you'll learn about first.

Setting up your design for generating CSS
If you intend to export or copy and paste CSS from Illustrator CC, slicing is not a necessary part of that process, but setting up the Illustrator CC file properly before creating CSS allows you to name the CSS styles that are generated. In this next section, you'll look at the CSS Properties panel and see how you can set up the content for style export using named or unnamed content.

1. Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
2. Choose Window > CSS Properties to open the CSS Properties panel.

 Note
The CSS Properties panel shown here is an example and will not reflect exactly what you see in your panel.

Using the CSS Properties panel, you can do the following:
• Preview CSS code for selected objects.
• Copy CSS code for selected objects.
• Export generated styling for selected objects to a CSS file (along with any images used).
• Change options for the CSS code exported.
• Export the CSS for all objects to a CSS file.

3. With the Selection tool () selected, click to select the orange rectangle behind the navigation at the top of the artboard (see the figure).

Take a look in the CSS Properties panel, and you will see that a message appears in the preview area. Instead of CSS code (which is what the preview area typically shows), the message states that the object needs to be named in the Layers panel or you need to allow Illustrator to create styling from "unnamed objects."
4. Open the Layers panel and click the Locate Object button () at the bottom of the panel, to easily find the selected object in the panel. Double-click directly on the name of the selected <Path> object, and change the name to navbar (lowercase). Press Enter or Return to make the change.


 Note
You may need to drag the left edge of the Layers panel to the left to see the entire name of the object.


 Note
If you see a style named ".navbar_1_" it's usually because there is an extra space after the name "navbar" in the Layers panel.

5. Look in the CSS Properties panel again, and you should see a style named .navbar.

 Note
You may wish to drag the bottom edge of the CSS Properties panel down like we did, to see the entire style.

When content is unnamed in the Layers panel, a CSS style is not created for it, by default. If you name the object in the Layers panel, the CSS is generated and the name of the style created matches the object name in the Layers panel. Illustrator creates styles called classes for most content.


 Tip
You can tell a style is a class in CSS because the name has a period (.) before it.


 Tip
If you are using HTML5 markup in your HTML editor, any objects in the Layers panel that you name according to the standard HTML5 markup tags, like "header," "footer," "section," or "aside," for instance, will not become a class style when the CSS code is generated. Rather, the style will be named according to the HTML5 markup tag.

For objects in the design (not including text objects, as you will see), the name you give them in the Layers panel should match the class name in the HTML that is created in a separate HTML editor, like Dreamweaver. But, you can also forgo naming the objects in the Layers panel and simply create generic styles that you can then export or paste into an HTML editor and name there. You will see how to do that next.
6. With the Selection tool, click to select the transparent white rectangle behind the Bella Casa logo. In the CSS Properties panel, a style will not appear since the object is unnamed in the Layers panel (it just has the generic <Path> name).

7. Click the Export Options button () at the bottom of the CSS Properties panel.
The CSS Export Options dialog box that appears contains export options that you can set, such as which units to use, which properties to include in the styles, and other options, like which Vendor pre-fixes to include.
8. Select Generate CSS For Unnamed Objects, and click OK.

9. Look in the CSS Properties panel again. With the white rectangle still selected, a style called .st0 appears in the preview area of the CSS Properties panel.
.st0 is short for "style 0" and is a generic name for the formatting that is generated. Every object that you don't name in the Layers panel will now be named .st1, .st2, and so on, after turning on Generate CSS For Unnamed Objects. This type of style naming can be useful if, for instance, you are creating the Web page yourself and you are going to paste or export the CSS from Illustrator and name it in your HTML editor, or if you simply needed some of the CSS formatting for a style you already have in your HTML editor.

10. Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.

Working with character styles and CSS code
Illustrator will create CSS styles based on text formatting, as well. Formatting, such as font family, font size, leading (called line-height in CSS), color, kerning and tracking (collectively called letter-spacing in CSS), and more, can be captured in the CSS code. Any character styles that are applied to text in your design are listed in the CSS Properties panel as a CSS style and have the same name as the character style. Text that has formatting applied, without a character style applied, will have a generic CSS style name when Illustrator generates the style.

Next, you will create and then apply a character style to text.

 Note
Currently, paragraph styles are not taken into account when naming styles in the CSS code that is generated.

1. In the CSS Properties panel, notice the style named [Normal Character Style], toward the top of the panel.
In the CSS Properties panel, only character styles that are applied to text appear. The Normal Character Style is applied to text by default, so it appears in the panel. If you create character styles but don't apply them to text, they will not appear in the CSS Properties panel.
2. Choose Window > Type > Character Styles to open the Character Styles panel.
3. Select the Type tool () in the Tools panel. Select the heading text "Welcome to Venice." You may want to zoom in on it.
4. Option-click (Mac OS) or Alt-click (Windows) the Create New Style button at the bottom of the Character Styles panel. In the Character Style Options dialog box, change the Style Name to Head1. Click OK.
5. Option-click (Mac OS) or Alt-click (Windows) the Head1 style in the Character Styles panel to apply it to the selected text. The text should now have the Head1 style applied.

In the CSS Properties panel, the character style named Head1 should appear in the list. This indicates that it is applied to text in the design.

6. Select the Selection tool (), and with the "Welcome to Venice" text object still selected, you will see CSS code in the preview area of the CSS Properties panel.

Selecting a text object will show all of the generated CSS code for the styling used in the entire text area. With just the text selected, the CSS is not shown in the CSS Properties panel.
You can also use the character styles listed in the CSS Properties panel as a way to apply the styles to text, which is what you'll do next.
7. Select the Type tool and scroll down to the artboard so you can see the "About Bella Casa" text toward the bottom. Select the black text "About Bella Casa."
8. Click the Head1 style name in the CSS Properties list to apply the formatting to the selected text.
This applies the Head1 character style, but it may not apply all of the formatting. If you look in the Character Styles panel, you may see a plus sign (+) next to the Head1 style name, indicating local formatting that is overriding the Head1 style formatting.

9. If necessary, click once more on the Head1 style name in the CSS Properties panel to remove the local formatting. The text should now look like the "Welcome to Venice" text.

 Note
The text may no longer fit in the type object. You may need to resize it to fit the text.


 Note
Selecting a type area gives you the ability to see all of the CSS code generated from the styling. It is also a great way to be able to copy or export all of the text formatting from a selected type area.

10. Select the Selection tool, and make sure that the type object that contains the "About Bella Casa" heading is selected. Look in the CSS Properties panel, and you will see a series of CSS styles listed. These are the styles applied to all of the text in the type area.

Working with graphic styles and CSS code
CSS code can also be copied or exported for any graphic styles that are applied to content. Next, you'll apply a graphic style and see the CSS code for it.

1. Scroll back up the artboard so that you can see the Bella Casa logo toward the top of the artboard. With the Selection tool (), click to select the transparent white rectangle behind the logo.

 Note
The unnamed style in the CSS Properties panel (.st0) is being generated because you selected Generate CSS For Unnamed Objects in the CSS Export options earlier.

2. Open the Graphic Styles panel (Window > Graphic Styles). Option-click (Mac OS) or Alt-click (Windows) the New Graphic Style button () at the bottom of the panel. In the Graphic Style Options dialog box, change the Style Name to Cover box and click OK. The graphic style should be applied automatically to the white rectangle.

 Tip
Like selecting a character style in the CSS Properties panel to apply the formatting, you can also select content and select an Object style listed in the CSS Properties panel to apply it.

Looking in the CSS Properties panel, you will see the object style named "Cover box" listed, because it is applied to content in your document. You will also see CSS code for a style named .st0. The CSS code is the same as for the "Cover box" graphic style you just saw, since that graphic style is applied. But it's not naming the style with the "Cover box" name, since the graphic style is just a way to apply formatting and the CSS code is being generated for that particular object. Remember, this is an unnamed style, because we didn't rename the white rectangle object in the Layers panel.

3. Leave the white rectangle selected, and then choose File > Save.

Copying CSS
At times, you may only need to capture a bit of CSS code from part of your design to paste into your HTML editor or to send to a Web developer. Illustrator lets you copy and paste CSS code easily. Next, you will copy the CSS for a few objects and learn about how grouping can change the way CSS code is generated.

1. With the white rectangle still selected, click the Copy Selected Style button () at the bottom of the CSS Properties panel. This copies the CSS code currently showing in the panel.

 Note
You may see a yield sign icon () at the bottom of the panel when certain content is selected. It indicates that not all of the Illustrator appearance attributes (like the multiple strokes applied to the shape) can be written in the CSS code for the selected content.

Next, you will select multiple objects and copy the generated CSS code at the same time.

2. With the Selection tool () selected and the white rectangle still selected, Shift-click the text "CHECK AVAILABILITY" at the top of the artboard to select both objects.

In the CSS Properties panel, you will not see any CSS code since you need to have Illustrator generate the code for more than one selected object.
3. Click the Generate CSS button () at the bottom of the panel.

 Tip
When CSS code appears in the CSS Properties panel for selected content, you can also select a part of the code and right-click the selected code, and then choose Copy to copy just that selection.

The code for two CSS styles, .st0 and .NormalCharacterStyle, now appears in the bottom half of the CSS Properties panel. To see both styles, you may need to scroll down in the panel. Yours may be in a different order, and that's okay.
With both styles showing in the CSS Properties panel, you could copy the styles and paste them into your HTML editor code or paste them into an email to send to a Web developer, for instance.

4. With the Selection tool, click to select the orange circle shape in the Bella Casa logo.
In the CSS Properties panel, you will see CSS code for a style named .image. That code contains a background-image property. When Illustrator encounters artwork (or raster images) that it can't make CSS code from, it rasterizes the exported content (not the artwork on the artboard) when you export the CSS code. The CSS code that is generated can be applied to an HTML object, like a div, and the PNG image will be applied as a background image in the HTML object.

5. Scroll down the artboard until you see the circle and flourishes below the "Welcome to Venice" heading and text. Click to select a flourish to the right or left of the circle. Those will also be exported as separate PNG images.
6. Choose Select > Deselect.
7. Drag a marquee selection across the two flourishes and the circle to select them all. Click the Generate CSS button () at the bottom of the CSS Properties panel to generate the CSS code for the selected artwork.

You will see the CSS code for three separate styles in the panel. If you were to copy the CSS code now, the images would not be created, only the code referring to them. In order to generate the images, you need to export the code, which you will do in the next section.
8. Choose Object > Group to group the three objects together. Leave the group selected for the next section.
Notice that, in the CSS Properties panel, a single CSS style is now showing (.image). Grouping content tells Illustrator to create a single image (in this case) from the grouped content. Having a single Web image would most likely be better if you intend on placing it on a Web page.

Exporting CSS
You can also export part or all of the CSS code for your page design. Exporting CSS code has the distinct advantages of creating a CSS file (.css) and exporting PNG files for content that is considered unsupported. In this section, you will see both methods.

1. With the group still selected, click the Export Selected CSS button () at the bottom of the CSS Properties panel.

2. In the Export CSS dialog box, make sure that the file name is WebDesign. Navigate to the Lessons > Lesson15 > ForCSSExport folder, and click Save to save a CSS file named WebDesign.css and a PNG image file.
3. In the CSS Export Options dialog box, leave all settings at default and click OK.
4. Go to the Lessons > Lesson15 > ForCSSExport folder on your hard drive. In that folder, you should now see the WebDesign.css file and an image named image.png.

 Tip
You can choose a resolution for rasterized artwork in the CSS Export Options dialog box. By default, it uses the Document Raster Effects resolution (Effect > Document Raster Effects Settings).

As stated earlier, the CSS code that was generated assumes that you are going to apply the CSS styling to an object in your HTML editor and that the image will become a background image for the object. With the image generated, you can use it for other parts of your Web page as well. Next, you will export all of the CSS from the design, after setting a few CSS options.
5. Back in Illustrator, choose File > Export. In the Export dialog box, set the Format option to CSS (css) (Mac OS) or Save As Type option to CSS (*.CSS) (Windows). Change the file name to WebDesign_all, and make sure that you navigate to the Lessons > Lesson15 > ForCSSExport folder. Click Export.

 Note
You can also export all of the CSS from your design by choosing Export All from the CSS Properties panel. If you want to change the export options first, you can set them by clicking the Export Options button () at the bottom of the CSS Properties dialog box.

6. In the CSS Export Options dialog box, leave all of the options at their default settings and click OK. You most likely will see a dialog box telling you that images will be overwritten. Click OK.
Position and size properties are not added to the CSS code by default. In certain situations, you will need to export CSS with those options selected. The Include Vendor Pre-fixes options are selected by default. Vendor pre-fixes are a way for certain browser makers (each is listed in the dialog box) to add support for new CSS features. You can choose to exclude these prefixes by deselecting them.
7. Go to the Lessons > Lesson15 > ForCSSExport folder, and you will see the new CSS file named WebDesign_all.css and a series of images created because the Rasterize Unsupported Art option was selected in the CSS Export Options dialog box.


 Note
Your file sorting and icons may look different in the ForCSSExport folder, and that's okay.

8. Return to Illustrator, choose File > Save (if necessary) and choose File > Close to close the document.

Saving artwork as SVG
SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) are used to define vector-based graphics for the Web that won't lose quality if they are zoomed or resized, such as a logo. They are a vector format that describes images as shapes, paths, text, and filter effects. The resulting files are compact and provide high-quality graphics on the Web, in print, and even on resource-constrained, handheld devices. Most major modern Web browsers—like Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer 9+, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari—have at least some support for viewing SVG.

Illustrator allows you to select vector artwork, choose Edit > Copy, and then simply paste the SVG code that it generates into HTML in an HTML editor, or you can export as an SVG (.svg) file. In this section, you'll export as SVG (.svg) and explore the SVG export options.
1. Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
2. Choose File > Open. In the Open dialog box, navigate to the Lessons > Lesson15 folder. Select the Logo_SVG.ai file and click Open.
3. Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.

When saving artwork as SVG, the artboard size is important. Notice that the artboard is cropped very closely to the edges of the logo. The artboard size will determine the dimensions of the SVG file just like it would in PNG or JPG.
4. Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, choose SVG (svg) from the Format menu (Mac OS) or SVG (*.SVG) from the Save As Type menu (Windows). Navigate to the Lessons > Lesson15 folder (if necessary).

Notice the option "Use Artboards." By default, the first artboard (at the top of the Artboards panel) will determine the dimensions of the SVG file. Artwork on other artboards will not appear in the SVG file. If you wanted to save a series of icons, for instance, as SVG, you could create artboards for each and select Use Artboards to create a series of SVG files—one for each artboard.
5. Leave the Use Artboards option deselected and click Save.
6. In the SVG Options dialog box, click More Options. There are a lot of options for creating the SVG, but the default settings work well most of the time. The Responsive option, which is selected by default, allows the SVG file to be resizable using CSS.

7. Click the world icon at the bottom of the dialog box to launch your default browser and view the SVG file.

 Tip
If you wanted to see the actual SVG code that is created, you could click the SVG Code button in the SVG Options dialog box to open the SVG content in an editor.

8. Close the browser and return to Illustrator. Click OK in the SVG Options dialog box. If you were to look in the Lessons > Lesson15 folder, you should see Logo_SVG.svg.

Notice that the document open in Illustrator is now Logo_SVG.svg. SVG files created by Illustrator using the default options can be opened later in Illustrator for editing.
9. Choose File > Close to close the logo file.

Copy and paste from Illustrator
You can also select and copy artwork in Illustrator, then paste it into your favorite text editor (like Adobe Edge Code) and SVG code will be generated and pasted. Instead of generating an SVG file, the code is pasted inline. This can be useful if you want to edit the code yourself, or even manipulate the contents with CSS or JavaScript.



SVG and fonts
When it comes to fonts in artwork saved as SVG, you need to be careful. Not all browsers (including Firefox and Internet Explorer) fully support all fonts used in your SVG file. It's best to use a Web-safe font or convert the fonts to outlines. Since converting fonts to outlines can increase file size greatly, best practice is to outline fonts only when you have a few words in the artwork, for instance. If you feel comfortable working with the generated SVG code and CSS, you can also create a reference to a hosted font, for instance, but that is beyond the scope of this section.
When you save as SVG (File > Save As), in the SVG Options dialog box, there are two options for fonts: Type and Subsetting.

For the Type option, you can choose Adobe CEF, SVG, or Convert To Outline. Adobe CEF uses font hinting for better rendering of small fonts. This font type is supported by the Adobe SVG Viewer but may not be supported by other SVG viewers. SVG is the default option and is the format defined by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). The SVG option offers maximum support by SVG viewers, but the text may not be as refined as if you chose Adobe CEF. The third option, Convert To Outline, can be useful if you want to convert your text content into SVG paths and ensure that the text looks like it did in Illustrator. This can be used, for instance, for an icon with a few characters in a word like "Home." If you use more complex fonts, like script fonts, the file size of your SVG file can increase greatly if you choose Convert To Outline. Converting fonts to outline in SVG can also make the SVG file less accessible.
The Subsetting option is useful if you include a reference to fonts in your SVG file (by choosing SVG or Adobe CEF from the Type menu). Subsetting controls which glyphs (characters of a particular font) are embedded in the exported SVG file.
Note: For more information on SVG options, search for "Save in SVG format" in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).


Review questions
1. Why do we align content to the pixel grid?

2. Name the three image file types that can be chosen in the Save For Web dialog box.
3. Describe the difference between named and unnamed content, when it comes to generating CSS.
4. What is SVG, and why is it useful?

Review answers
1. Aligning content to the pixel grid is useful for providing a crisp appearance to the edges of artwork. When Align To Pixel Grid is enabled for artwork, all of the horizontal and vertical segments in the object are aligned to the pixel grid.

2. The three image file types that can be chosen in the Save For Web dialog box are: JPEG, GIF, and PNG. PNG has two versions: PNG-8 and PNG-24.
3. Named content is content whose layer name in the Layers panel has been changed. When content is unnamed in the Layers panel (the default layer name is used), a CSS style is not created for the content, by default. If you name the object in the Layers panel, the CSS is generated and the name of the style created matches the object name in the Layers panel. In order to generate CSS styles for unnamed content, you need to enable this in the CSS Export Options dialog box by clicking the Export Options button () in the CSS Properties panel.
4. SVG, or Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), is a file format that is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web that won't lose quality if they are zoomed or resized, such as a logo. The resulting files are compact and provide high-quality graphics on the Web, in print, and even on resource-constrained, handheld devices.
