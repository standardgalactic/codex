Part 1: Understanding Focus 







Chapter 1: The Focus Mythback to topFocus. Many people hear this word today and think of monks in faraway monasteries or ultra-marathoners that run for days on end. Maybe we all want more focus in our lives, but that's for other people without jobs, families, and rush-hour traffic. We laugh and add it to the bottom of the list, below spending the night in a bubble bath or curling up with a book. Being able to focus feels more elusive than winning the lottery. Believe it or not, this is what the world wants you to believe. The longer we spend distracted by our favorite television shows, the more commercials we see and the more companies benefit. This digital world is designed to tell us that focus is unattainable and that we have no other choice but to split our time between productivity and distraction. Despite knowing what needs to be completed by the end of each day, we feel pulled in every direction. Even when we finally work up the motivation to sit down and start our taxes, we turn on the computer and see an alert about a friend's birthday. One click on a shopping site to buy a present leads to an insatiable urge to buy a new soap dish. Hours pass, the deadline approaches, and the allure of social media gets stronger. We make friends with a large pot of coffee and spend the evening in a tug-of-war between the given task and everything else the world has to offer. Who knew there were so many videos of cats falling into bathtubs? But what if I tell you that it is all a myth? Focus is there in every moment, just waiting for you to use it. No matter the stream of distractions flowing through your day, you have complete control over your time and how you spend it. Focus is still focus and it hasn't changed since the first day that the caveman sat down to build a fire. The only difference today is that we need to be savvy about trapping focus and not letting it stray. This book is for those who want to gain control of their productivity by discovering the elements that make up their unique focus formulas. Using simple techniques designed to maximize time and attention, it will become clear that modest changes can produce large results. We will examine everything from the construction of your to-do list to the strategic integration of activities you enjoy into your schedule. We will learn how to properly link your long-term goals to your short-term goals so as to increase motivation and how to properly shape your view of the present moment to get you through your most daunting and dreadful tasks. With this book, you will learn how to shape your focus formula so that it is easily implemented into your daily life and most challenging tasks. This is your journey and the world around you is your guide. How to Use This BookThis book is designed to equip you with the tools necessary to craft a lifestyle in which you feel in control of your own focus and productivity. Through the development of a focus formula, you will learn what that lifestyle looks like for you. Whether you are a business owner with twenty years of expertise looking to revamp your strategies, or you are a student looking to survive your final exams, these techniques will help you discern how to optimize the focus in your life by paying attention to your natural interests, dislikes, and productivity tendencies. Focus is unique to every individual, and so too will be your journey through this book. Some may find it useful to read from the first page to the last, and others may want to jump around. Some may want to complete the exercises on their computers, while others may want to use a journal to allow for further reflection. Regardless of your preferences, I would suggest transcribing the exercises into a separate computer document or notebook so that you can add to them as needed. The more thorough you are with the exercises, the more insight you will gain regarding your focus needs. This book is designed for you and, as such, needs to meet your needs. Feel free to adapt and manipulate these techniques and exercises as you see fit. This is your focus formula and the effectiveness of it will be reflected by the thought and work you put into developing it. Even in this distracting world, there is no excuse for being unfocused and unproductive. You are in the driver's seat of your own life and, with these techniques, you will become better equipped to steer in the direction of your choosing. Remember that you are in control. There's nothing stopping you from making today the most focused and productive day you have ever had. Focus is not a miracle, but the results are nothing short of miraculous. So, read on and let's get started.  







Chapter 2: Defining Focusback to topOpen the dictionary and you will find a definition of focus. Write it on a big piece of paper, tape it to the wall in front of your desk, and call it a day, right? Not so fast. Assuming that one definition will serve a wide array of needs is like assuming that one road will lead to Los Angeles, New York City, and Philadelphia. While focus may be a universal goal, the way it manifests itself in daily life looks different from person to person and situation to situation. Imagine that a songwriter and a university professor had to share an office cubicle for a day. After debates of who gets to sit closer to the air conditioning, both pull out their materials and get to work. It isn't long before the songwriter is distracted by the piles of papers that are crowding his space, and the professor is holding his fingers in his ears so as not to hear the same lyrics repeated over and over again at every possible speed and tone. The day ends and the only thing that either has accomplished is getting a headache. The problem isn't that songwriters and professors have an innate hatred for each other. Despite their differences, I'm sure the two would find each other fascinating at a dinner party. Instead, it's likely that the two have very different definitions of focus. While focus to a songwriter might entail listening to a piece of work on repeat, a professor might want pure silence. While the songwriter might only want his computer and guitar, the professor finds it useful to make notes on pieces of scrap paper with a big red pen. Similar to the way we all have different preferences, dreams, and goals, we all have different needs when it comes to enlisting the mental wherewithal to complete a task. It may seem obvious that a songwriter and a professor may run into conflicts when working in the same space. However, this problem is just as prevalent among individuals with the same goal and even with the same task. Do you remember your college days when you thought that studying with your best friend for your exams was a good idea? Although you two may have been unstoppable on the basketball court or at a party, I bet your grades suffered. In order to begin the process of building your focus formula, we need to start at square one and decide what focus means. This definition will be unique to you and will likely change depending on the task and environment. Maybe classic rock puts you in the perfect mood to finish that final bicep curl at the gym, while country is what gets you through a difficult run on the trail. Don't get attached to one idea of focus; be prepared for it to change as your goals and needs change. There's no doubt that you already have some idea of when and why you are focused in certain situations. This book does not run on the presumption that you are a blank slate with no experience of your own focus potential. The goal is to take your current knowledge, expand it, and make it work even better for you. To get us started, I want you to write down your definition of focus as it relates to a diversity of tasks. This can either be what it means to you or what contributes to it. Although only two slots are provided, feel free to add as many tasks and definitions as needed. We will revisit these definitions at the end of the book to see how they have changed.    Task:  _______________________________________   Definition of Focus:  _______________________________________   ________________________________________   ________________________________________   (Repeat for each task)Why We Need FocusThis may seem obvious. Without focus, we would all have to-do lists longer than our driveways and never get around to changing our socks. Despite all of the distractions the world has to offer through social media, technology, and the great outdoors, we all have enough focus to get through our daily lives without falling into open manholes. In short, we have enough focus to do what is expected and get to the next birthday with a few accomplishments in the bucket. Herein lies the issue. Our focus is just good enough to blind us from what we could be accomplishing if it was at its best. Maybe we stayed up all night in a crazed daze finishing that report, but the fact that we eventually finished it is all that we care about. Rarely do we stop and consider what else we could have accomplished that night if we hadn't had to battle so many distractions and had spent more time focused on the task at hand. Focus is what separates the good from the great. It's clear that staying up all night to finish a report is good, but finishing the report and spending the rest of the evening with the family or getting a jumpstart on the next day's work is great. We hear stories every day about entrepreneurs that have started businesses in their garages in a matter of weeks. What seems like years of work can be expedited when the time spent on music videos, e-mails, and online shopping is put to better use. To put it more simply, your ability to focus directly translates into your ability to accomplish your goals. Every minute you spend on something extraneous is a minute you're not spending working on something meaningful to you. The NumbersWhen the topic of focus comes up at dinner parties, someone always brings up the issue of time. If only we had enough hours in the day to complete everything that needs to be done. If only the television would stop turning on magically. If only someone could create a machine to freeze time. It is true that it would be a lucky stroke of magic for someone to invent a way to grant us all unlimited amounts of time. I don't believe, though, that this would help our ability to focus. In fact, as we will discuss later, having more time may actually be a focus killer. Regardless, we are all under the impression that we have too little time in our days and this is why we are falling short on our to-do lists. If we really do believe this so passionately, let's indulge in the idea and take a look at the numbers. Let's see if we have been correct all along and a lack of time really is to blame for our inability to focus.There are 7 days in a week, which works out to 168 hours. Let's say that you work a typical 40 hours a week. This leaves you with 128 hours to do with as you please. Assuming you haven't found the magical spell that makes sleeping unnecessary, let's be generous and hope that you are sleeping at least 7 hours a night. Forty-nine hours of sleep factored into your week leaves you with 79 hours to commute, cook dinner, pick your kids up from school, clean the house, or do something fun for a change. Seventy-nine hours. If the rumor is true that running a household and having a family is like a full-time job and a half, let's take out 60 hours to account for that responsibility. You still have 19 hours left in your week unaccounted for. Now, I know that unexpected time wasters pop up every day. The car breaks down, the kids come down with the flu, or your boss asks you to finish a project after hours. Life happens and it often doesn't fit into the schedule. However, no matter how the universe conspires against you, 19 hours a week is a lot of time. A 2012 article in The Atlantic1 found that the more hours people work a week, the more likely they are to exaggerate the number of hours they spent working. This is not to say that we are intentionally lying, but that our perceptions of how we spend our time are often inaccurate. This can be especially true if we are doing things we don't enjoy. Haven't you ever felt that the twenty minutes you spent in the dentist's chair felt longer than the two hours you spent watching your favorite movie? Without monitoring, our beliefs about how we spend our time can be influenced by our emotions associated with the task. If we step back and realize that our staff meeting felt like five hours, but was only two hours in reality, we can stop blaming our lack of time on our jobs and realize that we wasted more than an hour researching kale recipes. No matter your job, if a two-hour staff meeting regularly feels like five hours, and you spend more time at your desk making playlists for your next road trip than completing tasks, it may be time for a life change. By misinterpreting how much time we spend on tasks, we run the risk of prematurely fatiguing our focus. Your brain is trained to use time as an indicator of the effort it will need to exert to complete a task. The thought process behind running for twenty minutes is much different than the thought process behind running for two hours. By priming it to expect more than is required, you are likely to drain your focus simply by thinking about the task at hand. I would spend more time fretting over running for two hours than for twenty minutes and would probably feel exhausted before even putting my shoes on. You'll be surprised to see that the simple trick of accurately calculating how much time you spend completing tasks can improve focus by limiting mental fatigue that is brought on by false perceptions.Use the chart below (or a sheet of notebook paper) to record the amount of time you spend interacting with various aspects of your life. Be as detailed as possible and record the amount of time you spend completing specific tasks. For example, instead of writing that you work from nine to five, write what you typically do during that time. Maybe you usually have a meeting from ten to eleven, a lunch break from eleven to twelve, a conference call from twelve to one, and so on and so on. The more detailed you are, the easier it will be to replace the perceptions of how you spend your time with the reality. This will give you a foundation to work from as we move forward with the focus strategies.

Part 2: Strategies 







Chapter 3: Remembering the "Why"back to top"Because I said so," is a phrase that is used all too often when explaining the necessity of a task. Even if you haven't heard that phrase since you were five, think about all of the times it is implied in daily activities. We organize files in a certain fashion because that is the way it has always been done, we recite certain prayers at church because everyone has done so for years, and we make Grandma's coffeecake with that one cake pan because it wouldn't be the same otherwise. While this may seem unrelated to focus and speak solely to our evolution as creatures of habit, failing to understand the reasons behind our actions has negative implications for our productivity. Habits are usually boring. While we may be grateful that we've trained ourselves to brush our teeth every day, it's nothing to get too excited about. The focus we exhibit in those moments is not the same focus that will get us through writing a long expense report. While one demonstrates our robot-like tendencies, the other requires more inspiration. We need to want to write that expense report as badly as we want to jump into the warm blue ocean shown on that travel show about Hawaii. We need a reason why. Desire is the best friend of focus. The more we want something, the harder we are willing to work for it. Recall the classic movie scene of the man running through the airport, dodging security guards, and scaling terminal walls in order to reach the girl he loves before her flight leaves. If you asked him why he was making a fool of himself in the airport, I doubt he would hesitate for even a second before telling you. "Why" is the strongest and most powerful tool in our focus toolkits. We need to understand the motivations behind our actions and how they relate to our goals. There's no questioning why the Hawaiian ocean is so appealing and, in order to finish that expense report, your conviction needs to be just as strong. ClarifyingIt is easy to lose focus on a task when the "why" of it is unclear. Although counterintuitive, this most often happens when we are working on tasks related to our biggest and most prized goals. While we may want nothing more than to run a marathon, on that first day of training, when even two miles is more than we can handle, the "why" is all that keeps us tying up our shoes each day. The clarity of our "why" directly translates into the amount of focus we put into a task. I'm going to illuminate this point by introducing you to Neil, a friend that will follow us throughout the remainder of the book. Neil is an assistant to a respected CEO at the company of his dreams. As a lower-level employee, Neil often finds himself tasked with assignments that are not inherently meaningful to him, but are essential if he wants to move up the professional ladder, succeed in his job, and achieve his larger goals. One of these goals is becoming a CEO of a large company himself one day. This goal, though far off, can be used to increase Neil's focus on tasks he needs to complete today if he can clarify the "why" behind wanting to become a CEO in the first place.Goals that are a number of years down the road can become abstract and fairy-tale like. Becoming a CEO is so far from Neil's current reality, he doesn't understand what such a life would consist of. He imagines a fancy car, an expensive suit, and a luxury coffeemaker waiting for him every morning as he wakes up in his European silk sheets. He sees himself enjoying business trips to exotic locations, building a strong team around him, and passing on his wisdom to the next generation of leaders. It is possible that this is what Neil's life will look like. With his dreams and drive, there's no doubt that he will find himself in the corner office someday. The problem is that such long-term visions of future goals can become hackneyed if left in the abstract world of fantasy and will be of no service when the going gets tough. Let's say that Neil has a bad day at work and is questioning his desire to continue down the path of CEO. In this moment, envisioning himself in a fine suit and driving an expensive car becomes more of a caricature and a mockery than a motivation. This vision of himself seems so far from his current reality that it demoralizes him further as opposed to reinvigorating him. Instead of focusing on his work for the day, he finds that his assignments seem unimportant and the current basketball scores pull his attention. Basketball is here and now, while CEO is a distant dream. Neil has mistaken the side effects of achieving his goal for the "why" of pursuing it. Although he may enjoy first-class airline tickets once he is bumped to CEO status, this is merely a side effect of his success. It's similar to receiving a free air freshener when you purchase a new car. The air freshener is a nice perk but not why you bought the car in the first place. Similarly, Neil's luxurious lifestyle will be a nice side effect of his promotion to CEO, but not the reason why he is pursuing the goal in the first place. By mistakenly focusing on side effects instead of "whys," we lose track of our motivations. Our goals become based upon material desires as opposed to values and lose their appeal as a result. Although the pursuit of money can seem endlessly motivating, it won't get you through those tough days in the same way that values and beliefs will. If you don't believe me, think about the last time you splurged on a friend's birthday, went to that concert you'd been dreaming of, or maxed out a credit card to buy an airline ticket to visit family at the holidays. Commitment to living a good life always wins over having a full bank account. When it comes down to it, we choose values over money and material possessions 99 percent of the time. This is why goals that are focused on side effects will not be as motivating as goals that have clear "whys" that connect to personal values. This is not to say that you need to forget about the fancy cars and exotic vacations. Side effects have their place, but it is important to differentiate them from motivations. Doing so will allow you to entertain the fantasies of a life of success, while not confusing that fantasy with your reasons for pursing the goal. Use the chart below to help you differentiate between your motivations for pursing a goal and the side effects that will result from achieving it. For Neil, one of his motivations for becoming CEO is to become a mentor to young business executives as they begin their journeys, while a side effect might be a new sports car.     Goal:  _______________________________________________   Motivation:  _______________________________________________   Side Effects:  _______________________________________________   Although we examined clarifying your "why" as it relates to refocusing on larger goals, the same strategy can be applied to smaller goals as well. Let's say that Neil has clarity on his goal to become a CEO, but he struggles to stay focused on his goal to cook dinner for himself on a consistent basis. Every day it is the same story. Neil returns from a long day at work, opens his empty refrigerator, and finds the take-out menu more appealing than slaving over the stove. This goal seems small in comparison to the one of becoming a CEO, but the same principles apply. Neil needs to home in on his motivations for wanting to cook dinner for himself in the first place and the side effects of doing so. If he struggles to do this, connecting this smaller goal to a larger goal can have the same refocusing effects. Let's say that Neil associates cooking dinner for himself every night to his professional success. Perhaps the side effects of saving money on food that will come from cooking every day will better allow him to spend money on his professional wardrobe and connect to his motivations of becoming a professional authority figure as a CEO. By linking his smaller goal to his larger goal, he not only clarifies his focus but also creates a web of goals. The more you are able to intertwine your goals, the easier it will be to keep track of your motivations and maintain focus.RedefiningThere are times when a lack of focus is not due to the fact that the "why" of a goal needs to be clarified, but that it needs a complete overhaul. There are many reasons for doing something in life and discovering the right reason is key to maintaining focus and motivation on achieving your goal. For example, you can take out the trash because the can is full or to please your spouse. Both of these are valid reasons for taking out the trash, but pleasing your spouse may be more important to you than having an empty trashcan. As such, redefining your "why" of taking out the trash to pleasing your spouse as opposed to the necessity of emptying the can will make more sense to your overall goals of supporting your family, which will benefit your abilities to focus on the task. In his current assistant position, Neil is expected to write a report each month highlighting the company's progress and the changes that have happened since the month prior. This is an assignment that Neil dreads and struggles to complete. He doesn't view himself as a writer and finds it difficult to sit down to a blank computer screen when tasked with something as dull as a monthly report. Every month he gets swept up in the latest basketball game, falls into the trap of answering unimportant e-mails, wastes hours on social media, and ends up staying up all night writing a report that would have only taken three hours if he could have stayed focused. As Neil dreads report writing, he hasn't thought about the "why" of it beyond the fact that it is in his job description and his boss expects it of him every month. The "why" of writing his report is as important to him as the "why" of changing the filter in his vacuum, which he doesn't do with regularity. It is boring, tedious, and a waste of time. Neil needs to redefine the "why" of his report writing so that it carries more weight and relates to his goals.When facing a task that you are struggling to focus on, redefine it so that it is driven by your personal goals. Neil sees the importance of report writing for his professional development, but connects the "why" more so to his boss than to himself. The report is something his boss requires, sets the expectations for, and ultimately benefits from. When redefining the "why" of his reports, Neil focuses on himself instead of his boss. He tells himself that the act of writing will improve the communication skills he will need as he moves up the ladder. Analyzing the company's monthly progress will alert him to the factors that contribute to a successful company. And the development of a portfolio of written reports will serve as valuable evidence of his competence as he asks for a promotion. By redefining his report writing with a more personal focus, Neil is able to connect it to his goals and finds it easier to focus as a result. Instead of falling prey to distractions, when Neil sits down to write, he is aware of how his reports will directly impact his ability to become a CEO someday. No longer is he serving only the needs of his boss, but he is also serving his own needs. When you are struggling to stay focused on a task, consider whether you need to redefine your reasons for pursuing it. Use the chart below to redefine the "whys" of goals you have been struggling to focus on. Be sure that you make your "whys" personal and specific so as to best increase your focus on difficult tasks.     Task:___________________________________________  Previous "Why":_________________________________________  Redefined "Why":________________________________________  CraftingUnfortunately, life isn't always full of meaningful and exciting tasks. There are times when, no matter how you redefine your "why," a task still seems dreadful and not worth your time. This is how I feel every time my chemical bathroom cleaner starts giving me the stink eye, and I turn my back to watch more television. These are the tasks for which focus is so elusive that stalling to complete them takes on a life of its own. Eventually, my green sink will start to detour friends, scare away household pets, and leave me brushing my teeth outside on the curb, but plunging through the grime seems impossible. In moments like these, it's time to get creative. In those moments when your focus is so far gone that you can't even bring yourself to get started on a task, choose a goal and tell yourself a story about how the task is vital to your success in that goal. Your goal and your task need not even be inherently related. For example, if I struggle to clean my bathroom on a weekly basis, I can tell myself a story of how completing this task will benefit my goal of writing this book. If I have a clean bathroom, I will spend less time complaining about the mess, spring out of bed more quickly, take less time getting ready, and be at my computer in much less time. Be patient as you use this technique. It seems illogical that cleaning my bathroom will impact my completion of this book, but the more times I tell myself it is so, the more I will come to believe it. Stories are powerful and the stories we tell ourselves have the potential to shape our behaviors. Neil, for example, will begin to believe that cooking dinner for himself is crucial to his success as a CEO if he tells himself that the meditative act of chopping vegetables puts him in the calm mindset necessary for focusing on his reports and other administrative tasks. Soon, cooking dinner for himself will be inextricably linked to his professional success.This technique may sound crazy, but think about how deeply we believe in miracles and fairy tales. Even our most logical selves hold onto small threads of hope that the wizards we read about in our favorite fantasy novels actually exist in some far-off land. Your ability to focus on a task is dependent upon how strongly connected you feel to the story you tell yourself about it. Think about how focused you were during your driving test as a teenager. The story you told yourself about freedom, independence, and maturity was so powerful that your focus was nothing short of perfect as you made those left turns.        When struggling to focus on a task due to its lack of meaning and importance to you, tell yourself a story about why that task is essential to your success in one of your most coveted goals. As absurd as the story may sound, tell yourself on a daily basis that it is true. Before long, you will find yourself believing it and your ability to focus on your task will skyrocket. Use the chart below to link your tasks to a goal and to tell yourself a story about why they are dependent upon each other.      Task → Goal: _________________________________________    Story:  _________________________________________________  _________________________________________________  _________________________________________________  Yours vs. TheirsThere is no arguing that long-term commitments can be less enjoyable than short-term ones. This is why we are so drawn to instant gratification. This is also why, when presented with a less than desirable task, we are quick to dismiss it. Neil, for example, knows that the path to CEO will be painful. It would be much more pleasurable in the short-term to ignore his report, stay in his current position, disregard his efforts for promotion, and watch sports all night. This is a problem that can often be rectified by clarifying, redefining, and crafting the "whys" behind your goals and tasks. If, however, you have moved through all three steps and still cannot regain focus on your tasks, it's possible that your goals are not your own. There's a big difference between goals you want for yourself and those that have been imposed upon you by family, friends, and society. Sometimes they are one and the same, but be on the lookout for those that aren't. Maybe your family of teachers raised you to believe that such a career was the only path to fulfillment, or society's obsession with yoga convinced you that perfect health could only be achieved after successfully mastering a headstand. Whether large or small, silly or serious, goals that are not your own will serve as distracters when trying to focus on tasks. If becoming a CEO is a goal that was imposed on him by his father, Neil will not only struggle to focus on his monthly report but will likely abandon it altogether. If the task is personally meaningless, and the goal it is attached to is personally meaningless as well, focus stands little chance of winning the battle. Sometimes it is not so easy to distinguish between your goals and those imposed on you by others. Neil, for example, may have heard his father talk about the merits of professional leadership from such an early age that he began to assume it was what he wanted for himself. The key to differentiating between your personally imposed goals and those imposed by others is identifying the "why" of each. If your "why" comes to you quickly, it is likely yours. In addition, if your "why" is related to you, it is likely yours. Now, this may sound obvious, but goals that are imposed by others often have an externally focused "why" or a "why" that sounds generic. For example, if you grew up in a family of teachers, but you don't want to be a teacher yourself, your "why" for becoming a teacher may be, "Teachers make a difference in the lives of children," as opposed to, "I want to share my love for science and inspire the next generation of inventors." The latter is much more likely to inspire your focus on studying for your teaching credential exams than the former. If your "whys" are generic and unrelated to you, it is time to either refine your goals or ditch them for new ones. Use the chart below to identify the "whys" of your goals. Feel free to write both short- and long-term goals, as even short-term goals can fall into the trap of societal expectations. After you are done, review the list and mark goals that sound generic or don't relate to you. Reevaluate your motivation for pursuing those goals and consider adjusting them to reflect your true desires.    Your Goals:_______________________________________  Their Goals:_______________________________________  Sometimes a long-term goal is simply too far in the future to make sense in your current situation. Even if a goal is realistic and personally driven, if it is too far down the line, it is hard to make it relatable to the present moment. If this is the case for Neil, he may need to break down his goal of becoming a CEO into many smaller goals before his reports seem useful and relevant to him. It isn't that his goal of becoming a CEO is externally imposed, but becoming a CEO is so far in the future that monthly reports seem trivial. Neil needs a goal in which his monthly reports are an obvious and direct stepping-stone to success, such as receiving a promotion within his current company. It's similar to throwing a rock into a puddle as opposed to a lake. Which do you think is going to make the bigger splash?If your long-term goals are too large and you are finding yourself constantly losing motivation moving forward, first ensure that they are personally driven. If they are, break them down until you have a list of short-term goals that are more relevant to your current situation. Doing so will ensure that your "whys" relate to who you are today and not a distant vision of yourself. MantrasRegaining focus on a task can often be as simple as giving yourself a quick pep talk and reminder about why you're doing the task in the first place. Tell yourself to keep moving, to keep writing, to stop complaining, to just keep going. Especially while working on those long tasks that have a faraway finish line, it is easy to get distracted because we've lost sight of the "why." All we need is a reminder and, more often than not, we are the best people to do it. Sometimes we are better at whipping ourselves into shape than any boss, parent, friend, or coworker could be. We don't need a deep conversation probing our intentions, desires, dreams, and souls. We need a quick kick in the pants to help us move on. In those moments when your focus starts to wane, be prepared with a short mantra to provide that little spark of motivation and remind you of your "why." Keep it short and specific. For example, Neil might simply recite "CEO" when he feels his focus on his report waning. As a runner, I tell myself to "settle in" as a reminder to calm my body and accept the pain. You may recite the name of someone you hope to make proud, a line from a song that pushes you harder, or a quote from a person you respect. Experiment with what works best for you and increases your focus on tasks when it starts to slip. Use the space below to brainstorm mantras that are meaningful to you. Remember that, while you may have mantras that are inspiring on a consistent basis, you will likely have to adapt and create new mantras to suit the needs of a given task.

Chapter 4: Visualizationback to topVisualizations may seem like a panacea promising to solve everything from weight loss to low self-esteem. Success, power, love, friendship, wealth, happiness, peace, and sanity all magically come about after a good dose of visualizations. So, why am I going to add yet another round of them to your plate? Because they work. It's no mistake that experts from nutrition to business are trying to harness the enormous potential of visualization techniques. As I'm not concerned with your waistline or the valuation of your start-up, let's start by explaining why visualization will help you in this specific goal of increasing your focus.When you visualize your future self, you are not simply devising a fictional character. While you may not care that your favorite movie character misses the application deadline for that new job, I bet you feel differently when it's your turn. This is why we can entertain ourselves for hours with imagined stories of far-off adventures but feel sick when it's time to board the plane ourselves. Imagination is about writing yourself a story that you can either put on a mental bookshelf or erase. Visualization takes it a step further and convinces you that it's a story worth living. Visualization works for the same reason that positive reinforcement often works better than punishment. Did you ever make your parents proud as a child and try even harder the next time to win that same praise? The promise of reward is often more enticing than the fear of consequences and you are more likely to stick to a goal if you are aware of the reward you will reap from accomplishing it than the penalty you will suffer from falling short. While we will discuss the value of disappointment in the next chapter, right now we are concerned with the power of anticipating reward. Once you become comfortable visualizing the outcome of your goals, distractions lose their power and seem like a senseless detour from the life you're planning to build for yourself. Visualization can produce similar feelings of pride, success, love, relief, and accomplishment as having actually done the task. Although fantasy, your visualizations are deeply connected to you because, well, they are you. The stronger the emotions linked to your visualizations of your future self, the more motivated you will feel to have the situation turn out as you intend and the easier it will be to ward off distractions. Let's take a look at our friend Neil to get a better idea of how this works. It's nearing the end of the month and Neil needs to submit his regular thirty-day report to his boss. Despite Neil's good intentions, every month he finds himself staring at his computer the night before the deadline with a large cup of coffee and a feeling of dread building in his stomach. Neil stays up all night writing the report and spends the next day barely able to string together coherent sentences. Now, it's obvious that this scenario doesn't have to turn out this way month after month. Neil knows his report deadline and can easily predict how many hours it will take him to complete. He has a good understanding of what his boss expects, how the report needs to be written, and what the final product should look like. Neil has everything he needs to succeed, yet every month he waits too long to begin and suffers the consequences the next day. So why can't Neil change his behavior? Neil needs to see, feel, and experience the alternative.Let's say that instead of waiting until the night before the deadline, Neil sits down at his desk a week prior and visualizes himself turning his report into his boss. He sees himself rested and happy. He has had a full eight hours of sleep, eaten a homemade breakfast of eggs and bacon, and has even had time to iron his shirt and put on his favorite tie. When he gets to the office, he talks with a coworker about the day's current events, responds to the e-mails waiting in his queue, and makes lunch plans with his wife. When his boss comes by his office, Neil makes a joke about the company holiday party and hands over the report neatly organized in its blue presentation folder.Neil visualizes this positive scenario so vividly that he can feel the sense of accomplishment and pride that it would create within him. It is so tangible that he feels a sense of obligation to ensure that it happens. As Neil moves forward throughout his week, he reminds himself of these positive feelings and uses them as motivation to begin his report early. Whenever he is tempted to watch his favorite show or get lost in a website, Neil conjures up that feeling of accomplishment and tells himself that nothing would feel as good as having his vision become reality. The Bigger PictureWhile it may seem implausible that Neil's procrastinating ways can be changed through simple visualization exercises, you will be surprised by how motivating it is to view yourself as you wish to be. There is a catch, though. Although Neil spent time clarifying, redefining, and crafting his "why" of becoming CEO, the bigger picture of his life as a CEO is not the food for his visualizations. While there is nothing wrong with fantasies that work to validate the "whys" of your larger goals, visualizations that are not directly related to the task at hand can be paralyzing. There are a lot of things that need to happen before Neil's dream of becoming a CEO can be realized. If he sits down to write his report with the intention of visualizing himself as a CEO, he will be flooded with positive emotions, yet not have any clear picture of what his next step should be. Should he write his report or work on his resume? Should he reach out to his network or review the agenda for the meeting he is running tomorrow? Should he buy the blue suit or the black one? Suddenly Neil is consumed by everything and anything he will need to do in his many-year journey to CEO, as opposed to focusing on his current report.Becoming a CEO represents Neil's bigger picture, while his current concern is the smaller picture of writing his report. By visualizing the bigger picture, Neil gets distracted by everything he could be doing and fails to gain clarity on what he should be doing. Despite being an important component of his career progression, report writing suddenly seems insignificant in comparison to the responsibilities he will have down the line. Who cares about monthly reports after visualizing leading two hundred-person teams and occupying the corner office? Neil is newly inspired to become a CEO, but his focus on his report is shot. Goals and the "whys" behind them are designed to give an overarching meaning and storyline to life, while visualizations are intended to inform current behavior. Be sure that your visualizations are focused on the task at hand and the bigger picture. There's more than enough time in a day to fantasize about your larger goals. Remember those nineteen hours a week left unaccounted for? When you need to gain focus on a task, keep your visualizations as specific as possible. Your visualizations should translate into direct action, something that won't happen if they expand too far beyond the present moment. Taking ActionAs we discussed, it is important that your visualizations are task specific and translate into direct action. While Neil may use visualization to inspire his report writing today, this technique can be effectively used for any task less than a year in the future. Be strict about this year deadline. Anything more than a year away has the potential to seem too distant and won't translate into relevant action. It's the difference between imagining next year's Thanksgiving feast while you're still at this year's celebration and imagining an ingredient list for pumpkin pie as the end of October approaches. Which do you think is going to cause you to get into the car and go grocery shopping? Appropriate visualization should naturally point toward a course of action. If you visualize your goal and have no idea what to do next, you need to think smaller and more short term. Neil's visualizations relating to becoming a CEO don't tell him what to do in the present moment. I bet he will be just as tempted to waste time on social media as he was five minutes ago. On the other hand, visualizations relating to finishing his report on time will lead him to a very discernible course of action—begin working on the report.Use the chart below to record how your visualizations will translate into action. Not only will this serve as a reminder of how you should be spending your time when tempted by distractions, it will help you ensure that your visualizations are related to the current task and not the bigger picture. If you write something down and cannot think of the action it translates to, it's likely you need to think smaller and shorter term.     Visualization  →  Action  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  _______________  Connecting to the Bigger PictureAt this point, Neil has set himself up to have no other option but to focus on his report. While the basketball game may be tempting, Neil has built a strong defense against distractions. Let's see what he's built to prepare himself:1) a vision of himself healthy, happy, and well rested with a finished report in his hands2) feelings of pride, accomplishment, and joy at having met his goal3) knowledge of the actions he needs to take to write his report4) an understanding of his "why" of becoming a CEO that can only be realized if he fulfills his first goal of finishing his report on time Wait, wait. Didn't I just say that goals shouldn't extend beyond a year? Yes, your visualizations should not extend beyond a year, but it's natural for your short-term goals to add up to a larger goal and eventually the bigger picture and your "whys." It would be strange if Neil's desire to write successful monthly reports led to nothing but an eternity of writing monthly reports. Although visualizations should focus on the task at hand, it can be beneficial to remember how the task at hand links to your long-term goals. The way to do this without getting swept up in your fantasies of the bigger picture is to draw a clear map from today to your long-term goal. Break your goal up into small dreams that will each take less than a year to complete. Here's an example of Neil's potential list:• Consistently complete monthly report twenty-four hours before it is due• Achieve promotion into leadership position within eight months• Assume responsibility of annual financial reports nine months following the previous goal• Become chief advisor on budget decisions one year following the previous goal• So on and so on until our friend Neil is a big shot CEOGo ahead and try it for yourself. Choose one of your larger goals and follow it backward until you have a list on which your first goal is less than one year away from where you are today. As you cross goals off your list, make sure that the one at the top always meets the criteria listed below:1) takes less than a year to complete2) elicits strong emotions of pride and accomplishment3) points toward a course of actionIf the goal at the top doesn't meet these criteria, you either need to create a new goal before it or decide whether the goal is still relevant. Let your path toward your goal be fluid and reflect your current desires. If Neil decides ten years down the line that there is a more efficient route to a CEO position and that his goals need to be adjusted, he should adjust his proposed plan. As long as the goal at the top of his list still meets the criteria, Neil can play with the roadmap of his future goals as much as he likes. The hope is that this will serve as a framework pointing toward actionable steps and not as a permanent document mandating the future.    Goals     Time for Completion  __________________________     ___________________________  __________________________     ___________________________  __________________________     ___________________________  __________________________     ___________________________  __________________________     ___________________________  __________________________     ___________________________  __________________________     ___________________________   







Chapter 5: Disappointmentback to topEveryone knows the old saying that it feels better to have someone be angry with you than disappointed. It seems that we would rather be yelled at, shamed, ridiculed, and thrown in a Dumpster than be told we are disappointing. And it's true. There are few things more gut-wrenching than disappointment. While you may want to stay clear of this feeling, I need you to trust me as we dive headfirst into it. Believe it or not, disappointment, and learning how to feel it, can help a great deal in remaining focused on a task. Let's go back to the idea of visualization for a minute. Pick a task you need to complete and instead of visualizing it going as planned, let it go completely wrong. Instead of making the decisions that will make you feel proud of yourself, visualize yourself doing the opposite. Neil, for example, will imagine himself squandering away his time the night before his report is due. He will see himself spending hours on social media, getting swept up in his favorite television show and showing up to work with his hair uncombed. He imagines himself turning over a half-written report to his boss and stammering when asked why it wasn't completed in time. Neil lets himself feel the disappointment that such a scenario would cause. Instead of the feelings of accomplishment and ease that his successful visualization produced, he now feels a pit in his stomach related to his failure. I want you to feel this failure as tangibly as Neil does. Take the first short-term goal on your list from the previous chapter and visualize yourself making poor decisions about it until you have worked up a feeling you won't soon forget. The danger in visualizing disappointment is that you will feel the emotion so tangibly that you throw the entire goal out the window. This is why you need to complete your positive visualizations first and keep them at the front of your mind as you do your disappointment visualizations. Your job is to act as the clean-up crew, taking every mess as it comes and immediately making it safe to walk on. The way you do this is by linking an event that triggers a negative emotion to one that triggers a positive emotion and putting an action item between them. Here is what that would look like for Neil:1) Negative Emotion Event: holding a half-written report → Action Item: turning off the TV an hour earlier the night before → Positive Emotion Event: handing over a complete report 2) Negative Emotion Event: explaining his tardiness to his boss → Action Item: turning his phone on silent so as not to hear the notifications → Positive Emotion Event: cracking jokes about the holiday party with his boss the next dayWhat this exercise does is link two opposite emotions to one course of action, letting you see that small decisions can have big impacts on how you feel at the conclusion of a goal. While it may seem ridiculous that turning off the TV early can make the difference between disappointment and pride, I bet everyone can recount more than one story about how a five-minute distraction grew to take over an entire night. It really is the small things that make all the difference. Use the chart below to give it a try for yourself.     Negative Emotion Event:___________________________________→  Action Item:__________________________________→ Positive Action Event:____________________________________  Now you have two feelings associated with this action item, one that makes you feel good and one that doesn't. The positive visualization should feel so good and the negative visualization should feel so bad that your desire to move toward the positive one is inevitable and seems like the only logical option. If this isn't the case, you need to continue to develop your visualizations until they are tangible enough to elicit this response. Once you feel comfortable with visualization, practice switching between the positive and the negative at a moment's notice and then moving on. There is no benefit to this exercise if completing it causes more distraction than the distraction you were trying to avoid in the first place. Neil won't make very much progress on his report if he is spending all of his time visualizing the positive and negative outcomes of his actions and never getting down to the business of writing. While it may take practice at first, you should be tempted by social media and, in a split second, be able to feel the disappointment of failing to finish your assignment or the pride in completing it on time, and then be able to get back to work. Feel the feelings deeply, but move on quickly. This is not the time to get lost in your fantasy future dreamworld. This is a motivational tool that serves to move you forward with the next step. Once you've done your visualizations and set a foundation, only use them to get you to your goal.  







Chapter 6: Joyback to topThere's no denying the joy of taking that first bite of cake or singing along to the radio. A lot of life is about the moment-to-moment happiness of doing what we enjoy. Productivity and joy rarely go hand in hand, as we often associate joy with throwing out the schedules and getting lost in the moment. Some of the best stories are those of making a wrong turn on a family vacation or of quitting a job in the middle of the week to fulfill a dream of being a writer. There are times we need impulsivity and the rush that we can only get by taking advantage of what the world has to offer right here and now. On the other hand, if Neil quit his job tomorrow, he wouldn't get very far in his goal of becoming a CEO. There needs to be a balance. Although we often think in terms of extremes, there's no reason why we need to either live a life of carefully planned anticipation or a life of impulsive reckless abandon. The former forbids any present enjoyment in exchange for future success, while the latter disregards goal setting in exchange for a constant pursuit of pleasure. If you ask me, I would rather not hang out with people in either of these camps. Navigating the murky middle where both happiness and success lie is the key to finding the balance needed to stay focused on your tasks, pursue your goals, and maintain your sanity while doing it. So, what does this look like in real life? Let's use Neil and his report writing as an example. As you know, Neil struggles to finish his monthly reports on time. Every month it is the same old story of staying up too late and stumbling into work with a half-finished product straight off the printer. No matter how hard Neil tries, he finds himself in this same predicament. And why? Neil doesn't enjoy it. Any of it. Now, you might be thinking that Neil needs to find a new job that he cares about. And maybe you're right. But, I bet you can tell me a long list of things you dread doing even though they are associated with something you love. Maybe it's doing the dishes after a family meal, organizing the house before guests come over, or getting those travel plans nailed down. Even those that have found their dream jobs still need to focus on writing reports, taking out the trash, and pulling the weeds. Use the chart below to write down some daily, monthly, or yearly tasks that you don't enjoy doing. We are going to call them "dreadful tasks." Maybe you're like Neil and push these tasks aside until the last minute, or maybe you complete them on time but grumble as you do it. Remember that these tasks can be related to things you love. For example, you love your kids but you don't love washing and folding their clothes. Whatever you write down is not a reflection of your feelings about the bigger picture, but instead a barometer of how you feel in the moment while completing the tasks. Make a List of the Following: • Daily dreadful tasks• Monthly dreadful tasks• Yearly dreadful tasksNow that we've ruined your good mood by thinking too much about the unpleasant parts of life, let's turn that around and make this more fun. Here's your chance to write down everything you enjoy on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. These are common tasks and not exotic trips to India or the purchase of a fancy car. Maybe you enjoy listening to a favorite podcast, drinking a certain kind of tea, driving the scenic route to work, or celebrating the Fourth of July with family each year. Take a moment to write some of these things down. Remember that no moment of joy is too small to make note of.Make a List of the Following: • Daily joys• Monthly joys• Yearly joysIf I asked Neil to complete this exercise, he may stop and say that some of the things on his joy lists are the very things that distract him from his goals in the first place. They're fun and distracting, which is exactly why they're on the list. Well, Neil, that's perfectly all right. In fact, we are looking for the moments when what you dislike doing intersects with what you enjoy, even if that manifests itself as distraction. The hope is that we can change the dynamic so that the joys serve to enhance focus as opposed to distracting from it.Timing The Pomodoro Technique is a method that increases mental focus by dividing tasks into twenty-five-minute increments separated by five-minute breaks. Let's say that Neil is serious about getting his report done on time, but is tempted by the latest sports scores. He sets a timer for 25 minutes and tells himself that he will be rewarded with 5 minutes of sports when the timer goes off. If Neil gets distracted from his report writing at any point during that twenty-five minutes, he will need to reset the timer and start the twenty-five minutes over again. I bet Neil will have no trouble focusing with that as an incentive. The magic of twenty-five minutes is that it is long enough to produce substantial progress, yet short enough to inspire hope that reward is always just around the corner. That being said, twenty-five minutes is not a hard and fast number. If the timer goes off and you are feeling good and want to continue, by all means do so. Sometimes all you need is to find your flow and an unpleasant task doesn't seem too bad after all. I wouldn't suggest less than twenty-five minutes, though, as your ratio of work to break decreases to the point of negatively impacting your productivity. Give it a try. Set a timer for twenty-five minutes and tell yourself that you will work on a task until the timer goes off, no excuses. Do so with five minute breaks between until you are finished with the task. Realize that some tasks may merit more or less than twenty-five minutes and experiment with different intervals to find what works for different situations. For example, if you're writing an article, twenty-five minutes may fall right in the middle of your best creative moments and forty-five minutes would serve you better. If you find that a timer is jolting and often interrupts your focus at the wrong moments, it may be better to determine your breaks based upon natural pausing points in your task as opposed to an arbitrary time limit. Maybe you take a five-minute break after writing each chapter or after answering a certain number of e-mails. Such a strategy may allow you to streamline your day more than a timer would. Experiment with both and decide which works better for given tasks. Light at the End of the TunnelThere are times when I am so allured by the promise of watching my favorite show or going out for a walk that I ignore the timer and power through what I'm working on so that I can simply be done with it and enjoy the remainder of my evening stress-free. I remember those college days when I would watch my friends stay up all night finishing assignments that I had finished a few days prior. What was probably interpreted as a strange obsession with Shakespeare was actually my desire to have Monday night free to watch The Bachelor. When faced with something unpleasant, there's nothing more motivating than the promise of being done with it. We never understood it as children, but our mothers were right when they said that the sooner we cleaned our rooms, the sooner we could go outside and play. It applied then and it still applies now. The longer we spend doing activities we don't enjoy, the less time we will have for those that we do. When faced with a dreadful task, use the principles of visualization discussed earlier to visualize yourself one hour, two hours, three hours down the line. Feel what it would be like to be done and to have the rest of your day to do with as you please. Pick a pleasant task from your list and visualize yourself engaging in it. You are light, free, and relieved of the burden of your dreadful task. The only way you can have this dream become reality is to take action, so get busy. ProcrastinationI have a feeling that most of us didn't write procrastination on our lists of joyful tasks. However, I bet we spend quite a lot of time doing it. It's not that nothing gets accomplished while procrastinating. I have found some great dinner recipes while putting off cleaning my apartment. The problem with procrastination is that not only does it distract us from what we intend to be doing, it deadens the enjoyment of the distraction. For example, Neil often watches his favorite show when he should be writing his monthly reports. But instead of engrossing himself in the fictional world of his show and enjoying every last battle scene, his mind is yelling at him about how he really should be working. He feels a pit in his stomach as the minutes tick by and he feels a pang of guilt when he decides to watch just one more episode. Does this sound like fun?Let's look at the other possible scenario. Neil knows that he has to write his report, but he also wants to watch his favorite show. He visualizes himself being done with his report and how good it would feel to watch his show without the burden of the task weighing him down. With the visualization clear in his mind and the feeling of accomplishment tangible in his gut, he sets his timer for twenty-five-minute intervals and finishes the task before the evening is over. As such, he decides to turn off his computer, grab a bowl of popcorn, and settle in to watch his favorite show guilt-free. He laughs at the jokes, gets lost in the plot, and goes back for seconds on popcorn. There's nothing nagging at his mind and he doesn't even think about work. Not only is Neil less stressed, he is proud of what he has accomplished and feels as though he has put forth his best effort. Neil completed his report and watched his favorite television show in both scenarios. In fact, they may have even taken the same amount of time. Even though the events of the scenarios are relatively the same, there is a stark difference between the two. During the second scenario, Neil was able to visualize the joy he would feel after finishing his report and stave off procrastination as a result. He enjoyed the show a great deal more and felt a stronger sense of accomplishment at the end of the evening.Don't use the things you enjoy as excuses to procrastinate. Even though it might seem nice in the moment to distract yourself from a task, the enjoyment is watered down. Convince yourself through visualization that you will be happier once the task is completed and you can indulge in your enjoyment guilt-free. Every time you are pulled toward social media, remind yourself that you will reward yourself with time on social media when your assignment is done and that it will be ten times more enjoyable without the burden of your task nagging at you. With practice, resisting the urge to procrastinate won't even be necessary, as visualizing the benefits of not doing so will become second nature. MultitaskingEveryone today says that we all multitask too much. I would agree and hope that my surgeon isn't checking his e-mail while I'm on the table. However, there's nothing wrong with making unpleasant tasks more enjoyable. In fact, multitasking may increase your efficiency and allow you to stay focused for longer without being tempted by procrastination. As you are less likely to ruminate on the pain of doing your taxes if you're also rocking out to your favorite song, you decrease your risk of getting sidetracked. Even if the occasional air-guitar solo interrupts you, you will be more focused on your taxes overall than if your boredom had left you prey to the pull of your Twitter account. Not only will you increase your focus, you will increase your enjoyment as well, which is a productivity win-win. Multitasking is not only helpful during the completion of a dreadful task, but also as you work up the motivation to begin one. There are many days when I don't want to put on my shoes and step out into the cold for my daily run. No matter how good I feel after, starting my morning with pain is never more enticing than my pillow. But as I reach over to turn off my alarm clock, I remind myself that my phone is cued up with my favorite podcasts. Suddenly my daily run isn't an exercise in torture, but the one opportunity in my day to listen to my favorite shows. I have actually found myself turning around at my front door to run more miles so that I could finish episodes. There's nothing magical about listening to podcasts while running. My legs are no more capable or more powerful than they would be in silence. The reason why the technique works is because my love of podcasts surpasses my dread of running. Focusing on something other than the pain, I find that I can push myself beyond my expectations and actually enjoy doing so. They are the perfect pair. In her book, Better Than Before, Gretchen Rubin talks about pairing unpleasant tasks with those that are more enjoyable as a strategy to encourage habit formation. As she notes, it is more likely that I will put on my running shoes day after day if I know that my favorite podcast is waiting for me. That small enticement will serve me better in sticking to my daily habit of running than sheer willpower and determination. When it comes to focus, this strategy serves a similar purpose. It's often the case that focus is impaired by boredom or pain, mental or physical. If Neil is working on his report and hating every minute of it, he is likely to get caught up in the basketball game. On the other hand, if Neil had been listening to his favorite album while working on his report, his overall enjoyment would have been higher and his focus stronger as a result. Do you ever wonder why it can be so hard to read three pages of a textbook, but you can read three hundred pages of your favorite novel in one night? Reading the novel is a lot more enjoyable and, as a result, a lot easier to focus on. When you are doing something you enjoy, you don't even need to think about your focus. It happens naturally. Many productivity experts call this "flow" and describe it as the mindset that causes the sensation of time passing without notice due to a natural hyperfocus on an enjoyable task. Someone in flow rarely stops to analyze how focused they are, as there is no need to. By increasing your enjoyment of your dreadful tasks, you will put yourself closer to a flow state in which focus will come naturally and without considerable effort. Be on the lookout for moments when you can engage in a joyful task while completing a dreadful one. Neil, for example, may listen to his favorite album while working on his monthly report. Perhaps there is a show you only allow yourself to watch while you fold laundry or a food you only allow yourself to eat while writing the next chapter of your book. These joyful and dreadful tasks can come in any shape or form, but should meet these three criteria:1) both can be completed without significantly sacrificing performance in either one2) a majority of the focus is placed on the dreadful task3) they are of two different mediums (physical and auditory, auditory and visual, physical and visual) Now that you have a basic idea of how to combine dreadful and joyful tasks, give it a try for yourself. Use the chart below to link two activities, one dreadful and one joyful. Assign a number to each activity from one to ten as an indication of how much you enjoy the activity, with one representing the most dreadful and ten the most joyful. In the middle, write the number that you believe would represent your experience of doing the two together. For example, I give running a four and listening to podcasts an eight. Together, I give the experience a seven. As this pairing meets the three criteria above and has such a high ranking, they are a great match.     Dreadful Activity  Ranking        __________________   → _______________             Combined Ranking =  _______________  Joyful Activity  Ranking        __________________   →________________      (Repeat for each activity.)Train Your BrainThere's a reason why companies write jingles, stores smell a certain way, and logos become iconic. Once we associate two things, it's hard for us to not think about one without the other. I bet you could walk by a bakery and immediately think of your childhood and your grandma's famous chocolate cookies. While this allows for fun trips down memory lane, it can also help you maintain your focus. When you associate a smell, taste, sound, or image with a certain task, you are priming your brain to focus on that task. For example, I have a playlist of instrumental guitar music that I only listen to when I write. As soon as I hear one of those songs, my brain goes into writing mode without much effort on my part. Instrumental guitar music equals writing. This could be something as small as having a cup of coffee as you sit down to work or as large as traveling to the local library before pulling out your computer. You may have preexisting preferences that you can draw upon, or you may need to create new associations. The important factor in using this strategy to maintain focus is that your brain gets used to the associations without becoming confused. I rarely ever listen to instrumental guitar music unless I am writing. If I were to listen to this playlist at other points in my day, that association would lose its power and I would have a harder time focusing on my writing as a result. Once you find a strong association, protect it and keep it as free from cross contamination as possible. Cross contamination is easy to avoid when your associations are based on fairly obscure things like instrumental guitar music. But let's say that Neil has a playlist of current pop songs that he associates with writing his monthly report and plays on repeat as he's working. Although he is careful to only listen to the songs while working, he turns on his car in the morning and hears one of the songs playing on the radio. The song is so popular, he hears it everywhere he goes. His once-strong association is quickly contaminated by his time in the grocery store, the local mall, and the coffee shop down the street. He chose an association that is all too common in the world around him and cannot be isolated to his report writing. Be sure that your associations are unique and you won't accidentally stumble upon them at the wrong times. This is the perfect opportunity to check out that band that no one has heard of or sit in that chair that usually goes ignored in your bedroom.Use the chart below to record your tasks and the positive things you associate with them. Remember that these are things that increase your focus on the given task and are often unique to that task.     Task  Association  _________________________  ______________________________  _________________________  ______________________________  _________________________  ______________________________  When it comes to priming your brain for focusing, it is just as important to remove negative associations as it is to include positive ones. I have often heard people say that their focus is worthless when trying to get work done in their living rooms. This makes complete sense, as I bet you spend a great deal of time in your living room watching television, hosting guests, playing games, and relaxing. Your living room is negatively associated with focusing. The same can be said for listening to your party playlist when trying to get something done. Be on the lookout for negative associations that are derailing your focus. While you may be concerned with what you can add to your environment to increase your focus, sometimes all you need to do is remove something in order to see positive results. The Little ThingsWhoever coined the cliché that life is about the little things was on the right track. More often than not, the difference between focus and reckless abandon is something as simple as a comfortable chair. Have you ever been in a class or meeting and the room was really cold? I bet a good deal of your time was spent thinking about how cold you were as opposed to the content of the session. The first step to increasing focus through appreciation of the little things is to remove any focus killers. This could be an uncomfortable chair, an itchy sweater, or a pair of high heels. If technology causes you issues, put your phone on silent, turn off your Wi-Fi access, and work in a room without a television. If noisy environments are a problem, be sure to set yourself up in room with a door you can close, a quiet corner of the library, or at a time of day when the world is calm. Be aware of when you are unfocused and be critical of what is causing that state. It could be something as small as the flickering light across the room, so don't disregard anything that could be impacting you, whether it be large or small.The next step in the process is to surround yourself with focus boosters. For me, there is nothing more soothing than a scented candle. When I need to get something done, placing a candle by my computer sets the mood I need to get some serious work done. Sometimes focus boosters simply work to dispel the impacts of a focus killer. A jacket, for example, may be a great focus booster because it gets rid of the focus killer of being cold. Think of focus boosters also in terms of the joyful and dreadful tasks we talked about in the previous section. If lighting a candle makes me happy, increases my focus, and does not take away from the work that needs to be done, it is a perfect focus booster and a great joyful activity I can do when working on a dreadful task in my office. Don't underestimate the power of a pleasant and comfortable environment for getting dreadful tasks done. Environmental changes often give you the best focus bang for your energy buck, as they are easy to make, inconspicuous, and don't need constant attention in order to remain pleasing. Those bright yellow curtains will continue to delight even if you only get around to dusting them every couple of months. The same can be said for music, clothes, and snacks. Surround yourself with things that are pleasing that don't require a great deal of attention. Once you find what works for you, focusing will be easier and more pleasant, as dreadful tasks will be associated with a plethora of enjoyable things.  







Chapter 7: Excusesback to topWith so much knowledge in the world today, we have come to expect explanations for the things we believe to be true. No longer do we simply accept that the world is round or the sky is blue. We want to know why, and sometimes what, when, how, and where. It is this insatiable curiosity that makes us annoying and persistent question askers as kids and intelligent and discerning knowledge seekers as adults. While we want to see the underside of every scientific fact in the world around us, we are often less critical of our own lives. Think back to the last time you said, "Oh, I could never do that." This was most likely said in response to a physical challenge, a dream job, or an exotic adventure less than a second after receiving the offer. Usually this is not born of justifiable reasons, but an unshakable belief in the impossibility of the feat. Marathons are for other people. Only muscular, meat-eating men can backpack through the jungle. Only much smarter people deserve to apply for that job. Do these sound ridiculous, or are they on your daily mental soundtrack?There are two interrelated problems here, one being a lack of confidence and the other being a fear of the pain of long-term commitments. That voice in your head telling you that you can't do it is much quicker to the punch than the one telling you that you can. Let's be honest—the one telling you that you can't is often more fun as well. That's the one that wants you to stop for ice cream two miles in, while the other wants you to finish the ten miles. The key to eliminating excuses and enhancing your focus is making the idea of ten miles more appealing than the idea of stopping short. Although easier said than done, with a few mental techniques you can learn to quiet that voice in your head that wants to derail you from your goals. ConfidenceWhen it comes to increasing focus, a lack of confidence can be the number one saboteur in your abilities to complete your tasks and achieve your goals. Why focus on something dreadful if you doubt you will reach your goals to begin with? If there's little chance of ever finishing that ten-mile run, by all means indulge in that ice cream now. And if we're talking about something as enjoyable as ice cream, the temptation of the treat alone will make the proposition appealing. A lack of confidence combined with the desire for ice cream is a strong force that even the most stable of focus can't resist crumbling under. Imagine that Neil doubts his abilities to finish his report on time just as the basketball game is beginning. What was once a simple lack of confidence soon becomes a strong desire to enjoy the game as opposed to suffer the pain of the report. Suddenly Neil makes every excuse as to why his report is a lost cause and may as well be sacrificed to the criticism of his boss. As he settles onto his couch, he tells himself that he wasn't cut out to be a CEO anyway. As we saw above, a lack of confidence is a good excuse to avoid pain. Maybe you really do believe that you can get that job or complete that assignment, but trying to do so sounds more painful than the alternative of continuing with the same old comfortable routine. A lack of confidence can be a quick and easy escape hatch. Notice moments in your daily life when you doubt your abilities. Trace their roots and see what emotions they're attached to. Are you nervous, doubtful, or unmotivated? Understanding why you believe you can't do something will allow you to better understand how to move forward.There are three possible things happening when it comes to confidence and completing a task: 1) you want to, but don't believe you can 2) you don't want to, and don't believe you can3) you don't want to, but believe you canWhen faced with a desire to quit, decide under which category it most aptly applies. If your task falls under category 1, consider why your confidence is lacking. Pinpointing your fear, anxiety, or stress can help you realize that your lack of focus relates to your false beliefs as opposed to your inabilities. If your task falls under category 2, evaluate the task and consider whether you can better adapt it to suit both your desires and abilities. It's often the case that tasks in category 2 are asking too much of you in too short amount of time. No one believes they can clean their entire garage in one afternoon, nor do they want to. Giving yourself a week to tackle the cleaning instead of a single day may be all you need to do to refocus on the task. If your given task falls under category 3, consider the obstacles that are making the task unpleasant despite your confidence in completing it. Tasks in category 3 are strong candidates for the use of association or visualization techniques, as sometimes it is a simple case of making the task more fun or motivating. EvidenceIt is difficult to tell yourself that you can't do something when you have a record of previous successes. When Neil is tempted by distractions, telling himself, "I can't" or, "I'm too tired" doesn't cut it, as he has evidence of having successfully completed his monthly reports numerous times in the past. Despite how hard he tries, Neil can't convince anyone that his lack of focus is the result of his lack of ability. Similar to how it is difficult to argue that the world is flat when you have evidence otherwise, it is difficult to tell yourself you can't do something when you have proof that you've done so in the past. But what if you've never completed a marathon, earned that promotion, or completed a project as large as your boss is requesting? If your current task seems more daunting than anything you have ever tried to tackle in the past, it doesn't mean that your history of accomplishments thus far is irrelevant. There's no doubt that there is some event in your life that you are proud of having accomplished. Think back to something that seemed challenging and intimidating at the onset, but was a success due to your perseverance and hard work. Remember that feeling you had before you started and how that feeling changed once you were finished. Maybe you gave a speech that went better than you expected, won a game against a team that was undefeated, or just managed to get out the door on time in the morning. Whatever it is, remember that success and how good it felt. Use this as motivation when your focus starts to wane and you feel tempted to make an excuse for why you can't accomplish something. Use the chart below to record a goal or task you have been struggling to focus on and something from your past that you can use as evidence of your capabilities of completing it. Refer back to this list when you lose focus and feel the urge to make an excuse as to why you are incapable of moving forward.      Goal/Task → Evidence  ___________________________  ___________________________ (Repeat for each Goal/Task)Teach Yourself a LessonSo what if you have a goal that is completely unrelated to anything you have ever done in the past and you are struggling to use your past accomplishments as motivation to stay focused? Maybe you have never run a step in your life but dream of running a half marathon. Or maybe you have terrible stage fright but want to present at the annual holiday party. If you have done your homework up to this point and ensured that your goals are internally driven and broken down into one-year increments, it's time to teach yourself a lesson. As we talked about earlier, it is easy to make excuses if you have nothing proving otherwise. No one wants to be the first person to walk across the burning coals. We'll let the next guy go first and see what happens. Similarly, you are more likely to ignore the registration e-mail for that race or ignore your boss's invitation for that presentation if you have no knowledge of being successful in these domains in the past. While this seems like a perfectly logical and survival-conscious instinct, it doesn't help us move forward in our goals and provides more than enough fuel to the excuse firestorm keeping us from our tasks. Solving this problem isn't hard. If you don't have evidence pointing to your previous accomplishments, create some. Now, this doesn't mean that you need to run thirteen miles tomorrow or round up a bunch of strangers on the street to present a speech to, but it does mean that you need to convince yourself that your goal is not as intimidating as it seems. If you want to run a half marathon, find a training program and prove to yourself that you can run five, and then six, and then seven miles. If you want to present in front of a large group of people, audition for that musical they've been advertising for in town or be the one to read the psalm in church. Sometimes the key to focusing on a task or goal is simply proving to yourself that it is not so far-fetched. Once you have evidence that success is possible, you are much more likely to stay focused. Use the chart below to record a goal or task you've been struggling to focus on and an action step you can take to teach yourself a lesson and realize that it is not as intimidating as it seems. Add these action steps to your list of goals so that you begin to accumulate evidence regarding your capabilities to complete even the most daunting of goals and tasks.      Goal/Task → Action Step  __________________________  __________________________ (Repeat for each Goal/Task.) 







Chapter 8: Getting It Doneback to topWhile we hear stories of writers crafting novels in a single weekend or athletes achieving personal bests with little training, we tend to underestimate our own personal abilities. When making our daily to-do lists, we rarely plan to run a marathon, launch a business, and buy a new car all in one day. This is probably for the best. However, it's common for to-do lists to underestimate what we're capable of accomplishing. No one likes pain and, in an attempt to avoid it, our brains will only allow us to write down the essentials. Unless bound by deadlines, those tasks that can be left for tomorrow usually are.We all wish that we could flip a switch and suddenly focus on a task for hours at a time and complete the entirety of our to-do lists in half of the expected time. While the idea of needing to complete a task and working on it until it is done seems simple, as we have seen, there are many factors that pull our focus and work to distract us from our goals. One of these factors is time and the assumption that we have just enough of it to merit one short cat video or one quick check of the social media account. As we will explore next, by destroying this assumption and manipulating the amount of time we award to tasks, we can trick our brains into a more focused state. Under PressureThink back to the last time you were under pressure to complete a task. Maybe you forgot about an assignment until the night before it was due or maybe you got lost on a hike and needed to travel more miles than you intended to get back before sunset. Whether they be professional, academic, personal, or athletic, we all have these superhero moments in which the standards feel too high, yet we persevere anyway. Maybe you gave that speech to the entire company when your coworker came down ill, even though simply speaking to your boss is enough to cause anxiety. Although you probably haven't fought off any tigers or lifted any cars off of small children recently, these moments of pressure in which you exceed your own expectations are extraordinary. What makes superhero moments so special?1) Expectations are externally determinedIf given the choice, I'm sure that you would choose to call up your boss and tell them that you decided to move the due date of your expense report to a time more convenient for you. But, sorry to say, this is as likely to work as your attempts to move the mountain you are lost on so that it is closer to your car. Superhero moments are often the result of a lack of control of standards and expectations. Although you are the one tasked with ensuring that everything works out in the end, it is usually your boss, family, friend, or Mother Nature calling the shots. 2) No is not an optionAlthough expectations are not in your control, you quickly gain control of everything that is within your power. Let's say, for example, that you find out that your family missed all of the holiday traffic and will be arriving at your house for dinner two hours earlier than expected. Instead of throwing up your hands and resigning to crying in the corner, you evaluate your to-do list and eliminate all of the nonessentials. Maybe you order takeout from the restaurant down the street instead of slaving over a home-cooked masterpiece and maybe you skip dusting in exchange for cleaning the bathroom, but everything works out nonetheless. You can't change your family's good fortune on the roadways, yet you can change how you use the precious moments you have before they arrive. 3) Tunnel vision kicks inPeople are never more focused or productive than when in a superhero moment. Phones will ring, lightning will strike, and buildings will crumble and the person will still be glued to their task. There's something about the combination of impossible expectations and a lack of time that creates a degree of focus that even those that meditate for hours can't replicate. When engaged in a superhero moment, it's as though nothing else matters or even exists until the task is complete. No matter how tired or hungry you are, when the sun is going down and you are still miles from your car or your mother-in-law is just around the corner with a car full of relatives, nothing seems to matter but moving one foot in front of the other. The To-Do List ProblemTo-do lists can be great personal organization systems. They create a great visual of what needs to be completed before the end of the day and no one can deny the satisfaction that comes from crossing off tasks with a big black pen. On the other hand, how often do you finish your to-do list and have an urge to add to it? I'm assuming it's not often. When writing your to-do list in the morning, you are writing your destiny for the day. If it doesn't make the cut, it likely won't get done. Counterintuitively, the number of tasks you write on your to-do list has little impact on the timing of your day. This is easy to notice if you work a traditional nine-to-five or have a set schedule in which tasks need to be completed. I bet that you often complete your to-do list in the same amount of time regardless of how many items are on it. This is defined as Parkinson's Law, a law esteemed by productivity greats such as Tim Ferriss, that states that a task will expand to fill the time granted it. So if Neil writes on his to-do list that he needs to complete both his monthly report and tomorrow's meeting agenda before the evening is over, he will likely complete both in roughly the same amount of time it would have taken him to complete one. This is not caused by some stroke of magic, but by focus. Suddenly Neil is not tempted by the latest basketball scores or social media postings. Limiting the amount of time he has for his tasks by adding more to his to-do list, Neil is putting himself under the pressure required to produce a superhero moment. If you find that you are easily distracted throughout the day, you may have underestimated how much you can complete in a day. Practice adding additional tasks to your to-do list until you feel that the requirements are just beyond what you are capable of. Create superhero moments for yourself, as the pressure to complete the entirety of your list will keep you focused on your tasks and avoiding distractions.Due YesterdayLimiting the amount of time you have to complete a task can quickly become stressful as opposed to motivating. There's no doubt that Neil is focused on his report two hours before it is due, but he is also working himself into a panic. The goal isn't to increase your productivity at the expense of your health. If you are finding that increasing the length of your to-do list and limiting the amount of time you spend on tasks is raising your heart rate, it's time to change your approach. One way to manage this problem is to set all of your deadlines back by a day. For example, if you tell yourself something is due in two days when it is actually due in three, your brain will work at the intensity needed to fulfill this new deadline. This can offer the same benefits to your focus as real pressure, but imaginary pressure causes a lot less heart trouble. It is a win-win situation, as not only are you increasing your focus, but you are also giving yourself a cushion in case life happens. Even with the most predictable of schedules, there are always days when friends surprise you with a visit, a child becomes sick, or a pipe springs a leak. With this strategy, you are not thrown off course when unexpected events occur. This strategy is especially effective for reoccurring tasks. While it may sound absurd to intentionally reduce your time on a regular basis, you are not actually losing any time once it becomes habit. For example, if Neil decides to tell himself that his report is due on the 29th every month instead of the 30th, after the first month in which he makes the change and loses a day of work, he still has a full month between each report. Neil has put pressure on himself to finish his report early while giving himself the security of extra time in case life takes a turn.The key to this strategy is to set your deadlines a day earlier than necessary and then forget that you did. It is easy for Neil to set his deadline for the 29th, but then tell himself that he actually has until the 30th. If you set a new deadline but always have the old deadline in the back of your mind, your focus will suffer and the strategy will not work to your benefit. Get in the habit of setting a new deadline and sticking with it. Promise yourself a reward and use visualization strategies to create tangible feelings of pride and accomplishment for completing the task by the new deadline.Use the chart below to record your reoccurring tasks and the date by which you would like to have them completed. Remember that the first month is the only month you will lose a day of work and that you will become accustomed to the deadlines as time goes on.     Task  Deadline  ________________________  _________________________  _________________________  ________________________  Motivation vs. AnxietyThere is a fine line between expectations that are motivating and those that cause anxiety. While you may have no choice but to feel anxious about the crazy deadlines set by your boss, try not to raise your stress and blood pressure on your own accord. We are in search of that sweet spot in which you feel energized and focused, yet not on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I like to tackle this problem by doing as we discussed above and making my to-do list slightly longer than I can handle. But after I'm done with my list, I tack on a bonus task at the end that merits a reward if I complete it. This reward could be as simple as a cookie from my favorite bakery or listening to my favorite podcast on my drive home. Whatever it may be, this little incentive is usually enough to keep me focused during the day so that I can push past my to-do list essentials to the bonus task. The reason why this technique works is because it isn't a big deal if I don't complete the bonus task and get my cookie at the end of the day. By nature, the bonus task is something that can be added to the top of my list the following day if need be. The key is to determine a reward that you would be happy to treat yourself with but not heartbroken to leave behind. If it is something that isn't very exciting, it won't incentivize you to remain focused. On the other hand, if you are too excited about the reward, you will feel anxious to complete the list. Experiment with rewards and find something that strikes a perfect balance between boredom and anxiety.Check-InsAt the risk of sounding elementary, a fundamental part of ensuring consistent focus and productivity throughout the day is checking in with yourself emotionally on a regular basis. Look for natural pausing points in your day that are spaced about two hours from each other. Put everything down and take sixty seconds to take stock of what has been accomplished, what still needs to be done, and how you feel about it. Analysis of your feelings about how your day is progressing is the most important part of the check-in, as this will determine how the rest of the day will pan out. During your periodic check-ins, rate your levels of motivation and anxiety and be aware of any discrepancy between the two. For example, here's how Neil would rank himself the night before his report is due:Check-In Time: 9 p.m. →Anxiety: 8 →Motivation: 5 Whenever your anxiety level rates higher than your motivation level, this indicates that something needs to change. Neil cannot easily change the due date of his report the night before it is due. However, he can utilize a timer to avoid distractions, listen to his favorite music to increase his enjoyment of the task, or perform a quick visualization to remind himself of the pride he will feel when he is done. He can also consider how he will avoid these feelings in the future by setting his deadline earlier next month or creating positive associations that will strengthen his focus. Here's the second part of Neil's check-in:Next steps: play favorite music, set a timer for twenty-five minutes, visualize completion and having extra time for basketball, set deadline for the 29th instead of the 30th. Check-ins can be done on a piece of scratch paper, but sometimes it is useful to keep a record of your check-ins so as to look back on how your motivation and anxiety levels have shifted over time. Feel free to use the chart below as a template and record your check-ins in a journal with notes about what you were working on that day.    Check-In Time:  ___________________  Anxiety:  ___________________  Motivation:  ___________________      Next Steps  ________________________________________  ________________________________________  Although we have talked a lot about creating to-do lists first thing in the morning, this does not mean that it is written in stone. Unless you have secret powers you've kept from the rest of the world, it's unlikely that a day will go exactly as planned. No matter your degree of focus, you will be interrupted, surprise meetings will pop up, and tasks will take longer than expected. Remember that you are not a psychic and you wrote your to-do list based on presumptions of how the day would go, not on cold hard facts of what would actually happen. If you are at a check-in and find your anxiety ranking higher than your motivation, it's okay to reevaluate what you hope to accomplish and adjust your to-do list accordingly. Now, this is not an excuse to be lazy. If you begin to regularly adjust your to-do list during your check-in, you need to consider why. Is it that your list is always too ambitious and unrealistic when you create it in the morning? Or is it that you are wasting time throughout the day, subconsciously knowing that you can change your to-do list later if you need to? Be honest with yourself as you make adjustments to your day and realize that your own focus and productivity is ultimately in your control.  







Chapter 9: The Present Momentback to topIt's obvious that we live in the here and now. Although we may get caught daydreaming from time to time, we are often conscious of what is happening to us and around us. This is why foot pain today seems more important than hand pain last week. While we have no trouble focusing on moments we enjoy, dreadful moments have us running for the exits. This is a natural human instinct that we can thank for our survival from lions, fires, and marriage-ending conversations. The problem is that today's world often requires that we override our instincts to flee from dreadful moments in the name of progress and achieving our goals. Imagine if Neil indulged in distractions every time his focus on his monthly report began to fade. His instinct would be to make his present moment more enjoyable and watch the basketball game. While he may enjoy himself in the moment, his dreams of becoming a CEO would suffer. There are times that we need to sacrifice the joy of the present moment to our commitment to the bigger picture. This is not easy to do, as all of the nerves in our bodies tell us to seize the day and enjoy everything the world has to offer. Eat that ice cream today because it won't taste as sweet tomorrow; watch that video now because it will be old news an hour from now; buy that new car this week because the price won't be as low next month. This voice makes focus seem impossible, as it is always tempting us to choose pleasure over pain. As we will learn next, there are ways to frame the present moment so as to put this voice at bay. Achieving your goals and focusing on your most dreadful tasks is about taking the present moment back into your control, steering the wheel and riding the line between pleasure and pain. Ditch ItDo you remember when you were a child and your mom or dad would hold your hand and tell you a story about a rainbow unicorn while the nurse gave you a shot? Or maybe this happened yesterday. It seems counterintuitive, but diversion can be the best friend of focus. This is not a great strategy for heart surgeons or race car drivers, but for those of us that struggle with monotonous or tedious tasks that don't place any lives in jeopardy, strategic diversion can be the key to our abilities to focus on a task long enough to finish it. Imagine Neil as he is about to sit down to write his report. His mind is racing with thoughts about how many pages he still needs to write, how many hours of work are ahead of him, and how hungry, tired, and frustrated he is. It sounds like too much for him to handle and now all Neil can focus on is how horrible and dreadful this moment is. Maybe the future is bright, but the here and now is awful.We are often told that living in the present moment is the ultimate goal. Knowing that time is fleeting, we savor every last taste of that birthday cake or every last glimpse of that gorgeous sunset. These moments are great and we should love every minute of them. But, in this imperfect world, we encounter moments on a daily basis that aren't so special and magical. I would be the first in line to erase the memories of getting my wisdom teeth pulled. No matter how much we love and appreciate life, we will always be faced with challenges that are more difficult to handle when we focus too heavily on them. Staying in the present moment has the effect of turning emotions on overdrive. Think about how much more powerful that sunset is when you aren't thinking about your taxes or the laundry. Your enjoyment is more pure and free-flowing when you focus on the present moment and the beauty in front of you. On the flip side, think about how horrible Neil feels when he is focused on the blank page in front of him and how exhausted he already feels. His anguish is amplified when he gets caught up in the moment. Let's imagine instead that Neil puts on his favorite album and visualizes how happy he will be after his report is finished. As he is writing, instead of focusing on the blank page, he anticipates the next song that will play and lets his mind drift to how he will spend his free time later in the evening. Now you may be thinking that this distracts his focus from his report. And in some ways it does, as Neil is thinking less about his report than he was before. However, Neil utilizes association and visualization techniques that will ultimately increase his focus and productivity. By directing his attention to the music and future plans, he tricks his brain into believing he is doing something more enjoyable than he actually is. The few seconds he loses by enjoying the music and daydreaming about his future plans will be inconsequential in comparison to the time he would have lost had he fallen prey to a larger distraction by ruminating too long on the pain of his report. Focus is a bit like a game of cat and mouse. If you think about it too much, you will never get started on anything, but if you completely disregard it, your day will dissolve into an endless loop of funny cat videos. Sometimes the key is to trick your focus into submission. Through strategic diversions, you can complete a task, enjoy it, and not remember how it happened in the first place. It's similar to getting caught up in a news story while driving and not remembering the trip home. Be aware of when you are so focused on the dreadful nature of a task that you lose motivation to move forward with it. In moments like these, look for ways to shift your focus toward something more enjoyable. Revisit the chapter on joy to remind yourself of the joyful things you can incorporate into your day and practice visualization to remind yourself that better things are around the corner. Even if you lose a few minutes of productivity by thinking about your upcoming vacation while you work, you will save yourself the half-hour journey down the distraction rabbit hole. In addition to increasing your ability to complete tasks, strategic diversions are a reminder that you are ultimately in control of how much you enjoy your daily experiences. Even if your cubicle sometimes becomes an imaginary tropical island, don't be afraid to occasionally ditch the present moment and indulge in what makes you happy. Your focus and productivity will benefit in the long run and you will be much happier moving through life's dreadful tasks.       Reframe TomorrowAs we saw with Neil, our minds can be overwhelmed by the thought of our dreadful tasks and our focus suffers as a result. What often goes unmentioned is the tendency of dreadful tasks to sneak into every aspect of our lives, even when they are far in the future. Nothing can ruin a perfect dinner and a movie faster than worrying about tomorrow's presentation. Even the thought of a future dreadful task can detour our focus away from what we are currently working on. This is why we walk off of curbs when we're preparing for a difficult conversation with our spouse or we misspell our names on medical forms while waiting for test results in the doctor's office. This tendency not only impacts our overall focus but also deadens the enjoyment of our designated time off. Neil may rejoice after completing his monthly report, but as soon he sits down to reward himself with his favorite show, his mind starts worrying about tomorrow's staff meeting, the business trip he hasn't planned yet, and even next month's report. What was supposed to be time to unwind and relax has been hijacked by the anticipation of upcoming dreadful tasks. Although it seems less common, we often struggle to focus on our joyful tasks. You may scream out in protest and say that you've never failed to appreciate a nice slice of pizza or an evening with the family. But if you are honest with yourself, I bet you'd admit that have wound up in Neil's predicament more often than you'd like to admit. Have you ever been on vacation and been told to shut up, stop planning, and simply enjoy the view? Our worries about the dreadful tasks of tomorrow have a larger impact on today than we realize and can distract our attention from even the most enjoyable of tasks. When you find yourself distracted by a current or upcoming hardship, reframe the situation by reminding yourself that it won't last forever. Even the worst stomach flu has an end date. I know that reminders about the finitude of life are often used to inspire us to seize the day and make the most out of life, but knowing that moments are fleeting can be reassuring when things aren't going as planned. There's no doubt you have been through many unpleasant events that seemed horrible but are now distant memories. By reminding yourself that your present situation is temporary, you will redirect your focus away from worrying and back to the task at hand. Both your happiness and productivity will benefit, as the longer you spend thinking about how horrible your taxes are, the longer you will stall before beginning your taxes and the more enjoyable time you will taint with the anticipation of doing your taxes. Soon your whole life is revolving around your taxes and you haven't even started yet. Remind yourself that it won't last forever and then move on. Try developing a mantra to remind yourself that pain is fleeting and nothing lasts forever. When faced with a dreadful task that you find yourself obsessing over, repeat this mantra until you are able to regain your focus. If you are struggling to reframe a current or future dreadful task, revisit the evidence section of Chapter 7. Not only is evidence useful in convincing yourself that you are capable of accomplishing a challenging goal, it is also useful in convincing yourself that pain doesn't last forever. When Neil's relaxation time is spoiled by worries of his next report, he reminds himself that he has many months of evidence pointing to the successful completion of his report and of having survived the process. Once he has evidence, Neil feels as though he has the authority to tell himself that worrying is pointless. The lesson that worrying is pointless is one that we learn again and again. No matter how many sleepless nights we spend tossing and turning, we are disappointed to find out that worrying is not some magical act that causes everything to turn out in our favor. In short, time worrying does not equate to degree of success. We are humans, though, and sometimes even our most logical selves can't resist the urge to worry. This is where evidence comes into play yet again. In addition to evidence of past successes, keep track of times in your life in which worrying was pointless. Maybe you couldn't focus on dinner with your best friend because you were worried about missing your flight but ended up arriving at the airport in plenty of time. Or maybe you missed your flight, were put on a later flight, given a complimentary upgrade from the airline company, and spent a precious two extra hours with your friend. Even if missing your flight had a less glamorous outcome than this, worrying wouldn't have changed that. Reminding yourself that worrying often has little impact on the outcome of a situation is a good way to calm yourself and refocus your attention when it begins to stray. Use the chart below to record events you worried so much about that it pulled your focus away from the present moment. Record the events, the outcomes, and whether worrying produced the outcomes. More often than not, you will see that worrying had little impact on how the situation turned out and was simply a drag on your focus and happiness.    Event:  _____________________________________________  Outcome:  ______________________________________________  Outcome a Result of Worrying? Yes/No     Event:  ________________________________________________  Outcome:  ________________________________________________  Outcome a Result of Worrying? Yes/No Embrace TodayWhen it comes to focus and the present moment, there's a tendency to mistake detective work for progress. What I mean by this is that we want to know exactly what is derailing our focus. We want to know where that feeling of anger is coming from, why we feel jittery, and why the earth is spinning. We become so obsessed with analyzing a situation that by the time we have decoded all of our emotions, dealt with them, and prepared ourselves to work, half the day is gone. We see this all of the time with relationships. We will think so much about what we are going to say, whether our hair looks okay, and if the stars are perfectly aligned, that the person of our dreams will walk away and be halfway down the street before we get our act together and speak even a word. Sometimes we need to accept the present moment as it is and move on. Maybe your hair isn't perfectly combed and maybe you spit out a silly joke instead of a perfectly crafted pick-up line, but it's better than missing the opportunity to meet the love of your life. No matter how many strategies you employ or how much thought you put into it, no moment will ever be perfect and trying to make it perfect is a waste of time. You will always be a little distracted when working on a task, even if you have developed the sharp focus of a monk in a far-off monastery. You will always feel a slight pull toward your favorite online shopping site and you will always have a little bit of dread when you sit down to do your taxes, even if you surround yourself with things that bring you joy. Sometimes the key to focus is realizing that the moment or the task isn't perfect but getting on with it anyway. Neil could spend hours wondering why he dreads writing his reports and feeling sorry for himself that his boss told him to do them in the first place. This accomplishes nothing but wasting time. Neil would benefit much more from telling himself something like this:Yes, this report writing is awful, but it won't last forever and the sooner I get started, the sooner it will be over. Tomorrow I will be enjoying a nice cold drink while watching the basketball game. Now, get over it and on with it. No amount of recipes will give you tray of cookies if you never get in the kitchen and do the work. Similarly, no amount of analysis, environment manipulation, or cursing at your boss will increase your focus and productivity unless you get to work on that assignment you've been putting off. Acknowledge the present moment, change what you can, accept what you can't, and move on. Use the chart below to take stock of your feelings and environment as you sit down to a task. Divide everything around you into two categories: things you can control and things you can't. Look at your list and spend no more than five minutes trying to eliminate the things under your control. Maybe the music is too loud and the simple change of turning down the volume will make the moment more manageable. For the things that are out of your control, acknowledge them and move on. I can't offer a secret formula that will erase the frustration you feel toward your boss, but I can say that writing it down and acknowledging it as a factor impeding your focus can be beneficial in itself. By putting it on paper, you lessen its emotional power by creating distance between you and it. Although you may feel some very real frustration toward your boss, it doesn't look as dramatic or intimidating as small letters written on a page. Right now, these things are . . .

Chapter 10: Too Much of a Good Thingback to topWe often hear stories about the horrors of having too much money, too much success, or too much chocolate. The sad saga ends and we spend the next five minutes rolling our eyes. Even if we can't find enough pockets in our pants to stuff millions of dollars in, that seems like a great problem to have. I bet that most of us would rather have too much of a good thing than too much of a bad thing or even something that's just so-so.       The problem is that we quickly become gluttons. While it seems logical that we would want unlimited supplies of chocolate and focus, too much chocolate will eventually cause acne and upset stomachs and too much focus will eventually cause exhaustion and sudden outbursts at unsuspecting potted plants. As we have discussed, focus is about riding a fine line between dread and joy, motivation and anxiety, planning and action, and today and tomorrow. Keeping a tight rein on focus involves eliminating those things you deem as bad but also limiting those that you deem as good. It's a constant give-and-take that can be mastered with practice. BurnoutImagine that Neil has exceeded his own expectations and is now on his third hour of report writing sans distractions. Not once has he been tempted by the basketball scores, allured by the notifications on his phone, or fallen for his friend's nagging to finally buy those concert tickets. He has been staring so hard at his computer that his vision is blurry when he looks up and his fingers cramp as he types faster and faster. Neil is in the zone. This sounds perfect and, in many ways, it is. Neil is focused, productive, and well on his way to being done with his report before the evening is over. The problem arises when the first little crack appears in Neil's mental focus fortress. As he hasn't been taking breaks along the way, Neil's focus is vulnerable to complete breakdown. Let's say that after his long streak of focused work, Neil falls prey to the buzz of his phone. He stops to answer the message, returns to the report, and suddenly feels exhausted. He is like a sprinter that didn't realize he was tired until he stopped for water and was offered a doughnut and massage. Neil remembers how nice distractions can be and, as he is mentally tired, has a hard time resisting them. He spends the rest of the night more distracted than focused and ultimately takes more time finishing his report than if he had abided by regular breaks along the way. Focus can be a fickle creature that needs constant care and attention. If you overwork it, it is likely to fight back by calling it quits when you need it most. As he wasn't taking care of himself along the way, Neil reaches burnout before he is done with his task. Resist the urge to power through long tasks unless you are positive that your mental energy will hold. Neil may have evidence from previous months proving that he is capable of finishing his report in four hours and maintain uninterrupted focus for that amount of time. If you have this evidence, by all means, ride the focus wave until it runs out. Otherwise, stick to scheduled breaks. This will benefit your focus overall and prevent mental exhaustion. If your day is full of a lot of little tasks, mentally switching from task to task may be enough to prevent burnout without the need for frequent breaks. As such, be conscious of organizing your to-do list to promote diversity among your tasks. It may be easier to jump from writing a chapter of your novel to organizing your closet than it would be to jump to editing your son's literature essay. Simply mixing the order of your tasks in a day may be enough to prevent burnout and preserve your focus. On the other hand, long-term assignments and those with an ambiguous end date may require more intentional breaks to prevent burnout. If you are studying for an exam, writing a long report like Neil, or working on one task that consumes your to-do list for multiple days, your brain may struggle to have the energy to focus the entire day due to the monotony of it all. Think back to high school when you took the SAT or any other long standardized test. I bet that after those four or five hours of concentrated focus, you didn't go home and write a bestselling novel. Your brain was tired and likely wanted nothing more than a television and soft pillow. Trick your mind into believing that your day is filled with more diversity than it actually is by rewarding it with things that bring you joy on a regular basis. While it may feel good to fall into the zone and a focus flow, you are leaving yourself vulnerable to burnout and your productivity will ultimately suffer. ExcitementHaving too much joy is rarely a bad thing. We all want to celebrate life to the fullest and ride the highs of our greatest moments. Uncontrollable excitement is in full order at your best friend's birthday party, your son's graduation, or even your regular Tuesday night family dinner. We could be overwhelmed by something as large as finally reaching retirement or something as small as taking a walk every morning. Excitement for life has to be one of the greatest gifts and there's no doubt the world would be a better place if we found everything it has to offer more exciting. While excitement makes life worth living, uncontrollable excitement can be the enemy of focus. When we get too excited, our minds become like anxious dogs that can't wait to go outside. They spin around and around, making a lot of noise and moving fast, but never getting anywhere. We get so caught up in the excitement of the present moment that we lose our capacities for patience, forethought, and planning. Think about the last time you were at a dinner party or went out dancing. Would that same level of excitement have served you well if you were asked to sit down and write your life story? When it comes to completing a to-do list, it's unlikely that your high level of excitement is related to the task at hand. I can't remember the last time I was so excited to clean my car that I couldn't focus on it. More memorable is the last time I tried to clean my car and became so engrossed in the rock music I was listening to that I spent more time dancing around my driveway than emptying my passenger seat. While incorporating daily joys into your dreadful tasks is a great way to increase focus when motivation is lacking, it can go too far. This is not to say that dance breaks are strictly prohibited. As we discussed earlier, allowing yourself time in your day to do what you enjoy is crucial to maintaining motivation and focus. The problem is that we can unintentionally put ourselves at a disadvantage by priming our brains for the wrong tasks. It is similar to asking someone to run a mile and then expecting them to fall asleep ten minutes after they get back. Instead of being in the calm and relaxed state needed for sleep, the brain is wired and ready for action. If you want to sit down to a long to-do list, refrain from playing the same songs you would play when getting ready for a party. Don't eat the same popcorn you eat during movie nights, don't wear the same clothes you wear to the gym, and don't use the same markers that you use for art projects with your kids. As we talked about in Chapter 6, your brain will associate certain experiences with certain activities. This is why it is hard to focus on cleaning my car when my brain has been trained to associate rock music with having fun with friends. While I am happier than I was ten minutes ago, my car is still dirty. Make sure that your associations promote focus as opposed to suppress it. Excitement may feel good in the moment, but failing to accomplish your to-do list as a result does not. Use the chart below to write down some focus killers. These are things that may be inherently good, but put you in a state of mind that impedes your focus. For example, my ringtone used to be my favorite song and I would get excited when it rang. In order to maintain a focused mindset, I changed it to something neutral that doesn't hold any emotional weight.     Focus Killers:  _______________________________________________  _______________________________________________  If you have flexibility in your day, a good strategy for ensuring that your energy level matches the task at hand is to rearrange your to-do list to reflect your current needs. For example, if I need to paint the living room and complete some paperwork, I will paint the living room first thing in the morning when I am at my most energetic and leave the paperwork for the afternoon when I am feeling sluggish. I am still completing the same amount of work, but am doing so in a way that accommodates the ebbs and flows in energy that occur throughout the day. If you are feeling that your energy levels aren't aligning properly with the order of the day's tasks, rearrange them. You will have an easier time remaining focused and likely enjoy yourself more along the way. KnowledgeI know from experience that regardless of the number of hours I spend reading articles about ab exercises, I won't get a six-pack unless I get on the ground and do the work. The same can be said for productivity strategies. In a society prone to information overload, it is easy to get stuck in the research phase and avoid taking action until every i has been dotted and t has been crossed. The problem is that there simply isn't enough time in life to read everything about a topic. Perfect preparation is impossible. Sometimes we need to embark on a journey without knowing what every turn and pit stop will be along the way. Failing to take action can often be a cover-up for unpleasant emotions. Instead of accepting the fact that we are scared to put pen to paper on the first page of that novel, we tell ourselves that we haven't done enough research on character development, plot construction, or formatting. Instead of telling our significant others that we are nervous about commitment, we pour through online forums and top ten lists about decoding the red flags in a relationship. We may think we are gathering important information, but what we are really doing is stalling and wasting time. By this point in the book, you should already be enacting strategies and seeing results. If not, you need to stop reading and get to it. Much of what you need to know you will learn along the way as you begin to understand what works for you and your unique circumstances. Experiment, make mistakes, and change things as you go. Knowledge will guide your journey, but it won't take you the whole way. It's time for you to take action and give it a try.If you find yourself stuck in the research phase, go back to the beginning of the book and reevaluate the "whys" of your tasks. Sometimes a lack of focus can be an indication that there's an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. Maybe you are in need of a career change and that is what is killing your motivation to move forward with the expense reports. Maybe you are feeling uncomfortable in a new city and that is what is holding you back from unpacking that last box of clothes. Evaluate what is preventing action. Is it that you want to gather more information before getting started, or is there a larger issue at play? Once you know why you aren't moving forward, you will better be able to pinpoint the root of your distraction and have a better shot at redirecting your focus. StructureAs you move through any focus and productivity strategy, you will no doubt pick and choose based on what works for you. You will learn that electronic music isn't suited for answering e-mails and that drinking coffee before a long night's work makes you jittery. This type of information is useful as you set up your environment and mindset to suit your needs. What you implement today may seem unfamiliar, but soon it will become a routine and, eventually, a way of life. This is why we learn to fold clothes a certain way and ten years later find ourselves still folding them in the same fashion. Habits and structure allow us to move through life without obsessing about every move and step we are going to take next. Imagine if you put your keys in a different spot every time you came home. I bet you would drive yourself crazy trying to find them on your way to work in the mornings. Indeed, we would all lose our minds if it weren't for structure. As we have learned, structure is an important part of focus. We know the benefits of schedules, timers, environments, mindsets, and all of the tricks that keep us focused on our to-do lists. The problem is that focus can become demanding and picky. For example, Neil knows that he likes to change out of his work clothes, listen to instrumental music, drink a cup of coffee, and sit at his desk in his home office in order to cultivate the focus needed to write his report. As such, he makes sure that all of these things happen each month as he prepares to complete the task. One week, however, Neil is on a business trip the day before his monthly report is due and he finds himself in an airport terminal with his laptop open in front of him as passengers and flight staff hurry by. Neil is still wearing his suit from the meeting earlier that day, the line is too long at the coffee shop, and he can barely hear the soft strum of his music through his headphones because of the constant stream of flight announcements blaring through the terminal. Neil stares blankly at his computer and longs for his fuzzy slippers and sweatpants back at home. Neil has become too dependent on one focus routine. While it is great that he has found what works for him, he has left himself defenseless when the world throws him a curveball. Don't become so attached to one way of completing a task that you are unable to imagine yourself doing it any other way. What if someone takes your favorite table at the local coffee shop or the radio station you listen to every night has a program change? Your Plan A is only as strong as your Plan B. Anticipate that things won't go your way and have backup strategies at the ready so that you can regain your focus and carry on with your task. 







Part 3: Final Thoughts 







Chapter 11: Lifelong Learnerback to topAs we have learned throughout this book, focus requires close attention to the environment, circumstances, and requirements of the task at hand. Everyone's formula is unique and can't be applied universally to tasks or individuals, regardless of how similar those tasks or individuals appear to be. This is why many students groan at the thought of group projects. Although sharing one task and one goal, everyone needs something different in order to focus. This person needs absolute quiet, while this one needs background noise. This person needs to move around while brainstorming a new idea, while this one needs to sit with their eyes closed. This one writes with a computer, while this one prefers a pen or pencil. This one needs the stars to be aligned in a certain way, while this one can only work by a full moon. The list goes on and on. Remember that focus will never be perfect and, even when working alone, will require compromise. Maybe you can't remodel your house so that your windows face the backyard instead of the busy street or maybe you can't change the fact that your family is stopping in for a visit during the busiest time of your work year. Learning how to focus is as much about learning how to deflect what doesn't work for you as it is about learning how to attract what does. The better you are at mitigating distractions you have control over and accepting the ones you don't, the fewer focus strategies you will need to implement in the first place. Go ahead, lay on that cologne so that the endless talker won't sit next to you in the library. Be flexible, creative, and forever willing to adapt your focus strategies to suit your needs and circumstances. If you have learned just one thing from this book, I hope it is the idea that you have control over your focus. With a certain amount of self-awareness and detective work, you can discover what you need to complete any task. This is not a one-time obligation, though. Attending to your focus is a lifelong journey and requires consistent evaluation and adaption. Neil may believe that he has figured out the perfect storm of elements to foster his ideal report-writing focus, only to find it ineffective a month later. Similar to how our preferences for breakfast cereals or music styles can change on a whim, so too can our needs relating to focus and productivity. While one day you may need rock music and the bustle of a busy coffee shop to complete your work, the next day you might need the solace of your home office. Adopt the attitude of a lifelong learner, always searching for the next lesson that will improve your focus. For each new task, ask yourself what you need in that moment, in that environment, in that mindset, and in that pursuit of your goal. Realize that what worked for you in college may not work for you as a professional or what worked for you as a single individual may not work for you as a spouse or parent. Don't get too attached to any one strategy or way of behaving, and trust that making mistakes can be the best way to learn how to do it right the next time. As promised, we are ending this book by reevaluating your definition of focus. Whether it has changed dramatically or stayed essentially the same, I hope it is now informed by strategies and techniques that mean something to you. These definitions comprise the foundation of your focus formula and determine the path you take when devising a plan to accomplish your goals. Let these definitions be fluid, as you are in control of how you define your success. You are the owner of your life and it's about time you act like it.     Task:  _______________________________________________  Definition of Focus:  ________________________________________________ (Repeat for each Task.)
