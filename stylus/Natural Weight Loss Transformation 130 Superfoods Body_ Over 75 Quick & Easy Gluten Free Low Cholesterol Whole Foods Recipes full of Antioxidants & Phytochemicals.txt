Broths
 
Some recipes require a cup or more of various broths, vegetable,
beef or chicken broth. I usually cook the whole pot and freeze it.
 









Vegetable
broth
 
Servings: 6 cups 
Ingredients 
 
• 1
tbsp. coconut oil
• 1
large onion
• 2
stalks celery, including some leaves
• 2
large carrots
• 1
bunch green onions, chopped
• 8
cloves garlic, minced
• 8
sprigs fresh parsley
• 6
sprigs fresh thyme
• 2
bay leaves
• 1
tsp. salt
• 2
quarts water
 
Instructions - Allergies: SF, GF, DF, EF, V, NF
 
Chop veggies into small chunks. Heat oil in a soup pot and add onion,
scallions, celery, carrots, garlic, parsley, thyme, and bay leaves. Cook over
high heat for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Bring to a boil and add salt. Lower heat and simmer, uncovered, for
30 minutes. Strain. Other ingredients to consider: broccoli stalk, celery root
 












Chicken Broth
Ingredients
• 4 lbs. fresh chicken (wings, necks,
backs, legs, bones)
• 2 peeled onions or 1 cup chopped
leeks
• 2 celery stalks
• 1 carrot 
• 8 black peppercorns 
• 2 sprigs fresh thyme 
• 2 sprigs fresh parsley 
• 1 tsp. salt
Instructions - Allergies: SF, GF, DF, EF, NF
Put cold water in a stock pot and add chicken. Bring just to a boil.
Skim any foam from the surface. Add other ingredients, return just to a boil,
and reduce heat to a slow simmer. Simmer for 2 hours. Let cool to warm room
temperature and strain. Keep chilled and use or freeze broth within a few days.
Before using, defrost and boil.












Beef Broth
 
Ingredients
• 4-5
pounds beef bones and few veal bones
• 1
pound of stew meat (chuck or flank steak) cut into 2-inch chunks
• olive oil or cumin oil
• 1-2
medium onions, peeled and quartered
• 1-2
large carrots, cut into 1-2 inch segments
• 1
celery rib, cut into 1 inch segments
• 2-3
cloves of garlic, unpeeled
• Handful
of parsley, stems and leaves
• 1-2
bay leaves
• 10
peppercorns
 
Instructions - Allergies: SF, GF, DF, EF, NF
Heat oven to 375°F. Rub olive oil over the stew meat pieces,
carrots, and onions. Place stew meat or beef scraps, stock bones, carrots and
onions in a large roasting pan. Roast in oven for about 45 minutes, turning
everything half-way through the cooking. 
Place everything from the oven in a large stock pot. Pour some
boiling water in the oven pan and scrape up all of the browned bits and pour
all in the stock pot.
Add parsley, celery, garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns to the pot.
Fill the pot with cold water, to 1 inch over the top of the bones. Bring the
stock pot to a regular simmer and then reduce the heat to low, so it just
barely simmers. Cover the pot loosely and let simmer low and slow for 3-4
hours. 
Scoop away the fat and any scum that rises to the surface once in a
while. 
After cooking, remove the bones and vegetables from the pot. Strain
the broth. Let cool to room temperature and then put in the refrigerator.
The fat will solidify once the broth has chilled. Discard the fat
(or reuse it) and pour the broth into a jar and freeze it. 
 
 












Pastes
Curry Paste
This should not be prepared in advance, but there are several curry
recipes that are using curry paste and I decided to take the curry paste recipe
out and have it separately. So, when you see that the recipe is using curry
paste, please go to this part of the book and prepare it from scratch. Don't
use processed curry pastes or curry powder; make it every time from scratch.
Keep the spices in original form (seeds, pods), ground them just before making
the curry paste. You can dry heat in the skillet cloves, cardamom, cumin and
coriander and then crush them coarsely with mortar and pestle.
Ingredients
• 2
onions, minced 
• 2 cloves garlic, minced 
• 2 teaspoons fresh ginger root, finely chopped 
• 6 whole cloves 
• 2
cardamom pods
• 2 (2 inch) pieces cinnamon sticks, crushed 
• 1 tsp. ground cumin 
• 1 tsp. ground coriander 
• 1 tsp. salt 
• 1 tsp. ground cayenne pepper 
• 1 tsp. ground turmeric 

Instructions - Allergies: SF, GF, DF, EF, V, NF
Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat and fry onions until
transparent. Stir in garlic, cumin, ginger, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, salt,
cayenne, and turmeric. Cook for 1 minute over medium heat, stirring constantly.
At this point other curry ingredients should be added.










Tomato paste
Some recipes (chili) require tomato paste. I usually prepare 20 or
so liters at once (when tomato is in season, which is usually September) and
freeze it.
Ingredients
• 5
lbs. chopped plum tomatoes
• 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil or avocado oil plus
2 tbsp.
• salt, to taste
Instructions - Allergies: SF, GF, DF, EF, V, NF
Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add tomatoes.
Season with salt. Bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, until very soft, about 8
minutes.

Pass the tomatoes through the finest plate of a food mill. Push as much of the
pulp through the sieve as possible and leave the seeds behind.

Bring it to boil, lower it and then boil uncovered, so the liquid will thicken
(approx. 30-40 minutes). That will give you homemade tomato juice. You get
tomato paste if you boil for 60 minutes, it gets thick like store bought
ketchup.

Store sealed in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one month,
or freeze, for up to 6 months.










Precooked beans
 
Again, some recipes require that you cook some beans (butter beans,
red kidney, garbanzo) in advance. Cooking beans takes around 3 hours and it can
be done in advance or every few weeks and the rest get frozen. Soak beans for
24 hours before cooking them. After the first boil, throw the water, add new
water and continue cooking. Some beans or lentils can be sprouted for few days
before cooking and that helps people with stomach problems.

the cheese, stirring until well combined. Add sauce to broccoli mixture; and
stir gently until combined.
Put mixture in a
small casserole dish oiled with some coconut oil. Sprinkle with remaining
cheese. Bake at 400° for 50 minutes or until mixture bubbles at the edges and
cheese begins to brown. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Serve with
large Fiber Loaded Salad with Italian Dressing.

Appendix A









My Life story and how I discovered a
Superfoods Diet
 
If you're an
experienced, overweight yo-yo-er, you have to accept the following facts:
• You can't
change your nature and your obsession with food
• You can't
control your appetite
• You can't
control the size of your food portions
• You can't
control your eating habits 
If you are
overweight, at least one of these things is off-balance, which is enough to
cause your weight problems. Let's face it, if you have yo-yoed with your weight
more than a few times in your life, there is no hope for you. Read that again:
there is no hope for you. You have to make peace with yourself; you have
to accept the fact that there is no hope for you and you have to accept the
fact that you are not capable of solving your weight problems by yourself. You
need help. 
This book
deals with core reasons of the Yo-Yo Nations weight problems. It describes
issues people have while dieting and it offers solutions for every issue. 
Here's how
it all started.
I had some
life-changing experiences in 2009 and that led me to start re-thinking my
eating habits and my current lifestyle. Basically, I got scared to death, and
that moved me. My blog and this book would not exist without my dieting
mistakes, so bear with me and you will get slowly introduced to Superfoods. I
wish that I had been clever enough to see my health disaster coming, but I
wasn't, although I always thought of myself as being very smart. I was healthy in
2009, and I was overweight, but it was nothing too dangerous. At least that is
what I thought. 
One morning
in February 2009, I woke up with a back pain (again). Usually, back pain in the
morning had been a sign for me that I'm over-overweight again and that I needed
to go on a diet. I was 38 at the time, weighting more than 275 pounds (125
kg.). I would run out of breath by just walking up the stairs. When it came to
running around and playing with the kids, I was overheated and over-exhausted
after only a few minutes. I had gotten to the stage where, when I was sitting
on the bed in the morning, if I had to put my socks on, I had to get up and
lean against the wall and do it or I would have to take a breath before I would
lean over to put my sock on. I started to hate myself and felt disgusted with
myself, too.
Like me, you
have probably spent lots of money on diet books, exercise classes, fitness
DVDs, gym memberships and maybe even weight loss pills. You have probably lost
some weight along the way, but always seem to end up back at square one. I
didn't want to go that route again.
I said to
myself, "Hey, you're only 38, but you look like shit and you started to feel
like an old man." And then, one morning, very early, while I was in half sleep,
I suddenly understood everything and I had a solution for my problem. By trade,
I'm a software engineer and my job is to solve someone else's problems, so I
tried to apply the same approach to my problem. I knew that I couldn't change
my eating habits when I wasn't on a diet and I knew that sooner or later I
would get so busy and distracted that I would not have the mental strength to
continue to pay attention to what I eat. And I was stuck with that problem. But
a few days later, I solved the problem in my sleep!
I accepted
the fact that I could not change my appetite, that I couldn't control myself
when it came to food and that I would be cycling my weight all my life. My
usual full cycle was half a year, sometimes a year, if I was lucky. I would
successfully go on a diet (usually around spring time), stick with it for 2-3
months at the max, lose some weight, pay attention to what I ate for another
few months, and then somehow I'd just get distracted and slip into my old
eating habits. And after a few months, everything got piled back. 
So, I
accepted the fact that there was no hope for me. I made peace with myself about
that. I also accepted the fact that I would cycle my weight for the rest of my
life. And at the end, I decided to spare myself of future despair and
disappointments and decided to cycle my weight every day. 
Yes, that
was the solution for my problems! Or at least this is what I thought at that
time. I'd shorten the full cycle of dieting and going back to eating "regular
food" from 6 months to one day. I knew that I couldn't control my
appetite; I was and I will always be obsessed with food. But, hey, can I
control the size of my food portions or the amount of food I eat in a certain
period? After yo-yoing for so long, I just knew that I couldn't control it. I
mean, I could have a regular portion of food, but less than 2 hours later, I'd
be hungry again. And then, I would over-snack until the next meal, which I
wouldn't skip. (That is a common problem for overweight people, they either
can't control the size of their portions or they eat between meals.) So, my
wisdom told me that this practice goes to my "cannot change" list. You're
probably thinking, Hey, this guy just admitted that he can't control his
appetite and the amount of food he eats, so is there a chance for someone like
him to lose weight and maintain it throughout his life? Let's explore this
idea some more.
Could I change
something, like the type of the food I ate? Yes! I knew I could! I was
successful in doing low carb diets, so I knew that I could change the type of
the food I ate, at least for some time. I was not successful at low-fat diets
that restricted the amount of food; I was always hungry and nervous. So, I
tried the Atkins diet and it worked great for me, although I had all the
possible side-effects of it. When my friend doctor saw me after one of the low
carb diets, he couldn't believe his eyes. But when I told him how I lost
weight, he was shocked. He kept explaining that cutting carbs too much can be
very dangerous for my health, that it was plain stupid to go through the induction
phase of the Atkins diet. Going on a diet that restricts any type of food is
dangerous, but completely cutting out one very important type of food is as if
you were about to start your exercise program after years of inactivity, akin
to deciding to apply a training that a professional athlete does every day in
the middle of the training (e.g. running repeat sprints or doing 100+
push-ups). You wouldn't approach your exercise program this way, would you? You
wouldn't try to extremely shock your body, would you? Why would you then
approach dieting by completely cutting out one type of food, even if you know
it's dangerous and it has side-effects?
Before 2009,
I was an average weight loss yo-yoer, with 2 highlights to brag of. In 1994, I
managed to lose 35 kilos (75 pounds) in less than a year. I came down from 120
kg (265 pounds) to 75 kg (165 pounds). When I think of it now, I know that I
did it in a very stupid way. I wasn't exercising at all and I ate very small
amounts of food. I skipped breakfasts and ate salads with some type of low-fat
protein for lunch and dinner. I remember that I ate tomato and cucumbers in the
summer and sauerkraut in the winter. 
Initially, I
thought to exclude bread and potatoes. These were the only carbs I ate back
then; I ate zero rice and cereals. I also stopped eating anything sweet,
including fruits. I didn't read any books about dieting, I just decided on a
whim to start a diet. Because it went great from the beginning, I didn't think
that I should educate myself about dieting, so I kept eating smaller and
smaller portions, which slowed my metabolism to almost a full stop, which
caused me to lose almost all of my muscle mass along the way. Before that diet,
I had gone the gym for 9 months and I was able to push 55-60 kg on the bench
press. When I finished my diet and went back to the gym, I couldn't push more
than 30 kilos for the first few weeks. I was so embarrassed! That was a lesson
learned the hard way. Even at 75 kilos, I had some stubborn belly fat that I
couldn't get rid of. Being overweight all of my life left a stamp on my body.
A friend who
was on medical studies back then explained that fat cells are 85% fat, with the
remaining 15% comprising the cell nucleus and other cell material. He said that
when I lose fat, the fat cell still continues to exist; it's just has less fat,
but it's still there, dormant and ready to be filled with fat that body stores
when I eat too many calories. Scary to know, isn't it? Later, I read on the Internet
that dieting has its rhythm and that a person loses the weight easiest in the
beginning but that the weight loss gets slower and slower until it
stops. This stop can be prevented with exercising, as your metabolism will
get faster and faster. 
I was able
to keep myself under 100 kg until 2000. I went 4-5 times a week to the gym, ate
protein rich food and yo-yoed between 82 (180 pounds) and 94 kilos (207
pounds). Then, in February 2000, I switched jobs, life got more stressful, and
I stopped going to the gym. 
Within a
year, I was back to over 250 pounds (114 kg). But I was 30 at the time and my
health was good. At the end of 2002 our son was born, and I somehow gained
weight again. I went to over 120 kg (265 pounds). Then 15 months later, our
daughter was born and my weight peaked at 275 pounds (125 kg). But, I had a new
job, much less stress at work, and the Atkins diet was all the rage back then
in 2004. 
I embarked
on the Atkins diet, but this time I was much better prepared. I wasn't
exercising at all, but house chores and being around my children caused me to
be more active. I wasn't worried about muscle loss because Atkins is all about protein,
right? However, I was a little worried about ketosis and whether my brain would
work fine, because brain feeds on glucose, which is the simplest type of the
carbs. When I started the Atkins diet, I had some terrible side effects during
the first few weeks (headache, weakness, tiredness, constipation, bad breath)
and it took me a while to find some sort of food that wouldn't be boring to eat.
The Atkins
diet encourages the eating of fat cheese and fatty processed meats, but I got
bored with them after 2 weeks of eating it daily and I wanted to speed up the
weight loss, so I ate low-fat protein with raw or steamed cauliflower (the "official"
potato replacement). That got boring quickly too, so I educated myself about
carbs that should be counted and fiber that should not be counted and started
to eat a lot of fiber-loaded veggies with lean protein such as boiled eggs,
fish, lean pork, chicken, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, spinach and celery. For
breakfast I ate eggs and every second day either low-fat cottage cheese or
low-fat yogurt with cucumbers and/or celery. 
I even
bought ketone test strips and was happily peeing on them every few days. The extra
weight I carried melted away quickly. After 4-5 months, I lost 30-35 kilos, and
I was at 90 kg (200 pounds). I was really satisfied with the results. I started
to preach the Atkins diet and turned myself into a low-carb Taliban,
proclaiming sugar and carbs as evil things. 
I was able
to keep my weight under 100 kg for almost 3 years, just because I ate a low-carb
office lunch (fiber salad and protein). But after 3 years, my job got stressful
again and I went back to my old eating habits. The extra kilos started to creep
up on me again, and before I knew what was happening, my kids told me that I
was fat. In the summer of 2008 and at the end of February 2009, I had bloodwork
done. I was in the middle of my future diet engineering, but the blood test results
diverted them. 
I found out
that I was suffering from hyperthyroidism. I had elevated levels of TSH
(thyroid-stimulating hormone). Our family doctor explained everything about
hypothyroidism, including the side effects, and then prescribed me some synthetic
hormone pills (thyroxin). She said that this problem was the easiest to handle
and the least dangerous chronic disease that I could have. She also said that I
should learn to live with the side effects and take a pill every day for the
rest of my life. But that was not the thing that scared me to death. I'll get
into that more in a moment.
At first I
didn't know how to react to the fact that I had hyperthyroidism. I read that
it's mostly a female disease. I also found out that I had been experiencing side
effects for a few years; my hyperthyroidism was just not showing on the blood
test results. 
I started to
lose hair, I was tired all the time (I thought it was because I was
overweight), and I read that I couldn't lose weight as easily as before, which
was true. I also noticed that I my memory was poor. 
I decided to
find some natural remedy or anything that could alleviate these side effects.
But as I said, low thyroid was not the thing that scared me. Around the same
time, I got my first hemorrhoid. It was very bad one; and an external one, too,
as I later learned. 
I went again
to our family doctor (a nice older lady in the St. Lawrence district), who
prescribed some ointment. While I was there, she decided to check the veins on
my legs. She learned that I had very expanded external veins. They were buried
in fat, so I couldn't see them, but they were as thick as my thumb. Although I
had occasionally heavy legs and itching in my lower legs, I didn't have any
other side effects.
Since I was sitting
during all of my work hours and I was overweight, it was not surprising that I
got hemorrhoids and varicose veins. That was my second chronic disease
discovered in less than a month! Ugh! The doctor sent me to do some additional
checks and although they found that my deep veins were okay, a vascular
specialist talked to me and told me that I had a lot of small blood clots
hanging from the walls of my veins and that some of them could be released into
my bloodstream and clog some veins.
I knew that
my veins were already clogged because of my weight. I then learned that this
could cause a heart attack, a stroke, or a pulmonary embolism. Scary!

The knowledge
that I could have a stroke or heart attack at any time prompted some serious
diet planning. I wanted my veins unclogged as much as possible ASAP! But this
time I wanted to go on a perfect diet, a diet that I won't even know that I'm
on, and I wanted it to be a lifelong one.
After some
thinking and researching and after examining previous diets attempts, I decided
to continue with a diet plan that was supposed to work for me (going through a
full cycle every day). I wanted to avoid all side effects I had experienced in
my previous dieting efforts. I wanted to include carbs in my diet, too. I also
wanted to prevent future weight cycling. 
I wanted to
have the perfect solution that would allow me to never ever go back to my bad
eating habits that ruined my health. The bad eating habits that I'm referring to
here are eating processed and refined foods, sugary breakfasts (muffins,
donuts), and drinking soft drinks. Fad diets were out of the question. I mean,
I couldn't live on smoothies or steak and eggs for the rest of my life!
I also
decided to examine the mechanism of fad diets and weight yo-yoing and facts
why people cycle their weight, when EXACTLY the cycling starts (when
exactly they drop the ball and why), why it happens, and how long
it takes them to cycle their weight. I wanted to compare those facts with my
own experience. I also wanted to discover why there are so many overweight
people around me and understand the processes behind food intake. 
The thyroid
hormone issue also prompted me to read about hormones in the human body and how
they affect weight loss. I was lucky not to have any blood sugar or cholesterol
issues, but I wanted to find out everything I could about them anyway, because
members of my family had health problems related to them. My brother and my
father suffer from high blood pressure and my aunt (my father's sister) died of
cancer. She was diabetic for last 10 years of her life. 
The last
thing that hit my family around that time was learning that our son had ADHD
(Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). He was born at the end of 2002. In
September 2008, he started primary school. After a few months, we got a call
from his teacher. She explained that he was not focused in school and had all
the symptoms of ADHD. 
A few months
of consultations confirmed that he, indeed, had ADHD. 
My wife
started to search for anything that would help alleviate the symptoms, hoping
that we would be able to avoid giving him Ritalin or other medications. 
A nutrition
search discovered that some foods can fuel ADHD. 
Around the
same time, two of our close friends found out that their 3-year-old son was
autistic. They had already started to take nutritional measures to alleviate his
autism, which included a gluten-free and a casein-free diet. They said that he was
noticeably behaving better since being on that diet. He had lower hyperactivity.
His temper tantrums didn't happen as often. He began making eye contact. Also,
his speech improved. The results were great!
As a result,
my wife and I decided to learn everything we could about the foods that fuel
ADHD so that we could treat our son without medicating him.
When I
started my research, I kept coming across information about high sugar intake,
blood sugar levels, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels, fast food diets
that most Americans are used to, processed foods, ingredients in processed foods,
etc. It turned out that the same foods that were causing my problems were the same
foods that were fueling the ADHD: sugar, processed foods, and refined carbs. 
I then compiled
a list of healthy, whole foods that would help with both my problems and my
son's ADHD. When I started to research each food more closely, I kept hitting
web sites that dealt with Superfoods. When the list was completed, I found out
that all the food from my list were Superfoods. WOW! 
I decided to
list all the "must-haves" for our diets, which include the following: 
• No food type
is to be excluded (carbs, proteins, fats). 
• Snacks
must be included, as I knew I'd be snacking throughout the day. 
• Fruits
must also be included, even though they're mostly forbidden by low-carb
diets. Plus, I like fruits. They're full of vitamins and antioxidants, and are
healthy.
• Meals
must be regular-sized,
and they should be tasty. 
I wanted to
stop thinking about my diet at all and to have this daily cycling as a part of
my life. I couldn't go my whole life on low carb or low-fat diet and I couldn't
go back to my regular eating habits between diets (I knew that much). 
My first
assumption was that I had to mix a low-carb diet in the morning (at least few
times a week) with a low-carb diet in the evening, and have a regular meal for
lunch, albeit a healthy one for most days in the week. (It had to be a "regular
lunch" and not a "diet" lunch.) Or I'd make my evening meal be a "regular" meal
and my lunch be a low-carb lunch.
These were
my beginning assumptions. Then I went to do some more
research.         











Engineering the Diet
 
While I was
gathering together information about the body's weight loss mechanisms and
metabolism, my research uncovered one very important fact: The amount of carbs
you take in is directly related to the body's starvation mode. 
The way in
which the body reacts to the amount of carbs you digest can have a massive
impact on the way in which you lose and gain weight. My low thyroid problem
meant that I couldn't lose weight as easily or as quickly as I used to. This fueled
my interest about how to speed up my metabolism and which carbs to eat.
Once I was
aware of how important the intake of carbs was to the body's gain and loss of
weight, I started working this into my future diet. When you strategically vary
your carb intake by eating different types and amounts, you can really give
your metabolism a much needed "kick-start." So, I decided to include brown
rice, quinoa, buckwheat and oatmeal in my diet (all non-gluten), together with
carbs from veggies and fruits. We were already eating brown rice as our main
starch for lunch and dinner, and I was snacking on cooked buckwheat in my
office before noon. And I had oatmeal breakfasts occasionally anyway. I
decided to go with oatmeal because it doesn't contain gluten and keeps me
fuller longer than other cereals do. No one in my family is allergic to gluten,
but, because of my son's ADHD, we already tried to lower our gluten intake.
This
combination of carbs would increase my metabolic rate while dieting so that I could
avoid falling into a counter-productive "starvation mode." The reality is -
every diet that restricts carb calories over the long term can cause metabolism
slowdown. At best, if you preserve with these diets you'll end up sacrificing
muscle mass rather than actual fat. I was determined to find out how I could
speed up my metabolism rate, because of the diet and because of my low thyroid.
After I set
some rules about what I wanted to have in my diet, I went to work on the
details. Snacking in-between was the easiest part; I'd have at least an apple
and a carrot once a day, and some type of citrus fruit (orange or grapefruit)
accompanied with a few nuts (such as 4-5 almonds) or a cup of cooked buckwheat.
The apple or orange could be substituted with any other fruit that is in season
(berries, pomegranates, melons, apricots), with the same serving size as an apple
or orange. If still hungry after eating fruit and a few nuts, I'd fill up with
the regular low carb snacks like raw celery, broccoli, cauliflower or any high
fiber, low carb veggie (more on those later). 
By the way, when
eating apples, don't peel them; the apple's skin contains soluble fiber called
pectin, which puts hunger to rest while lowering your blood sugar levels,
making you less likely to reach for additional snacks. You're also less likely
to binge on sugary or calorie-dense foods when your blood sugar is steady.
Since I was always thinking of pizza and cake while on my old diets, I wanted
to make sure that I would be doing everything I could to keep my blood sugar
steady while on my new one. By keeping my sugar levels steady, I'd be less likely
to crave these foods... if I craved them at all!
Foods that stave
off the hunger the longest are protein foods, followed by foods chock-full of
fibers. I learned this after several Atkins diet cycles. My protein was always
accompanied with a huge fiber-loaded, low-carb salad (spinach, shredded
cabbage, lettuce, raw cauliflower, raw broccoli, cucumber). The typical
dressing I used was a combination of olive oil, lemon, minced garlic and salt
or plain, low-fat yogurt or buttermilk with olive oil, minced garlic and salt.
The amount of olive oil I used was usually 1 teaspoon and the rest was added to
taste. Occasionally I would add a teaspoon of mustard or some herbs like basil,
oregano, marjoram, chives, thyme, parsley, dill or mint. With all these options,
I had many different dressings to choose from! It was crucial to vary salad
dressings every day because the main pillar of my successful dieting was a large,
fiber-loaded salad with dressing (or steamed veggie or stir fried veggie) and
protein on the side. This was supposed to become the main pillar of my future
diet (in the weight loss phase). 
I decided to
eat one such "salad-and-protein" meal every second day for dinner, switching it
with stir-fry with a low-fat protein and some fiber-loaded veggie. With so many
options of veggies to include in a salad or stir-fry, and with so many dressing
options and so many options for proteins on the side, eating should never get
boring. 
Studies have
shown that consumption of fiber-loaded, leafy greens leads to healthier,
longer, disease-free lives.  The greens are loaded with all sorts of
nutritious compounds, such as vitamins, minerals, fiber, polyphenols, folate
and various carotenoids. Most important to me was the fact that they would
keep me full without containing too many calories. All these phytonutrients,
vitamins and minerals were just a great bonus for my health.
I decided
that most of the fat in my diet would come from olive oil, salmon, flax, nuts,
and seeds because they're supposed to be great for my veins. I was already
using olive oil in my salads, my family ate salmon once a week already, and we
were also already eating flax in our meals. A small amount of the fat in my
diet would have to be a saturated fat of animal origin, found in lean meats,
eggs and low-fat dairy products, but I wasn't worried too much about the extra
calories because it wouldn't be a large amount of fat.
Because I am
a gourmet cook and I like to eat fatty meat once in a while, and because I
decided to exclude fatty red meats and fatty cheese because of my the problem
with my veins, I started to have a grilled salmon fillet at least once a week.
Salmon is fatty, but loaded with good Omega 3 fat. Most animal fats are
composed of saturated fats, which are the most dangerous types of fat. 
Consumption of saturated fats raises cholesterol levels and elevates the risk
of heart disease and cancer.  
Because I'm
a huge fan of beans and other legumes, I included them in my diet at least once
or twice per week. They sometimes caused stomach discomfort (mostly when cooked
without presoaking), but they didn't cause any other problems for me. Plus,
they're full of antioxidants. If you have stomach problems with legumes, soak
them for 24 hours or sprout them and your problems should disappear.
At the very
end, I decided to have 2 versions of the diet: one that would make me lose
weight and one that would allow me to maintain it.











Enter the Superfoods
 
When I had a
final list of foods that would likely allow me to lose weight, and keep that
weight for years, I decided to Google all of them to check all their benefits
and make sure that I'd get all necessary vitamins and minerals from them. I
wanted to avoid any supplements (if possible) and I wanted to check whether I'd
have any side effects due to a lack of missing minerals or vitamins. I also
wanted to check whether or not I should exclude some of them because of
something bad. I learned that goitrogens (substances that suppress the function of the thyroid gland) found
in raw, cruciferous veggies are bad for those with a low thyroid if eaten in
excess and if iodine intake is low at the same time, because a goiter might
result. I also learned that nightshade veggies cause arthritis problems for
some people, and that legumes can cause stomach problems.
After
meticulously checking each food on my list, I decided to call this diet a Clean
Foods Superfoods Smart Carbs diet. Most people associate the term Superfoods
with some sort of exotic berries, like the Acai berry, the Goji berry, or the Noni
berry. These berries are great - they're full of antioxidants - but you can't
live on them. So when you hear me say "Superfoods," think regular Superfoods,
like spinach, broccoli, quinoa, olive oil, garlic, kale, and salmon... basically
foods that have nothing bad in them and have many health benefits.
I mentioned
earlier that I wanted to have a diet that would keep my appetite and cravings
under control. Some people might think that counting calories is all that
matters, but they don't take appetite and cravings into equation and I
wanted to make sure that I didn't have any cravings. Think about it: What
chances you have to shed successfully off some pounds if you're hungry all the
time and you can't take pizza and chocolate bars off your mind? Zero! It is
much easier to be on a diet when you're not hungry all the time and when you
don't have cravings. How can this be achieved? By switching to Superfoods!!
Switching to Superfoods will change your palate, it will clean your body of
toxins, and it will stabilize your insulin sensitivity and blood sugar level. That
is half of the job!! 
Glucose
drives insulin. Insulin drives fat. Fatty acids will not be released into the
bloodstream to be used as energy if your glucose level is high. If you eat a
diet that causes your blood sugar to be frequently high, all energy you consume
that is not immediately needed will be stored in your fat cells and will not be
released. You will not get to use all of the 700 calories you eat at one meal,
only the 100 or so you need immediately, and thus you will soon be hungry
again, and will over-eat. But if your blood sugar is stable and you can
access that stored energy you will not be hungry and you won't over-eat. It
doesn't matter if you are eating fat or glucose; your body will convert what
it's got to what it needs. Every major nutritional philosophy pegs sugar as
being a major problem. Circulating saturated fatty acids found in the blood
(known as triglycerides in the lipid panel), are indeed a major risk factor in
heart disease, but the majority of these saturated fatty acids are almost
without exception the result of liver secretions, and are the consequence of a
diet that is high in refined carbohydrates. 
Some people
are more sensitive to the hormonal effects of insulin and cortisol than other
people are. The more sensitive you are, the more you're likely to get fat.
Insulin is the primary hormone that fixes fat in the fat cells. This is why
Type I diabetics lose weight: they're not producing enough insulin. Since
insulin is manufactured in direct response to carbohydrates, if you don't eat carbohydrates,
you won't have a mechanism by which to store fat. 
Since Superfoods
are whole foods and completely opposite of processed foods, switching to Superfoods
will have a double effect on your body. You will stop eating
processed foods, meaning you'll have zero intake of any chemicals,
additives, food colorings, flavor enhancers and all other nastiness found in
processed food. You will also stop ingesting chemicals found in processed foods
and their packaging. Think about how bad plastic can be for your health! Bisphenol-A (BPA) is found in can linings. At the same time, you'll be eating Superfoods
which do not contain any chemicals found in processed food, but contain
phytonutrients and antioxidants. These Superfoods will detox your body. That
detox will regulate your blood sugar level and insulin sensitivity, which will
lower your sugar cravings. After 10-15 days all these changes will result in a
palate change and you won't crave processed food with flavor enhancers. You
will learn to appreciate natural taste of the whole foods. That is half of
the job on your path to a healthier you! 
After that
change, you will feel great and energetic. Your body won't crave the salty and
fatty food you used to snack on, or the sweet and fatty food you used to gobble
up a daily basis. The 280 calories from a chocolate bar and the 280 calories
from a lean protein meat with fiber-loaded salad are not the same. More water and more fiber in your diet translates into a
larger amount of food that will offer you more stretch; you will get fuller faster
and you'll stay fuller much longer, and benefit from the antioxidants,
minerals, vitamins, and phytonutrients you'll get from these Superfoods.
When you
choose the right foods, and understand how these foods react with your body,
you will not have cravings for processed foods anymore. When I started this
diet for the first time, I sometimes thought, Hey, I have lost some weight,
I deserve a treat, so I'll have pizza for lunch or I'll have a small chocolate
bar for dessert, but after a few weeks I realized that I didn't want these
foods, and that I was not craving them at all. I simply stopped eating them, and
I felt much prouder of myself for it.
After 8-9
months on the Superfoods diet, I went from 275 pounds (125 kg) to 195 pounds
(89 kg). This was in the beginning of 2010. I felt great, looked decent, and
decided that any additional weight loss would have to wait for a while. Since
then, my weight went from 195 pounds (89 kg) to 210 pounds (95 kg) and back. 
In March
2014,I decided to try to go under 195 pounds and describe that effort in a
blog. But because I wanted to share everything about Superfoods diet, my
investigation turned into a book. I'm writing this in June 2014 and I'm at 180
pounds (82 kg) and looking to go under 180 pounds in the following months. 
My whole family
felt better because of the Superfoods diet, my wife has lost some weight (I'm
not allowed to say how much!) and her waist line has been perfect ever since. 





UPDATE:
Below are pictures from November 2014, after 3 months of kettlebells training:

 
If you're
preparing yourself for a diet, you need to remove processed foods and sweets
that you have in your pantry and freezer, making sure that you clean from your
fridge the following:
• Any fruit juices, such
as orange or apple juice, as they're considered to be processed foods 
• Any frozen, prepackaged
"low-fat" versions of regular meals
• Margarine
• Any protein / granola
bars - make sure to check the amount of sugar, protein, fat and fiber in it.
Some might be okay as a snack, but they have to have enough protein and fiber
and be low on sugar and fat.
• Any processed meat but
ham without sugar (ham is okay for first one or two weeks)
• Pasta
• Any diet deserts
• Soda drinks, although
diet ones might be okay for first one or two weeks when your body is still
craving sugar
When
I mentioned that switching to Superfoods will have a double effect on your
body, you can look at that fact from another perspective: your ability to avoid
health problems. Basically, there are really only 2 health problems, toxicity
and deficiency. These conditions can lead to vast array of diseases (actually
symptoms of toxicity or deficiency). 
Toxicity is a
bigger problem than deficiency with modern American diets. Processed food is
toxic. Toxicity is a state of being infested and overwhelmed with materials
that are known to cause problems in the body, specifically to the central
nervous system. The body has filtering systems that enable it to deal with the
toxins that it is exposed to. However, when these systems become overloaded,
toxins can accumulate in the body and cause hundreds of different symptoms that
lead to chronic disease. Toxicity combined with nutritional deficiency is a
recipe for disaster. Our bodies need good nutrition to be able to rebuild and
repair properly.
If
the body has the right supplies or materials it can heal itself of almost
anything. If you are toxic, you can cleanse.  If you are deficient, you can
replenish.  Processed food is toxic. Superfoods cleanse. Superfoods replenish
any deficiencies. Clearly, Superfoods are the solution.











Superfoods
and Disease Prevention
 
Introduction












Superfoods and Hormone Imbalance
 
In addition
to the many benefits of Superfoods that have already been mentioned, consuming
Superfoods will also fix most of your hormone imbalance... if you have one.
I have a low
thyroid. Side effects of this are tiredness, weight gain, difficulty losing
weight, and an intolerance to cold. Since I changed my diet and switched to Superfoods,
I can report that I feel much better, I have more energy, and I'm losing weight
without any problem.
Processed
food can disrupt your hormone balances, causing your metabolic rate to be
decreased, meaning that you might frequently over-eat because the mechanism
that should signal that you ate enough is not working properly. Your natural
mechanisms for fat burning might be disrupted because of hormone imbalances.
You might
not be gluten-intolerant, but you should think about excluding whole wheat for
a while, just as a test. Even if you're not having gluten intolerance, you
might be better off with some other whole grain food. 
Refined
grains are a high glycemic food. They stimulate the production of insulin -
your body's fat-storing hormone. The more bread, pasta, cereal and flour you
consume, the more likely it is that you will be overweight.
Even if you
switch to non-gluten food, remember that most commercially prepared gluten-free
foods are no better than their "super-gluten" counterparts. Most of these foods
are highly processed and contain chemicals and preservatives. Gluten-free
packaged foods, such as bread, pasta, cookies, crackers and cakes, typically
have just as high of a glycemic index as their wheat-based counterparts (e.g.
they use refined rice flour).  Basically, they harm your blood-sugar
regulation system just as much as wheat does. The same goes for make-at-home
baking mixes. Not to mention the bread and dessert recipes on most
"gluten-free" food blogs.
I'm using
quinoa/brown rice/oatmeal/buckwheat (all non-gluten food and all
non-commercially prepared) as the whole grains that are a part of my diet.
Whole grains are low on the glycemic index, meaning they are absorbed slowly
and can help you feel full longer. If you switch to whole grains, it should
help with fixing your hormonal imbalance and you won't feel hungry during the day.
More on wheat and gluten later.














Superfoods
and Heart and Vascular Diseases
 
I'll list
some reasons why the Superfoods diet can prevent heart diseases, including
vascular diseases. 
The basic Superfoods
oil is olive oil, which is heart-healthy because it is rich in
polyphenols.  Polyphenols have antioxidant characteristics and studies have
shown that they reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and lower
blood pressure. Olive oil also contains antioxidants in the form of vitamin
E. As an antioxidant, vitamin E counteracts free radicals just before they hurt
or kill fat cells. Olive oil is one of the number one resources of
monounsaturated fats that assist reduced cholesterol and help lessen
inflammation. Monounsaturated fats maintain your heart's fitness by reducing
bad and total cholesterol, battling inflammation, and improving levels of good
cholesterol. The FDA authorized a health claim for olive oil that says that the
monounsaturated fats you will get from having 2 tbsp. daily might decrease the
danger of coronary heart disease. Avocado oil is also an awesome choice, as are
avocados, but only eat one-quarter daily if you are aiming for weight loss.
One of the
main reasons that the Superfoods Diet stimulates heart health is the simple
fact that it is a diet that is low in saturated fat. I am referring to
saturated fat coming from hydrogenated oils, rendered animal fats, fat dairy
products (cheese, creams), processed meats, shortening, fatty burgers, and
hidden fats located in cakes, cookies and muffins. The Superfoods diet includes
the consumption of healthy amounts of monounsaturated fat through usage of
olive oil, salmon, flax seeds (rich in Omega 3 and Omega 9) and other nuts and
seeds. The human body, in fact, does require the intake of fat on a day-to-day
basis and you should never even think of going to a completely fat-free diet.
The best type of fat to consume is monounsaturated fat. Some amount of
saturated fat is also included in the Superfoods diet. It is found in lean meats
(pork and beef), eggs, and low-fat cheese. Another source of saturated fat is
coconut oil, but the saturated fat found in coconut oil is much healthier than
the one found in meats. 50 percent of the fat content in coconut oil is a fat
hardly ever found in nature - lauric acid. Lauric acid is an effective virus
and bacteria destroyer, and coconut oil has the most lauric acid of any
material on Earth. Another reason why the Superfoods diet promotes heart health
is because of the inclusion of significant amounts of fruits, vegetables and
smaller servings of legumes.
Saturated
fat from the animal source raises "bad" blood cholesterol levels, which are a
sign of possible heart disease and stroke. Monounsaturated fat does not
increase blood cholesterol levels. When consumed in moderation, monounsaturated
fat gives the body the element it needs for correct functioning and in general
good health.
Arterial
rigidity (arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis) is accountable for most
cardiovascular incidents. It is the leading predecessor of stroke and
myocardial infarction, two of the major causes of death in many high-income and
middle-income nations. Consuming foods that are high in saturated fat can also cause
plaque to build up within the walls of the arteries. When this takes place,
your artery walls will solidify and your heart will have a difficult time
moving blood through your body. Clots might form alongside the walls of your
artery, making it harder for your blood to move through it. Arterial rigidity
might also result as a complication of a number of medical conditions such as
diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. 
Here are a
few of the problems that might arise as a consequence of arterial stiffness:
• Tissue
death. Arterial rigidity prevents the supply of blood and nutrients to the
tissues and might cause harm and tissue death.
• Pulmonary
embolism. Arterial rigidity may cause pulmonary embolism if a clot moves to an
artery in your lungs. This condition can be deadly and will call for emergency
treatment.
• Aneurysms.
In many cases, arterial plaque accumulation is triggered by the decline of the
walls of the arteries and might result in the development of an aneurysm (an
irregular widening of a section of the artery). Ruptured aneurysms can be
lethal so it is best to prevent them while you can.
Think about
these problems when you have been served foods that are high in saturated fats,
and instead eat foods high in Omega 3 fat. To me, olive oil tastes as great as
bacon or any other type of animal fat, but it is much healthier.
Omega-3s can
keep your skin soft, prevent acne and skin inflammation, delay the aging
process, and help you lose or maintain weight. Incorporating enough omega-3s
(found in salmon, flax, walnuts, fish, enriched eggs, enriched milk, etc.) into
your diet can also help keep your blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels
in check to avoid diabetes, heart diseases and stroke. It can also reduce your
risk for arthritis, osteoporosis, emotional and mental disorders (ADHD,
depression, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia) as well as
several forms of cancer (such as breast, colon and prostate cancer). Women can
benefit a lot from a high Omega-3 intake, too. It relieves menstrual pain and
cramps, it can enhance fertility, it can reduce the risk of premature birth,
and it can reduce severity of post-menopausal symptoms.
Vitamin K2
is found in leafy greens and is definitely good for you. One Dutch study
reported in the Journal of Nutrition in 2004 that individuals with the high
vitamin K2 intake had an astonishing 51% reduced risk of heart attack death
rate and a 26% reduced risk of death from all reasons in comparison to those
consuming the very least vitamin K2.  The study determined that high
vitamin K2 consumption decreased arterial calcification. 
Vitamin K2
also helps prevent Arthritis. A study not too long ago published by the
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) has
disclosed that elevated intake of vitamin K2 might decrease the risk of prostate
cancer by 35 percent. Foods high in vitamin K2 are farmer's cheese, eggs,
chicken breasts, and ground beef.









Fibers
 
The real
secret behind my weight loss and maintenance of my lowered weight is my
discovery of fiber-rich foods and bitter foods and what they can do for me as
an experienced yo-yoer. Dieting properly with fiber-rich foods is not just about
being fuller because you ate a lot of fiber, it's about sugar level change, it's
about insulin sensitivity change, it's about phytonutrients and antioxidants, and
it's about the thermogenic effect. Essentially, it's a 6-in-1 Superfoods deal! 
Also, fibers
reduce inflammation, lower cholesterol and regulate bowel function. They also
may lower your risk of developing hemorrhoids! In the beginning, I noticed that
I could eat it as much as I want without incurring a high calorie intake. It's
almost like a "free" food; one that you're allowed to eat anytime you're
hungry. Most people will think, How eating a spinach-and-shredded-cabbage
salad can be tasty and exciting? I'm here to tell you it can be; just add a
pinch of sea salt, 1 tsp. of olive oil and some lemon. Suddenly, your salad
will taste heavenly! This is also due to the palate change that comes after you
stop eating processed food and suddenly discover that bitter foods actually
taste great. By adding low-fat yogurt or buttermilk, your salad will be even
tastier. Add any lean protein and you're eating the healthiest meal on
the planet! 
Dietary
fibers are found in the plants that we eat. They are parts of the vegetable
that do not break down in our bellies, and instead pass through our system
undigested (just like with cows eating grass). Dietary fibers are either
soluble or insoluble. Both kinds of fiber are similarly significant for health
and digestion, and for preventing conditions such as heart disease, diabetes,
diverticulitis, obesity and constipation. Soluble fiber dissolves in water.
Insoluble fiber doesn't. These differences govern how each fiber works in the
body and benefits your health. 
Soluble
fibers draw in the water and form a gelatinized substance that decreases
digestion. Soluble fiber delays the emptying of your stomach and will make you feel
full, which assists in weight control. Reduced stomach-emptying might also
impact blood sugar values and has an advantageous impact on insulin
sensitivity, which helps control diabetes. Soluble fibers also help lower LDL
(''bad") blood lipids by interfering with the absorption of dietary
cholesterol.
Sources of soluble fiber: lentils, apples, beans,
oranges, pears, oat bran, strawberries, flaxseeds, nuts, dried peas, cucumbers,
blueberries, celery, carrots, oatmeal and oat cereal.
Insoluble
fibers are considered good for the gut because they have a laxative result and
add substance to the diet, helping avoid constipation. These fibers do not
break down in water, so they move through the stomach relatively intact, and
accelerate the passing of the food and waste through your gut. Insoluble fibers
are mostly found in vegetables and whole grains.
Sources of insoluble fiber: broccoli, dark
leafy vegetables, celery, cabbage, carrots, brown rice, zucchini, onions,
tomatoes, cucumbers, green beans, seeds, nuts, grapes, and whole grains.
Eating
high-fiber, nutrient-dense veggies gives you a wealth of health-boosting
antioxidants and helps you feel full longer. You also get the
powerful metabolism-boosting effects of the fiber-loaded food itself. This diet
is low in calories and high in fiber and - above all - safe (unlike some
high-protein diets). 
This diet
will:
• Promote healthy and
fast weight loss
• Eliminate excess fat
• Detoxify your body
• Rest your system
• Stop cravings
• Break sugar habits
• Increase your willpower
• Boost your self-confidence
• Regain your energy
• Boost your immunity
• Develop a positive mental
attitude
• Regain a youthful appearance

• Create a positive lifestyle
change
• Promote longevity
• Promote healthy eating
habits for your kids











Superfoods
that Prevent Cancer
Any antioxidant-rich
food will protect you from getting cancer. Top antioxidant foods are:
• Beans (small red bean, pinto, red kidney)
• Blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, and
strawberries (in that order)
• Artichokes 
• Cranberries and sweet cherries
• Prunes and plums
• Apples
• Pecans
Any vitamin-E-rich
food will protect you from cancer of the stomach, colon, lung and liver, as
well as other cancers. Add vitamin E-rich foods like almonds, cooked spinach
and sunflower seeds to your diet; they'll help keep your cell-defense system
strong.
Beta-carotene is a
powerful antioxidant. A diet high in beta-carotene (found in orange-colored
foods and leafy greens) implies a reduced risk of cancer, particularly of the
stomach, lung and colon. 
Low vitamin
D levels have been linked to several types of cancer, including breast and
colon. Scientists say that vitamin D may help block the growth of blood vessels
that feed growing tumors and help stop the growth and spread of cancerous and
precancerous cells. Eat plenty of vitamin-D-rich foods, such as wild salmon,
and choose vitamin-D-fortified dairy products, such as yogurt, for example. 
The only
supplement I take is Vitamin D, all other vitamin and mineral needs are
provided by the Superfoods diet. There is just not enough vitamin D in food and
that is the only supplement I recommend. Some people want to boost their
antioxidants intake and therefore take some additional supplements (such as Acai
berry supplements), which is fine.
Omega-3 fatty acids
may prevent cancer by inhibiting cancer cell propagation and disrupt steps that
are critical to cancer growth. Omega-3 fatty acids also help decrease
inflammations and cellular mutations. But even if Omega-3s don't directly
reduce the risk of cancer, they surely keep our bodies strong and healthy. In
addition to fatty fish, mixing ground flaxseed into yogurt and/or smoothies (or
about just anything) is a great way to include more Omega-3s in your diet. I
always add flax meal to any stew I make - to cooked brown rice or quinoa or
buckwheat.
Turmeric is a yellow-colored
spice found in curry powder. Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric,
functions as both as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and it helps prevent
liver, breast, colon, stomach and lung cancer. Using curry powder to spice up
dishes is an easy way to include it into your diet - and it has the additional
bonus of adding flavor to your meals, almost without any calories. Black pepper
enhances the absorption of curcumin by 2000%, so always add some black pepper
to turmeric dishes. I love turmeric as a spice and I love curries. But I can't
eat curry every day. So I settled for a turmeric supplement.
Cruciferous
vegetables. All plant foods contain small amounts of phytonutrients,
which are natural chemical compounds that are just as significant as vitamins
and minerals for maintaining good health. There are thousands of known
phytonutrients (and probably thousands of those unknown), many of which have
demonstrated the potential to protect us against cancer. Cruciferous vegetables
such as broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage contain phytonutrients, which
may help inhibition of the metabolism of certain carcinogens and stimulate the
body's production of detoxification enzymes.
Green Tea contains
compounds that scientists say may help in stopping the growth of cancer cells
and stop cellular mutations that contribute to cancer development. Green tea
drinkers have also been shown to be at reduced risk for ovarian, colon, breast,
prostate, and lung cancers. All types of tea (green, black, oolong, and white)
seem to have value as cancer-preventive agents, so regularly drink tea and
enjoy all the benefits!
Pomegranates are full of
ellagic acid, which is also found in berries, and nuts. Ellagic acid
hinders cancer cell growth and deactivates carcinogenic compounds.
Cyanide-containing
vitamin B 17 arrests, encloses, and even prevents cancer. A lack of
intestinal enzymes was the main pathogen for the onset of cancer. Vitamin B17
is a natural cyanide-containing composite that provides its cyanide content
only in the occurrence of a particular enzyme group called beta glycosidase.
This enzyme group is found almost exclusively in cancer tissue, which
results in the cancer's failure to survive the cyanide. There are no recognized
harmful side effects of B17 (if taken in small amounts, not more than 15 seeds
per day for adults), and the cyanide in B17 does not affect non-cancerous
cells.
Fruits are
very high in B17. Some fruits are higher than others. The apricot seed is the
richest source of Vitamin B17. Wild varieties of fruits are higher in nutrients
than hybridized varieties. For example, wild cranberries are much higher in B17
than their hybrid counterparts. The list of foods containing B17:
• blackberries, choke cherries
• cranberries, currants
• apple seeds 
• apricot seeds (I'm taking 8 seeds
every day)
• buckwheat
• flax
• nectarine seeds
• plum seeds
• prune seeds
• fava beans
• lentils
• almonds
• spinach
Certain
herbs and spices contain a wide variety of antioxidants. Some spices
such as cloves, turmeric, and cinnamon have 10 times more antioxidants compared to berries. Besides the antioxidants,
herbs and spices can also aid with fat-burning and metabolism-boosting, as well
as the stabilization of blood sugar levels. They also have anti-bacterial,
anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. 
• Turmeric,
ginger, rosemary, and basil are powerful anti-inflammatories.
• Turmeric, cumin, and sage help fight dementia.
• Cumin, coriander, cayenne, and cinnamon help to regulate insulin and
blood sugar.
• Nutmeg, bay leaves, and saffron have a calming effect.
• Garlic, mustard seed, and chicory are excellent for the heart.
• Basil and thyme help your skin become smoother.
• Cinnamon, thyme, saffron, turmeric, garlic, basil, garlic, and ginger
boost the immune system.
• Allspice, coriander, rosemary, cayenne, and black pepper can help banish
depression.









Buckwheat
 
Buckwheat
was a food I tried only once or twice, and I did not like it.  The flavor was
unusual, and the kitchen smelled bad after I cooked it. A colleague from Ukraine
used it every day, but it looked completely different from the buckwheat I
used. She consumed it as a snack and as a principal starch in her lunch box.
The Buckwheat I tried was brown and had an intense taste; hers was pale and
tasted awesome - it had a very simple nutty taste. She explained that I had
used toasted buckwheat, also known as kasha, and that she uses all-natural raw
buckwheat, which is pale green. She showed me an awesome way to cook it, too. 
She would put
4-5 tbsp. of raw buckwheat in a medium-sized thermos bottle, then add boiling
water to it. She'd promptly shut the bottle and wait. After one-and-a-half or
two hours, she would have an awesome batch of cooked buckwheat. 
I decided to
purchase a thermos bottle and use this method to try buckwheat again. When I
did, I discovered I liked it, and since then, my regular, mid-morning office snack
has been 1 cup of cooked buckwheat, totaling only 155 calories! 
•Buckwheat
is gluten-free, is high in protein and fiber, and is a good source of magnesium
and iron.
•Buckwheat
won't cause addiction. No one binges on buckwheat. Truly a cool carb!!
•Buckwheat
is rich in B vitamins as well as phosphorus, iron, magnesium, folate, copper,
zinc, and manganese. 
•Buckwheat
is very high in protein; the protein found in buckwheat consists of the eight
essential amino acids. 
•Buckwheat
is very high in fiber. A single cup of cooked buckwheat, at 155 calories, contains
over 4 grams of dietary fiber. 
•Buckwheat
is a great source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), one of the two essential fatty
acid that is crucial for good health. 
•Buckwheat
reduces glucose levels and is helpful for managing diabetes. 
•Buckwheat
has been found to reduce blood pressure and reduce cholesterol.









Glycemic Index and
Satiety Index
 
The glycemic index (GI) is a rating carried out
on foods that contain carbohydrates and their particular influence on our blood
sugar level. In earlier times, most diets that were supposed to improve blood
sugar assessed the total amount of carbs (such as sugars and starches) in
foods. The GI goes outside of this strategy, looking at the impact of foods on
our blood sugar. Rather counting the total quantity of carbohydrates in foods
in their unconsumed condition, the GI measures the real influence of these
foods on the blood sugar. The GI number ranges between 50 and 100, where 100
represents the standard, which is an equivalent amount of pure glucose.
Low-GI diets have been connected with a reduced
risk of the following: strokes; cardiovascular disease; depression; type 2
diabetes; neural tube defects; chronic kidney disease; metabolic syndrome;
formation of gall stones; formation of uterine fibroids; and prostate, colon,
breast and pancreas cancers. 
Fruits and veggies tend to have a lower
glycemic index. Meat, nuts and seeds, dairy products, beans and spices all have
a low GI. Grains suggested in the Superfoods diet (brown rice, buckwheat,
quinoa, oats) have a low GI. 
Low GI (55 or less):
• small seeds (flax, pumpkin, sunflower, poppy,
sesame)
• beans and nuts (kidney, black, white, pink,
almond, peanut, lentil, walnut, chickpea)
• most whole intact grains (oat, millet, rye,
rice)
• most veggies
• most sweet fruits (mangos, strawberries,
peaches) 
 
Medium GI (56-69):
• not intact whole-wheat or enriched wheat
• basmati rice
• pita bread
• grape juice
• raisins
• unpeeled boiled potato
• prunes
• cranberry juice
• pumpernickel bread
• regular ice cream
• banana
• sucrose
 
High GI (70 and above):
• white bread
• most white rice
• extruded breakfast cereals, such as Corn
Flakes
• glucose
• maltose
• potatoes
• pretzels
• maltodextrins (polysaccharides that are used
as food additives)
• bagels














 
Satiety Index
 
In the mid-1990s, Australian scientist Dr.
Susanna Holt examined the length of time particular foods can stave off food
cravings. The results she found were the same as those I had encountered,
proving that bakeshop goods ARE, indeed, addictive. White bread was given the
baseline rating of 100. Foods that scored higher than 100 are considered to be
more satisfying than white bread and those under 100 are deemed to be less
satisfying. Bakeshop products like croissants scored 47, donuts scored 68, and
cakes scored 65. This is proof that wheat is addictive and that consuming
bakeshop products will make you desire more. 
Foods that have a lower satiety index than
white bread are: chocolate bars, pastries, and cakes - basically, all refined
foods. Foods that were found to have the best satiety index are: oatmeal, eggs,
meats, boiled potatoes, fish, fruits, and veggies.
It was also concluded that the satiety index
(SI) could serve as a useful tool in planning diets for weight reduction or
weight gain.











Thermogenic
Superfoods
 
Thermogenic Superfoods are foods that require
additional calories to be broken down, leading to a raised metabolism and more
calories burned. Thermogenic foods are also very high in fiber, which causes a
person to become fuller faster. Simply because of the low calorie content and
high fiber, thermogenic foods assist in weight loss. Basically, the Superfoods
diet relies on foods that demand more calories to be digested than the exact
caloric value of the food, thus burning up stored fat from one's body. Your body
needs energy for body heat as well as energy to break down the food you eat. A
360-calorie piece of birthday cake may require 90 calories to be broken down,
resulting in a net gain of 270 calories to be incorporated into your fat
storage. On the other hand, a 28-calorie katabolic food may call for 95
calories to breakdown, resulting in a net loss of 67 calories off your stored
fat deposit. Diets based on katabolic nutrients result in impressive weight
losses of the real fat from the body. 
Plant foods that burn more calories than they
contain are:
• celery
• strawberries
• oranges
• tangerines
• carrots
• apricots
• grapefruit
• lettuce
• cucumbers
• tomatoes
• watermelon
• cauliflower
• hot chili peppers
• apples
• zucchini
As you can see, these particular foods are on
the Superfoods main list and all of these foods have plenty of fiber. Many
green veggies are thermogenic foods, particularly the ones that include a great
percentage of water and fiber. Broccoli, cabbage and Brussels sprouts are green
veggies that are common thermogenic foods. Celery is also a great additional
example of thermogenic food mainly because it is primarily made of water and
fiber. The body requires more energy to digest these foods than the quantity of
energy they provide.
Green tea has two significant chemicals -
polyphenols called the catechins and caffeine. Both of these chemical
substances are known to promote thermogenesis. Apart from these two chemicals,
green tea is also high in catechin, also known as epigallocatechin gallate, a
compound that enhances the process of thermogenesis. The gymnemic acid and
cannatic extracts in green tea decreases the assimilation of sugar into your
blood. Green tea also suppresses your body's ability to digest carbs. As you
likely know, sugar and high glycemic index carbs are two of the main factors of
weight gain.
Coconut oil is another example of a thermogenic
food. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) found in coconut oil hold off the
buildup of fat in the body. Coconut oil, therefore, promotes thermogenesis. A
British study has discovered that adding chili and MCT (coconut oil) to meals
boosts thermogenesis by over 50 percent. With time, this practice may cumulate
to help promote weight loss and restrict weight gain. 
Eating ginger has anti-hypertensive,
glucose-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and stimulatory effects on the
gastrointestinal tract. 
Cinnamon is a thermogenic spice that assists
and influences blood sugar levels. A suggested daily consumption of 1 g of
cinnamon in individuals with type 2 diabetes has been discovered to reduce
blood sugar, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol
levels.
A protein-rich diet is recognized as an enhancer
of the thermogenic process (unlike high-fat or high carbohydrate diets). As an
example, studies show that there is a 6-8 percent boost in energy expenditure
with carb meals, a 3 percent boost with fat, and a tremendous 25-40 percent
with protein-based meals. Lean proteins are an awesome example of thermogenic
foods. Lean proteins are located in foods such as chicken breasts, turkey,
buffalo, lean red meat such as sirloin or top round steak, bison, and other
game meats. Really good sources of lean proteins comes from seafood such as
shellfish and almost every different kind of fish. Some researchers found that
people whose diets consisted of more protein not only increased thermogenesis
(ie. their metabolism), but also enhanced their satiety and assisted in the
maintenance of an all-around leaner body mass. Simply said, it takes a lot of
body energy to digest lean proteins.
Celery is one of the greatest thermogenic
foods. First of all, it is really low in calories, which is why it is a really
popular food for those on a diet. It also helps burn off more calories because
of its thermogenic effect. Celery has a really mild taste that makes it easy to
include in many meals. You can also dip it in low-fat yogurt or low-fat farmer's
cheese toned down with some yogurt for a delicious snack.
Perhaps the most recognized thermogenic foods
are spices such as chili pepper (Capsicum annuum) or cayenne pepper. In
fact, such spices can boost your metabolic rate by 25 percent because they
contain capsaicin, chemical compound that speeds up the metabolism and dilates
the blood vessels. So, if you frequently eat spicy hot dishes, then you are
definitely helping your weight loss. If you can't stand hot food but you want
the capsaicin benefits, you can use a capsaicin supplement.
Hot foods are not the only thermogenic foods.
Consuming ice water can also possess a thermogenic effect on the body. This is
mainly because your body has to work harder in order to deal with the cold
temperature. Nevertheless, make sure that you don't consume ice cold water with
your meals as it can disturb your digestion. 
And don't drink water after eating chili
peppers in an attempt to rid your mouth of the "burn." Instead, drink milk.
Milk contains casein, a protein that breaks the bond between the pain receptors
and the capsaicin. 









Probiotic Superfoods
 
Recently, there has been a lot of fascination
with probiotic foods, thanks to studies signifying that friendly bacteria might
help with or prevent an array of problems, from irritable bowel syndrome to
stomach upset and diarrhea to constant inflammation — the underlying cause of
heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Sauerkraut stays fresh for months and
delivers outstanding health benefits in the form of probiotics and nutrients
that the cabbage in its natural form doesn't have.
All of the research carried out on overweight
people focused on gut bacteria, and the findings revealed higher instances of
"bad" bacteria and reduced levels of probiotics amongst these people.
Keeping the preferred ratio of "good bacteria" to "bad
bacteria" is now gaining appreciation as perhaps the most important step
you can take to defend your health and fat-loss goals.
These are the signs that your digestive
bacterial harmony is beginning to get out of control:
• gas and bloating
• acid reflux
• a failure to lose weight
• skin problems
• overall sickness
• headaches
• constipation and/or diarrhea
• urinary tract infections
• sugar cravings, particularly for heavily
refined carbohydrates
• difficulty sleeping
The perfect healthy ratio of "good"
to "bad" bacteria is 85 to 15 percent, or 9 to 1. To re-balance your
intestinal bacteria ratio and begin experiencing weight loss advantages, you
need to eat more probiotic foods and reduce your sugars, artificial sweeteners,
antacids, processed foods, laxatives, and antibiotic consumption. You can do
this with the following proposed Superfoods: yogurt, any fermented vegetables
(cabbage, cucumbers), kefir, and kimchi. Just make sure that you know the
distinction between "pickled" and "naturally fermented." Pickled means that the
vegetables are preserved in various acidic liquids, commonly vinegar. But these
vegetables are NOT fermented and do not provide the probiotic and enzymatic
benefits of naturally fermented vegetables. Simple home recipe for fermented
vegetables includes salt and water. The process of fermentation produces its
own acidic liquid as a by-product. So, naturally fermented vegetables are both
fermented and pickled. 
Lactobacilli is a bacteria produced in fermentation,
causing the creation of lactic acid, which is what preserves the vegetables. It
also boosts health by improving the vitamin content of the food, by heightening
the nutrient bio-availability in the body, and by preserving and boosting the
enzyme content of the food. It also heightens the digestibility of the food as
well as the cooked foods that are eaten along with it!
Manufacturing preservation of veggies is done
by high temperature and pressure and that damages nutrients. Make sure that you
meticulously check whether the store-purchased, pickled veggies are factory-pickled
or naturally fermented. You will most likely find some naturally fermented foods
in health food shops. In any case, check the description, and if it includes
vinegar, it's most likely fake, since vinegar is used in mass manufacturing.
You can, with ease, make your own pickled products at home; it's quick, easy
and inexpensive. 
Fermented foods are high in "good" probiotic
bacteria, and their intake will help stabilize your total gut bacteria ratio.
The next step is to eliminate pretty much all sugar in your diet. Consuming
sugar-laden foods feeds the bad or pathogenic bacteria - the yeast and fungi in
your intestine - which can have more of a damaging influence on your health
than sugar's influence on blood sugar and insulin resistance. What's more,
artificial sweeteners are worse than ordinary sugar because they have chlorine
that kills off the good bacteria in your intestine just like chlorine kills
microorganisms in swimming pools.
Sauerkraut and kimchee are age-old Superfoods
that are starting to make a comeback mainly because of their unique taste and
advantages of "good bacteria." Fresh cabbage is full of bacteria needed to
lacto-ferment itself. Sauerkraut fermentation is accomplished with lactic acid
bacteria handling cabbage sugar in a process comparable to how yogurt is made.
Just like yogurt, the fermentation process makes cabbage much healthier and
more digestible than the plant is in its primary form. In addition to producing
a naturally-occurring probiotic supplement, fermentation adds other nurturing
benefits as well. Cabbage, in its raw form, includes materials called "goitrogens"
that can block the production of thyroid hormone, but goitrogens are decreased
or eliminated through the fermentation process. This is very significant for
people who suffer from low thyroid. Such people should eat sauerkraut or cooked
cabbage rather than raw cabbage. Sauerkraut is higher in B vitamins than
cabbage, especially in vitamin B12, which makes sauerkraut an ideal food for
vegans. Just as with kimchi, sauerkraut is high in vitamin C and intestinal
enzymes. It is also a great source of all-natural lactic acid bacteria such as
pediococcus and lactobacillus.
If you're purchasing sauerkraut in a container,
make sure that it says "Raw" or "'Unpasteurized" in order to make certain that
it's a "living" food with worthwhile bacteria. Even better, homemade sauerkraut
is an uncomplicated and inexpensive way to get an excellent natural probiotic "supplement"
that won't call for taking any pills, powders or potions.
One of the very best probiotic foods is
live-cultured yogurt, particularly homemade. Search for Greek low-fat yogurt or
check goat's milk yogurt that has been blended with probiotics like
lactobacillus or acidophilus. Goat's milk and cheese are especially high in
probiotics like bifudus, bulgaricus, thermophillus and acidophilus.
Double-check the ingredients list, as not all yogurt is made equally. Some
prominent brands are filled with high-fructose corn syrup, artificial colors
and artificial sweeteners, so they are basically a sweet, unhealthy ice cream.
Choose Greek or plain low-fat as an alternative. If however, you don't like the
taste of probiotic foods, you can use supplements.
The health benefits of probiotics:
• calms colon discomfort following surgical
procedure
• boosted immune system response
• relieves negative effects of consuming many
types of antibiotics
• helps to support healthful skin in youth
• boosts ability to absorb the nutrients from
food
• enhances ability to digest food
• acts as a treatment for bad breath
(halitosis)
• decreases lactose intolerance
• decreases incidence of vaginitis, candidiasis
and yeast infections
• therapeutic for upper respiratory problems
• relieves many common digestive disorders such
as constipation, diarrhea and IBS
• improves ability to absorb calcium
• improves ability to synthesize vitamin B











Bitter
Foods
 
As I have previously said, my taste changed
considerably when I quit eating refined food. It took me perhaps 10-15 days to
observe the change. My sugar urges ended almost entirely. And I learned to
enjoy the bitter taste in coffee, wines, cocoa, and dark green leafy
vegetables. My coffee-consuming habit transformed from double cream and double
sugar to double cream with Stevia throughout my Atkins period, but after I
began the Superfoods diet, it transformed to pure black. My chocolate taste
transformed from milk chocolate to dark chocolate and subsequently to extra
dark (85 percent cocoa becoming the favored one). Also, my chocolate intake
went from 8-12 squares of milk chocolate to 1 or 2 squares of dark chocolate.
My wine-consuming habit modified from Merlot to Cabernet Sauvignon, which I
kind of could not stand previously because of the intense tannins. Now Merlot
tastes dull to me. My cocoa-consuming habit altered from cacao with milk and
sugar to cacao with only a dash of milk and subsequently to pure cacao. I
believed that this would be the last thing that I might have to either sweeten
a little bit or to use a little bit of cream or milk to take the edge off the
bitterness, but, today, I take pleasure in pure cacao with hot water. 
The exact same story can be applied to bitter
greens. I did not like them much before, and I have constantly seasoned them in
order to reduce the bitterness. Bitter greens possess phytonutrients that
assist the liver as it does its job handling cholesterol, detoxifying the blood,
and balancing hormones. Bitter greens are awesome sources of vitamins A, C, and
K as well as minerals such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium. They are also
very high in foliate and fiber and low in sodium and fat. 
The bitter taste is antibacterial and antiviral
so it assists with detox of the body. It also:
• is anti-toxic 
• detoxifies your liver
• kills germs
• assists with skin disorders
• increases the firmness of the skin and
muscles
• decrease fever
• assists digestion and minimizes intestinal
gas.
List of bitter foods:
• burdock root
• Jerusalem artichoke: rich in inulin
(prebiotic), which is a starchy food that is handled by the body in a different
way than sugars and is also high in magnesium, iron, potassium and B vitamins
• bitter melon
• dandelion greens
• arugula
• kale, which contains vitamins,
anti-inflammatory properties, antioxidants and calcium
• sesame seeds
• eggplant
• castor oil
• cocoa and dark chocolate
• dill
• sesame oil
• cumin
• neem leaves
• saffron
• fenugreek
• coffee
• turmeric, which helps detoxify the blood,
replenish damaged liver cells, and fight stomach upset and inflammation
• garden sage (Salvia officinalis) tea, which addresses
disorders of the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, dental abscesses,
skin, mouth, throat infections, infected gums and mouth ulcers, and includes
thiamin, folic acid, pyridoxine and riboflavin











Prebiotic
Superfoods
 
When I first read about prebiotics, I thought
someone made a typo, that it should say "probiotics." However, Wikipedia
offered me some insight: "Prebiotics are non-digestible food substances that
encourage the development and/or activity of micro-organisms in the intestinal
system in ways reported to be useful to health." In other words, prebiotics are
non-digestible carbohydrates that act as "food" for probiotics. Prebiotics help
probiotics grow and remain in your digestive system. 
The established definition by Dr. Roberfroid
is:
"A prebiotic is a selectively fermented
substance that enables specific changes, both in the structure and/or activity
in the intestinal micro flora that confers advantages upon host well-being and
overall health."
Resources of prebiotics include beans, garlic,
raw oats, raw dandelion leaves, leeks, inulin sources (like jicama, Jerusalem
artichoke and chicory root), and onions. Essentially, if you eat raw leeks, raw
onions, or raw garlic, and you add onions to anything you cook, you're definitely
acquiring enough prebiotics. Studies have confirmed evident effects on calcium
and other mineral assimilation, immune system effectiveness, bowel pH, hypertension,
inflammatory bowel problems and intestinal constipation. Prebiotics also reduce
the risk of colon cancer. So, if you add raw onions or raw leeks to all of your
salads and cook with onions, you are all set.
Many people know that the red wine is great
simply because it contains antioxidants and resveratrol. But studies showed
that individuals who drank 2 glasses of dry red wine per day had high levels of
effective bacteria in their gut and low levels of bad bacteria in the
gut. The research concluded that, while the red wine intake reduced bad
bacteria in the gut, it in fact had a prebiotic effect in the gut in that it
reinforced the development of colonies of healthy gut microbes which defend
your health.









How Antioxidants Slow Aging
 
Each part of your body ages. From your bone
tissues to your skin and your brain, what we eat determines how we will really
feel, whether or not we will be healthy, and how long we will live.
We all
understand the hazards of free radicals and how
anti-oxidants eliminate them, right? The antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals
that decrease aging are coenzyme Q10, alpha-lipoic acid, carnitine, vitamins A,
C, D, E, K, essential fatty acids, lutein, many of the B vitamins, magnesium,
phosphorous, zinc, potassium, taurine, iron, and selenium.
Keep in mind, you won't get 3 times additional
advantages if you take 300 percent of recommended daily consumption of any
vitamin, antioxidant or mineral. Don't purchase manufactured food that has been
marked as "rich in antioxidants," and don't believe that relying on
supplements is the very best way to go. Buy local natural and organic whole
foods Superfoods. Eat lots of different fruits and vegetables, nuts, and animal-healthy
proteins every day. Rotate your antioxidants; don't stick to the same fruits,
veggies, and spices. Increasing the intake of one antioxidant won't substitute for
another one. For example, if you absorb 200% of the daily suggested vitamin C
intake, that won't substitute for vitamin B12 or vitamin E for that particular
day. Antioxidants should also come from your eating habits and not from a
tablet. Antioxidants in a tablet are isolated synthetic materials, but fruits
and vegetables have phytochemicals, which we already know are beneficial to us.
Whole foods consists of many various ingredients that function in synergy and
are far more efficient than supplements that just provide one of them.
Antioxidants impact aging in different ways.
Here are some examples of antioxidants and how they slow down the aging
process:
• Coenzyme Q10 - Early aging is the primary
side effect of having too little Coenzyme Q10. A Coenzyme Q10 deficit also
speeds up DNA damage, and because Coenzyme Q10 is beneficial to the well-being
of your heart and muscles, this reduction brings muscle fragility, soreness,
fatigue, and heart problems. Coenzyme Q10 essentially had a strong anti-aging
impact, in the sense that you can maintain youthfulness up until the very end
of life. Coenzyme Q10-rich foods are beef and beef organ meats, sardines,
pistachios, sesame seeds, mackerel, cuttlefish, tuna, herring, yellow tail,
pollock, chicken, and adzuki beans. There are also Coenzyme Q10 supplements
and Q10 anti-aging creams.
• Vitamin D - People with elevated vitamin
D amounts were found to have much less aging-associated variations in their
DNA, as well as decreased inflammatory issues.
• Astaxanthin offers anti-inflammatory and
DNA-protective abilities and helps reduce inflammation. Astaxanthin has been
discovered in microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis. Astaxanthin
is 65 times much more efficient than vitamin C, 54 times more effective than
beta-carotene, and 14 times more powerful than vitamin E.
• Probiotics - Let's first mention the main
reason of bad gut flora in overweight people: high fructose corn syrup. HFCS is
a main element in nearly all refined foods, from snacks and frozen meals, to
dressings to soft drinks. It causes genetic variations and failures that can
cause illness in future generations. Refined, sugar- and chemical-laden foods
actually destroy your digestive microflora. Your gut flora handles your immune
system (your body's all-natural protection system). Artificial sweeteners,
antibiotics, and stress can also reduce the amount of probiotics (useful
bacteria) in your intestines, which can encourage disease and early aging. You
can choose probiotic supplements, but it is much healthier to include fermented
foods such as sauerkraut, kefir and plain yogurt in your diet regime. Yogurt is
great source of iodine and zinc. If, however, you don't like the taste of
probiotic foods, you can use supplements.
• Vitamin B9 and B12 - B9 has a significant
role in the upkeep of DNA integrity and DNA methylation, both of which affect
the size of your telomeres. B9 can be found in leafy green veggies and beans.
B12 is found in salmon, beef liver, lamb, snapper, beef, scallops, venison,
shrimp, eggs, and poultry. If you don't like the B12 rich foods or you are
vegan, you can use supplements.
• Vitamin K2 - K2 is found in chicken breasts,
cheese, eggs, and ground beef. People who take 45 mcg of K2 daily live seven
years longer than people obtaining only 12 mcg per day. If you don't like the
K2 rich foods, you can use supplements.
• Omega-3 - Individuals who have an Omega-3
index of lower than 4 percent age a lot faster than individuals with indexes
over 8 percent. The Omega-3 index is an awesome new way to examine your health.
Force your Omega-3 index over 8 percent if you wish to postpone aging. An Omega-3
index under 4 percent sets you at an elevated risk or danger for a heart
attack. Omega-3 fat acids can invert telomere reducing. If the rate of Omega-6
divided by Omega-3 is greater than 10, your body is in a condition of
inflammation, such as arthritis (a quiet inflammation), or other diseases and
cancers. In order to better shield yourself from cancer, you ought to, ideally,
take this ratio beneath 3. When you've got active cancer, you need bring the
rate to under 1 - in other words, your objective should be to have a lot more Omega-3s
than Omega-6s in your body. Krill Oil is a recommended Omega-3 supplement
mainly because its assimilation rate is much greater than fish oil.
• Magnesium - Magnesium has a significant role
in DNA reproduction, repair, and RNA activity, and it's been disclosed that magnesium
favorably relates with increased telomere length in women.
• Polyphenols are intense antioxidants related
to anti-aging advantages and disease decrease. Resveratrol has been discovered to
be in grapes and red wine, as well as in cacao and green tea, which possess
lots of polyphenols.
• Vitamin A - Telomere extent is related with
dietary consumption of vitamin A. Vitamin
A has a significant role in your immune system.
• Turmeric - Turmeric
is an immune enhancement and acts as an anti-inflammatory, but it's mainly
known for its anti-cancer capabilities.
• Exercise decreases telomere decrease.
In the end, you're most likely questioning
which foods should be eliminated? The answer is the exact same as always: processed
and refined food and sugar. Recognize that overwhelming sugar consumption
brings insulin resistance, which tends to be the origin of numerous (if not the
majority) chronic diseases. So far, scientific researchers have connected
extreme sugar intake to about 78 various diseases and health issues, such as
heart disease and cancer.









Weight Loss-Related
Hormones: Leptin, Ghrelin, Cortisol, Insulin (and Some Others)
 
Weight loss is managed with hormones leptin and
ghrelin, but cortisol and insulin also carry out an important role. The ghrelin
hormone is the "cravings hormone," and leptin is the "hunger
hormone" or the "satiety hormone."  Plenty of leptin speeds
up the metabolism; a reduced level decreases it. Ghrelin amounts go up
considerably before you eat; it indicates hunger. It's important to know that
ghrelin is released by the stomach tissue. Ghrelin then moves down for around 2-3
hours following a meal. Research reveals that reducing levels of ghrelin
results in reduced body fat. The ghrelin hormone encourages the brain to boost your
appetite, but it also encourages the build-up of fat found in the abdominal
region. Ghrelin levels raise after dieting because body wants to go back to a higher
set point. That is one of the causes why fad diets are unsuccessful and why
those on a fad diet yo-yo their weight. The body wants all of the processed
foods that it was missing during the diet; Ghrelin is high all the time and
people go back to eating processed foods with the result of putting all the
weight back on. They didn't reset their set point to a lower value or adjust to
a new weight, they didn't fix their hormones with Superfoods, and so, after a
fad diet, they're back to square one.
Leptin is your food cravings suppressor - the
hormone that indicates to your body that you've had enough to eat. It is a key
player in perfecting weight loss. Numerous foods can either block or boost
leptin. Leptin signals your brain that you have adequate energy stored in your
fat tissue to take part in regular metabolic processes. Leptin is released by
fat cells and the brain should recognize that body has enough fat, which should
mean that body has enough energy stored... but when you eat processed food, there
is a disruption and your brain doesn't recognize the leptin signals. The fatter
you are, the more leptin is secreted. This is a perfect self-regulating
mechanism because the brain should recognize that the body has more than enough
energy stored as fat. However, it is a perfect self-regulating mechanism only
in lean people and people that don't eat processed foods. Their hormonal
signals are fully recognized by the brain and everything works fine. But for
overweight people, these leptin signals are not properly recognized and brain
thinks "Hey, these leptin signals are pretty weak, my body is starving, so let's
store more fat." This leptin insensitivity is also called leptin resistance
and it's primarily caused by inflammations, which are, again, caused by
processed foods. Genetics, environmental factors, stress, and lack of sleep
also contribute to influencing leptin-resistance, to a degree.
When men and women diet, they eat a bit less
and their fat cells eliminate some fat, which then reduces the amount of leptin
created. Then the brain detects starvation. Yo-Yo weight cycling results in
lower leptin. Anytime you are on a fad diet that limits calories, that diet
decreases leptin, increases ghrelin, and enhances your appetite. This seems
like a hormonal snowball effect that hinders weight loss, isn't it? That is why
it is crucial to have the right, wholesome foods Superfoods diet as a component
of your life as soon as you are done with the weight loss period and are on a
plateau. The Superfoods diet reduces calories, but keeps your belly full with
proteins and fibers and that enhance satiety, reduces your hunger (reduces
ghrelin) and fixes your appetite. Consuming 5 meals a day also controls ghrelin
production.
Evolution makes it hard for women to lose fat,
simply because their body is preprogrammed to accumulate fat and energy for housing
babies. 
There are no leptin -abundant foods because our
intestinal tracts cannot process it. But we can enhance our sensitivity to it,
which will help our metabolism to go upward and our cravings to go downward.
Our battle can be aided along by eating protein for breakfast and eating dark,
leafy dietary fiber-rich vegetables and fish for lunch and/or supper. 
Exercising also improves leptin sensitivity. 
Swedish experts have found that thylakoids
found in spinach and some other leafy greens work as a normal appetite
suppressant that controls food intake, inhibits weight gain, and encourages
weight loss. Thylakoids postpone digestion because they attach to fats and
decrease hydrolysis of the fats. They also stimulate the release of
cholecystokinin, which is the primary signal for satiety. Thylakoids also
elevate the leptin amount for up to 6 hours after consuming a meal, and
decrease ghrelin (measured 2 hours after a meal) and insulin.
Foods that reduce leptin sensitivity are - you
guessed it - refined foods. All of them. Carbs are particularly terrible.
Excessive carbohydrates do not only stop the leptin signals; they are also what
we get ahold of when we are truly craving something. The more carbohydrates we
consume, the more we desire them. 
A couple of words about the last portion of
persistent fat that you can't lose, even when we have achieved our ideal weight:

Immediately after you eat, insulin and fatty
acids are elevated. You are in the "fed" condition and there is no fat consumption
going on. Your body relies entirely on glucose oxidation during the hours
following a meal.
As the hours go by, and the nutrients coming
from a meal are utilized, there is a move to fat-burning and usage of stored
fat. This process is mediated by insulin and blood-borne fat acids. The
Superfoods meal plans split meals with carbohydrates for 5-6 hours, which keeps
insulin down most of the time. Because insulin closes down fat-burning, if you
separate carbohydrate meals, that action will bring more fat-burning time. 
As long as insulin is present in your system,
your body will not burn fat. If you want to lose fat, do not eat carbohydrates
3 hours before a workout and don't eat carbohydrates within 2 hours after a workout.
That time will be utilized for fat-burning. The more insulin you have in your
system during workouts, the less fat you'll burn. Insulin transports calories
into tissues, sugar into fatty cells and muscles, and closes down fat cells
from delivering energy for a period of time.
There are usually two releases of insulin. The
first one occurs once the carbohydrates enter the blood, which peaks 30 minutes
after a meal. In the following 3.5 hours, insulin gradually drops in the blood.
Glucagon (which is hormone completely opposite of insulin) starts trickling and
increasing. Glucagon is accountable for fat dripping out of the fatty cells and
being utilized as energy. It also draws sugar out of the muscles for energy. A Glucagon
shot (injection) is provided to diabetics when they feel a sugar drop or feel
faint.
Glucagon and insulin can't be increased at the
same time. Numerous meals containing carbohydrates will keep your insulin levels
increased and there is no opportunity for glucagon to do its fat-loss miracle. 
So, again, divide meals with carbohydrates for
5-6 hours, so glucagon can do the trick. I'm talking about starchy
carbohydrates like oatmeal, brown rice, sweet potatoes and such. Carbohydrates
from other vegetables do not impact insulin levels, so feel free to eat cooked
meats with fiber-packed salads.
When fat acids in blood levels decrease, an
energy shortfall is "sensed" and adrenaline and noradrenaline rise.
Adrenaline and noradrenaline move through blood
and hook up to receptors on fat cells. A receptor can be thought of as a "lock."
Hormones and neurotransmitters are "keys" that are appropriate for that lock
and make things happen. Ordinary fat contains a bunch of beta-2 receptors in
proportion to alpha-2-receptors. B2-receptors are "accelerators" for fat
reduction and a2-receptors are "breaks" for fat reduction.
The ratio between b2-receptors and a2-receptors
controls how easy it is to allow-fat loss from one region of the body. "Easy"
fat has a very good ratio of b2-receptors to a2-receptors, while difficult fat
has a higher ratio of a2-receptors to b2-receptors. Easy fat is on our limbs
and difficult fat is found on our bellies and love handles (in both men and
women) and thighs (solely in women). Women can have up to 5-8 times more a2-receptors
in her hips and thigh fat. Stimulation of the a1 and b-receptors is lipolytic
(causes fat elimination) while activation of the a2-receptor is anti-lipolytic
(blunts fat elimination). Persistent fat areas have a high concentration of a2-receptors,
making it harder for fat meltdown to occur in that area. Stress and sleep also
impact your ability to lose persistent fat. So, make sure that you get adequate
sleep and reduce your stress level as much as you can. Also, eat frequently: 3
meals and 2 snacks per day. Missing meals boost stress. Here is where cortisol
will come into the game.
Cortisol is the stress hormone. It's a crucial
hormone, and is essential for human survival.  Every time your body
encounters any type of stress, your body produces cortisol, which then
initiates a cascade of other physiological responses necessary for your body to
continue functioning.  
You can look at it like a crisis
generator. Cortisol turns "off" many of the regular physiological systems
and turns "on" many short-term physiological systems.
In a regular situation, cortisol release only
lasts for a brief burst of time. Following that, all metabolic functions go
back to normal. But this is exactly where things can go wrong, simply
because in many instances, the stresses that trigger your body to emit cortisol
take place too often and stay "on" for too long.  
When your body encounters constant stress, it
continuously secretes cortisol and that's when cortisol becomes damaging to
your body. Depending on how long and the amount of cortisol you have in your
body, it can really damage your health and change your metabolic processes,
leading to you to gain persistent belly fat! The Superfoods diet
stabilizes cortisol production. When your stress and cortisol levels are
elevated, the body basically resists weight loss. Your body reasons: days are
tough and you may starve, so it holds the fat you eat or current have in your
body. Cortisol takes fat from healthier locations, like your limbs and hips,
and relocates it to your abdominal area, which contains additional cortisol
receptors. 
As a summary, remember this fact: certain belly
fat is natural. Its main function is actually to guard your vital inner organs.
To drop all your belly fat is to oppose nature. This is why it is so hard to
achieve. I have decided to lose weight and not stress personally about few
pounds of the belly fat I might still have. 











Inflammation - A Story about Omega-3 and Omega-6
 
Inflammations are a huge problem in today's
American society. Most of them are induced by refined foods. Inflammations lead
to achy joints, and early aging of the skin and inner organs. They make it
difficult to lose fat. They make you depressive and moody. Omega-6 is the
primary cause of inflammation and, in a perfect world, the proportion to
Omega-3 should be 1:1. Contemporary Western diets typically have proportions of
Omega-6 to Omega-3 in excess of 10 to 1, some as elevated as 30 to 1. The Japanese
diet is the only diet that has the ratio of 4:1.
Excessive Omega-6 fatty acids from vegetable
oils interfere with the health benefits of Omega-3 fats, in part simply because
they compete for the same rate-limiting digestive enzymes. A high balance of Omega-6
to Omega-3 fats in the diet is pro-thrombotic, pro-constrictive, and
pro-inflammatory. Chronic excessive production of Omega-6 eicosanoids is
correlated with arthritis, cancer, and inflammation. Omega-3 fatty acids are
anti-inflammatories and Omega-6 fatty acids are pro-inflammatory. More than
half of Americans suffer from one kind of chronic illness or another. 
Don't buy products that offer you a Omega-3/Omega-6/Omega-9
combination. You need more Omega-3 and Omega-9 and not as much Omega-6 because
you're obtaining enough of Omega-6 from your diet anyway. Organic feed farm
animals have a much lower amount of Omega-6 than farmed animals. It's
straightforward: when the diet of the animals are changed, their meat is
changed as well. Omega-6 is not a wrong fat, we need it, and it's just bad if
you have a great deal of it and not enough Omega-3 at the same time.
A person can think of Omega-3 as a thinning
agent in the blood and Omega-6 as the thickening agent. Fish high in Omega-3
gets Omega-3 from algae. Omega-3 is also located in green leaves. Think of
Omega-3 as a "spring season fat," found in leafy vegetables. It thins our
bloodstream so we can move faster and be more agile. Then imagine Omega-6s as
"fall fats," the ones that are eaten by animals preparing for the winter.
As you can picture, Omega-6 is found in corn, nuts, soy and seeds. All of them
are ready for usage in autumn, just before winter. Think of Omega-6 as a fat
storage space for animals. And THAT is what American people eat during the
whole year - LOADS of high-processed corn syrup and soy oils. Constantly. For
the whole year. If you draw a diagram of the refined wheat, corn, and soy
intake increase in Western society and then draw a diagram of the increase in obesity,
you will see the connection.
How can you change your diet so you consume a perfectly
balanced Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio? Try consuming more Omega-3s (avocado, flax,
salmon, chia seeds, raw nuts), or take Omega-3 supplements and avoid vegetable
oils full with Omega-6. High Omega-6 intakes are associated with a rise of all
inflammatory diseases:
• atherosclerosis
• cardiovascular disease
• type 2 diabetes
• rheumatoid arthritis
• obesity
• metabolic syndrome
• irritable bowel syndrome 
• cancer
• macular degeneration
• asthma
• psychiatric disorders
• autoimmune diseases
Some pro-inflammatory foods found in the
Western diet are:
• trans fat
• processed oils
• sugar
• flour containing gluten
• corn
• fatty meat and dairy
• soy
• alcohol
 
Foods, herbs and spices that have
anti-inflammatory properties are pomegranates, green tea, ginger, turmeric,
garlic, and all foods with a high Omega-3 content.











Superfoods Allergies
 
Note
that some Superfoods can cause allergic reactions in some people (for example, some
Superfoods nuts or the casein in kefir). We are all different and there is no
diet that will fit all people. To find out if you have allergies you don't know
about, get tested. Find out if you are anaphylactic or are lactose intolerant,
for example, and simply exclude the Superfoods that could cause you to have allergic
reactions or inflammations (beans, nuts, dairy). You could also experiment and
exclude some foods for 2-4 weeks and monitor how you feel each week.
 
I
excluded wheat from my family's diet and noticed an instant improvement in my
son's ADHD behavior as well as in my own energy levels. We experimented with
exclusion of dairy products and came to the conclusion that simple, fermented,
non-processed dairy (plain yogurt, kefir and yogurt cheese/ farmer's cheese)
are not causing problems to any of us. Fruit yogurts were terrible for my son's
ADHD, however, due to the additives and food colorings used in them. I stopped
drinking milk because it was causing me some discomfort, but I continued consuming
fermented dairy, such as plain yogurt,  kefir, and small amounts of yogurt
cheese.  If you suffer from milk intolerance, swap yogurt in recipes with
tahini sauce and cheese with hummus, red pepper spread or baba ghanoush.
 
Note
that food allergies and food intolerances are two different things. A food
allergy is caused by a specific food protein, which causes an overreaction when
that protein is ingested. Mild food allergy symptoms are hives, rashes,
swelling, or itching. Severe ones can include breathing problems and, in some
cases, a loss of consciousness.
Food
intolerances generally don't involve the immune system. People with
intolerances are simply unable to digest that particular food. Symptoms of
intolerances include gas, cramps, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea. Celiac
disease is the only food intolerance (gluten intolerance) that does involve the
immune system and causes a reaction in the small intestine. Gluten is found in wheat,
rye and barley.
 









Common
Weight Loss Rules
How can you
make the switch from processed foods to Superfoods? It's simple. Remove all
processed food from your home! Every experienced dieter knows that all
processed foods, refined foods, baked goods, pasta, white rice, sweets, pop,
Cheetos, and similar snacks should be removed from your pantry, fridge, and
freezer, no matter which diet is about to be started. As the saying goes, out
of sight, out of mind!
Eating at
regular intervals stabilizes blood sugar levels and it's necessary to keep eating
snacks 2-3 hours after each meal, to prevent cravings. Eating the right foods
at regular intervals throughout the day keeps blood-sugar levels steady and
hunger at bay. Again, empty your cupboards and fridge of all problematic foods;
you want to make sure that if the cravings appear, you don't have any such food
handy and that you have your "Binge Emergency Kit" available. (More on that
later.) If you have kids, they will benefit if you don't serve them processed
foods. Plan out your meals for the week and stock food that is recommended for
this diet. Again, don't skip meals! Skipping a meal means you will be so hungry
at the next meal that you are likely to over-eat. Not only that, skipping meals
can actually slow down your metabolism, meaning you'll burn fewer calories.
The first
few times I lost weight, I didn't do any exercises. But, with time, I noticed
that I lost some of my muscles, so the last few times I dieted I decided to eat
more protein and exercise at least a little bit in order to prevent muscle
loss. I added a 20-45 minute walk per day and 5 rounds of pushups every second
day to my regimen. That was all that was necessary to prevent muscle loss.
Plus, it prevented the slowdown of my metabolism. There is one more very
important reason why you must include some type of exercise in your life. (More
on that later.)
You're free
to drink coffee, tea, or any diet pop (but only for the first one or two
weeks). Avoid beer and alcohol if you're trying to lose weight and have some only
when you're in weight-maintenance mode. Don't drink fruit juices; it is much
healthier to eat fresh fruit and get vitamins and fibers from them that way. I
drink herbal tea in the morning and have green tea in the late afternoon. Doctors
suggest up to 2 cups of coffee per day, so I lowered my coffee intake from 5 cups
to 2 (morning and 2 pm). Green tea lowers risks of cardiovascular disease,
osteoporosis, kidney disease and cancer. I drink coffee without sugar, but if
you have to have your coffee sweet, use Stevia and avoid aspartame, Splenda,
Sugar Twin, and other artificial sweeteners. I like to drink hot cocoa by
adding one spoon of low-fat, unsweetened cocoa powder to some hot water. The only
thing I use to sweeten this drink is by adding a half of spoon of honey or some
Stevia to it. With time, I got used to the bitterness of one spoon of cocoa in
a cup of boiled water, but sometimes I just like to add some low-fat milk or
half a teaspoon of honey to it.
I used to
eat sweets daily but since I switched to Superfoods diet, my palate changed
significantly and I almost lost my sweet tooth. If I crave sweets, I have a
little bit of dark chocolate or a cocoa drink with a pinch of honey or I mix a
spoon of honey with grounded nuts or seeds and make a small cookie. But since I
eat fruits daily, that seems to be enough of sugar for me. I won't refuse a
birthday cake in Phase 2, but when I go shopping, I never look for sweets,
juices, or condiments that contain sugars.
I also
noticed that I don't crave fried food like I used to. Somehow I got used to
grilled meats, which satisfies my fast-food urge - grilled chicken breast or
pork tenderloin with some grilled eggplant, grilled red peppers and grilled
mushrooms (shiitake), sprinkled with fresh rosemary and a few drops of olive
oil, yummy!! 
Choose your
foods wisely to obtain satiety. For example, if you offer me a choice between a
tomato/peppers/cucumbers salad and a fiber-loaded salad (e.g. shredded cabbage
and spinach), I will choose the latter because know that the fiber-loaded salad
will keep me filled twice as long as the tomato salad. Fiber-loaded salads have
substance and if I pair them with any protein for dinner, they're
able to stave my hunger off until the end of the day.











Why Do Diets Fail?
 
Why do over
80% of people that try to lose weight fail? Why do 40% quit within the first 7
days? Why do 20% quit within a month? Why do only 20% make it to a three month
mark?
The sad fact
is, most overweight people are destined to stay that way, unless they get educated
about processed food, sugar and wheat. Some are stuck in a cycle of yo-yo
dieting, never really committing to a whole-foods lifestyle change involving regular
exercise.
Here's why:
• Most people have very
little knowledge of which foods cause weight gain. This is a major
problem! Most people don't know what processed foods contain, or what the hidden
sugars are. Foods labeled "low-fat" or "reduced fat" aren't always a healthy
choice because they're full of artificial sweeteners, chemicals, and artificial
colors. Read the labels! Learn about the food you eat. Know the difference
between proteins and carbs. Healthy nutrition might not have been taught at
school in your time, so now it's time to get educated. It's your life and your
health... and the health of your children that's at stake! 
• People start a fad diet
which more often than not involve eliminating certain food groups. This is so
unhealthy, not to mention unrealistic for long term weight loss. 
• Most people focus only on
their diet and forget to make sure they get enough night sleep. Most people
also don't include exercising as part of their "diet," either. It's important
to eat well, sleep well, and exercise in order to achieve and maintain weight
loss!
• Some fad diets
eliminate carbs and the body goes into starvation mode, making it almost
impossible for you to resist the urge to eat the food you were used to. Long-term
weight control is a lifetime commitment. Learn how to include celebratory
meals, because they prevent cravings. 
• People see their diet as a
momentary solution, not a lifestyle change. That's why they inevitably return
to their old eating habits. 
• People don't track their
progress. Or they do, but they have unrealistic expectations. You didn't gain
weight overnight, so don't expect to lose it overnight. Don't get discouraged
and abandon the diet. 
• Slow metabolism might a
problem for some people, which means weight loss will occur more slowly. You
burn fewer calories and the diet becomes less effective. Don't get discouraged.
If you have a slow metabolism, pay attention to the advice for how to speed it
up.
• People always have many
excuses. They blame their age, their metabolism, their busy schedule and pretty
much anything else. 
• Some people don't get
moral support from their friends and family. "C'mon, eat it, you'll diet
tomorrow!" or "You look fine, you don't need a diet!" are what we hear. We've
all heard these sayings. I'm more prone to over-eat when I'm among friends or
family that behave like that. And I know that I'm less likely to over-eat when
I'm among strangers; I would feel embarrassed. Stay firm, stay determined, and
tell friends and family firmly that you have decided to take your life
and your health into your hands and that over-eating will destroy your efforts
to change. When dealing with my friends and family, I mentioned that, since
dieting, I feel more energetic, I sleep better, my stomachaches have
disappeared, I'm more productive at work, and I no longer have back pain. Most
people, after hearing these positive points, will understand you and start
supporting you. 
• Some people lack ambition.
Period.
• Many folks fail to
comprehend that they must focus on a diet that provides them with all the
valuable nutrients that ensure the correct functioning of their body. A weight-loss
diet must be low in calories, not low in nutrients and vitamins. Minerals and
amino acids play an essential role for your overall health and well-being. If
you do not fuel your body properly, you will feel hungry throughout the day and
you will eventually give up and binge on food. Do not play down your hunger, as
it can be your worst enemy.
• Many people pick the
wrong exercises to do. You don't need to devote hours in the gym or do
something you find totally boring to lose weight. When exercise becomes a
chore, that's when most people give up. 80% of calories you lose comes from changing
your eating habits with only 20% coming from exercising. Some exercise is good,
more is better, but everything counts, even a 5-minute walk or doing household
chores.
• Some people don't seek
help. Getting advice from a dietician can make all the difference. Knowing
which foods to eat and which workouts are the most effective are vital.
• Drastic diets or diets
that are too strict can activate mood swings, headaches, physical and mental
exhaustion, irritability, digestive upset, and brain fog. But changing your
diet should leave you feeling happy, energized and light.
• Feeling hungry 10
minutes or even an hour after you have eaten might indicate other problems.
Chronic hunger generally indicates that your diet is imbalanced or insufficient,
which can cause your body to store energy, and resist weight loss. If you feel
hungry all the time during a diet, this means you're not eating foods that
boost satiety. Lean protein, fiber-loaded veggies and some good fat should fix
that. Again, 280 calories from a candy bar and 280 calories from a lean protein
meal with a large fiber-loaded salad are not the same! Protein and fiber-loaded
salad will leave you a lot fuller!
• Tradition. We usually
celebrate over meals, we bond over meals, we comfort ourselves over meals and
we entertain over meals. Celebrate by pampering yourself with a spa or massage
treatment. Bond by going on a hike together. Comfort yourself with other things.
• Some diets are based on
prepackaged food and portion control. This won't work over a long term.
• Did you know that the
quantity of calories in 1lb (.45kg) of body fat is equal to 3,500 calories?
That means that you have to eat 3,500 fewer calories than usual in order to
lose 1 pound.
• One gram of carbs has 4
calories, one gram of protein has 4 calories, one gram of fat has 9 calories,
and one gram of water or insoluble fiber has 0. So, plan accordingly, but
remember that you need some fats every day, so don't exclude them completely.
Fat boosts satiety.
• If you're wondering how many
calories you should eat for successful weight loss, here are the ballpark
numbers. Aim for 500 calories lower than the amount of calories you burn
daily. Of course, that amount varies between people
leading a sedentary life and active people. I'd say that women should take
between 1200-1400 calories per day for a healthy weight loss. Don't go below
1200. Men should not go below 1500 calories per day; the suggested amount is
1600-1800.
• For people who exercise at
least 10 minutes per day, the number of carbs per day should be kept between
100 and 150. That means that you can eat a lot of fruits and veggies and you'll
be fine. If you aim for a healthy weight loss, eat 50-100 grams of carbs per
day. That is the amount suggested in the Superfoods Diet - Phase 1. If you eat
less than 50 grams per day, you're basically low-carbing, and you might
experience side effects. I don't recommend doing that.











Fad Diets Created the Yo-Yo Nation
 
Again, I'll
go back and talk more about fad diets, because they're responsible for weight
yo-yoing and for the existence of the Yo-Yo Nation! NOTE: more than 70%
of adult Americans are overweight and there are more than 1 billion overweight
people in the world. The Yo-Yo Nation is huge!! 
Most diets
concentrate on weight loss and don't give you the bulletproof solution for maintaining
your loss. Trying to lose weight by going on strict diets that are not
satisfying is not going to solve anything. Forget these kind of diets. You
can't lose weight by not eating. That's because the human evolution is a very
slow process. Our DNA still has data from the caveman days. There was not much
food back then. People, back then, would sometimes go for days without anything
to eat.
When food is
consumed, our bodies are programmed to turn it into fat and store it. When you
try to lose weight by undernourishment, this old mechanism kicks in. This means
that when you eat your next meal, what you eat will be converted into fat and
stored in your body. The more you eat during this time, the more fat will be
converted. There are things you can do to drastically increase your metabolism
and speed up your weight loss without eating less.
Stress
affects how you think. If you worry about your next meeting or other issues at
work, or worry about how you are going to make your bill payments, it's less
likely that you are going to have the mental energy to prepare a healthy menu
for yourself each and every day. Instead, when you are feeling nervous, you are
more likely to turn to sweet, fatty foods like candy and cookies. Stress is an
immense problem. 
You don't
have to worry that you will gain weight from over-eating (even if you do,
you'll over-eat on lean protein and fiber-loaded salads) and at the same time
you will find that you're healthier and more energetic than before. I'll be
honest with you, if you used to eat fast food and processed foods, this will be
a big change for you. If you used to cook your meals, then there are no drastic
changes you have to make. In fact, it will become so easy to follow that you
and your entire family can adapt to it without much hassle. I am that confident
that this diet is not just the program for you but will completely transform
your weight lost efforts and the way you look at diets forever.
On fad diets,
food gets boring quickly. Let's face it: People don't want to drink smoothies
or live on steak and eggs for the rest of their lives. With recipes, diversity
and taste is everything. You can create all the meal plans you want, but by the
time you get two or three weeks into your diet, you're sick and tired of eating
the same things over and over again.
In a world
where processed food is regrettably becoming a part of everyday life, it is
important, now more than ever, to be aware of what you are eating and how it
affects your life. What you eat affects your mood, your health, and your
confidence. A Superfoods diet will allow you to lose weight naturally because
you'll provide your body with nutrients and foods that our bodies have used for
centuries. There is no such thing as a shortcut to long term weight loss. If
you do not equip yourself with the right knowledge, you will end up
yo-yoing your weight and spending your money searching for an easy way for
weight loss success. But the fact of the matter is, there is no easy way to
weight loss... just effort and sticking to a proper eating habits.
There are a
huge number of reasons why overweight people try to lose weight. Some want to
feel and look better while others want to have more energy to accomplish their
daily tasks. Some want to be healthier now and prevent health problems later
in their life and avoid huge medical costs. Some want to transform their
eating habits, so their children can learn at an early age that eating whole
foods is healthy and that fast food and processed foods will get them into trouble,
causing depression because of their looks in their teens, to a lack of
self-confidence later on, to other health issues and diseases. The costs of NOT
applying healthy eating habits are just too high! For you and your
children, and their children, and their children, and so on. Think of it as a health
retirement plan. If you become leaner, happier, and healthier because of the
whole food Superfoods you are going to start to eat, you and your children will
be healthier and happier, have fewer problems, and have fewer health-related
costs. If you continue eating processed foods and junk foods, you're
risking a lot. The price for heart surgery ranges from 70 000 to 100 000
dollars for smaller and simpler procedures to 300 000 dollars for open-heart
surgery. Then there's the stroke rehab cost and cost for lost productivity. It
all adds up! But it doesn't have to, if you change your diet to a Superfoods
diet.
The Superfoods
diet will teach you how to eat healthy unprocessed, whole Superfoods and
maintain your weight. It will also enable you to lose weight in the first phase,
but without side effects or without risking your health. You already saw my
pictures and 5 years proof of this. Fad diets promise quick and easy weight
loss and are mostly based on eating more of one kind of food and not another.
While there are people who get instant results from these diets, the results
are, unfortunately, not sustainable. I managed to lose weight on a low-carb
diet more than once and I gained everything back, simply because I
continued to eat processed foods afterwards.
We choose
what we eat, but for many of us there are many other explanations for
being overweight than just bad eating habits: having office jobs or lifestyles
that don't give us the time we need to be active, or perhaps your day is so
busy and frantic with family and children that you have been pushing your
health on the back-burner while caring for others. 
I was like
that. I justified my weight gain because, as a software developer that sits
through the day and a father of 2 small demanding kids, I felt I didn't have
the time to squeeze in a workout routine and I didn't have the mental energy to
concentrate on what I ate. At that time, we had a freezer full of frozen
processed food and we ate just about anything. My kids were born 15 months
apart and that time was very stressful and tiring both for me and my wife. You
saw the pictures and how we looked. With the days being full of small tasks,
work, and family time, by the end of the day I was exhausted and couldn't
imagine getting up and doing a 10- or 20-minute workout or cooking a healthy
meal or even making a trip to the store to buy healthy whole foods and prepare
them for the next day.
But it
doesn't have to be difficult or time-consuming to make some changes to your
life. Once I got better organized and learned few life hacks, I felt mentally
prepared to change myself. With transformed eating habits and less than 20
minutes a day of body weight exercises, I was able to lose weight. And I have
kept it off for over 5 years!
Let's be
realistic: if you don't make time to shop for whole foods and if you don't make
a firm resolution to cook a healthy meal with it, you will not succeed.

If you make
these changes, not only will you lose weight, you won't feel hungry at all. If
you do feel hungry, you will have healthy food at your disposal that
will not make you gain weight. 
A quick
summary of what over-eating can cause or lead to:
• heart disease
• high blood pressure
• diabetes
• circulatory Issues
• gallbladder problems
• obesity
It's said
that there may even be a link between certain cancers and being overweight, probably
because of the processed foods overweight people eat. 
You know the
reasons why you have to finally do something about your weight. You want to
live a longer and healthier life. You don't want to cause irreparable damage to
your body. 
Now is the time
to make that decision, and experience what it's like to have a stronger and
healthier body. 
Take
responsibility for yourself. It's only really you that can make it
happen. Others can help, but it's up to you whether it happens or not. Just go
for it! I've met people who managed to lose weight and keep it off for years.
These people are the ones who have really made a determined decision to change.
Something made them think, "I've had enough, I want to change, I want to
get healthier, I want to live longer, I don't want to spend all
my retirement money on heart surgeries or stroke rehab, I want to enjoy life to
the fullest." They're successful because they've made that determined, definite
decision that they don't want to feel unhealthy anymore. 
And now it's
your turn. Forget about risky diets, time-consuming workouts, and exhausting
routines. You can finally lose weight by making simple changes to your daily
life.
There is no
easy way to lose weight. A gradual weight loss of 2 pounds per week is an
optimal weight loss. It takes a long time for weight to be put on, and the most
lasting way to lose weight is to do it is progressively. Let your new lifestyle
become your healthy habits. There is no doubt that you can lose weight either
by starving yourself or following a crash-diet plan, but as soon as you quit
it, you gain back all the lost weight... and sometimes even more. So there is no
point of suffering from starvation if, in the end, you are going to put on more
weight. Other than absorbing a healthy lifestyle, all weight loss solutions are
unrealistic and temporary. Millions of North Americans and people worldwide are
overweight or obese. 
A person's
weight is a result of many factors: environment; family history and genetics;
metabolism, which is the way the body changes food and oxygen into energy; and
personal behaviors or habits. 
Certain
things, like family history, can't be changed. However, other things—like a
person s lifestyle habits—can be changed. You can help prevent or treat
overweight and obesity if you follow a Superfoods diet, are physically active, and
limit the time you spend being inactive.














Drinks

During the beginning of my diet, I started to drink diet root beer because I
had sweet cravings. I usually had one per day. I also drank 4-5 cups of coffee
at that time, sweetened with Stevia, and a cup of herbal tea in the morning.
Even before I started the Superfoods diet, I tried to lower my sugar intake for
coffee, so I went from one-and-a-half teaspoons to one-half. Luckily, I never
added sugar to my tea, so there were no issues with my tea once I started the
diet, except that I wasn't sure which sweetener to use. I didn't like
artificial sweeteners but I had them in my diet root beer anyway, so I tried Stevia
and I liked it. But somehow, during my diet, my palate started to change. I
didn't need sugar with my coffee and I started to avoid diet root beer. Then,
just for fun, I tried pure black coffee, without cream or Stevia. And I liked
it!
I'm pretty sure that my lowered sweet tooth was
caused by the Superfoods lifestyle, probably because of the fruits that I ate
daily and because I didn't eat any wheat bread or pastries. After less than 6
weeks, I stopped drinking diet root beer completely (in the last 4 weeks I had
a diet root beer maybe once a week) and I stopped adding Stevia to my coffee.
During the last 4 years, I have had a half-full small bottle of Stevia in the
top drawer of my office desk, as a reminder of my sweet coffee days. I lowered my
coffee intake to 2 cups per day, and I started to drink green tea in the
afternoon, in addition to one cup of herbal tea (sage + mint being my favorite),
which I drank in the morning. When I wanted to drink something cold and
refreshing, I had a sparkling mineral water or soda with quarter of a lemon
squeezed in. I also had one 5-ounce glass of red wine in the evening, but not
every day. If I was invited to a party or if I was entertaining, I'd drink red
wine. 
Please avoid diet sodas because they're full of
nasty chemicals. (They're okay for the first few weeks while you're still
parting with processed foods, but avoid them once you lose your sweet cravings.)
Artificial sweeteners in diet sodas create a
negative hormonal response in the body that increases fat-storing hormone
production. They also increases your craving for more sweets and refined
carbohydrates in the time period immediately after consuming the diet drink.
The best alternatives are sparkling or regular water, club soda with lemon, or
unsweetened iced teas. You have plenty of options with teas - green, white,
black, and mint. Be creative in making your iced teas and you'll enjoy them
more! Plus, you'll get a more diverse array of antioxidants. I'm not a fan of
fruit juices, even freshly squeezed ones. I prefer to eat fresh fruit and with
additional fibers found in fresh fruit. The choice you should make regarding
fruits is, therefore, obvious!











Exercising
If you're as lazy as I am, this will be the
tricky part. I used to go to the gym a lot during one particular period of my
life. I know that the hardest part is getting ready to go to the gym but that
once I'm there, I'm raring to go!
Often, our problems with exercising lies in our
mindsets and our initial motivational preparation. We need to make up our minds
to prepare for the gym, and stop making excuses.
For example, after a long day at the office,
I'm usually full of excuses: "I walked 40 minutes already today," or "I will go
tomorrow," or "Maybe my walk was enough exercise for today."
Generally, the only thing that can get me
moving are the realizations that I feel inflexible, that I have lower back
stiffness when I get up after 2 hours of sitting, and that I have to maintain
my muscle mass, and that the only way to alleviate these feelings is to do some
stretching and some type of strength training. I noticed that if I don't do any
strength exercises for a few weeks, my back discomfort returns again, no matter
what my weight is. I think that it's because when you stop doing strength
exercise, your body isn't tightened anymore (there is no tension in it) and
long hours spent sitting in the office start to take their toll. 
To get
myself moving, I decided to do shoulder exercises with two full 2L bottles of
liquid, and then do a few repetitions of body weight circuit training. I also
always remember that I first have to warm up. Never ever forget to warm up your
muscles, joints and have your heart pumping. I had 2 strained muscles/tendons
in the past (my left shoulder and my right elbow) and I still remember the
problems and pain that they caused me. This is the minimum you can do for your
health: some walking and/or some weight exercises. Of course, if you can do
30-45 minutes of cardio per day and 45 of strength training every second day,
you're doing much more for your health. Plus, you can eat more because you
burned some calories. But don't do steady cardio; research proved that an
exercise regimen consisting of only cardio does not really burn fat or speed up
your metabolism like it should. New research shows that you can trick your body
into burning calories more efficiently, especially if you change the intervals,
both during cardio and strength training. By varying intervals in
strength-training and by training just a couple of times a week, you'll reverse
50% of the metabolism slow-down that comes with age. The next time you run,
swim, or even walk, ramp up the intensity for 30-second intervals, returning to
your normal speed afterward. Using this strategy will help you consume more
oxygen and make your cell powerhouses work harder to burn energy.
If you're
very overweight, start with just walking, then slowly introduce some stretching
and then some body weight training into your exercise plan.
Body weight circuit training is sort of a
minimal strength type of training you can do. You saw my pictures; I'm not the
type of fitness guy that is "ripped" and "toned." I'm a very average guy who
works at a desk and has a family. I don't have a lot of time to spend on
fitness training. For example, my home body weight circuit training in the
beginning was:
• 30 seconds of
bodyweight squats, or until you can't do anymore (might be less than 30 seconds
in the beginning)
• 30 seconds of push-ups,
or until you can't do anymore (might be less than 30 seconds in the beginning)
• 30 seconds jumping
jacks
Repeat 3-4
times. That's it.
This is very
basic training that will lead you into strength exercising. When you can do
this easily every morning (or every second morning), you can add into every
circuit the  following:
• 20 walking lunges
• 15-30 seconds of planking
A more
advanced body weight circuit training would be to add pull-ups, dips (using bar
stools), and chin-ups and to repeat the whole circuit 5 times. That should have
you sweating like a pig and your metabolism should be running full steam. So,
advanced body circuit training might be:
• 20 bodyweight squats
• 10 pull-ups
• 30 jumping jacks
• 20 walking lunges
• 10 chin-ups
• 30 seconds of planking
• 10 dips
• 20 push-ups 
Repeat 3-5
times.
Not only
does muscle weigh more than fat, but it uses more energy, too. The average
woman in her 30s who strength-trains 30-40 minutes twice a week for 4 months
will increase her resting metabolism by 100 calories a day. That means she's resetting
her thermostat to keep running at that rate even on the days when she doesn't
make it to the gym.
Muscles
build metabolism. If you have more muscle mass, you will burn more calories
when exercising as well as when  you are resting. Strength training is the easiest
way to increase metabolism. We lose half a pound of muscle per year as we get
older, and that lost muscle mass should be replenished. For example, if you
used to go to the gym in your 20s and then do nothing for 15 years and then in your
late 30s you notice that you gained some weight, you have to know that, at the
same time, you have lost 7-8 pounds of muscles too and that your body now has a
very different composition.
I would
suggest to do interval exercises even when you're walking, alternating short
bursts of intense exercise with easier recovery periods. This will help you
lose weight, but it will also strengthen your heart and lungs, reduce bad LDL
cholesterol, and help your body control your blood sugar fluctuations. It will
also boost your metabolism and you will sleep better. 
I prefer to
do my exercise in the morning, because I'm a morning person. This also helps me
feel better throughout the day. I feel energized and rejuvenated. Most importantly,
for the lazy person I am, I know that I did my exercise for that day and I feel
great about it the whole day! I definitely think that it's better to know that
you're finished with your exercise and feel great entire day, than to think "Will
I find time and energy to do my exercise in the evening?"
Exercise is
also vitally important for lymph activity (the "sewage" system of the
body, so to speak, since it doesn't have its own heart to pump), which requires
the diaphragm's breathing movements and other body movements to keep things
flowing, cleansing, and flushing the toxins out. Check out these exercise
videos on my blog: http://Superfoodstoday.com/video/.
There is one
very important fact connected to exercising, which is the mental connection
that occurs when you begin to follow a routine. Let's say you go through this
diet, you start exercising, everything goes as expected, and you have achieved
your ideal weight (or you came close to your ideal weight). Then, for some
reason, you get into a stressful situation at work, you forget about exercising
and eating healthy food, you start adding processed foods to your diet again
because you don't have time to cook, and you find yourself thinking, "What went
wrong... and when?" You conclude that you have yo-yoed again. But, if you had
your exercising routine firmly planted into your new lifestyle, thoughts of exercising
would be ingrained in your brain. These thoughts serve as a reminder that you
have to eat healthy food. Every time you start thinking about exercising, you
will be reminded about your current eating habits. Even if you ate a few
processed foods, you'll be aware of it and you'll do something about it. This
positive mental connection alone should be a good enough reason to make
exercising a new habit. 
People who make exercise
a lifelong habit feel good all the time, and do it because they want to stay
healthy and live longer. I'm pretty sure that if you switch - for life - from processed
food to Superfoods, you will include exercise in your daily routine. I can tell
you what motivates me to exercise daily. Again, it's the whole "feel great for
the whole day" feeling. After I exercise in the morning, I feel proud of myself.
I feel wonderful. I am full of energy. I'm alert. I know that I started the day
on a healthy note and that I will be mindful of what I foods will be consumed
that day. I know that I will have a great sleep, too.
Some exercising
tips that will help keep you motivated are:
·        
Find
someone to exercise with. It's more difficult to let a friend down if you
agreed to exercise together. It's even better if that friend has an exercise
habit already firmly planted in his/her life. 
·        
Exercise
on your way home from the office. Have an exercise bag in your car and go
straight to the gym, so you avoid of temptation to stay at home.
·        
Use
"waiting" time to your advantage. For example, do a few lunges or squats when
you find yourself waiting for something (like the microwave to "ding" or the
elevator to arrive).
·        
Use
the stairs instead of the elevator, if possible.
There is one
more option for people who know that they might revert to unhealthy eating and
drop exercising as a habit. Join our online community of Superfoods eaters and
get support there! It's easy to be connected these days. Meet other people who
are on the same quest of leaving the Yo-Yo Nation and joining the Superfoods Nation
and support each other. If you make friends there, you will support each other
and it will be hard to part with your newly acquired healthy-eating lifestyle
that involves regular exercising.











Weight Loss Challenges
Sweets
When I was
in the weight loss phase before in my life, I learned that it's best for me not
to have any sweets in the house at all. First of all, I can't control
myself (!) and secondly, not having sweets on hand will prevent binging. 
Learn to
recognize that point where snacking comes close to transitioning to a binge.
Recognize your binge triggers, and never ever have that food in the
house. It is much easier to lose weight if you don't have access to processed
sweets!









Fried food      
My way of
dealing with fried food is never to make it at home, never to order it in the
restaurant, and eat it only when it's served somewhere else (for example, at a party
or birthday). Making these rules for myself means that I will only eat a few
bites once or twice a month somewhere. That is enough for me! Occasionally, I ate
some fried food (chicken, fish) as a celebratory meal, in the beginning of my
diet, but I started to avoid it more and more in favor of grilled food. If you
have to eat fried food, eat only occasionally, and eat it as a celebratory meal
with a large fiber-loaded salad. Alternatively, you can take any meat that you
wanted to grill, put it in an egg mixture, then coat with flax meal and bake it
in the oven. Taste-wise, it will be the closest thing to fried food and it will
be much, much healthier.











Celebratory
Meals and How to Prevent Binge Eating
The
Superfoods diet is so successful because it allows people to cycle their diet
every day, so they never felt like they're suffering. They know that their next
regular meal is only a few hours away. Cycling means that the dieter will have
one meal with the regular food outside of the diet. 
You know
that eating refined foods, processed foods, and fast foods has brought you
here. During a celebratory meal (hey, every day is a celebration!), you should make
choices that fall on the "healthy side" of celebratory. With time, you will
completely switch to a "Superfoods only" lunch or dinner. That doesn't mean
that you can't have an occasional fast food meal in Phase 1, but make sure that
your choice is a healthy, clever choice. There is a huge range of fast food
meals that have less than 500 calories (Google this), and you can eat any of
them as a celebratory meal. 
You'll
notice that those fast food meals don't include fries and mayo. If you insist
on having fries, you can have medium fries with a salad on the side, but you shouldn't
have a burger at the same time. Remember, you're trying to lose weight! Now, an
ideal meal would be some sort of healthy "meat and potato" type of a meal.
Having said that, an ideal meal should be any low-fat grilled or roasted meat,
1 medium size baked potato (or one scoop of brown rice or quinoa) and a large fiber-loaded
salad. If you want to lose more weight, you can "diet cheat" on your celebratory
meal and eat some type of tasty low-carb meal instead (such as cauliflower
instead of potatoes or rice, a cauliflower crust pizza, etc.). If you insist on
having a Whopper with medium fries and a diet pop, you can have that, too, but
you probably won't lose any weight on that day, unless you do some serious
exercising or you skip breakfast. 
Don't over-eat
during a celebratory meal. Don't think, "OK, I'll over-eat now and ruin this
one day and tomorrow I'll diet again." Instead, think of the sum of the calories
you ate during the past week. That over-eating might spoil the whole week of
effort.
If you're
planning on attending a party, reschedule your celebratory meal and eat it at the
party. If you over-eat there, again, your whole weekly effort will be ruined.
My best advice is to eat any lean protein food and any fiber-loaded salad at the
party and to avoid cheese, salad dressings, sweets, alcohol and breads,
especially if you're in Phase 1. If you're in Phase 2, then you can have a small
serving of fried food or a thin slice of birthday cake. My personal way of
taking care when I'm at a party and I want to lose weight is to eat lean meat
and a fiber-loaded salad, but to limit my intake to one-and-a-half plates. One
plate is usually enough, but if I'm still "kind of hungry" and there is a
myriad of options in front of me, (and some wicked thoughts start to pop up in
my head like "Hey, I haven't tried that; I'll take just a bite"), then I risk
the danger of over-eating. My one plate will turn into two, and the second plate
will likely have more fat in it than the food I just ate. But if I eat one-and-a-half
plates of lean meat and a fiber-loaded salad or some steamed veggies (you can
call this loading up on veggies & protein too), I'm usually "full enough"
and I feel that I don't have to eat anything else. 
Another way
of thinking about this problem is to just simply eat lean protein and a fiber-loaded
salad until you're full and that's it. Or, if you're in Phase 2, load one plate
with veggies and protein, eat it and then browse the buffet. You won't eat much
after that plate, I guarantee it!
Parties are
not good for celebratory meals because they have so many tasty options. That is
why I'm suggesting protein and fiber and not a real celebratory meal. If I take
one plate of some meat and potatoes and salad, I'm always hungry after that,
just because I end up looking at all those other food options. However, if I
behave well at a party and do not over-eat, I feel so proud of myself!
 









Binge
Eating
Emotional
hunger can be powerful. As a result, it's easy to mistake it for physical
hunger. But there are clues you can look for that can help you tell physical
and emotional hunger apart. Emotional hunger comes on suddenly. Emotional
hunger craves specific comfort foods. Emotional hunger craves fatty foods or
sugary snacks that provide an instant rush. Emotional hunger isn't satisfied
once you're full. Emotional hunger isn't located in the stomach; it's in your
head. When the binge urging hits you, make sure that you have your "Binge
Emergency Kit" ready in the fridge.
 









Binge
Emergency Kit
The "Binge Emergency Kit" consists of 2 peeled
hardboiled eggs, one large container half-full of shredded cabbage and spinach
leaves and a small jar of yogurt salad dressing. The salad container should be
fairly large, 1 or 2 liters, with a non-airtight lid (so the veggies don't get
spoiled). Put the eggs and veggies in it and put the jar beside it. Place
sticky notes or stickers on them that say anything that will soothe you in that
moment (pictures of your family, some calming words, some "before" photos, a reminder
where to find a CD so that you can play soothing music, etc.). If the cravings
do not hit you for 2 days, eat those veggies and those 2 eggs so they don't
spoil. And don't forget to prepare a fresh Binge Emergency Kit. You might need
one soon.
 









How
to Use Your Binge Emergency Kit
When a
craving for sweets and/or junk food hits you, you need to slow it down. To do
this, count to 10, drink a glass of water, sip some tea, brush your teeth, and then
chew a piece of gum. If all that doesn't help, take a deep breath, open the
fridge, look at the lid with the comforting pictures and messages, count to 10
again, and then decide if you should pour the dressing from the jar over the
veggies or not. If you still have cravings, take the 2 eggs out and put them on
a plate, pour the dressing over the veggies, stir it and eat eggs and salad as
slow as you can while staring at the lid. This should help. If you're still
hungry, even after this eating, prepare the same meal once more and eat it. You
should not be very hungry by then. Afterwards, prepare a new Binge Emergency
Kit.











Evening Problem - AKA "Nighttime eating"
 
If I'm about
to spend hours in front of my computer in the evening, I'll experience an
"Evening Problem" a few nights a week. Ok, I'll admit it, I'll get it almost
every night because I'm a nighttime eater. As a matter of fact, it is happening
right now, as I write these words. I had a thick lentil stew with a few small
bites of braised pork (added for flavor) around 6 p.m., accompanied by a large
spinach and green onion salad with Italian dressing. Now is 8:30 p.m., and I'm
fidgeting. If I eat an apple, I'll be fine until 9 or maybe 9:15 p.m., but then
I will go into the kitchen again. I already had a small 4 oz. glass of the red
wine around 8 pm. So, I'm deciding what to do. What I do most of the times is prepare
a mini "Binge Emergency Kit" that contains a small or medium green leafy salad
serving, with some low-fat yogurt as a dressing and 50 grams of low-fat
farmers' cheese on the side (one boiled egg will do too instead of the farmers'
cheese). That is enough for me. After I eat that, I feel more than full and I
know that I'll be fine until bedtime. Sometimes even half of this meal will do.
Then, I'll simply stop eating and leave the rest of it for another day.
When I was
yo-yoing, I would go for a few cookies. But, more than once, that turned into a
binge party where I would polish off a half gallon of ice cream after the
cookies. Now I don't have a single cookie or any ice cream in my house, I have
my "Binge Emergency Kit" and I've managed to be binge-free for years. But I
can't go to sleep with my stomach empty, and if I don't eat a  "Binge Emergency
Kit," I have to have at least an apple or two. 
It is
estimated that 6 million Americans suffer from NES or "Nighttime Eating
Syndrome." One third are obese and turn nighttime snacking into a binge. If you
search the Internet for advice on how to stop nighttime eating, you will find
different suggestions from "eat your breakfast" to "buy supplements to stop
nighttime eating." But these are written by thin doctors who don't have a clue
what we feel after 9 p.m. My suggestion is not to fight this urge to eat before
sleep. Accept it and live with it; you're not alone. But don't go into a binge,
don't eat refined carbs or any carbs at all. Instead, follow my advice and eat
fruits (or fruits & nuts or seeds), have a cup of tea or eat a mini "Binge
Emergency Kit." Since I started to eat Superfoods chocolate every afternoon, I
don't crave sweets in the evening. My wife was shocked the first few times she
saw me making a coffee after 10 p.m. and then eat 2 apples with that coffee,
which was just before my bedtime, and then find me sleeping like a log 5
minutes later. 









Weekend
Problem
You managed
to stick to a diet for the whole week and now weekend is coming. You'll be
running around the whole weekend and you're afraid that you might eat too much.
Plus, you'll be invited to your friends' houses and you are worried you won't
be able to say no to whatever they bring out in front of you. You're not alone.
Let's say
you typically have a few temptations during the weekend. You'll be running
around in malls for 3 hours before lunchtime on Saturday and in the evening
you're invited to a friend's house and on the next day you'll be attending someone's
birthday party. Before you were on a diet, you'd eat some fast food in the mall
and have a feast in the evening. And pizza and birthday cake is what you'll
be having at the birthday party. You know that this behavior has brought you to
this diet. Well, now you have a few options, but not all the optimal ones.
These options include:
• You decide to tough it
out and stay focused on your diet. You reschedule the celebration meal for the
time you visit your friend, and you have brought your binge emergency kit with
you to the mall. Knowing that you're going to your friend's in the evening, you
decide to spend an hour in the gym, doing extra hard training, believing that
your friend will have something to offer you that is hard to resist. You also
concluded that you deserved a treat for doing so great on your diet during the
week and, instead of treating yourself with food, you decide to treat yourself
with a spa visit after the gym. You decide to tell your friend you're on a diet
and eat a healthy celebration meal while having only one glass of wine and
maybe a thin slice of cake. That slice of cake cancels out the extra hard work,
but in the end you'll lose weight on that day. Bravo! This is the preferred
mindset!
• You'll bring a low-carb
meal to the mall and eat the celebration meal at your friend's house. The
decision whether to eat the cake or what to drink will make or break your
calories count on that day. 12 oz. beer has 140 calories, a light one has 110.
Mineral water with some lemon has almost none. It's up to you. Don't eat the
cake or take just one bite.
• You'll bring a low-carb
meal to the mall, but you'll slightly over-eat at your friend's house. You
won't lose any weight on that day, but you won't gain it either. It's up to
you.
• You opt to eat a low-carb
meal in the mall and over-eat at your friend's house. That will cancel your 3-7
day weight loss effort. It's up to you.
I would
suggest to script the entire weekend and make plans for what you will eat and
when. That should prevent you from over-eating, because you will be mentally
prepared for the whole weekend. Script it!











The First-Bite
Rule
If, by any
chance, you find yourself near a box of cookies or a jumbo bag of chips, and
you're unprepared to handle the situation, remember "the first bite rule." If
you have one bite, there will be another. And another. And another. Processed
food is full of additives, it's fatty and salty or fatty and sweet, and it's
made to twist your taste buds and twist your mind into thinking that you have
to have the next bite and that you have to keep eating it. IT IS "DESIGNED"
FOOD! FOOD THAT IS DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU EAT MORE AND MORE! DESIGNED
IN THEIR LABS! DON'T TAKE THAT FIRST BITE. THINK OF YOUR WHOLE WEEK OF EFFORT.
Leave that place right away or eat something healthy and forget to think about
the treat in front of you. JUST SAY NO! If you take that first bite, salt
cravings or sweet cravings will kick into high gear and you won't be able to
resist them. You will feel really great and proud of yourself if you resist!
Ask yourself if it's going to be worth the guilt you'll feel after eating it? Chances
are, it's not, so DON'T TAKE THAT FIRST BITE!











 Clean
Foods Superfoods Smart Carbs Diet Conclusion
 
As you can
see, Superfoods that are recommended are high in fiber; are thermogenic; are low
in saturated fat; contain many antioxidants, probiotics, vitamins, and minerals;
are high in Omega 3 fats; and, above all, are very tasty. The Superfoods diet
is also very close to Paleo in that processed food and wheat are not included.
The Paleo diet doesn't allow beans, oats, cheese and yogurt. However, I don't think
they are that bad for you; beans are full of antioxidants and they lower
cholesterol and blood pressure, and yogurt has huge probiotic values and it's an
incredible addition to spinach- or cucumber-based salads. The latest dietary
guidelines recommend we triple our current bean intake from 1 to 3 cups per
week. Beans contain a lot of protein and fiber. Meat is digested fairly
quickly, whereas beans are digested slowly, keeping you satisfied longer. Plus,
beans are low in sugar, which prevents insulin in the bloodstream from spiking
and causing hunger. When you substitute beans for meat in your diet, you also
get the bonus of a decrease in saturated fat. These reasons are enough for me
and my family to keep eating beans in any form!
The
Superfoods cuisine is also very similar to the Mediterranean diet, although it
excludes pasta, hard cheeses, smoked meats and gluten breads.
As you can
notice from my dieting ideas, I went through several stages. First, I was sure
that cycling daily is the thing that will 100% work and allow me to lose weight
effortlessly. But when my palate changed because of the Superfoods I ate, I
noticed that I didn't need a "normal lunch" at all and certainly none of the
planned junk food meals I dreamed of. As software techies would say, I went
through several iterations of my diet idea and settled for the one that suits
me the best. You're free to stick with "cycling daily" idea if you want to keep
a meat and potato lunch or a fast food lunch as part of your diet. 














 What Superfoods are NOT:
 
• Not processed
or refined foods 
• Not
preservatives, additives or artificial coloring
• Not smoked food
or processed meats
• Not canned
vegetables or meats (beans, garbanzos, beets, corned beef) except canned fish
(sardines, tuna) once or twice a week
• Not wheat,
refined flour, or sugar. 
• Not corn, white
rice, or potatoes. Brown rice and quinoa are fine.
• Not vegetable
oils or fried food. Olive oil and Coconut oil are fine.
• Not soy
products or tofu 
• Not pasta,
except gluten-free soba noodles (100% buckwheat) or acorn or mung bean noodles.
• Not full-fat
dairy cheese. Yogurt, kefir and low-fat farmers' cheese/cottage cheese/Greek
feta cheese are fine and occasionally (context-related) some low-fat cheddar or
mozzarella are fine. "Context-related" means it's okay to sprinkle some grated
low-fat cheddar or mozzarella on your casseroles or a Superfoods pizza.
• Not store-bought
salad dressings or condiments with vegetable oils or corn syrup (mayo, ketchup,
barbeque sauce). Hummus, guacamole, mustard, pesto and hot sauces are fine.
Superfoods
meals have existed for ages, and you will find some Superfoods recipes in
Mediterranean, Chinese, Japanese and European cookbooks. Superfoods cuisine is mainly
comprised of soups, salads, stews and grilled meats and veggies. Some examples
of well-known Superfoods recipes are hummus, guacamole, tapenade, basic chicken
or beef soup with vegetables and without noodles, any slow cooked stew with
leaner meats and veggies, some bean dishes without ketchup and sugar, some
lentil dishes and curries, salads without store-bought dressing, pasta, bacon
or bread, any grilled lean fish or meat and veggie. A lot of other classical
recipes can be easily modified and become Superfoods stars. For example, you
can swap white rice for brown rice and omit sugar and soy in Japanese recipes.
You can also swap rice, sauce thickener, soy and oil in Chinese stir-fries with
healthier options. 
I don't
believe in any diet that restricts any type of food in the long term, except
diets that exclude processed industrial foods. We have witnessed what the
industrial food did to modern society and that is not the option to go with!
Yo-Yo Nation should switch to Superfoods and not junk food!
Let me
mention the last reason why I'm sure that the Superfoods Diet will change your
life forever. Once you know everything about the benefits of the vast array of Superfoods,
and once you learn why processed food is so bad on so many levels, I'm pretty
sure that you will think twice every time you get served any processed food and
I'm sure that you will keep thinking, "Why am I eating this, why am I ruining
my health? I can do better, there is tasty food that will help me with my
inflammations and that will protect me from cancer." 
Once you
expand your knowledge, you can't go back and forget about all the facts about Superfoods
and all the facts about processed food. And if you have kids, I'm pretty sure
that you will think twice before you serve them processed colored foods instead
of healthy, tasty Superfoods meals. 
Some people either
hate to cook or they don't have enough time to do so, but it's obvious that Superfoods
Diet will require some time to shop for fresh foods and some time for preparing
them. The good news is that 90% of the meals are very easy and quick to
prepare. Let me give you some examples of Superfoods meals that require only 10
minutes prep time:
• You can chop
veggies while you grill meat or fish. 
• Stir-fries
are typically prepared in 10 minutes.
• Slow
cooker meals or casseroles or stews are also typically prepared in 10 minutes
or less. In all of them you typically include chopped onions, carrots, meat and
one more veggie (green peas, green beans, mushrooms, eggplants, red peppers
etc.). And you just pour all ingredients in a pot, casserole or slow cooker and
you're done. Monitoring the stew as it cooks is not a huge time-wasting task
(same with monitoring a casserole in the oven). You can prepare a large pot or
casserole once a week, freeze some of it, and eat it once or twice during the
week. If you prepare 2 such meals on a Sunday, you're set for the week.
• Superfoods
breakfasts are very quick; eggs or oatmeal don't take too much time to make.
My
point is that you can eat healthy if you are mentally prepared to shop for
healthy ingredients as well as a healthy meal preparation. If you have a bunch
of kids and 2 jobs, you can still find 2-3 hours on a Sunday evening to prepare
all these foods for the rest of the week. Buy already-cut bags of spinach and
cabbage and other veggies and only add olive oil, lemon or apple cider vinegar
and salt before you eat them. Cut some veggies for salads and snacks on a Sunday
evening, put it in your Tupperware container, and you're set for 2-3 days. At
the same time, cook a stew in the huge pot and load food in the slow cooker. Then
freeze all that cooked food so that you'll have meals on hand for when you don't
have time to do preparations. Keep a bunch of hard-boiled eggs in your fridge
for snacks. Be over-prepared for your weight loss journey. You're about to
become a Superfoodie!! Read the Superfoodie Manifesto.











Clean
Foods Superfoods Smart Carbs 20 Days Detox
 









Prep Week
Occasionally,
I would decide to start a diet on a whim. But more than once I regretted it
because my kitchen was full of processed food and sweets and I wasn't mentally
prepared for the diet. The next time I approached it differently, deciding that
next Monday I'd start a diet, and doing all I could to prepare myself mentally
for it. I stocked low-fat proteins, supplements, nuts, seeds, and sugar-free
pop... and got rid of any "bad" food that might beckon me. 
I started to
care about the foods I ate. I also developed the habit of telling everyone that
I was dieting, so they could ask me how it was going. For me, social pressure
works well. Because of that, I would hesitate to cheat in front of someone that
knew I was on a diet. 
Before
dieting, I usually measure myself and take a "before" photo. Then I'm ready to
get focused on my weight loss. I also do visualization exercises, and visualize
myself as a lean, muscle-pumped person.  This helps me endure the first few
days until I get used to the diet.
So, since
this is a diet & detox book, let me tell you few facts about proper detox
planning. The goal is, of course, to expel all the toxins from your body. Those
toxins are stored primarily in your fat cells and they get expelled from the
body through the liver. Now, there is a fixed amount of toxins that the liver
can process in 24 hours, so our goal is multifold:
• You want to
minimize the ingestion of toxins during the detox period. That can be done by
avoiding processed foods, fatty foods (red meat), alcohol, caffeine, fatty
cheeses, sugar, etc. These same foods reduce liver function, so you have
achieved a double goal by avoiding them.
•
You
want to make sure that toxins exit your body as fast as possible. Again, there
are foods that prevent your body from doing that (low fiber foods), and there
are foods that help your body expel toxins, which are foods that are rich in
fiber. 
You can also help your liver work better if you enhance your liver
enzyme function. This is where bitter foods come into play (kale, spinach
and other leafy greens, green tea, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, garlic). These
foods are also high in fiber.
 
To protect yourself from all these toxins, you need to consume
antioxidant-rich foods during your detox. Berries, green tea, and lemon are
antioxidant-rich foods.
 
Finally, you also need something to speed up the elimination of toxins
from your body. This will require the consumption of a lot of water and green
tea as well as a lot of fiber. Veggies, fruits, oats, and legumes are the best
source of fiber.
 
Basically, if you just switch to the Clean Foods Superfoods Smart
Carbs Diet, you'll get all the benefits and you'll detox your body in few weeks
anyway. But let's start with 20 days Detox and slowly get introduced to the Clean
Foods Superfoods Smart Carbs Diet. Some people like to start with the full
detox, meaning they'll eat just vegetables and fruits, but that can be quite
hard. I propose to start slower and to have those vegetables and fruits after
few days. So, the first 2 days are following rules of the Clean Foods Superfoods
Smart Carbs Diet. The next 2 days are days without meats or fish and with
almost no dairy or eggs. Following that, there are 4 full detox days. Then
you'll go back slowly to the Clean Foods Superfoods Smart Carbs Diet. 














Switch to Superfoods!
 
Well, this
is it - you don't have any processed food in your house, you're stocked up on
fresh veggies, fruits and other healthy stuff, and you're ready to change your
life! Congratulations for your willingness to get healthier and achieve a better-looking
you! 
Just please
remember these common facts:
Breakfast
Veggies:
When I'm referring to breakfast veggies, I mean some red or yellow pepper
strips, cucumber and pickles. If you want, you can eat celery, green onions
(spring onions) and sauerkraut; I eat them with eggs or farmers' or cottage
cheese. Hey, you can even eat broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce and spinach for
breakfast. If you want, you can roast or grill some veggies (eggplant, zucchini
and peppers) and have them with savory breakfasts.
Cinnamon: Cinnamon
lowers blood sugar, helps maintain insulin sensitivity, and is a very powerful
antioxidant. Add it every time you eat oatmeal. 
Cocoa:
Cocoa
consumption is associated with decreased blood pressure, improved blood vessel
health, and improvement in cholesterol levels. Some people eat dark chocolate;
I add it to oatmeal or drink it. Buy unsweetened cocoa, ideally the unprocessed
kind (because processing it at a high temperature destroy healthy ingredients
in it).
Nuts
and Seeds: Flax should be always ground. Buy flax meal or grind flax
with a coffee grinder. Almond is the healthiest nut, but you can eat walnuts,
Brazil nuts, or pecans instead. It's okay to eat a different type of nut each
day, but remember that almonds are the healthiest ones.
Grilling
and Frying: Fry a little bit of coconut oil in the skillet, and cook
your meat and/or fish for 7-10 minutes. Don't overdo it. Don't grill for too
long. If you don't like the meat suggested in the recipe, replace it with
something similar. Use beef instead of pork or chicken instead of fish. Think
about organ meats, such as liver or kidneys, as they  contain more vitamins. If
you don't want red meat, use chicken. If you crave fried food, dip the meat in
a beaten-eggs mixture, and cover it with flax meal instead of breadcrumbs and
then bake it in the oven. Delicious!
Coconut
oil:
Use coconut oil. Period. Avoid blended vegetable oils, corn oil and soybean
oil. I cook with coconut oil and eat one spoon of coconut oil once a day
because of my low thyroid; to me, it tastes like heaven. Coconut oil also
fights cancer and contains MCTs - medium chain triglycerides - which fight
plaque in the brain (which cause Alzheimer's disease). Coconut oil also boosts
metabolism and it's great for the skin. Some people experience stomach
discomfort when taking a spoon of coconut oil on empty stomach, and some even
vomit. If you experience this, eat coconut oil after your meal or mix it in your
meal.
Extra-virgin
olive oil: Olive oil is the healthiest oil you can buy, as it
contains the highest amount of monounsaturated content. Extra-virgin is the oil
that results from the first cold pressing of the olives. Being the purest olive
oil, it's also the most expensive. But because it has a low smoke point, it
should not be used for cooking.
Yogurt
and low-fat cheese: Low fat or non-fat Greek (or plain) yogurt is
the only one recommended. If you can't find Greek yogurt, use any plain yogurt.
In my opinion, 0.5% or 1% fat yogurt tastes the best. If you want fruit yogurt,
add some fresh berries (or frozen) or fruits in the plain or Greek yogurt, and
if it's not sweet enough, you can add some Stevia or raw honey. By doing that,
you'll know what exactly went into that snack and you'll avoid industrial
chemicals found in fruit yogurts. Choose low-fat farmers' cheese over cottage
cheese. When choosing Cheddar, Colby or Mozzarella, choose low-fat.
Breads: It's best
to avoid breads altogether, but if you crave something bread-like, try egg-based
flatbread recipes such as egg pancakes, egg muffins or egg pizza crust or almond/tapioca
flour naan.
Salad
Dressings: Store -bought salad dressings contain high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil or canola
oil. Forget them. Forever. The Superfoods dressing is similar to
"Italian Dressing" - olive oil/lemon/minced garlic/salt + some herbs. We'll
call the second dressing a "yogurt dressing" - half a cup of plain low-fat yogurt
or low-fat buttermilk with olive oil/minced garlic/salt. The amount of olive
oil I use is usually 1 teaspoon per person and the rest is added to taste.
Occasionally I'll add a teaspoon of mustard or some herbs like basil, oregano,
marjoram, chives, thyme, parsley, dill or mint to it. If you like spicy, hot
food, add some cayenne to the dressing. It will speed up your metabolism.
Stir-fry: Stir-fry
meats and veggies in coconut oil. Add some garlic, ginger, and half of an onion
cut in wedges. Season only with fish sauce. If you have to, thicken the sauce
with tapioca flour or arrowroot flour. 
Condiments: Forget
about mayo or tartar sauce (it's a processed food containing refined soybean
oil), ketchup (contains high fructose corn syrup) or barbeque sauce (it
contains more high fructose corn syrup than ketchup). Healthy condiments are hummus, salsa, hot sauce,
guacamole, mustard and pesto. Use them sparingly in Phase 1.
Broths: Cook
broths and freeze them. Every few weeks, I cook a large pot of chicken soup and
freeze half of it.
Oatmeal: Buy
regular oatmeal, unenriched and unsweetened.
Exotic
Superfoods: When people hear that I'm eating only Superfoods they
usually think that Superfoods are really expensive, and think I'm eating various
Superfoods in powder form (Spirulina, Chlorella) or Superfoods berries and
seeds (Goji, Chia). When I explain that I eat regular, everyday Superfoods such
as kale and avocado, they ask if I have experimented with exotic Superfoods. I
have, but I didn't wanted to create recipes where such Superfoods are
prominently featured or put them in regular recipes because people will
complain that recipe ingredients are expensive. So, I'll list here how I use
various exotic Superfoods:
• I add
seaweeds to any soup or stew I make and you can do the same with Chlorella and
Spirulina. They also can be added to smoothies, condiments and salads. Some
people use them in granola recipes or energy bars along with Maca powder.
• Spike any
salad dressing with 1 tbsp. of Spirulina, Chlorella, Maca or Matcha. Chlorella
has a strong taste (think pond water or horse hay), Spirulina has an oceanic
taste (think seaweed or something fishy), Maca has earthy/nutty taste (goes
well with smoothies), and Matcha is basically a powdered green tea. Spirulina
and seaweeds taste best in a veggie soup or a fish stew. It tastes nasty in
average smoothies, but another strong taste can hide it (think grapefruit,
lemon, lime, pomegranate or granny Smith apples).
• I eat Goji
berries as a snack or sprinkle them on oatmeal breakfasts and smoothies.
• Wherever
flax seeds are used, you can use Chia seeds instead (oatmeal breakfasts,
smoothies).
