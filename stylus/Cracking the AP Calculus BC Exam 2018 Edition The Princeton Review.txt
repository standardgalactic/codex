Acknowledgments

First of all, I would like to thank Arnold Feingold and Peter B. Kahn for once again doing every problem, reading every word, and otherwise lending their invaluable assistance. I also want to thank Meave Shelton for being a terrific editor; Cameron Crowe for her first-rate reading, analysis, and contributions; and the production team of Jim Melloan, Harmony Quiroz, and Craig Patches. Thanks to Frank, without whose advice I never would have taken this path. Thanks to Jeffrey, Miriam, and Vicki for moral support. Thanks Mom.
Finally, I would like to thank the people who really made all of this effort worthwhile—my students. I hope that I haven't omitted anyone, but if I have, the fault is entirely mine.

Part I
Using This Book to Improve Your AP Score

• Preview: Your Knowledge, Your Expectations
• Your Guide to Using This Book
• How to Begin










PREVIEW: YOUR KNOWLEDGE, YOUR EXPECTATIONS
Your route to a high score on the AP Calculus BC Exam depends a lot on how you plan to use this book. Start thinking about your plan by responding to the following questions.

1. Rate your level of confidence about your knowledge of the content tested by the AP Calculus BC Exam:
A. Very confident—I know it all
B. I'm pretty confident, but there are topics for which I could use help
C. Not confident—I need quite a bit of support
D. I'm not sure
2. If you have a goal score in mind, circle your goal score for the AP Calculus BC Exam:
5 4 3 2 1 I'm not sure yet
3. What do you expect to learn from this book? Circle all that apply to you.
A. A general overview of the test and what to expect
B. Strategies for how to approach the test
C. The content tested by this exam
D. I'm not sure yet

YOUR GUIDE TO USING THIS BOOK
This book is organized to provide as much—or as little—support as you need, so you can use this book in whatever way will be most helpful for improving your score on the AP Calculus BC Exam.

• The remainder of Part I will provide guidance on how to use this book and help you determine your strengths and weaknesses.
• Part II of this book contains Practice Test 1, its answers and explanations, and a scoring guide. (Bubble sheets can be found online when you register your book—see this page for details.) We strongly recommend that you take this test before going any further, in order to realistically determine:
 your starting point right now
 which question types you're ready for and which you might need to practice
 which content topics you are familiar with and which you will want to carefully review
Once you have nailed down your strengths and weaknesses with regard to this exam, you can focus your test preparation, build a study plan, and be efficient with your time.
• Part III of this book will
 provide information about the structure, scoring, and content of the AP Calculus BC Exam.
 help you to make a study plan.
 point you towards additional resources.
• Part IV of this book will explore the following strategies:
 how to attack multiple-choice questions
 how to write a high scoring free-response answer
 how to manage your time to maximize the number of points available to you
• Part V of this book covers the content you need for your exam.
• Part VI of this book contains Practice Tests 2 and 3, their answers and explanations, and a scoring guide. If you skipped Practice Test 1, we recommend that you use it, in conjunction with Tests 2 and 3 (with at least a day or two between them) to chart your progress and identify lingering issues: if you get a certain type of question wrong every time, you probably need to review it. If you only got it wrong once, you may have run out of time or been distracted by something. In either case, this will allow you to focus on the factors that caused the discrepancy in scores and to be as prepared as possible on the day of the test.

You may choose to use some parts of this book over others, or you may work through the entire book. This will depend on your needs and how much time you have. Let's now look at how to make this determination.


When you register your book online, you can download and print out bubble sheets for each Practice Test in this book. See this page for details!

HOW TO BEGIN

1. Take a Test
Before you can decide how to use this book, you need to take a practice test. Doing so will give you insight into your strengths and weaknesses, and the test will also help you make an effective study plan. If you're feeling test-phobic, remind yourself that a practice test is a tool for diagnosing yourself—it's not how well you do that matters but how you use information gleaned from your performance to guide your preparation.
So, before you read further, take the AP Calculus BC Practice Test 1. Be sure to do so in one sitting, following the instructions that appear before the test.
2. Check Your Answers
Using the answer key on this page, count how many multiple-choice questions you got right and how many you missed. Don't worry about the explanations for now, and don't worry about why you missed questions. We'll get to that soon.
3. Reflect on the Test
After you take your first test, respond to the following questions:

• How much time did you spend on the multiple-choice questions?
• How much time did you spend on each free-response question?
• How many multiple-choice questions did you miss?
• Do you feel you had the knowledge to address the subject matter of the free-response questions?
• Do you feel your free responses were well organized and thoughtful?
• Circle the content areas that were most challenging for you and draw a line through the ones in which you felt confident/did well.
 Functions, Graphs, and Limits
 Differential Calculus
 Integral Calculus
 Polynomial Approximations and Series
 Applications of Derivatives
 Applications of Integrals

4. Read Part III, and Complete the Self-Evaluation
Part III will provide information on how the test is structured and scored. It will also set out areas of content that are tested.
As you read Part III, reevaluate your answers to the questions above. At the end of Part III, you will revisit and refine the questions you answer above. You will then be able to make a study plan, based on your needs and time available, that will allow you to use this book most effectively.
5. Engage with Parts IV and V as Needed
Notice the word engage. You'll get more out of this book if you use it intentionally than if you read it passively, hoping for an improved score through osmosis.
Strategy chapters will help you think about your approach to the question types on this exam. Part IV will open with a reminder to think about how you approach questions now and then close with a reflection section asking you to think about how/whether you will change your approach in the future.
The content chapters in Part V are designed to provide a review of the content tested on the AP Calculus BC Exam, including the level of detail you need to know and how the content is tested. You will have the opportunity to assess your mastery of the content of each chapter through test-appropriate questions and a reflection section.
6. Take Test 2 and Assess Your Performance
Once you feel you have developed the strategies you need and gained the knowledge you lacked, you should take Test 2. You should do so in one sitting, following the instructions at the beginning of the test.
When you are done, check your answers to the multiple-choice sections. See if a teacher will read your long-form calculus responses and provide feedback.
Once you have taken the test, reflect on what areas you still need to work on, and revisit the chapters in this book that address those topics. Through this type of reflection and engagement, you will continue to improve.
7. Keep Working
After you have revisited certain chapters in this book, continue the process of testing, reflecting, and engaging with Practice Test 3. You want to be increasing your readiness by carefully considering the types of questions you are getting wrong and how you can change your strategic approach to different parts of the test.
As discussed in Part III, there are other resources available to you, including a wealth of information on AP Central. You can continue to explore areas that can stand to improve and engage in those areas right up to the day of the test.

CALCULATORS MAY NOT BE USED IN THIS PART OF THE EXAMINATION.
Indicate all of your answers to the multiple-choice questions on the answer sheet. No credit will be given for anything written in this exam booklet, but you may use the booklet for notes or scratch work. After you have decided which of the suggested answers is best, completely fill in the corresponding oval on the answer sheet. Give only one answer to each question. If you change an answer, be sure that the previous mark is erased completely. Here is a sample question and answer.
Sample Question
Chicago is a
(A) state
(B) city
(C) country
(D) continent
Sample Answer

Use your time effectively, working as quickly as you can without losing accuracy. Do not spend too much time on any one question. Go on to other questions and come back to the ones you have not answered if you have time. It is not expected that everyone will know the answers to all the multiple-choice questions.
About Guessing
Many candidates wonder whether or not to guess the answers to questions about which they are not certain. Multiple choice scores are based on the number of questions answered correctly. Points are not deducted for incorrect answers, and no points are awarded for unanswered questions. Because points are not deducted for incorrect answers, you are encouraged to answer all multiple-choice questions. On any questions you do not know the answer to, you should eliminate as many choices as you can, and then select the best answer among the remaining choices.

ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS TO SECTION I

1. D We will need to use implicit differentiation to find .
First, take the derivative of both sides with respect to x: ey  = 0.
Distribute: ey  − x − y = 0.
Group those terms containing  on the left and those without on the right: ey  − x  = y
Factor out  = y
And divide: 
2. B Step 1: We need to use the formula for finding the volume of a solid of revolution. The equations in the problems are given to us in terms of x, and we are rotating around the x-axis, so we can use the method of washers. The curve y = ex is always above the curve y = 0 (which is the x-axis), so we don't have to break this up into two integrals.

Therefore, the integral will be  ((ex)2) − 02) dx.
Step 2:  ((ex)2) − 02) dx =  e2x dx
Step 3:  e2x dx = π 
Step 4: 
Step 5: 
3. D Step 1: We need to use partial fractions to evaluate this integral.
First, we write the integrand as  = 
Step 2: Multiply both sides by (x + 3)(x − 4).
Step 3: Now we have x − 18 = A(x − 4) + B(x + 3).
Step 4: x − 18 = Ax − 4A + Bx + 3B
Step 5: x − 18 = (Ax + Bx) + (3B − 4A)
Step 6: x − 18 = x(A + B) + (3B − 4A)
Step 7: Thus: (A + B) = 1 and (3B − 4A) = −18.
Step 8: Solve this using simultaneous equations to get A = 3 and B = −2.
Step 9: We can now rewrite the original integral as .
Step 10: This is the same as .
4. C We can solve this problem with the Chain Rule.
Step 1:  = 10x + 4
Step 2:  = 
Step 3:  so  = (10x + 4)
Step 4: Substitute for x so that  = (10ln t + 4) .
You could also have solved this by first substituting for x in the original equation and getting y in terms of t, and then differentiating with the Chain Rule.
5. C All we have to do is integrate f(x) and then use the initial condition to solve for the constant. First, we integrate: f(x) = ∫(ex + πx)dx = ex +  + C. Next, we know that f(0) = 2, so 2 = eo +  + C
2 = 1 + C
C = 1
Therefore, f(x) = ex +  + 1.
6. B Step 1: First, find the slope of the tangent line:  = 3x2 − 4.
Step 2: Plug 2 into  = 3(2)2 − 4 = 12 − 4 = 8.
This means that the slope of the tangent line at x = 2 is 8.
Step 3: Then, the equation of the tangent line is (y − 8) = 8(x − 2).
Step 4: The x-intercept is found by plugging in y = 0 and solving for x.

0 − 8 = 8(x − 2)

Therefore, x = 1.
7. B This is a parametric equation and is solved by eliminating t from the equations and finding a direct relationship between y and x. These problems can often be quite difficult, but, fortunately, on the AP exam, they give only very easy versions of parametric equations.
Step 1:  = sin(t) and  = cos(t)
Step 2: Because sin2 (t) + cos2 (t) = 1, we can substitute and we get  = 1.
This is an ellipse.
8. D You should recognize this as an inverse trigonometric integral of the form , which is sin−1 (u). You also should know this by looking at the answer choices. One of the difficulties of the AP exam is that you are required to recognize many different types of integrals by sight and then know which techniques to use to solve them.
Step 1: First, we need to use a little algebra to convert the integrand to the form.

Rewrite:  =  = 
The integral then becomes  =  = .
Step 2: Now, we can use u-substitution. Let u =  and du =  dx and  du = dx.
We can now rewrite the integral as  =  = .
Step 3: You should have memorized this last integral. It is sin−1−(u) + C.
Step 4: Now, reverse the u-substitution and we have

 sin−1−(u) + C =  sin−1−  + C

9. C To solve this problem, you need to remember how to evaluate limits, particularly of trigonometric functions.
Step 1: As you should recall, the  = 1. (This can be shown with L'Hôpital's Rule. Differentiate the top and bottom of the limit to obtain , which just equals 1.) Thus, we need to find a way to convert this integral into one that looks like .
We can do this with simple substitution. Let y = . Now we can change this limit from  4x sin  to  4 .
Step 2:  = 4(1) = 4
10. D This problem requires you to know derivatives of exponential functions and derivatives of trigonometric functions. Also, whenever you are given restrictions on the domain of a function, pay careful attention to the restrictions.
Step 1: x(t) = ecos(2t)(−2sin(2t))
Step 2: Now that we have the derivative, set it equal to zero.

ecos(2t)(−2sin(2t)) = 0

Step 3: Because ecos(2t) can never equal zero (Did you know this? Make sure that you do!), we only have to set −2sin(2t) equal to zero. This will be true wherever sin(2t) = 0. This will occur whenever 2t = 0, π, 2π,...or when t = 0, , π,...Thus, all three roman numeral answer choices work.
11. B This may appear to be a limit problem, but it is actually testing to see whether you know the definition of the derivative.
Step 1: You should recall that  = f′(x). Thus, if we replace f(x) with sec(x), we can rewrite the problem as

Step 2: The derivative of sec(x) is sec(x)tan(x). Thus,

Step 3: Because sec(π) = −1 and tan(π) = 0, this is equal to 0.
12. C The volume of a cube is V = x3. Using differentials, the change will be dV = 3x2 dx.
Substitute in x = 8 and dx = −0.01, and we get

dV = 3(82)(−0.01)
dV = −1.92

13. C Step 1: An infinite series of the form  rn will converge if |r| < 1. So all we have to do is to set .
Step 2:  means that |a| < |x + 2|.
Step 3: Solving the inequality, a < x + 2 or -a > x + 2 Thus, the two solutions are x < -a − 2 OR x > a − 2, for a > 0.
14. C Step 1: Your first reaction to this integral may very well be "I don't know how to find the integral of an inverse trigonometric function. I know only how to find the derivative of an inverse trigonometric function!" That's okay. This is actually an integration by parts problem. First of all, we are going to ignore the limits of integration until the end of this problem, and just focus on finding the integral itself. As you should recall, the formula for integration by parts is

∫u dv = uv − ∫v du

Step 2: Let: u = sin−1 x and dv = dx.
Then du =  and v = x.
Now, using integration by parts, we have  sin−1 (x) dx = x sin−1 (x) - .
Step 3: We can now solve this latter integral with u-substitution.
Let u = 1 − x2 and du = −2x dx.

 du = x dx

Then we have  = .
Step 4: Substituting back for u gives us  sin−1(x) dx = xsin−1(x) + .
Step 5: Now we evaluate at the limits of integration.

15. A Step 1: This problem requires you to know how to find equations of tangent lines. We will use the point-slope formula of a line: (y − y1) = m(x − x1).
Step 2: When x = 2, y =  = , so x1 = 2 and y1 = 
Step 3:  
This would now require some messy algebra to simplify, but fortunately we don't have to. We can plug in 2 for x right now and solve for  , which simplifies to  = .
Step 4: If we were finding the equation of a tangent line, we would use  for m in the equation, but, as you should recall, because we are finding the equation of the normal line, we use the negative reciprocal of  for m, which is , and plug it into the equation of the line.
Step 5: Now we have (y − y1) = m(x − x1), which becomes y −  =  (x − 2).
Multiply through by 60 to get 60y − 20 = 81x − 162 or 81x − 60y = 142.
16. B Step 1: The Mean Value Theorem for derivatives states that if a function is differentiable on an interval [a, b], then there exists some value c in that interval where  = f′(c).
Step 2:  =  = 0
Step 3: Thus, f ′(c) = 0. Because f ′(c) = 2cos(c), we need to know what value of c makes 2 cos(c) = 0. The value is .
17. D This problem requires you to be familiar with the Mean Value Theorem for integrals, which we use to find the average value of a function.
Step 1: If you want to find the average value of ƒ(x) on an interval [a, b], you need to evaluate the integral  f(x)dx. So here we would evaluate the integral  x lnx dx.
Step 2: We are going to need to do integration by parts to evaluate this integral. Let's ignore the limits of integration for now and just do the integration.
Let u = ln x and dv = x dx.
Then du =  dx and v = .
Now the integral becomes  =  = .
Thus, we have  = 
Step 3:  =  −  = 
This can be simplified to .
Step 4: Don't forget to multiply by . This gives the final result of .
18. B Step 1: The ladder forms a right triangle with the wall, with the ladder itself as the hypotenuse. Whenever we see right triangles in related rates problems, we look to use the Pythagorean theorem.
Call the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground y, and the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall x. Then the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall is , and the rate at which the foot of the ladder is sliding away from the wall is , which is what we need to find. Now we use the Pythagorean theorem to set up the relationships: x2 + y2 = 172.
Step 2: Differentiating both sides we obtain 2x + 2y = 0.
Step 3: Because of the Pythagorean theorem, we also know that, when y = 8, x = 15.
Step 4: Now we plug everything into the equation from Step 2 and solve for .

2(15)  + 2(8)(−5) = 0 and  = 

19. A Step 1: Separate the variables, by putting all of the terms containing y on the left-hand side of the equals sign, and all of the terms containing x on the right-hand side.



Step 2: Integrate both sides.




ln y = 3sin x + C

Whenever we have a differential equation where the solution is in terms of ln y, we always solve the equation for y. This involves raising e to the power of each side. This gives us: eln y = e3sin x + C; y = e3sin x eC; y = Ce3sin x. Now you should notice that eC is just a constant, so we call that C, and write the equation as

y = Ce3sin x

Step 3: Now plug in y = 8 and x = 0 in order to solve for C.

8 = Ce3sin 0 = Ce0 = C
                            8 = C

Step 4: This gives the final equation of y = 8e3sin x.
20. D This problem requires you to find an arc length. This is a simple integral formula.
Step 1: The formula for the arc length of a curve given in parametric form on the interval [a, b] is



Step 2:  = 3 and  = 4t, so  = 
Step 3:  = 
21. D This problem requires you to know how to find the velocity of a moving object.
Step 1: All you need to do to find the velocity of a moving object at a particular instant in time is to take the derivative of its position function at that time; the derivative of et2 = 2tet2 and the derivative of e-t3 = -3 t2 e-t3.
Step 2: Now we plug in 3 for t and we get 2tet2 = 6e9 and -3 t2 e-t3 = −27e−27.
22. D This problem requires you to know how to find the critical points on a graph, which is a crucial part of graphing functions.
Step 1: The points of inflection on a graph are generally at points where the second derivative is zero, but not necessarily at all points where the second derivative is zero. The good thing about the AP exam is that, in the multiple-choice part of the test, you do not have to worry about exceptions to the second derivative rule. Thus, all we have to do here is to take the second derivative of the function and set it equal to zero.

Step 2: When we are setting a rational function equal to zero, all we have to do is set the numerator equal to zero, and that value will be our point of inflection. Always double check that the value that makes the numerator equal to zero does not also make the DENOMINATOR equal to zero. If it does, this is NOT necessarily a point of inflection. There is no point where 11 equals zero, so there is no point of inflection.
23. B Here, we use the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which says that   f(t) dt = f(x). We get:   e3tdt = e3sin x (cos x) − e3cos x (-sin x) = e3sin x (cos x) + e3cos x (sin x)
Remember that we need to use the Chain Rule when we have a function in the limits of integration.
24. D Here we can use u-substitution. We let u = 5 − 2x2 and du = −4x dx, so − du = −4x dx. Now we substitute and we get: . Integrate:  =  + C. Now we just have to substitute back:  + C
25. A This is a maximum/minimum problem. It is usually helpful to draw a picture first, so we know what we are looking for.
Step 1: If we graph y = 4 − x2 and sketch in a rectangle, we get something like the following:

Step 2: Notice that the length of the base of the rectangle is 2x, and the height of the rectangle is y. This means that the area of the rectangle is A = 2xy. If we substitute 4 − x2 for y, we get A = 2x(4 − x2) = 8x − 2x3.
Step 3: If we want to find the maximum area, all we have to do is take the derivative of A and set it equal to zero.

 = 8 − 6x2 = 0
8 = 6x2
x = 

Because the answer is looking for a length, we are satisfied with the positive answer.
Besides, −isn't an answer choice.
26. C If you look at this integral, you should notice that it is similar to the integral.

 = sin−1 x + C

Step 1: If we factor 9 out of the radicand, we can convert our integral into the one above.

Step 2: Now we can use u-substitution. Let u = . Then du =  dx and 3 du = dx.
We get  =  = sin−1u + C.
Step 3: Substituting back, we get

sin−1+ C

27. B This is a limit of an indeterminate form. We use L'Hôpital's Rule to evaluate these limits, but we need to get this into the form  so that we can take the derivative of the top and bottom. We do this using logarithms.
Step 1: First, let y = .
Step 2: Now, take the log of both sides (remember, when we say log, we mean natural log, not common log).
We get ln y = ln , which we can rewrite, using log rules, as ln x or .
Step 3: Now, we can use L'Hôpital's Rule. Take the derivative of the top and bottom.

Be careful! This is NOT the answer! We just found that the limit of ln y → 0; therefore, y → e0 = 1. Whenever you use this technique, remember to reverse the logarithm at the end.
28. B This series is of the form   This, as we know, is the Maclaurin series expansion of sin x. In the problem, we simply have π instead of x. Therefore, this is equal to sinπ = 0.
29. C This is a Taylor series problem. There are four Taylor series that you should memorize. This is one of them. But just in case you didn't memorize it...
Step 1: The formula for a Taylor series about the point x = a is
f(a) + f′(a)(x − a) + f″(a) 
Step 2: First, let's take the first few derivatives of cos x.

f(x) = cos x
f ′(x) = -sin x
f ′′(x) = -cos x
f ′′′(x) = sin x
f(4)(x) = cos x

Step 3: Next, we evaluate each of these at a = 0.

f (0) = cos 0 = 1
f ′(0) = -sin 0 = 0
f ′′(0) = -cos 0 = −1
f ′′′(0) = sin 0 = 0
f(4)(0) = cos 0 = 1

Step 4: Now, if we plug in 0 for a throughout the formula, we get

f (0) + f ′(0)(x) + f″(0)  + 
= 1 + (0)(x) +  + 
 = 

You should make sure to memorize the four Taylor series in the unit. One of them almost always shows up on the AP exam!
30. D Before we integrate, let's simplify the integrand. First, we can factor out sec2 x:  = . Next, we can use the trig identity: 1 − sin2 x = cos2 x to get:  = , which simplifies to  x dx.
Now we integrate: ʃ sec2x dx = tan x + C. .
31. A Here, we can use the trig identity sin2 to rewrite the integrand:  = . We can now break up the integrand:  =  x dx. Both of these are easy integrals. We get:  = 
32. C This will require us to use one of the convergence tests for Infinite series. If we use the Ratio Test, we will be able to tell if the sequence converges, and, if so, to what value.
Step 1:  and . So the Ratio Test says that, if , then the sequence will converge to zero, and if , then the series diverges—in other words, it has no limit.
Step 2:  = 
If we take the limit, .
Because this is less than one, the sequence converges to zero.
33. B This is another partial fractions integral.
Step 1: Write the integrand as  = .
Step 2: Multiply both sides by (2x − 3)(x + 1).
Step 3: Now we have 18x − 17 = A(x + 1) + B(2x − 3).
Step 4: 18x − 17 = Ax + A + 2Bx − 3B
Step 5: 18x − 17 = (Ax + 2Bx) + (A − 3B)
Step 6: 18x − 17 = x(A + 2B) + (A − 3B)
Step 7: Thus: (A + 2B) = 18 and (A − 3B) = −17.
Step 8: Solve this using simultaneous equations to get: A = 4 and B = 7.
Step 9: We can now rewrite the original integral as

Step 10: These are both basic ln integrals, and we get

 = 2ln|2x − 3| + 7 ln|x + 1| + C

34. B This is another arc length problem.
Step 1: The formula for the arc length of a curve given in parametric form on the interval [a, b] is 
Step 2:  = − 3cos2 t sin t and  = 3sin2 t cos t, so

Step 3: Now you have a choice. You can integrate this using your calculator. You should get 1.50.
If you are not comfortable doing this on the calculator, or if you prefer to do the integration, you need to do the following. Reduce the integrand by factoring out sin2 t cos2 t, and we get

Step 4: Using u-substitution, let u = sin t and du = cos t. Then we get

35. D Anytime that you see the word "optimize," you will be doing a maximum/minimum problem. The profit is the number of items sold times the difference between the sales price of each object and its cost. The number of items is x, so the total sales price is 800x − 35x2.
Step 1: Let P equal profit.
P = 800x − 35x2 − (2x3 − 140x2 + 2,600x + 10,000) = −2x3 + 105x2 − 1,800x − 10,000
Step 2:  = −6x2 + 210x − 1,800. Setting it equal to 0 we get

−6x2 + 210x − 1,800 = 0
x2 − 35x + 300 = 0
(x − 20)(x − 15) = 0
x = 15, 20

Step 3: In order to determine which of these is the maximum and which is the minimum, use the second derivative test. The second derivative of profit is  = −12x + 210. At x = 15, we get  = 30, so this is a minimum. At x = 20, we get  = − 30, so this is a maximum. Therefore, the optimum number of units is 20.
36. C Step 1: This problem requires you to know the polar formula for finding the area of a region. The formula is Area = .

 = . Use your calculator to get 51.8363.

If you don't want to do this integral with the calculator, do the following:
If we expand the integrand, we will get three integrals.

The first two integrals are easy and give us

Evaluating the first two integrals, we get .
Step 2: We do the third integral using a trigonometric substitution.

If we simplify this integral, we get

If we add 16π + , we get .
37. C This problem will require you to be familiar with the Trapezoid Rule. This is very easy to do on the calculator, and some of you may even have written programs to evaluate this. Even if you haven't, the formula is easy. The area under a curve from x = a to x = b, divided into n intervals is approximated by the Trapezoid Rule and is

 [y0 + 2y1 + 2y2 + 2y3...+ 2yn − 2 + 2yn − 1 + yn]

This formula may look scary, but it actually is quite simple, and the AP exam never uses a very large value for n anyway.
Step 1: 
Plugging into the formula, we get

 [(33 − 32) + 2(3.253 − 3.252) + 2(3.53 − 3.52) + 2(3.753 − 3.752) + (43 − 42)]

This is easy to plug into your calculator and you will get 31.516.
38. D Step 1: If a series is of the form  and |r| < 1, then the sum of the series is (a), where a is the first term. (Notice that if the series went from one to infinity, instead of zero to infinity, then the formula would be (a). Be careful that you memorize the correct formula. You could avoid this confusion by deriving the formula as you do the problem. To learn how to do that, refer to the unit on Infinite Series.) Here r is cos2 x and a is 1, and |cos2 x| < 1. This is very important. If |r| ≥ 1, the formula doesn't work. So the sum is (1).
Using trigonometric substitution, this sum can be simplified to (1) − .
Now if we plug in  for x, we get (1)  = 2.
39. B This is another volume of a solid of revolution problem. As you should have noticed by now, these are very popular on the AP exam and show up in both the multiple-choice section and in the free-response section. If you are not good at these, go back and review the unit carefully. You cannot afford to get these wrong on the AP exam! The good thing about this volume problem is that it is in the calculator part of the multiple-choice section, so you can use a program and your graphing calculator to assist you with this problem.
Step 1: First, graph the two curves on the same set of axes. The graph should look like the following:

Step 2: Now, look at the answer choices. Notice that each answer choice is the sum of two integrals, and all of the functions are in terms of y. This means that you are going to have to use the method of shells and that you will have to convert the functions from being in terms of x to being in terms of y. Also, when you make a horizontal slice in this region, you are using different curves above and below the intersection point, so you will have to do two integrals. Okay. One thing at a time.
Step 3: First, let's find where the two curves intersect. We can do this either with the calculator or algebraically.
Algebraically, we set the two equations equal to each other.

x2 + 2 = 10 − x2
2x2 = 8
x2 = 4
x = ± 2

We will use x = 2, and plugging in 2 for x, we get y = 6.
Now, we have to find what y is when x = 0. On the lower curve, y = 2. On the higher curve, y = 10. These then are our limits of integration. We will have two integrals, one from 2 to 6, the other from 6 to 10. By process of elimination, this means that the answer can be only (B) or (C).
Step 4: Now, we have to convert each of the equations to terms of y.




Step 5: We are concerned with only the positive roots for this region, so using the Shells formula, we get that the volume is  + .
40. A Remember that this is the calculator part of the test. You can simply evaluate this on your calculator using fnint. If you are not comfortable with this, we will show you how to do this algebraically. This integral requires a trigonometric substitution. These types of integrals require a lot of algebra, so you should leave them for the second pass.
Step 1: Using your calculator, enter fnint ((1/()), x, 0, 4). You should get 1.0986. Evaluate each of the answer choices to see which has the same value, or which is closest.
Step 2: If you are not using your calculator, you first have to do a substitution. Let's ignore the limits of integration for now, and just evaluate the integral. Whenever we have an integral of the form , we do the substitution x = a tan θ. So here we let x = 3 tan θ and dx = 3 sec2 θ dθ.
Substituting into the integrand, we get  dθ.
If we factor 9 out of the radical in the denominator, we get

You should have memorized this integral. It is ln|sec θ + tan θ|.
Step 3: Now we want to evaluate the limits of integration, but in order to do that, we should substitute back for x. If x = 3 tan θ, then  = tan θ. Using the Pythagorean theorem,  = sec θ.
So now we have ln|sec θ + tan θ| = ln . If we evaluate the limits of integration, we get

41. C This is a differential equation. Each AP exam tends to contain one differential equation word problem. They usually give you the same type of equation and are actually not terribly difficult, once you understand the question.
Step 1: The first sentence tells us what the equation is going to be. Let T stand for temperature at a particular time, and S stand for the surrounding temperature. Then our equation is  = k(T − S). Time is always represented by t, and k is a constant.
This equation is solvable using separation of variables. Put everything that contains a T on the left side, and everything that contains a t on the right side.

 = k dt

If we integrate both sides we get .
And performing the integration gives us ln|T − S| = kt + C.
Step 2: Whenever we have an equation of this form, we then exponentiate both sides, giving us

|T − S| = ekt + C or |T − S| = Cekt

If we plug in the rest of the information from the problem, we can solve for the constants k and C.
The initial temperature tells us that at time t = 0, T = 35, and S = 10.
So |35 − 10| = Cek(0) and 25 = C.
Then at time t = 5, T = 25. So

|25 − 10| = 25k(5)
15 = 25ek(5)
 = e5k


This gives us the final equation |T − 10| = .
Step 3: Finally, we plug in the last bit of information, that T = 20 to solve for t.


t = 8.97

42. D Remember that  = . We can use that here:  (x)dx. Now simply substitute the values for the respective integrals:  + 10 = 8. Therefore,  = − 2.
43. CIf you want to find acceleration, all you have to do is take the second derivative of the position functions.
Step 1:
 = −2sin 2t and  = 4cos t
 = −4cos 2t and  = −4sin t
Step 2: Now all we have to do is to graph both of these equations on the same set of axes on a calculator. You should make the window from x = 0 to x = 7 (leave yourself a little room so that you can see the whole range that you need). You should get a picture that looks like the following:

Where the graphs intersect, the acceleration is the same. There are three points of intersection.
44. D You have two options. First, let's do the problem without using the calculator.
If we want to find the minimum, we take the derivative and set it equal to zero. We get  = 3x2 − 7 = 0. Now we solve for x.

3x2 = 7
x2 = 
      x = ±

We are concerned with only positive values of x (note the restriction in the problem), so let's look at x = . First, we have to determine whether this is a minimum or a maximum. The simplest way to do this is with the second derivative test. Take the second derivative and we get  = 6x. Now, plug in x = . The second derivative is positive there, so the point is a minimum.
Next, we plug x =  back into the original equation to find the y-value.
y =  + 11 ≈ 3.872 (rounded to 3 decimal places).
Now, let's do this using the calculator.
Using the TI-82/83, press Y= and enter the graph as Y1 = x3 − 7x + 11.
45. BWe are given that the curve goes through the point (0, 1). We will call the coordinates of this point x0 = 0 and y0 = 1. The slope is found by plugging y0 = 1 into y′ = y, so we have an initial slope of  = 1.
Now we need to find the next set of points.
Step 1: Increase x0 by h to get x1.

x1 = 0.2

Step 2: Multiply h by  and add to y0 to get y1.

y1 = 1 + 0.2(1) = 1.2

Step 3: Find  by plugging y1 into the equation for y′.

 = 1.2

Repeat until you get to x = 1.
Step 1: Increase x1 by h to get x2.

x2 = 0.4

Step 2: Multiply h by  and add to y1 to get y2.

y2 = 1.2 + 0.2(1.2) = 1.44

Step 3: Find  by plugging y2 into the equation for y′.

 = 1.44

Step 1: x3 = x2 + h

x3 = 0.6

Step 2: y3 = y2 + h()

y3 = 1.44 + 0.2(1.44) = 1.728

Step 3:  = y3

 = 1.728

Step 1: x4 = x3 + h

x4 = 0.8

Step 2: y4 = y3 + h()

y4 = 1.728 + 0.2(1.728) = 2.0736

Step 3:  = y4

 = 2.0736

Step 1: x5 = x4 + h

x5 = 1.0

Step 2: y5 = y4 + h()

y5 = 2.0736 + 0.2(2.0736) = 2.48832

We don't need to go any further because we are asked for the value of y when x = 1.
The answer is y = 2.48832.

ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS TO SECTION II

1. Let f be the function given by f(x) = 2x4 − 4x2 + 1.
(a)    Find an equation of the line tangent to the graph at (−2, 17). Verify your answer.
In order to find the equation of a tangent line at a particular point we need to take the derivative of the function and plug in the x and y values at that point to give us the slope of the line.
Step 1: The derivative is: f ′(x) = 8x3 − 8x. If we plug in x = −2, we get

f ′(−2) = 8 (−2)3 − 8 (−2) = −48

This is the slope m.
Step 2: Now we use the point-slope equation of a line, y − y1 = m(x − x1), and plug in the appropriate values of x, y, and m.

y − 17 = −48(x + 2)

If we simplify this we get y = −48x − 79.
(b)    Find the x- and y-coordinates of the relative maxima and relative minima.
If we want to find the maxima/minima, we need to take the derivative and set it equal to zero. The values that we get are called critical points. We will then test each point to see if it is a maximum or a minimum.
Step 1: We already have the first derivative from part (a), so we can just set it equal to zero: 8x3 − 8x = 0.
If we now solve this for x, we get

8x(x2 − 1) = 0 8x(x + 1)(x − 1) = 0 x = 0, 1, −1

These are our critical points. In order to test if a point is a maximum or a minimum, we usually use the second derivative test. We plug each of the critical points into the second derivative. If we get a positive value, the point is a relative minimum. If we get a negative value, the point is a relative maximum. If we get zero, the point is a point of inflection.
Step 2: The second derivative is f ′′(x) = 24x2 − 8. If we plug in the critical points, we get

f ′′(0) = 24(0)2 − 8 = −8
f ′′(1) = 24(1)2 − 8 = 16
f ′′(−1) = 24(−1)2 − 8 = 16

So x = 0 is a relative maximum, and x = 1, −1 are relative minima.
Step 3: In order to find the y-coordinates, we plug the x-values back into the original equation and solve.

f (0) = 1
f(1) = −1
f(−1) = −1

This yields the following points:

(0, 1) is a relative maximum
(1, −1) is a relative minimum
(−1, −1) is a relative minimum

(c)    Find the x-coordinates of the points of inflection. Verify your answer.
If we want to find the points of inflection, we set the second derivative equal to zero. The values that we get are the x-coordinates of the points of inflection.
Step 1: We already have the second derivative from part (b), so all we have to do is set it equal to zero and solve for x.

24x2 − 8 = 0  x2 =   

2. Water is draining at the rate of 48π ft3/sec from a conical tank whose diameter at its base is 40 feet and whose height is 60 feet.
(a)    Find an expression for the volume of water (in ft3) in the tank in terms of its radius at the surface of the water.
The formula for the volume of a cone is: V =  πr2 h, where r is the radius of the cone, and h is the height. The ratio of the height of a cone to its radius is constant at any point on the edge of the cone, so we also know that  (remember that the radius is half the diameter). If we solve this for h and substitute, we get

h = 3r
V =  πr2 (3r) = πr3

(b)    At what rate (in ft/sec) is the radius of the water in the tank shrinking when the radius is 16 feet?
Step 1: This is a related rates question. We now have a formula for the volume of the cone in terms of its radius, so if we differentiate it in terms of t we should be able to solve for the rate of change of the radius .
We are given that the rate of change of the volume and the radius are, respectively

 = 48p and r = 16

Differentiating the formula for the volume, we get  = 3πr2.
Now we plug in and get 48π = 3π162. Finally, if we solve for , we get  =  ft/sec.
(c)    How fast (in ft/sec) is the height of the water in the tank dropping at the instant that the radius is 16 feet?
Step 1: This is the same idea as the previous problem, except that we want to solve for . In order to do this, we need to go back to our ratio of height to radius and solve it for the radius.

Substituting for r in the original equation, we get V = .
Step 2: Now, we need to know what h is when r is 16. Using our ratio,

h = 3(16) = 48

Step 3: Now, if we differentiate, we get .
Now we plug in and solve.

One should also note that, because h = 3r,  = 3  in part (b), we merely had to multiply it by 3 to find the answer for part (c).
3. Two particles travel in the xy-plane. For time t ≥ 0, the position of particle A is given by x = t + 1 and y = (t + 1)2 − 2t − 2, and the position of particle B is given by x = 4t − 2 and y = −2t + 2.
(a)    Find the velocity vector for each particle at time t = 2.
Step 1: Because velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time, all we have to do is take the derivative of each of the position functions.
Particle A: The position of the x-coordinate is t + 1, the x-component of the velocity is 1.
The position of the y-coordinate is (t + 1)2 − 2t − 2, the y-component of the velocity is 2(t + 1)(1) − 2 = 2t.
Particle B: The position of the x-coordinate is 4t − 2, the x-component of the velocity is 4.
The position of the y-coordinate is −2t + 2, the y-component of the velocity is −2.
Step 2: Now all we have to do is plug in.
At t = 2, particle A's velocity vector is (1, 4).
At t = 2, particle B's velocity vector is (4, −2).
(b)    Set up an integral expression for the distance traveled by particle A from time t = 1 to t = 3. Do not evaluate the integral.
Step 1: We are being asked to find the arc length of a curve in parametric form. The formula is , where the starting time is a, and the ending time is b.
Plugging into the formula, we get  dt = 
(c)    At what time do the two particles collide? Justify your answer.
Step 1: The particles collide when they have the same x- and y-coordinates. If we set the equations for the x-coordinates of the two particles equal, we get

t + 1 = 4t − 2 so t = 1

At this time, the y-coordinate for particle A is (1 + 1)2 − 2(1) − 2 = 0.
The y-coordinate for particle B is: −2(1) + 2 = 0. These are the same, so at time t = 1, the two particles collide.
(d)    Sketch the path of both particles from time t = 0 to t = 4. Indicate the direction of each particle along its path.
Below is the sketch of the paths of the particles.

4. Let f be the function given by f(x) = e−4x2.
(a)    Find the first four non-zero terms and the general term of the power series for f(x) about x = 0.
Step 1: If we want to find the power series we need to do the Taylor series expansion for f(x). The formula for a Taylor series about the point x = a is

f(a) + f ′(a)(x − a) +  

Here a = 0 and f(x) = e−4x2. You should have memorized the Taylor series expansion eu = 1 + u + , so you don't have to do all of the work here. You can just substitute −4x2 for u.

e−4x2 = 1 + (−4x2) +  = 1 − 4x2 + 8x4 − 

Step 2: The general term is .
(b)    Find the interval of convergence of the power series for f(x) about x = 0. Show the analysis that leads to your conclusion.
Step 1: The series for e-u2 converges for − ∞ < u < ∞. So the series for f(x) = e−4x2 converges if -∞ < 2x < ∞. Thus, it converges if -∞ < x < ∞.
(c)    Use term-by-term differentiation to show that f ′(x) = −8xe−4x2.
Step 1: First, we differentiate the individual terms of the power series.

f(x) = 1 − 4x2 + 8x4 − 
f ′(x) = 0 − 8x + 32x3 − 64x5 +...+ 
= −8x + 32x3 − 64x5 +...+ 

Step 2: Next, we multiply −8x by the individual terms of the power series and compare to the result of step 1.
−8xf(x) = 1(−8x) − 4x2(−8x) + 8x4(−8x) −  
= −8x + 32x3 − 64x5 +...+ 
Step 3: If we substitute n − 1 for n, we can make the general terms match exactly.

5. Let R be the region enclosed by the graphs of y = 2ln x and y =  and the lines x = 2 and x = 8.
(a)    Find the area of R.
Step 1: If there are two curves, f(x) and g(x), where f(x) is always above g(x), on the interval [a, b], then the area of the region between the two curves is found by

 (f(x) g(x)) dx

In order to determine whether one of the curves is above the other, we can graph them on the calculator.
The graph looks like the following:

As we can see, the graph of y = 2ln x is above y =  on the entire interval, so all we have to do is evaluate the integral .
Step 2: We can do the integration one of two ways—on the calculator or analytically.
Calculator: You should get 3.498.
Analytically:  = 

 = 18.498−15=3.498

By the way, you should have memorized ∫ ln x dx = x ln x − x, or you can do it as one of the basic integration-by-parts integrals.
(b)    Set up, but do not integrate, an integral expression, in terms of a single variable, for the volume of the solid generated when R is revolved about the x-axis.
Step 1: If there are two curves, f(x) and g(x), where f(x) is always above g(x), on the interval [a, b], then the volume of the solid generated when the region is revolved about the x-axis is found by using the method of washers.

Here, we already know that f(x) is above g(x) on the interval, so the integral we need to evaluate is .
(c)    Set up, but do not integrate, an integral expression, in terms of a single variable, for the volume of the solid generated when R is revolved about the line x = −1.
Step 1: Now we have to revolve the area around a vertical axis. If there are two curves, f(x) and g(x), where f(x) is always above g(x), on the interval [a, b], then the volume of the solid generated when the region is revolved about the y-axis is found by using the method of shells.

When we are rotating around a vertical axis, we use the same formula as when we rotate around the y-axis, but we have to account for the shift away from x = 0. Here we have a curve that is 1 unit farther away from the line x = −1 than it is from the y-axis, so we add 1 to the radius of the shell (for a more detailed explanation of shifting axes, see the unit on finding the volume of a solid of revolution). This gives us the equation

6. Let f and g be functions that are differentiable throughout their domains and that have the following properties:
(i) f(x + y) = f(x)g(y) + g(x)f(y)
(ii)  f(a) = 0
(iii) 
(iv) f ′(0) = 1
(a)    Use L'Hôpital's Rule to show that  = 1.
Step 1: L'Hôpital's Rule states that if a function is of the indeterminate form , then the limit of the derivatives of the numerator is the same as the limit of the original quotient. In other words, if we differentiate the top and bottom of the quotient, we will get the limit. First, we have to show that the quotient gives us an indeterminate form.

 f(a) = 0 (using property (ii))

Next, we differentiate the top and bottom and take the limit.

 = f ′(0) = 1 (using property (iv))

(b)    Use the definition of the derivative to show that f ′(x) = g(x).
Step 1: The definition of the derivative states: f ′(x) = 
If we substitute into the formula, we get

f ′(x) =  =  (using property (i))
 = 
 +  = [f(x)](0) + g(x)(1) = g(x) (using property (iii))

(c)    Find .
Step 1: Using u-substitution, let u = f(x) and du = f ′(x) = g(x). Then we have

 = ln|u| + C = |ln f(x)| + C

AB CALCULUS VS. BC CALCULUS
AP Calculus is divided into two types: AB and BC. The former is supposed to be the equivalent of a semester of college calculus; the latter, a year. In truth, AB calculus covers closer to three quarters of a year of college calculus. In fact, the main difference between the two is that BC calculus tests some more theoretical aspects of calculus and it covers a few additional topics. In addition, BC calculus is harder than AB calculus. The AB exam usually tests straightforward problems in each topic. They're not too tricky and they don't vary very much. The BC exam asks harder questions. But neither exam is tricky, in the sense that the SAT is. Nor do they test esoteric aspects of calculus. Rather, both tests tend to focus on testing whether you've learned the basics of differential and integral calculus. The tests are difficult because of the breadth of topics that they cover, not the depth. You will probably find that many of the problems in this book seem easier than the problems you've had in school. This is because your teacher is giving you problems that are harder than those on the AP.

Please note that this book will focus only on the topics that will appear on the AP Calculus BC test. If you are looking to prepare for the AP Calculus AB exam, please purchase Cracking the AP Calculus AB Exam in stores now!

STRUCTURE OF THE EXAM
Now, some words about the test itself. The AP exam comes in two parts. First, there is a section of multiple-choice questions covering a variety of calculus topics. The multiple-choice section has two parts. Part A consists of 30 questions; you are not permitted to use a calculator on this section. Part B consists of 15 questions; you are permitted to use a calculator on this part. These two parts comprise a total of 45 questions.
After that, there is a free-response section consisting of six questions, each of which requires you to write out the solutions and the steps by which you solved it. You are permitted to use a calculator for the first two problems but not for the four other problems. Partial credit is given for various steps in the solution of each problem. You'll usually be required to sketch a graph in one of the questions. The College Board does you a big favor here: You may use a graphing calculator. In fact, The College Board recommends it! And they allow you to use programs as well. But here's the truth about calculus: Most of the time, you don't need the calculator anyway. Remember: These are the people who bring you the SAT. Any gift from them should be regarded skeptically!
OVERVIEW OF CONTENT TOPICS
This list is drawn from the topical outline for AP calculus furnished by the College Board. You might find that your teacher covers some additional topics, or omits some, in your course. Some of the topics are very broad, so we cannot guarantee that this book covers these topics exhaustively.

I. Functions, Graphs, and Limits
A. Analysis of Graphs
• You should be able to analyze a graph based on "the interplay between geometric and analytic information." The preceding phrase comes directly from the College Board. Don't let it scare you. What the College Board really means is that you should have covered graphing in precalculus, and you should know (a) how to graph and (b) how to read a graph. This is a precalculus topic and we won't cover it in this book.
B. Limits
• You should be able to calculate limits algebraically or to estimate them from a graph or from a table of data.
• You do not need to find limits using the Delta-Epsilon definition of a limit.
C. Asymptotes
• You should understand asymptotes graphically and be able to compare the growth rates of different types of functions (namely polynomial functions, logarithmic functions, and exponential functions). This is a topic that should have been covered in precalculus, and we won't cover it in this book.
• You should understand asymptotes in terms of limits involving infinity.
D. Continuity
• You should be able to test the continuity of a function in terms of limits, and you should understand continuous functions graphically.
• You should understand the intermediate value theorem and the extreme value theorem.
E. Parametric, Polar, and Vector Functions
• You should be able to analyze plane curves given in any of these three forms. Usually, you will be asked to convert from one of these three forms back to Rectangular Form (also known as Cartesian Form).


II. Differential Calculus
A. The Definition of the Derivative
• You should be able to find a derivative by finding the limit of the difference quotient.
• You should also know the relationship between differentiability and continuity. That is, if a function is differentiable at a point, it's continuous there. But if a function is continuous at a point, it's not necessarily differentiable there.
B. Derivative at a Point
• You should know the Power Rule, the Product Rule, the Quotient Rule, and the Chain Rule.
• You should be able to find the slope of a curve at a point, and the tangent and normal lines to a curve at a point.
• You should also be able to use local linear approximation and differentials to estimate the tangent line to a curve at a point.
• You should be able to find the instantaneous rate of change of a function using the derivative or the limit of the average rate of change of a function.
• You should be able to approximate the rate of change of a function from a graph or from a table of values.
• You should be able to find Higher-Order Derivatives and to use Implicit Differentiation.
C. Derivative of a Function
• You should be able to relate the graph of a function to the graph of its derivative, and vice-versa.
• You should know the relationship between the sign of a derivative and whether the function is increasing or decreasing (positive derivative means increasing; negative means decreasing).
• You should know how to find relative and absolute maxima and minima.
• You should know the Mean Value Theorem for derivatives and Rolle's theorem.
D. Second Derivative
• You should be able to relate the graph of a function to the graph of its derivative and its second derivative, and vice-versa. This is tricky.
• You should know the relationship between concavity and the sign of the second derivative (positive means concave up; negative means concave down).
• You should know how to find points of inflection.
E. Applications of Derivatives
• You should be able to sketch a curve using first and second derivatives and be able to analyze the critical points.
• You should be able to solve Optimization problems (Max/Min problems), and Related Rates problems.
• You should be able to find the derivative of the inverse of a function.
• You should be able to solve Rectilinear Motion problems.
F. More Applications of Derivatives
• You should be able to analyze planar curves in parametric, polar, and vector form, including velocity and acceleration vectors.
• You should be able to use Euler's Method to find numerical solutions of differential equations.

GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THIS BOOK
The key to doing well on the exam is to memorize a variety of techniques for solving calculus problems and to recognize when to use them. There's so much to learn in AP calculus that it's difficult to remember everything. Instead, you should be able to derive or figure out how to do certain things based on your mastery of a few essential techniques. In addition, you'll be expected to remember a lot of the math that you did before calculus—particularly trigonometry. You should be able to graph functions, find zeros, derivatives, and integrals with the calculator.
Furthermore, if you can't derive certain formulas, you should memorize them! A lot of students don't bother to memorize the trigonometry special angles and formulas because they can do them on their calculators. This is a big mistake. You'll be expected to be very good with these angles and formulas in calculus, and if you can't recall them easily, you'll be slowed down and the problems will seem much harder. Make sure that you're also comfortable with analytic geometry. If you rely on your calculator to graph for you, you'll get a lot of questions wrong because you won't recognize the curves when you see them.
This advice is going to seem backward compared with what your teachers are telling you. In school you're often yelled at for memorizing things. Teachers tell you to understand the concepts, not just memorize the answers. Well, things are different here. The understanding will come later, after you're comfortable with the mechanics. In the meantime, you should learn techniques and practice them, and, through repetition, you will ingrain them in your memory.
Each chapter is divided into three types of problems: examples, solved problems, and practice problems. The first type is contained in the explanatory portion of the unit. The examples are designed to further your understanding of the subject and to show you how to get the problems right. Each step of the solution to the example is worked out, except for some simple algebraic and arithmetic steps that should come easily to you at this point.
The second type is solved problems. The solutions are worked out in approximately the same detail as the examples. Before you start work on each of these, cover the solution with an index card or something, then check the solution afterward. And you should read through the solution, not just assume that you knew what you were doing because your answer was correct.
The third type is practice problems. Only the answer explanations to these are given. We hope you'll find that each chapter offers enough practice problems for you to be comfortable with the material. The topics that are emphasized on the exam have more problems; those that are de-emphasized have fewer. In other words, if a chapter has only a few practice problems, it's not an important topic on the AP exam and you shouldn't worry too much about it.

HOW AP EXAMS ARE USED
Different colleges use AP Exams in different ways, so it is important that you go to a particular college's website to determine how it uses AP Exams. The three items below are the main ways in which AP Exam scores can be used.

• College Credit. Some colleges will give you college credit if you score well on an AP Exam. These credits count towards your graduation requirements, meaning that you can take fewer courses while in college. Given the cost of college, this could be quite a benefit, indeed.
• Satisfy Requirements. Some colleges will allow you to "place out" of certain requirements if you do well on an AP Exam, even if they do not give you actual college credits. For example, you might not need to take an introductory-level course, or perhaps you might not need to take a class in a certain discipline at all.
• Admissions Plus. Even if your AP Exam will not result in college credit or even allow you to place out of certain courses, most colleges will respect your decision to push yourself by taking an AP Course or even an AP Exam outside of a course. A high score on an AP Exam shows mastery of more difficult content than is taught in many high school courses, and colleges may take that into account during the admissions process.

OTHER RESOURCES
There are many resources available to help you improve your score on the AP Calculus BC Exam, not the least of which are your teachers. If you are taking an AP class, you may be able to get extra attention from your teacher, such as obtaining feedback on your free-response questions. If you are not in an AP course, reach out to a teacher who teaches calculus, and ask if the teacher will review your free-response questions or otherwise help you with content.
Another wonderful resource is AP Central, the official site of the AP Exams. The scope of the information at this site is quite broad and includes:

• A course description, which includes details on what content is covered and sample questions
• Sample test questions
• Free-response prompts from previous years

The AP Central home page address is: http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/.

1 How to Approach Multiple-Choice Questions
2 How to Approach Free-Response Questions










PREVIEW ACTIVITY
Review your responses to the first three questions on this page of the Introduction, and then respond to the following questions:

•  How many multiple-choice questions did you miss even though you knew the answer?
• On how many multiple-choice questions did you guess blindly?
• How many multiple-choice questions did you miss after eliminating some answers and guessing based on the remaining answers?
• Did you find any of the free-response questions easier or harder than the others—and, if so, why?

HOW TO USE THE CHAPTERS IN THIS PART
For the following Strategy chapters, think about what you are doing now before you read the chapters. As you read and engage in the directed practice, be sure to appreciate the ways you can change your approach. At the end of each chapter in Part Three, you will have the opportunity to reflect on how you will change your approach.









Chapter 1
How to Approach Multiple-Choice Questions
CRACKING THE MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
Section I of the AP Calculus Exam consists of 45 multiple-choice questions, which you're given 105 minutes to complete. This section is worth 50 percent of your grade.
All the multiple-choice questions will have a similar format: Each will be followed by four answer choices. At times, it may seem that there could be more than one possible correct answer. There is only one! Remember that the committee members who write these questions are calculus teachers. So, when it comes to calculus, they know how students think and what kind of mistakes they make. Answers resulting from common mistakes are often included in the four answer choices to trap you.
Use the Answer Sheet
For the multiple-choice section, you write the answers not in the test booklet but on a separate answer sheet (very similar to the ones we've supplied at the very end of this book). Four oval-shaped bubbles follow the question number, one for each possible answer. Don't forget to fill in all your answers on the answer sheet. Don't just mark them in the test booklet. Marks in the test booklet will not be graded. Also, make sure that your filled-in answers correspond to the correct question numbers! Check your answer sheet after every four answers to make sure you haven't skipped any bubbles by mistake.
Should You Guess?
Use process of elimination (POE) to rule out answer choices you know are wrong and increase your chances of guessing the right answer. Read all the answer choices carefully. Eliminate the ones that you know are wrong. If you only have one answer choice left, choose it, even if you're not completely sure why it's correct. Remember: Questions in the multiple-choice section are graded by a computer, so it doesn't care how you arrived at the correct answer.
Even if you can't eliminate answer choices, go ahead and guess. AP exams no longer include a guessing penalty of a quarter of a point for each incorrect answer. You will be assessed only on the total number of correct answers, so be sure to fill in all the bubbles even if you have no idea what the correct answers are. When you get to questions that are too time-consuming, or that you don't know the answer to (and can't eliminate any options), don't just fill in any answer. Use what we call "your letter of the day" (LOTD). Selecting the same answer choice each time you guess will increase your odds of getting a few of those skipped questions right.
Use the Two-Pass System
Remember that you have about two and a quarter minutes per question on this section of the exam. Do not waste time by lingering too long over any single question. If you're having trouble, move on to the next question. After you finish all the questions, you can come back to the ones you skipped.
The best strategy is to go through the multiple-choice section twice. The first time, do all the questions that you can answer fairly quickly—the ones where you feel confident about the correct answer. On this first pass, skip the questions that seem to require more thinking or the ones you need to read two or three times before you understand them. Circle the questions that you've skipped in the question booklet so that you can find them easily in the second pass. You must be very careful with the answer sheet by making sure the filled-in answers correspond correctly to the questions.
Once you have gone through all the questions, go back to the ones that you skipped in the first pass. But don't linger too long on any one question even in the second pass. Spending too much time wrestling over a hard question can cause two things to happen: One, you may run out of time and miss out on answering easier questions in the later part of the exam. Two, your anxiety might start building up, and this could prevent you from thinking clearly, which would make answering other questions even more difficult. If you simply don't know the answer, or can't eliminate any of them, just use your LOTD and move on.
REFLECT
Respond to the following questions:

• How long will you spend on multiple-choice questions?
• How will you change your approach to multiple-choice questions?
• What is your multiple-choice guessing strategy?










Chapter 2
How to Approach Free-Response Questions
CRACKING FREE RESPONSE QUESTIONS
Section II is worth 50 percent of your grade on the AP Calculus Exam. This section is composed of two parts. Part A contains two free-response questions (you may use a calculator on this part); Part B contains four free-response questions where there are no calculators allowed. You're given a total of 90 minutes for this section.
Clearly Explain and Justify Your Answers
Remember that your answers to the free-response questions are graded by readers and not by computers. Communication is a very important part of AP Calculus. Compose your answers in precise sentences. Just getting the correct numerical answer is not enough. You should be able to explain your reasoning behind the technique that you selected and communicate your answer in the context of the problem. Even if the question does not explicitly say so, always explain and justify every step of your answer, including the final answer. Do not expect the graders to read between the lines. Explain everything as though somebody with no knowledge of calculus is going to read it. Be sure to present your solution in a systematic manner using solid logic and appropriate language. And remember: Although you won't earn points for neatness, the graders can't give you a grade if they can't read and understand your solution!
Use Only the Space You Need
Do not try to fill up the space provided for each question. The space given is usually more than enough. The people who design the tests realize that some students write in big letters or make mistakes and need extra space for corrections. So if you have a complete solution, don't worry about the extra space. Writing more will not earn you extra credit. In fact, many students tend to go overboard and shoot themselves in the foot by making a mistake after they've already written the right answer.
Read the Whole Question!
Some questions might have several subparts. Try to answer them all, and don't give up on the question if one part is giving you trouble. For example, if the answer to part (b) depends on the answer to part (a), but you think you got the answer to part (a) wrong, you should still go ahead and do part (b) using your answer to part (a) as required. Chances are that the grader will not mark you wrong twice, unless it is obvious from your answer that you should have discovered your mistake.
Use Common Sense
Always use your common sense in answering questions. For example, on one free-response question that asked students to compute the mean weight of newborn babies from given data, some students answered 70 pounds. It should have been immediately obvious that the answer was probably off by a decimal point. A 70-pound baby would be a giant! This is an important mistake that should be easy to fix. Some mistakes may not be so obvious from the answer. However, the grader will consider simple, easily recognizable errors to be very important.
REFLECT
Respond to the following questions:

• How much time will you spend on each free-response question?
• How will you change your approach to the free-response questions?
• Will you seek further help, outside of this book (such as a teacher, tutor, or AP Central), on how to approach the calculus exam?

Chapter 3
Limits
WHAT IS A LIMIT?
In order to understand calculus, you need to know what a "limit" is. A limit is the value a function (which usually is written "f(x)" on the AP exam) approaches as the variable within that function (usually "x") gets nearer and nearer to a particular value. In other words, when x is very close to a certain number, what is f(x) very close to? As far as the AB test is concerned, that's all you have to know about evaluating limits. There's a more technical method that you BC students have to learn, but we won't discuss it until we have to—at the end of this chapter.
Let's look at an example of a limit: What is the limit of the function f(x) = x2 as x approaches 2? In limit notation, the expression "the limit of f(x) as x approaches 2" is written like this:  f(x). In order to evaluate the limit, let's check out some values of  f(x) as x increases and gets closer to 2 (without ever exactly getting there).

When x = 1.9, f(x) = 3.61.
When x = 1.99, f(x) = 3.9601.
When x = 1.999, f(x) = 3.996001.
When x = 1.9999, f(x) = 3.99960001.

As x increases and approaches 2, f(x) gets closer and closer to 4. This is called the left-hand limit and is written:  f(x). Notice the little minus sign!
What about when x is bigger than 2?

When x = 2.1, f(x) = 4.41.
When x = 2.01, f(x) = 4.0401.
When x = 2.001, f(x) = 4.004001.
When x = 2.0001, f(x) = 4.00040001.

As x decreases and approaches 2, f(x) still approaches 4. This is called the right-hand limit and is written like this:  f(x). Notice the little plus sign!
We got the same answer when evaluating both the left- and right-hand limits, because when x is 2, f(x) is 4. You should always check both sides of the independent variable because, as you'll see shortly, sometimes you don't get the same answer. Therefore, we write that  x2 = 4.
We didn't really need to look at all of these decimal values to know what was going to happen when x got really close to 2. But it's important to go through the exercise because, typically, the answers get a lot more complicated. Let's do a few examples.
Example 1: Find  x2.
The approach is simple: Plug in 5 for x, and you get 25.
Example 2: Find  x3.
Here the answer is 27.
There are some simple algebraic rules of limits that you should know. These are:


 kf(x) = k  f(x)


Example:  3x2 = 3  x2 = 75


If  f(x) = L1 and  g(x) = L2, then  = L1 + L2

Example:  =  = 150


If  f(x) = L1 and  g(x) = L2, then  = L1 · L2


Example:  =  = 52
Example 3: Find .
Plug in 0, and you get 0.
So far, so good. All you do to find the limit of a simple polynomial is plug in the number that the variable is approaching and see what the answer is. Naturally, the process can get messier—especially if x approaches zero.
Example 4: Find .
If you plug in some very small values for x, you'll see that this function approaches ∞. And it doesn't matter whether x is positive or negative, you still get ∞. Look at the graph of :

On either side of x = 0 (the y-axis), the curve approaches ∞.
Example 5: Find .
Here you have a problem. If you plug in some very small positive values for x (0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and so on), you approach ∞. In other words, . But, if you plug in some very small negative values for x (−0.1, −0.01, −0.001, and so on) you approach -∞. That is, . Because the right-hand limit is not equal to the left-hand limit, the limit does not exist.
Look at the graph of .

You can see that on the left side of x = 0, the curve approaches -∞, and on the right side of x = 0, the curve approaches ∞. There are some very important points that we need to emphasize from the last two examples.
Why do we state the limit in Example 4 but not for Example 5? Because when we have , the function is always positive no matter what the sign of x is and thus the function has the same limit from the left and the right. But when we have , the function's sign depends on the sign of x, and you get a different limit from each side.
Let's look at a few examples in which the independent variable approaches infinity.



(1) If the left-hand limit of a function is not equal to the right-hand limit of the function, then the limit does not exist.
(2) A limit equal to infinity is not the same as a limit that does not exist, but sometimes you will see the expression "no limit," which serves both purposes. If  f(x) = ∞, the limit, technically, does not exist.
(3) If k is a positive constant, then  = ∞,  = −∞, and  does not exist.
(4) If k is a positive constant, then  = ∞,   = ∞, and  = ∞.



Example 6: Find .
As x gets bigger and bigger, the value of the function gets smaller and smaller. Therefore,  = 0.
Example 7: Find .
It's the same situation as the one in Example 6; as x decreases (approaches negative infinity), the value of the function increases (approaches zero). We write the following:

 = 0

We don't have the same problem here that we did when x approached zero because "positive zero" is the same thing as "negative zero," whereas positive infinity is different from negative infinity.
Here's another rule.


If k and n are constants, |x| > 1, and n > 0, then  = 0, and .


Example 8: Find .
When you have variables on both the top and the bottom, you can't just plug ∞ into the expression. You'll get . We solve this by using the following technique:
When an expression consists of a polynomial divided by another polynomial, divide each term of the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of x that appears in the expression.
The highest power of x in this case is x1, so we divide every term in the expression (both top and bottom) by x, like so:

Now when we take the limit, the two terms containing x approach zero. We're left with .
Example 9: Find .
Divide each term by x2. You get

Example 10: Find .
Divide each term by x10.

The other powers don't matter, because they're all going to disappear. Now we have three new rules for evaluating the limit of a rational expression as x approaches infinity.

Remember to focus your attention on the highest power of x.




(1) If the highest power of x in a rational expression is in the numerator, then the limit as x approaches infinity is infinity.



Example: 



(2) If the highest power of x in a rational expression is in the denominator, then the limit as x approaches infinity is zero.



Example: 



(3) If the highest power of x in a rational expression is the same in both the numerator and denominator, then the limit as x approaches infinity is the coefficient of the highest term in the numerator divided by the coefficient of the highest term in the denominator.


Example: 
LIMITS OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
At some point during the exam, you'll have to find the limit of certain trig expressions, usually as x approaches either zero or infinity. There are four standard limits that you should memorize—with those, you can evaluate all of the trigonometric limits that appear on the test. As you'll see throughout this book, calculus requires that you remember all of your trig from previous years.


Rule No. 1:  (x is in radians, not degrees)





This may seem strange, but if you look at the graphs of f(x) = sin x and f(x) = x, they have approximately the same slope near the origin (as x gets closer to zero). Because x and the sine of x are about the same as x approaches zero, their quotient will be very close to one. Furthermore, because  cos x = 1 (review cosine values if you don't get this!), we know that .

Remember that the  sin x = 0.

Now we will find a second rule. Let's evaluate the limit . First, multiply the top and bottom by cos x + 1. We get . Now simplify the limit to: . Next, we can use the trigonometric identity sin2 x = 1 cos2 x and rewrite the limit as: . Now, break this into two limits: . The first limit is −1 (see Rule No. 1) and the second is 0 (why?), so the limit is 0.


Rule No. 2: 





Example 11: Find .
Use a simple trick: Multiply the top and bottom of the expression by 3. This gives us: . Next, substitute a letter for 3x; for example, a. Now, we get the following:

Example 12: Find .
Now we get a bit more sophisticated. First, divide both the numerator and the denominator by x, like so:

Next, multiply the top and bottom of the numerator by 5, and the top and bottom of the denominator by 4, which gives us

From the work we did in Example 11, we can see that this limit is .
Guess what! You have two more rules!


Rule No. 3: 
Rule No. 4: 





Example 13: Find .
Using trigonometric identities, you can replace (1 − cos2x) with sin2x.

Here are other examples for you to try, with answers right beneath them. Give 'em a try, and check your work.

If plugging in the value of x results in the denominator equaling zero and you cannot factor the quotient anymore, then check the left and right hand limits to find the limit of the expression.

PROBLEM 1. Find .
Answer: If you plug in 3 for x, you get .
PROBLEM 2. Find .
Answer: The left-hand limit is: 
The right-hand limit is: 
These two limits are not the same. Therefore, the limit does not exist.
PROBLEM 3. Find .
Answer: The left-hand limit is: 
The right-hand limit is: 
These two limits are the same, so the limit is ∞.
PROBLEM 4. Find .
Answer: If you plug −4 into the top and bottom, you get . You have to factor the top into (x + 2)(x + 4) to get this: 
Now it's time to cancel like terms:  =  (x + 2) = −2
PROBLEM 5. Find .
Answer: Divide each term by x2.

PROBLEM 6. Find .
Answer: Replace tan x with , which changes the expression into

Because  = 1, the  = 1 as well. Thus, because  = 1 and , the answer is 4.
Problem 7. Find . Answer: First, expand and simplify the numerator.

Next, factor h out of the numerator and the denominator.

Taking the limit you get:  (10 + h) = 10.

Note: Pay careful attention to this next solved problem. It will be very important when you work on problems in Chapter 6.

Chapter 4
Continuity
Every AP exam has a few questions on continuity, so it's important to understand the basic idea of what it means for a function to be continuous. The concept is very simple: If the graph of the function doesn't have any breaks or holes in it within a certain interval, the function is continuous over that interval.
Simple polynomials are continuous everywhere; it's the other ones—trigonometric, rational, piecewise—that might have continuity problems. Most of the test questions concern these last types of functions. In order to learn how to test whether a function is continuous, you'll need some more mathematical terminology.
THE DEFINITION OF CONTINUITY
In order for a function f(x) to be continuous at a point x = c, it must fulfill all three of the following conditions:


Condition 1: f(c) exists.
Condition 2:  f(x) exists.
Condition 3:  f(x) = f(c)



Let's look at a simple example of a continuous function.
Example 1: Is the function f(x) =  continuous at the point x = 2?
Condition 1: Does f(2) exist?
Yes. It's equal to 2(2) − 1 = 3.
Condition 2: Does  f(x) exist?
You need to look at the limit from both sides of 2. The left-hand limit is:  f(x) = 2 + 1 = 3. The right-hand limit is:  f(x) = 2(2) − 1 = 3.
Because the two limits are the same, the limit exists.
Condition 3: Does  f(x) = f(2)?
The two equal each other, so yes; the function is continuous at x = 2.
A simple and important way to check whether a function is continuous is to sketch the function. If you can't sketch the function without lifting your pencil from the paper at some point, then the function is not continuous.
Now let's look at some examples of functions that are not continuous.
Example 2: Is the function f(x) =  continuous at x = 2?
Condition 1: Does f(2) exist?
Nope. The function of x is defined if x is greater than or less than 2, but not if x is equal to 2. Therefore, the function is not continuous at x = 2. Notice that we don't have to bother with the other two conditions. Once you find a problem, the function is automatically not continuous, and you can stop.
Example 3: Is the function f(x) =  continuous at x = 2?
Condition 1: Does f(x) exist?
Yes. It is equal to 2(2) + 1 = 5.
Condition 2: Does  f(x) exist?
The left-hand limit is:  f(x) = 2 + 1 = 3.
The right-hand limit is:  f(x) = 2(2) + 1 = 5.
The two limits don't match, so the limit doesn't exist and the function is not continuous at x = 2.
Example 4: Is the function f(x) =  continuous at x = 2?
Condition 1: Does f(2) exist?
Yes. It's equal to 22 = 4.
Condition 2: Does  f(x) exist?
The left-hand limit is:  f(x) = 2 + 1 = 3.
The right-hand limit is:  f(x) = 2(2) − 1 = 3.
Because the two limits are the same, the limit exists.
Condition 3: Does  f(x) = f(2)?
The  f(x) = 3, but f(2) = 4. Because these aren't equal, the answer is "no" and the function is not continuous at x = 2.
TYPES OF DISCONTINUITIES
There are four types of discontinuities you have to know: jump, point, essential, and removable.


A jump discontinuity occurs when the curve "breaks" at a particular place and starts somewhere else. In other words,  f(x) ≠  f(x)


An example of jump discontinuity looks like this.



A point discontinuity occurs when the curve has a "hole" in it from a missing point because the function has a value at that point that is "off the curve." In other words,  f(x) ≠ f(a).


Here's what a point discontinuity looks like.



An essential discontinuity occurs when the curve has a vertical asymptote.


This is an example of an essential discontinuity.



A removable discontinuity occurs when you have a rational expression with common factors in the numerator and denominator. Because these factors can be canceled, the discontinuity is "removable."


Here's an example of a removable discontinuity.



This curve looks very similar to a point discontinuity, but notice that with a removable discontinuity, f(x) is not defined at the point, whereas with a point discontinuity, f(x) is defined there.


Now that you know what these four types of discontinuities look like, let's see what types of functions are not everywhere continuous.
Example 5: Consider the following function:

f(x) = 

The left-hand limit is 5 as x approaches 2, and the right-hand limit is 4 as x approaches 2. Because the curve has different values on each side of 2, the curve is discontinuous at x = 2. We say that the curve "jumps" at x = 2 from the left-hand curve to the right-hand curve because the left and right-hand limits differ. It looks like the following:

This is an example of a jump discontinuity.
Example 6: Consider the following function:

f(x) = 

Because  f(x) ≠ f(2); the function is discontinuous at x = 2. The curve is continuous everywhere except at the point x = 2. It looks like the following:

This is an example of a point discontinuity.
Example 7: Consider the following function: f(x) = 
The function is discontinuous because it's possible for the denominator to equal zero (at x = 2). This means that f(2) doesn't exist, and the function has an asymptote at x = 2. In addition,  f(x) = -∞ and  f(x) = ∞.
The graph looks like the following:

This is an example of an essential discontinuity.
Example 8: Consider the following function:

If you factor the top and bottom, you can see where the discontinuities are.

The function has a zero in the denominator when x = 1 or x = 5, so the function is discontinuous at those two points. But you can cancel the term (x − 5) from both the numerator and the denominator, leaving you with

Now the reduced function is continuous at x = 5. Thus, the original function has a removable discontinuity at x = 5. Furthermore, if you now plug x = 5 into the reduced function, you get

The discontinuity is at x = 5, and there's a hole at . In other words, if the original function were continuous at x = 5, it would have the value . Notice that this is the same as:  f(x).
These are the types of discontinuities that you can expect to encounter on the AP examination. Here are some sample problems and their solutions. Cover the answers as you work, then check your results.
PROBLEM 1. Is the function f(x) =  continuous at x = 2?
Answer: Test the conditions necessary for continuity.
Condition 1: f(2) = 9, so we're okay so far.
Condition 2: The  f(x) = 15 and the  f(x) = 9. These two limits don't agree, so the  f(x) doesn't exist and the function is not continuous at x = 2.
PROBLEM 2. Is the function f(x) =  continuous at x = 1?
Answer: Condition 1: f(1) = 9.
Condition 2: The  f(x) = 9 and the .
Therefore, the  f(x) exists and is equal to 9.
Condition 3:  f(x) = f (1) = 9.
The function satisfies all three conditions, so it is continuous at x = 1.
PROBLEM 3. For what value of a is the function f(x) =  continuous at x = 4?
Answer: Because f(4) = 12, the function passes the first condition.
For Condition 2 to be satisfied, the  f(x) = 4a + 5 must equal the  f(x) = 12. So, set 4a + 5 = 12. If a = , the limit will exist at x = 4 and the other two conditions will also be fulfilled. Therefore, the value a =  makes the function continuous at x = 4.
PROBLEM 4. Where does the function f(x) = have: (a) an essential discontinuity; and (b) a removable discontinuity?
Answer: If you factor the top and bottom of this fraction, you get

Thus, the function has an essential discontinuity at x = −4. If we then cancel the term (x − 5), and substitute x = 5 into the reduced expression, we get f(5) = . Therefore, the function has a removable discontinuity at .

Note: Don't confuse coordinate parentheses with interval notation. In interval notation, square brackets include endpoints and parentheses do not. For example, the interval 2 ≤ x ≤ 4 is written [2, 4] and the interval 2 < x < 4 is written (2, 4).

(f) Any discontinuities.









Chapter 5
The Definition of the Derivative
The main tool that you'll use in differential calculus is called the derivative. All of the problems that you'll encounter in differential calculus make use of the derivative, so your goal should be to become an expert at finding, or "taking," derivatives by the end of Chapter 6. However, before you learn a simple way to take a derivative, your teacher will probably make you learn how derivatives are calculated by teaching you something called the "Definition of the Derivative."
DERIVING THE FORMULA
The best way to understand the definition of the derivative is to start by looking at the simplest continuous function: a line. As you should recall, you can determine the slope of a line by taking two points on that line and plugging them into the slope formula.


m =              m stands for slope.


For example, suppose a line goes through the points (3, 7) and (8, 22). First, you subtract the y-coordinates (22 − 7) = 15. Next, subtract the corresponding x-coordinates (8 − 3) = 5. Finally, divide the first number by the second:  = 3. The result is the slope of the line: m = 3.

Notice that you can use the coordinates in reverse order and still get the same result. It doesn't matter in which order you do the subtraction as long as you're consistent.

Let's look at the graph of that line. The slope measures the steepness of the line, which looks like the following:

You probably remember your teachers referring to the slope as the "rise" over the "run." The rise is the difference between the y-coordinates, and the run is the difference between the x-coordinates. The slope is the ratio of the two.
Now for a few changes in notation. Instead of calling the x-coordinates x1 and x2, we're going to call them x1 and x1 + h, where h is the difference between the two x-coordinates. Second, instead of using y1 and y2, we use f(x1) and f(x1 + h). So now the graph looks like the following:

The picture is exactly the same—only the notation has changed.

Sometimes, instead of h, some books use ∆x.

The Slope of a Curve
Suppose that instead of finding the slope of a line, we wanted to find the slope of a curve. Here the slope formula no longer works because the distance from one point to the other is along a curve, not a straight line. But we could find the approximate slope if we took the slope of the line between the two points. This is called the secant line.



The formula for the slope of the secant line is

Remember this formula! This is called the Difference Quotient.



While at first the Difference Quotient may seem like another formula to memorize, keep in mind that it's just another way of writing the slope formula.

The Secant and the Tangent
As you can see, the farther apart the two points are, the less the slope of the line corresponds to the slope of the curve.

Conversely, the closer the two points are, the more accurate the approximation is.

In fact, there is one line, called the tangent line, that touches the curve at exactly one point. The slope of the tangent line is equal to the slope of the curve at exactly this point. The object of using the above formula, therefore, is to shrink h down to an infinitesimally small amount. If we could do that, then the difference between (x1 + h) and x1 would be a point.

Keep in mind that there are infinitely many tangents for any curve because there are infinitely many points on the curve.

Graphically, it looks like the following:

How do we perform this shrinking act? By using the limits we discussed in Chapter 3. We set up a limit during which h approaches zero, like the following:





This is the definition of the derivative, and we call it f′(x).
Notice that the equation is just a slightly modified version of the difference quotient, with different notation. The only difference is that we're finding the slope between two points that are infinitesimally close to each other.
Example 1: Find the slope of the curve f(x) = x2 at the point (2, 4).
This means that x1 = 2 and f(2) = 22 = 4. If we can figure out f(x1 + h), then we can find the slope. Well, how did we find the value of f(x)? We plugged x1 into the equation f(x) = x2. To find f(x1 + h) we plug x1 + h into the equation, which now looks like this

f(x1 + h) = (2 + h)2 = 4 + 4h + h2

Now plug this into the slope formula.

Next simplify by factoring h out of the top.

Taking the limit as h approaches 0, we get 4. Therefore, the slope of the curve y = x2 at the point (2, 4) is 4. Now we've found the slope of a curve at a certain point, and the notation looks like this: f´(2) = 4. Remember this notation!
Example 2: Find the derivative of the equation in Example 1 at the point (5, 25). This means that x1 = 5 and f(x) = 25. This time,

(x1 + h)2 = (5 + h)2 = 25 + 10h + h2

Now plug this into the formula for the derivative.

Once again, simplify by factoring h out of the top.

Taking the limit as h goes to 0, you get 10. Therefore, the slope of the curve y = x2 at the point (5, 25) is 10, or: f´(5) = 10.
Using this pattern, let's forget about the arithmetic for a second and derive a formula.
Example 3: Find the slope of the equation f(x) = x2 at the point .
Follow the steps in the last two problems, but instead of using a number, use x1. This means that f(x1) =  and (x1 + h)2 =  + 2x1h + h2. Then the derivative is

Factor h out of the top.

Now take the limit as h goes to 0: you get 2x1. Therefore, f´(x1) = 2x1.
This example gives us a general formula for the derivative of this curve. Now we can pick any point, plug it into the formula, and determine the slope at that point. For example, the derivative at the point x = 7 is 14. At the point x = , the derivative is .
DIFFERENTIABILITY
One of the important requirements for the differentiability of a function is that the function be continuous. But, even if a function is continuous at a point, the function is not necessarily differentiable there. Check out the graph below.

If a function has a "sharp corner," you can draw more than one tangent line at that point, and because the slopes of these tangent lines are not equal, the function is not differentiable there.
Another possible problem occurs when the tangent line is vertical (which can also occur at a cusp) because a vertical line has an infinite slope. For example, if the derivative of a function is , it doesn't have a derivative at x = −1.
Try these problems on your own, then check your work against the answers immediately beneath each problem.
PROBLEM 1. Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x2 at (4, 48).
Answer: f(4 + h) = 3(4 + h)2 = 48 + 24h + 3h2. Use the definition of the derivative.

Simplify.

The slope of the curve at the point (4, 48) is 24.
PROBLEM 2. Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x2.
Answer: f(x + h) = 3(x + h)2 = 3x2 + 6xh + 3h2. Use the definition of the derivative.

Simplify.

The derivative is 6x.
PROBLEM 3. Find the derivative of f(x) = x3.
Answer: f(x + h) = (x + h)3 = x3 + 3x2h + 3xh2 + h3. First, use the definition of the derivative.

And simplify.

The derivative is 3x2.
This next one will test your algebraic skills. Don't say we didn't warn you!
PROBLEM 4. Find the derivative of f(x) = .
Answer: f(x + h).
Use the definition of the derivative.

Notice that this one doesn't cancel as conveniently as the other problems did. In order to simplify this expression, we have to multiply both the top and the bottom of the expression by (the conjugate of the numerator).

Simplify.

The derivative is .

Chapter 6
Basic Differentiation
In calculus, you'll be asked to do two things: differentiate and integrate. In this section, you're going to learn differentiation. Integration will come later, in the second half of this book. Before we go about the business of learning how to take derivatives, however, here's a brief note about notation. Read this!
NOTATION
There are several different notations for derivatives in calculus. We'll use two different types interchangeably throughout this book, so get used to them now.
We'll refer to functions three different ways: f(x), u or v, and y. For example, we might write: f(x) = x3, g(x) = x4, h(x) = x5. We'll also use notation like: u = sin x and v = cos x. Or we might use: y = . Usually, we pick the notation that causes the least confusion.
The derivatives of the functions will use notation that depends on the function, as shown in the following table:

In addition, if we refer to a derivative of a function in general (for example, ax2 + bx + c), we might enclose the expression in parentheses and use either of the following notations:

ax2 + bx + c)′, or  ax2 + bx + c)

Sometimes math books refer to a derivative using either Dx or fx. We're not going to use either of them.
THE POWER RULE
In the last chapter, you learned how to find a derivative using the definition of the derivative, a process that is very time-consuming and sometimes involves a lot of complex algebra. Fortunately, there's a shortcut to taking derivatives, so you'll never have to use the definition again—except when it's a question on an exam!
The basic technique for taking a derivative is called the Power Rule.


Rule No. 1: If y = xn, then  = nxn−1





That's it. Wasn't that simple? Of course, this and all of the following rules can be derived easily from the definition of the derivative. Look at these next few examples of the Power Rule in action.
Example 1: If y = x5, then  = 5x4.
Example 2: If y = x20, then  = 20x19.
Example 3: If f(x) = x−5, then f´(x) = −5x−6.

Notice that when the power of the function is negative, the power of the derivative is more negative.

Example 4: If u = x, then .

When the power is a fraction, you should be careful to get the subtraction right (you'll see the powers , , , − and − often, so be comfortable with subtracting 1 from them).

Example 5: If y = x1, then  = 1x0 = 1. (Because x0 is 1!)
Example 6: If y = x0, then  = 0.

When the power is 1, the derivative is just a constant. When the power is 0, the derivative is 0.

This leads to the next three rules.


Rule No. 2: If y = x, then  = 1
Rule No. 3: If y = kx, then  = k (where k is a constant)
Rule No. 4: If y = k, then  = 0 (where k is a constant)





Note: For future reference, a, b, c, n, and k always stand for constants.
Example 7: If y = 8x4, then  = 32x3.
Example 8: If y = 5x100, then y′ = 500x99.
Example 9: If y = −3x−5, then  = 15x−6.
Example 10: If f(x) = 7x, then f′(x) =  x−.
Example 11: If x, then  = .
Example 12: If y = 12, then  = 0.
If you have any questions about any of these 12 examples (especially the last two), review the rules. Now for one last rule.

THE ADDITION RULE


If y = axn + bxm, where a and b are constants, then  = a(nxn−1) + b(mxm−1)




This handy rule works for subtraction, too.

Example 13: If y = 3x4 + 8x10, then  = 12x3 + 80x9.
Example 14: If , then  = −28x−5 −  x−.
Example 15: If y = 5x4(2 − x3), then  = 40x3 − 35x6.
Example 16: If y = (3x2 + 5)(x − 1), then

y = 3x3 − 3x2 + 5x − 5 and  = 9x2 − 6x + 5.

Example 17: If y = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, then  = 3ax2 + 2bx + c.
After you've worked through all 17 of these examples, you should be able to take the derivative of any polynomial with ease.
As you may have noticed from the examples above, in calculus, you are often asked to convert from fractions and radicals to negative powers and fractional powers. In addition, don't freak out if your answer doesn't match any of the answer choices. Because answers to problems are often presented in simplified form, your answer may not be simplified enough.
There are two basic expressions that you'll often be asked to differentiate. You can make your life easier by memorizing the following derivatives:


Reciprocal Rule:
If y = , then 
If y = k, then 





HIGHER ORDER DERIVATIVES
This may sound like a big deal, but it isn't. This term refers only to taking the derivative of a function more than once. You don't have to stop at the first derivative of a function; you can keep taking derivatives. The derivative of a first derivative is called the second derivative. The derivative of the second derivative is called the third derivative, and so on.
Generally, you'll have to take only first and second derivatives.


Notice how we simplified the derivatives in the latter example? You should be able to do this mentally.

Here are some sample problems involving the rules we discussed above. As you work, cover the answers with an index card, and then check your work after you're done. By the time you finish them, you should know the rules by heart.
PROBLEM 1. If y = 50x5 + , then  =
Answer:  = 50(5x4) +  = 
PROBLEM 2. If y = 9x4 + 6x2 − 7x + 11, then  =
Answer:  = 9(4x3) + 6(2x) − 7(1) + 0 = 36x3 + 12x − 7
PROBLEM 3. If f(x) , then f´(x) =
Answer:
 −  +  − 
How'd you do? Did you notice the changes in notation? How about the fractional powers, radical signs, and x's in denominators? You should be able to switch back and forth between notations, between fractional powers and radical signs, and between negative powers in a numerator and positive powers in a denominator.

THE PRODUCT RULE
Now that you know how to find derivatives of simple polynomials, it's time to get more complicated. What if you had to find the derivative of this?

f(x) = (x3 + 5x2 − 4x + 1)(x5 − 7x4 + x)

You could multiply out the expression and take the derivative of each term, like

f(x) = x8 − 2x7 − 39x6 + 29x5 − 6x4 + 5x3 − 4x2 + x

And the derivative is

f´(x) = 8x7 − 14x6 − 234x5 + 145x4 − 24x3 + 15x2 − 8x + 1

Needless to say, this process is messy. Naturally, there's an easier way. When a function involves two terms multiplied by each other, we use the Product Rule.


The Product Rule: If f(x) = uv, then f´(x) = 




With the product rule, the order of these two operations doesn't matter. It does matter with other rules, though, so it helps to use the same order each time.

To find the derivative of two things multiplied by each other, you multiply the first function by the derivative of the second, and add that to the second function multiplied by the derivative of the first.
Let's use the Product Rule to find the derivative of our example.

f´(x) = (x3 + 5x2 − 4x + 1)(5x4 − 28x3 + 1) + (x5 − 7x4 + x)(3x2 + 10x − 4)

If we were to simplify this, we'd get the same answer as before. But here's the best part: We're not going to simplify it. One of the great things about the AP exam is that when it's difficult to simplify an expression, you almost never have to.
Nonetheless, you'll often need to simplify expressions when you're taking second derivatives, or when you use the derivative in some other equation. Practice simplifying whenever possible.
Example 1: f(x) = (9x2 + 4x)(x3 − 5x2)

f´(x) = (9x2 + 4x)(3x2 − 10x) + (x3 − 5x2)(18x + 4)

Example 2:  (x5 − 11x8)

y′ = (5x4 − 88x7) + (x5 − 11x8) 

Example 3: y = 

THE QUOTIENT RULE
What happens when you have to take the derivative of a function that is the quotient of two other functions? You guessed it: Use the Quotient Rule.


The Quotient Rule: If f(x = , then f′(x) = 





In this rule, as opposed to the Product Rule, the order in which you take the derivatives is very important because you're subtracting instead of adding. It's always the bottom function times the derivative of the top minus the top function times the derivative of the bottom. Then divide the whole thing by the bottom function squared. A good way to remember this is to say the following:

You could also write

f(x) =  as f(x) = u

Then you could derive the Quotient Rule using the Product Rule.


For the Quotient Rule, remember that order matters!

Here are some more examples.
Example 4: f(x) = 

Example 5: y = 

We're not going to simplify these, although the Quotient Rule often produces expressions that simplify more readily than those involving the Product Rule. Sometimes it's helpful to simplify, but avoid it otherwise. When you have to find a second derivative, however, you do have to simplify the quotient. If this is the case, the AP exam usually will give you a simple expression to deal with, such as in the example below.
Example 6: y = 

In order to take the derivative of , you have to use the Chain Rule.
THE CHAIN RULE
The most important rule in this chapter (and sometimes the most difficult one) is called the Chain Rule. It's used when you're given composite functions—that is, a function inside of another function. You'll always see one of these on the AP exam, so it's important to know the Chain Rule cold.
A composite function is usually written as: f(g(x)).
For example: If f(x) =  and g(x) = , then f(g(x)) = 
We could also find: g(f(x)) = 
When finding the derivative of a composite function, we take the derivative of the "outside" function, with the inside function g considered as the variable, leaving the "inside" function alone. Then, we multiply this by the derivative of the "inside" function, with respect to its variable x.
Here is another way to write the Chain Rule.


The Chain Rule: If y = f(g(x)), then y′ = 





This rule is tricky, so here are several examples. The last couple incorporate the Product Rule and the Quotient Rule.
Example 7: If y = (5x3 + 3x)5, then  = 5(5x3 + 3x)4(15x2 + 3)
We just dealt with the derivative of something to the fifth power, like this

y = (g)5, so  = 5(g)4, where g = 5x3 + 3x

Then we multiplied by the derivative of g: (15x2 + 3).
Always do it this way. The process has several successive steps, like peeling away the layers of an onion until you reach the center.
Example 8: If y = , then 
Again, we took the derivative of the outside function, leaving the inside alone. Then we multiplied by the derivative of the inside.
Example 9: If y = , then

Messy, isn't it? That's because we used the Chain Rule and the Product Rule. Now for one with the Chain Rule and the Quotient Rule.
Example 10: If y = , then

Example 11: If y = , then 
Now we use the Product Rule and the Chain Rule to find the second derivative.

You can also simplify this further, if necessary.
There's another representation of the Chain Rule that you need to learn.


If y = y(v) and v = v(x), then 


Example 12: y = 8v2 − 6v and v = 5x3 − 11x, then

 = (16v − 6)(15x2 − 11)

Then substitute for v.

 = (16(5x3 − 11x)(15x2 − 11) = (80x3 − 17x − 6)(15x2 − 11)


As you can see, these grow quite complex, so we simplify these only as a last resort. If you must simplify, the AP exam will have only a very simple Chain Rule problem.

DERIVATIVES OF TRIG FUNCTIONS
There are a lot of trigonometry problems in calculus and on the AP Calculus Exam. If you're not sure of your trig, you should definitely go to the Appendix and review the unit on Prerequisite Math. You'll need to remember your trig formulas, the values of the special angles, and the trig ratios, among other stuff.
In addition, angles are always referred to in radians. You can forget all about using degrees.
You should know the derivatives of all six trig functions. The good news is that the derivatives are pretty easy, and all you have to do is memorize them. Because the AP exam might ask you about this, though, let's use the definition of the derivative to figure out the derivative of sin x.

If f(x) = sin x, then f(x + h) = sin(x + h).

Substitute this into the definition of the derivative.

Remember that sin(x + h) = sin x cos h + cos x sin h. Now simplify it.

Next, rewrite this as

Next, use some of the trigonometric limits that you memorized back in Chapter 3. Specifically,

This gives you



sin x = cos x


Example 1: Find the derivative of sin.

Use some of the rules of trigonometry you remember from last year. Because

sin = cos x and cos = sin x,

you can substitute into the above expression and get


cos x = − sin x


Now, let's derive the derivatives of the other four trigonometric functions.
Example 2: Find the derivative of .
Use the Quotient Rule.

Because  = tan x, you should get


tan x = sec2 x


Example 3: Find the derivative of .
Use the Quotient Rule.

Because  = cot x, you get: cot x = − csc2x.
Example 4: Find the derivative of .
Use the Reciprocal Rule (refer to this page).

Because  = sec x, you get


 csc x = − csc x cot x


Example 5: Find the derivative of .
You get the idea by now.

 =  = − csc x cot x

Because  = csc x, you get


 csc x = − csc x cot x


There you go. We have now found the derivatives of all six of the trigonometric functions. (A chart of them appears at the end of the book.) Now memorize them. You'll thank us later.
Let's do some more examples.
Example 6: Find the derivative of sin(5x).

sin(5x) = cos(5x)(5) = 5cos(5x)

Example 7: Find the derivative of sec(x2).

sec(x2) = sec(x2)tan(x2)(2x)

Example 8: Find the derivative of csc(x3 − 5x).

csc(x3 − 5x) = − csc(x3 − 5x) cot(x3 − 5x)(3x2 −5).

These derivatives are almost like formulas. You just follow the pattern and use the Chain Rule when appropriate.
Here are some solved problems. Do each problem, covering the answer first, then checking your answer.
PROBLEM 1. Find f´(x) if f(x) = sin(2x3).
Answer: Follow the rule: f´(x) = cos(2x3)6x2.
PROBLEM 2. Find f´(x) if f(x) = .
Answer: f′(x) =  = 
PROBLEM 3. Find f´(x) if f(x) = .
Answer: 
f′(x) =  = 
PROBLEM 4. Find f´(x) if f(x) = csc(x3 + x + 1).
Answer: Follow the rule: f´(x) = -csc(x3 + x + 1)cot(x3 + x + 1)(3x2 + 1)
GRAPHICAL DERIVATIVES
Sometimes, we are given the graph of a function and we are asked to graph the derivative. We do this by analyzing the sign of derivative at various places on the graph and then sketching a graph of the derivative from that information. Let's start with something simple. Suppose we have the graph of y = f(x) below and we are asked to sketch the graph of its derivative.

First, note that the derivative is zero at the point (0, 1) because the tangent line is horizontal there. Next, the derivative is negative for all x < 0 because the tangent lines to the curve have negative slopes everywhere on the interval (-∞, 0). Finally, the derivative is positive for all x > 0 because the tangent lines to the curve have positive slopes everywhere on the interval (0, ∞). Now we can make a graph of the derivative. It will go through the origin (because the derivative is 0 at x = 0), it will be negative on the interval (-∞, 0) and it will be positive on the interval (0, ∞). The graph looks something like the following:


Note that it's not important for your graph to be exact. All we are doing here is sketching the derivative. The important parts of the graph are where the derivative is positive, negative, and zero.

Now let's try something a little harder. Suppose we have the following graph and we are asked to sketch the graph of the derivative:

Notice that the tangent line looks as if it's horizontal at x = 1. This means that the graph of the derivative is zero there. Next, the curve is increasing for all other values of x, so the graph of the derivative will be positive. As we go from left to right on the graph, notice that the slope starts out very steep, so the derivatives are large positive numbers. As we approach x = 1, the curve starts to flatten out, so the derivatives will approach zero but will still be positive. Then, the slope is zero at x = 1. Then the curve gets steep again. If we sketch the derivative, we get something like the following:

Here is an important one to understand. Suppose we have the graph of y = sin x.

Notice that the slope of the tangent line will be horizontal at all of the maxima and minima of the graph. Because the slope of a horizontal line is zero, this means that the derivative will be zero at those values (). Next, notice that the slope of the curve is about 1 as the curve goes through the origin. This should make sense if you recall that  = 1. The slope of the curve is about −1 as the curve goes through x = π. And so on. If we now sketch the derivative, it looks something like the following:

Notice that this is the graph of y = cos x. This should be obvious because the derivative of sin x is cos x.
Now let's do a hard one. Suppose we have the following graph:

First, notice that we have two vertical asymptotes at x = 6 and x = −6. This means that the graph of the derivative will also have vertical asymptotes at x = 6 and x = −6. Next, notice that the curve is always decreasing. This means that the graph of the derivative will always be negative. Moving from left to right, the graph starts out close to flat, so the derivative will be close to zero. Then, the graph gets very steep and points downward, so the graph of the derivative will be negative and getting more negative. Then, we have the asymptote x = −6. Next, the graph begins very steep and negative and starts to flatten out as we approach the origin. At the origin, the slope of the graph is approximately −. This means that the graph of the derivative will increase until it reaches . Then, the graph starts to get steep again as we approach the other asymptote x = 6. Thus, the graph will get more negative again. Finally, to the right of the asymptote x = −6 the graph starts out steep and negative and flattens out, approaching zero. This means that the graph of the derivative will start out very negative and will approach zero. If we now sketch the derivative, it looks something like the following:

Chapter 7
Implicit Differentiation
HOW TO DO IT
By now, it should be easy for you to take the derivative of an equation such as y = 3x5 − 7x. If you're given an equation such as y2 = 3x5 − 7x, you can still figure out the derivative by taking the square root of both sides, which gives you y in terms of x. This is known as finding the derivative explicitly. It's messy, but possible.
If you have to find the derivative of y2 + y = 3x5 − 7x, you don't have an easy way to get y in terms of x, so you can't differentiate this equation using any of the techniques you've learned so far. That's because each of those previous techniques needs to be used on an equation in which y is in terms of x. When you can't isolate y in terms of x (or if isolating y makes taking the derivative a nightmare), it's time to take the derivative implicitly.
Implicit differentiation is one of the simpler techniques you need to learn to do in calculus, but for some reason it gives many students trouble. Suppose you have the equation y2 = 3x5 − 7x. This means that the value of y is a function of the value of x. When we take the derivative, , we're looking at the rate at which y changes as x changes. Thus, given y = x2 + x, when we write

 = 2x + 1

we're saying that "the rate" at which y changes, with respect to how x changes, is 2x + 1.
Now, suppose you want to find . As you might imagine

So here, . But notice that this derivative is in terms of x, not y, and you need to find the derivative with respect to y. This derivative is an implicit one. When you can't isolate the variables of an equation, you often end up with a derivative that is in terms of both variables.
Another way to think of this is that there is a hidden term in the derivative, , and when we take the derivative, what we really get is

A fraction that has the same term in its numerator and denominator is equal to 1, so we write

 = 2x(1) + 1(1) = 2x + 1

Every time we take a derivative of a term with x in it, we multiply by the term , but because this is 1, we ignore it. Suppose however, that we wanted to find out how y changes with respect to t (for time). Then we would have

If we wanted to find out how y changes with respect to r, we would have

and if we wanted to find out how y changes with respect to y, we would have

This is how we really do differentiation. Remember the following:

When you have an equation of x in terms of y, and you want to find the derivative with respect to y, simply differentiate. But if the equation is of y in terms of x, find  and take its reciprocal to find . Go back to our original example.

y2 + y = 3x5 − 7x



You should use implicit differentiation any time you can't write a function explicitly in terms of the variable that we want to take the derivative with respect to.

To take the derivative according to the information in the last paragraph, you get

Notice how each variable is multiplied by its appropriate . Now, remembering that , rewrite the expression this way:  = 15x4 − 7.
Next, factor  out of the left-hand side: (2y + 1) = 15x4 − 7.
Isolating  gives you .
This is the derivative you're looking for. Notice how the derivative is defined in terms of y and x. Up until now,  has been strictly in terms of x. This is why the differentiation is "implicit."
Confused? Let's do a few examples and you will get the hang of it.
Example 1: Find  if y3 − 4y2 = x5 + 3x4.
Using implicit differentiation, you get

Remember that  = 1: (3y2 − 8y) = 5x4 + 12x3.
After you factor out , divide both sides by 3y2 − 8y.

Note: Now that you understand that the derivative of an x term with respect to x will always be multiplied by , and that  = 1, we won't write  anymore. You should understand that the term is implied.
Example 2: Find  if sin y2 − cos x2 = cos y2 + sin x2.
Use implicit differentiation.

Then simplify.

Next, put all of the terms containing  on the left and all of the other terms on the right.

Next, factor out .

And isolate .

This can be simplified further to the following:


Did you notice the use of the Product Rule to find the derivative of 5xy2? The AP exam loves to make you do this. All of the same differentiation rules that you've learned up until now still apply. We're just adding another technique.

Example 3: Find  if 3x2 + 5xy2 − 4y3 = 8.
Implicit differentiation should result in the following:

You can simplify this to

Next, put all of the terms containing  on the left and all of the other terms on the right.

Next, factor out .

Then, isolate .

Example 4: Find the derivative of 3x2 − 4y2 + y = 9 at (2, 1).
You need to use implicit differentiation to find .

Now, instead of rearranging to isolate , plug in (2, 1) immediately and solve for the derivative.

Simplify: 12 − 7 , so 


Be smart about your problem solving. Just because you can simplify something doesn't mean that you should. In a case like this, plugging into this form of the derivative is more effective.

Getting the hang of implicit differentiation yet? We hope so, because these next examples are slightly harder.
Example 5: Find the derivative of  = − x at (1, 1).
First, cross-multiply.

2x − 5y2 = −x(4y3 − x2)

Distribute.

2x − 5y2 = −4xy3 + x3

Take the derivative.

Do not simplify now. Rather, plug in (1, 1) right away. This will save you from the algebra.

Now solve for .

SECOND DERIVATIVES
Sometimes, you'll be asked to find a second derivative implicitly.
Example 6: Find  if y2 + 2y = 4x2 + 2x.
Differentiating implicitly, you get


Remember: When it is required to take a second derivative, the first derivative should be simplified first.

Next, simplify and solve for .

Now, it's time to take the derivative again.

Finally, substitute for .

Try these solved problems without looking at the answers. Then check your work.
PROBLEM 1. Find  if x2 + y2 6xy

Therefore, the first derivative is the following:

Unit 2
Differential Calculus Applications









Chapter 8
Basic Applications of the Derivative
EQUATIONS OF TANGENT LINES AND NORMAL LINES
Finding the equation of a line tangent to a certain curve at a certain point is a standard calculus problem. This is because, among other things, the derivative is the slope of a tangent line to a curve at a particular point. Thus, we can find the equation of the tangent line to a curve if we have the equation of the curve and the point at which we want to find the tangent line. Then all we have to do is take the derivative of the equation, plug in the x-coordinate of the point to find the slope, then use the point and the slope to find the equation of the line. Let's take this one step at a time.
Suppose we have a point (x1, y1) and a slope m. Then the equation of the line through that point with that slope is

(y − y1) = m(x − x1)

You should remember this formula from algebra. If not, memorize it!
Next, suppose that we have an equation y = f(x), where (x1, y1) satisfies that equation. Then f´(x1) = m, and we can plug all of our values into the equation for a line and get the equation of the tangent line. This is much easier to explain with a simple example.
Example 1: Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = 5x2 at the point (3, 45).
First of all, notice that the point satisfies the equation: when x = 3, y = 45. Now, take the derivative of the equation.

 = 10x

Now, if you plug in x = 3, you'll get the slope of the curve at that point.


By the way, the notation for plugging in a point is . Learn to recognize it!

Thus, we have the slope and the point, and the equation is

(y − 45) = 30(x − 3)

It's customary to simplify the equation if it's not too onerous.

y = 30x − 45

Example 2: Find the equation of the tangent line to y = x3 + x2 at (3, 36).
The derivative looks like the following:

 = 3x2 + 2x

So, the slope is

 3(3)2 + 2(3) = 33

The equation looks like the following:

(y − 36) = 33(x − 3), or y = 33x − 63

Naturally, there are a couple of things that can be done to make the problems harder. First of all, you can be given only the x-coordinate. Second, the equation can be more difficult to differentiate.
In order to find the y-coordinate, all you have to do is plug the x-value into the equation for the curve and solve for y. Remember this: You'll see it again!
Example 3: Find the equation of the tangent line to y =  at x = 1.
First, find the y-coordinate.

Second, take the derivative.

You're probably dreading having to simplify this derivative. Don't waste your time! Plug in x = 1 right away.

Now, we have a slope and a point, so the equation is

 (x − 1), or 2y = −9x + 2

Sometimes, instead of finding the equation of a tangent line, you will be asked to find the equation of a normal line. A normal line is simply the line perpendicular to the tangent line at the same point. You follow the same steps as with the tangent line, but you use the slope that will give you a perpendicular line.

Remember: the slope of a perpendicular line is just the negative reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line.

Example 4: Find the equation of the line normal to y = x5 − x4 + 1 at x = 2.
First, find the y-coordinate.

y(2) = 25 − 24 + 1 = 17

Second, take the derivative.

 = 5x4 − 4x3

Third, find the slope at x = 2.

 = 5(2)4 − 4(2)3 = 48

Fourth, take the negative reciprocal of 48, which is −.
Finally, the equation becomes

y − 17 = −  (x − 2)

Try these solved problems. Do each problem, covering the answer first, then checking your answer.
PROBLEM 1. Find the equation of the tangent line to the graph of y = 4 − 3x − x2 at the point (2, −6).
Answer: First, take the derivative of the equation.

 = −3 −2x

Now, plug in x = 2 to get the slope of the tangent line.

 = −3 −2(2) = −7

Third, plug the slope and the point into the equation for the line.

y − (−6) = −7(x − 2)

This simplifies to y = −7x + 8.
PROBLEM 2. Find the equation of the normal line to the graph of y = 6 − x − x2 at x = −1.
Answer: Plug x = −1 into the original equation to get the y-coordinate.

y = 6 + 1 − 1 = 6

Once again, take that derivative.

 = −1 −2x

Now plug in x = −1 to get the slope of the tangent.

 = −1 −2(−1) = 1

Use the negative reciprocal of the slope in the second step to get the slope of the normal line.

m = −1

Finally, plug the slope and the point into the equation for the line.

y − 6 = −1(x + 1)

This simplifies to y = -x + 5.
PROBLEM 3. Find the equations of the tangent and normal lines to the graph of y =  at the point (2, 4).
Answer: This problem will put your algebra to the test. You have to use the Quotient Rule to take the derivative of this mess.

Second, plug in x = 2 to get the slope of the tangent.

Now, plug the slope and the point into the equation for the tangent line.

y − 4 = −  (x − 2)

That simplifies to 6x + 5y = 32. The equation of the normal line must then be

y − 4 =  (x − 2)

That, in turn, simplifies to −5x + 6y = 14.
PROBLEM 4. The curve y = ax2 + bx + c passes through the point (2, 4) and is tangent to the line y = x + 1 at (0, 1). Find a, b, and c.
Answer: The curve passes through (2, 4), so if you plug in x = 2, you'll get y = 4. Therefore,

4 = 4a + 2b + c

Second, the curve also passes through the point (0, 1), so c = 1.
Because the curve is tangent to the line y = x + 1 at (0, 1), they must both have the same slope at that point. The slope of the line is 1. The slope of the curve is the first derivative.

At (0, 1),  = b. Therefore, b = 1.
Now that you know b and c, plug them back into the equation from the first step and solve for a.

4 = 4a + 2 + 1, and a = 

PROBLEM 5. Find the points on the curve y = 2x3 − 3x2 − 12x + 20 where the tangent is parallel to the x-axis.
Answer: The x-axis is a horizontal line, so it has slope zero. Therefore, you want to know where the derivative of this curve is zero. Take the derivative.

 = 6x2 − 6x − 12

Set it equal to zero and solve for x. Get accustomed to doing this: It's one of the most common questions in differential calculus.

 = 6x2 − 6x − 12 = 0
6(x2 − x − 2) = 0
6(x − 2)(x + 1) = 0
x = 2 or x = −1

Third, find the y-coordinates of these two points.

y = 2(8) − 3(4) −12(2) + 20 = 0


y = 2(−1) − 3(1) − 12(−1) + 20 = 27

Therefore, the points are (2, 0) and (−1, 27).

If y = f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b], and is differentiable everywhere on the interval (a, b), then there is at least one number c between a and b such that





Remember that in order for The Mean Value Theorem for Derivatives to work, the curve must be continuous on the interval and at the endpoints.

In other words, there's some point in the interval where the slope of the tangent line equals the slope of the secant line that connects the endpoints of the interval. (The function has to be continuous at the endpoints of the interval, but it doesn't have to be differentiable at the endpoints. Is this important? Maybe to mathematicians, but probably not to you!) You can see this graphically in the following figure:

Example 1: Suppose you have the function f(x) = x2, and you're looking at the interval [1, 3]. The Mean Value Theorem for derivatives (this is often abbreviated MVTD) states that there is some number c such that

Because f´(x) = 2x, plug in c for x and solve: 2c = 4 so c = 2. Notice that 2 is in the interval. This is what the MVTD predicted! If you don't get a value for c within the interval, something went wrong; either the function is not continuous and differentiable in the required interval, or you made a mistake.
Example 2: Consider the function f(x) = x3 − 12x on the interval [−2, 2]. The MVTD states that there is a c such that

Then f´(c) = 3c2 − 12 = −8 and c = ± (which is approximately ±1.155).
Notice that here there are two values of c that satisfy the MVTD. That's allowed. In fact, there can be infinitely many values, depending on the function.
Example 3: Consider the function f(x) =  on the interval [−2, 2].
Follow the MVTD.

Then

There is no value of c that will satisfy this equation! We expected this. Why? Because f(x) is not continuous at x = 0, which is in the interval. Suppose the interval had been [1, 3], eliminating the discontinuity. The result would have been

c = - is not in the interval, but c =  is. The answer is c = .
Example 4: Consider the function f(x) = x2 − x − 12 on the interval [−3, 4].
Follow the MVTD.

f′(c) =  = 0 and f´(c) = 2c − 1 = 0, so c = 

In this last example, you discovered where the derivative of the equation equaled zero. This is going to be the single most common problem you'll encounter in differential calculus. So now, we've got an important tip for you.


When you don't know what to do, take the derivative of the equation and set it equal to zero!


Remember this advice for the rest of AP Calculus.



ROLLE'S THEOREM
Now let's learn Rolle's theorem, which is a special case of the MVTD.


If y = f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b], and is differentiable everywhere on the interval (a, b), and if f(a) = f(b) = 0, then there is at least one number c between a and b such that f´(c) = 0.


Graphically, this means that a continuous, differentiable curve has a horizontal tangent between any two points where it crosses the x-axis.

Example 4 was an example of Rolle's theorem, but let's do another.
Example 5: Consider the function f(x) =  − 6x on the interval [0, 12].
First, show that

f(0) =  −6(0) = 0 and f(12) =  − 6(12) = 0

Then find

f´(x) = x − 6, so f´(c) = c − 6

If you set this equal to zero (remember what we told you!), you get c = 6. This value of c falls in the interval, so the theorem holds for this example.
As with the MVTD, you'll run into problems with the theorem when the function is not continuous and differentiable over the interval. This is where you need to look out for a trap set by ETS. Otherwise, just follow what we did here and you won't have any trouble with either Rolle's theorem or the MVTD. Try these example problems, and cover the responses until you check your work.
PROBLEM 1. Find the values of c that satisfy the MVTD for f(x) = x2 + 2x − 1 on the interval [0, 1].
Answer: First, find f(0) and f(1).

f(0) = 02 + 2(0) − 1 = −1 and f(1) = 12 + 2(1) − 1 = 2

Then,

Next, find f´(x).

f´(x) = 2x + 2

Thus, f´(c) = 2c + 2 = 3, and c = .
PROBLEM 2. Find the values of c that satisfy the MVTD for f(x) = x3 + 1 on the interval [1, 2].
Answer: Find f(1) = 13 + 1 = 2 and f(2) = 23 + 1 = 9. Then,

Next, f´(x) = 3x2, so f´(c) = 3c2 = 7 and c = ±.
Notice that there are two answers for c, but only one of them is in the interval. The answer is c = .
PROBLEM 3. Find the values of c that satisfy the MVTD for f(x) = x +  on the interval [−4, 4].
Answer: First, because the function is not continuous on the interval, there may not be a solution for c. Let's show that this is true. Find f(−4) = −4 −  = −  and f(4) = 4 +  =  Then,

Next, f′(x) = 1 − . Therefore, f′(c) = 1 − .
There's no solution to this equation.
PROBLEM 4. Find the values of c that satisfy Rolle's theorem for f(x) = x4 − x on the interval [0, 1].
Answer: Show that f(0) = 04 − 0 = 0 and that f(1) = 14 − 1 = 0.
Next, find f´(x) = 4x3 − 1. By setting f´(c) = 4c3 − 1 = 0 and solving, you'll see that c = , which is in the interval.
PRACTICE PROBLEM SET 2
Now try these problems. The answers are in Chapter 23.

4. Find the values of c that satisfy the MVTD for f(x) =  − 3 on the interval [−1, 2].
5. Find the values of c that satisfy Rolle's theorem for f(x) = x2 − 8x + 12 on the interval [2, 6].
6. Find the values of c that satisfy Rolle's theorem for f(x) = x(1 − x) on the interval [0, 1].

8. Find the values of c that satisfy Rolle's theorem for f(x) =  on the interval [0, 1].










Chapter 9
Maxima and Minima
Here's another chapter of material involving more ways to apply the derivative to several other types of problems. This stuff focuses mainly on using the derivative to aid in graphing a function, etc.
APPLIED MAXIMA AND MINIMA PROBLEMS
One of the most common applications of the derivative is to find a maximum or minimum value of a function. These values can be called extreme values, optimal values, or critical points. Each of these problems involves the same, very simple principle.


A maximum or a minimum of a function occurs at a point where the derivative of a function is zero, or where the derivative fails to exist.


At a point where the first derivative equals zero, the curve has a horizontal tangent line, at which point it could be reaching either a "peak" (maximum) or a "valley" (minimum).
There are a few exceptions to every rule. This rule is no different.



If the derivative of a function is zero at a certain point, it is usually a maximum or minimum—but not always.
There are two different kinds of maxima and minima: relative and absolute. A relative or local maximum or minimum means that the curve has a horizontal tangent line at that point, but it is not the highest or lowest value that the function attains. In the figure to the right, the two indicated points are relative maxima/minima.




An absolute maximum or minimum occurs either at an artificial point or an end point. In the figure below, the two indicated points are absolute maxima/minima. A relative maximum can also be an absolute maximum.



A typical word problem will ask you to find a maximum or a minimum value of a function, as it pertains to a certain situation. Sometimes you're given the equation; other times, you have to figure it out for yourself. Once you have the equation, you find its derivative and set it equal to zero. The values you get are called critical values. That is, if f′(c) = 0 or f′(c) does not exist, then c is a critical value. Then, test these values to determine whether each value is a maximum or a minimum. The simplest way to do this is with the second derivative test.


If a function has a critical value at x = c, then that value is a relative maximum if f″(c) < 0 and it is a relative minimum if f″(c) > 0.


If the second derivative is also zero at x = c, then the point is neither a maximum nor a minimum but a point of inflection. More about that later.
It's time to do some examples.
Example 1: Find the minimum value on the curve y = ax2, if a > 0.
Take the derivative and set it equal to zero.

 = 2ax = 0

The first derivative is equal to zero at x = 0. By plugging 0 back into the original equation, we can solve for the y-coordinate of the minimum (the y-coordinate is also 0, so the point is at the origin).
In order to determine if this is a maximum or a minimum, take the second derivative.

 = 2a

Because a is positive, the second derivative is positive and the critical point we obtained from the first derivative is a minimum point. Had a been negative, the second derivative would have been negative and a maximum would have occurred at the critical point.
Example 2: A manufacturing company has determined that the total cost of producing an item can be determined from the equation C = 8x2 − 176x + 1,800, where x is the number of units that the company makes. How many units should the company manufacture in order to minimize the cost?
Once again, take the derivative of the cost equation and set it equal to zero.

 = 16 x − 176 = 0
x = 11

This tells us that 11 is a critical point of the equation. Now we need to figure out if this is a maximum or a minimum using the second derivative.

 = 16

Because 16 is always positive, any critical value is going to be a minimum. Therefore, the company should manufacture 11 units in order to minimize its cost.
Example 3: A rocket is fired into the air, and its height in meters at any given time t can be calculated using the formula h(t) = 1,600 + 196t − 4.9t2. Find the maximum height of the rocket and the time at which it occurs.
Take the derivative and set it equal to zero.

 = 196 − 9.8t
t = 20

Now that we know 20 is a critical point of the equation, use the second derivative test.

 = −9.8

This is always negative, so any critical value is a maximum. To determine the maximum height of the rocket, plug t = 20 into the equation.

h(20) = 1,600 + 196(20) − 4.9(202) = 3,560 meters



The technique is always the same: (a) take the derivative of the equation; (b) set it equal to zero; and (c) use the second derivative test.


The hardest part of these word problems is when you have to set up the equation yourself. The following is a classic AP problem:
Example 4: Max wants to make a box with no lid from a rectangular sheet of cardboard that is 18 inches by 24 inches. The box is to be made by cutting a square of side x from each corner of the sheet and folding up the sides (see figure below). Find the value of x that maximizes the volume of the box.

After we cut out the squares of side x and fold up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be:


width: 18 − 2x
length: 24 − 2x
depth: x


Using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, we can get an equation for the volume in terms of x.

V = x(18 − 2x)(24 − 2x)

Multiply the terms together (and be careful with your algebra).

V = x(18 − 2x)(24 − 2x) = 4x3 − 84x2 + 432x

Now take the derivative.

 = 12x2 − 168x + 432

Set the derivative equal to zero, and solve for x.

12x2 − 168x + 432 = 0
x2 − 14x + 36 = 0


Common sense tells us that you can't cut out two square pieces that measure 10.6 inches to a side (the sheet's only 18 inches wide!), so the maximizing value has to be 3.4 inches. Here's the second derivative test, just to be sure.

 = 24x − 168

At x = 3.4,

 = −86.4

So the volume of the box will be maximized when x = 3.4.
Therefore, the dimensions of the box that maximize the volume are approximately: 11.2 in. × 17.2 in. × 3.4 in.
Sometimes, particularly when the domain of a function is restricted, you have to test the endpoints of the interval as well. This is because the highest or lowest value of a function may be at an endpoint of that interval; the critical value you obtained from the derivative might be just a local maximum or minimum. For the purposes of the AP exam, however, endpoints are considered separate from critical values.
Example 5: Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of y = x3 − x on the interval [−3, 3].
Take the derivative and set it equal to zero.

 = 3x2 − 1 = 0

Solve for x.

x = ±

Test the critical points.

 = 6x

At x = , we have a minimum. At x = −, we have a maximum.
At x = −, y =  ≈ 0.385
At x = , y =  ≈ −0.385
Now it's time to check the endpoints of the interval.
At x = −3, y = −24
At x = 3, y = 24
We can see that the function actually has a lower value at x = −3 than at its "minimum" when x = . Similarly, the function has a higher value at x = 3 than at its "maximum" of x = −. This means that the function has a "local minimum" at x = , and an "absolute minimum" when x = −3. And, the function has a "local maximum" at x = −, and an "absolute maximum" at x = 3.
Example 6: A rectangle is to be inscribed in a semicircle with radius 4, with one side on the semicircle's diameter. What is the largest area this rectangle can have?
Let's look at this on the coordinate axes. The equation for a circle of radius 4, centered at the origin, is x2 + y2 = 16; a semicircle has the equation y = . Our rectangle can then be expressed as a function of x, where the height is  and the base is 2x. See the following figure:

The area of the rectangle is: A = 2x. Let's take the derivative of the area.

The derivative is not defined at x = ±4. Setting the derivative equal to zero we get


2(16 − x2) = 2x2
32 − 2x2 = 2x2
32 = 4x2
x = ±


If you're wondering why we don't use the negative root, it's because there is no such thing as a negative area.

Note that the domain of this function is −4 ≤ x ≤ 4, so these numbers serve as endpoints of the interval. Let's compare the critical values and the endpoints.


When x = −4, y = 0 and the area is 0.
When x = 4, y = 0 and the area is 0.
When x = , y =  and the area is 16.


Thus, the maximum area occurs when x =  and the area equals 16.
Try some of these solved problems on your own. As always, cover the answers as you work.
PROBLEM 1. A rectangular field, bounded on one side by a building, is to be fenced in on the other three sides. If 3,000 feet of fence is to be used, find the dimensions of the largest field that can be fenced in.
Answer: First, let's make a rough sketch of the situation.

If we call the length of the field y and the width of the field x, the formula for the area of the field becomes

A = xy

The perimeter of the fencing is equal to the sum of two widths and the length.

2x + y = 3,000

Now solve this second equation for y:

y = 3,000 − 2x

When you plug this expression into the formula for the area, you get a formula for A in terms of x.

A = x(3,000 − 2x) = 3,000x − 2x2

Next, take the derivative, set it equal to zero, and solve for x.

 = 3,000 − 4x = 0
x = 750

Let's check to make sure it's a maximum. Find the second derivative.

 = −4

Because we have a negative result, x = 750 is a maximum. Finally, if we plug in x = 750 and solve for y, we find that y = 1,500. The largest field will measure 750 feet by 1,500 feet.
PROBLEM 2. A poster is to contain 100 square inches of picture surrounded by a 4-inch margin at the top and bottom and a 2-inch margin on each side. Find the overall dimensions that will minimize the total area of the poster.
Answer: First, make a sketch.

Let the area of the picture be xy = 100. The total area of the poster is A = (x + 4)(y + 8). Then, expand the equation.

A = xy + 4y + 8x + 32

Substitute xy = 100 and y =  into the area equation, and we get

A = 132 +  + 8x

Now take the derivative and set it equal to zero.

Solving for x, we find that x = . Now solve for y by plugging x =  into the area equation: y = 2. Then check that these dimensions give us a minimum.

This is positive when x is positive, so the minimum area occurs when x = . Thus, the overall dimensions of the poster are 4 +  inches by 8 + 2 inches.
PROBLEM 3. An open-top box with a square bottom and rectangular sides is to have a volume of 256 cubic inches. Find the dimensions that require the minimum amount of material.
Answer: First, make a sketch of the situation.

The amount of material necessary to make the box is equal to the surface area.

S = x2 + 4xy

The formula for the volume of the box is x2y = 256.
If we solve the latter equation for y, y = , and plug it into the former equation, we get

S = x2 + 4x = x2 + 

Now take the derivative and set it equal to zero.

If we solve this for x, we get x3 = 512 and x = 8. Solving for y, we get y = 4.
Check that these dimensions give us a minimum.

This is positive when x is positive, so the minimum surface area occurs when x = 8. The dimensions of the box should be 8 inches by 8 inches by 4 inches.
PROBLEM 4. Find the point on the curve y =  that is a minimum distance from the point (4, 0).
Answer: First, make that sketch.

Using the distance formula, we get

D2 = (x − 4)2 + (y − 0)2 = x2 − 8x + 16 + y2

Because y = ,

D2 = x2 − 8x + 16 + x = x2 − 7x + 16

Next, let L = D2. We can do this because the minimum value of D2 will occur at the same value of x as the minimum value of D. Therefore, it's simpler to minimize D2 rather than D (because we won't have to take a square root!).

L = x2 − 7x + 16

Now, take the derivative and set it equal to zero.

 = 2x − 7 = 0
x = 

Solving for y, we get y = .
Finally, because  = 2, the point  is the minimum distance from the point (4, 0).
PRACTICE PROBLEM SET 1
Now try these problems on your own. The answers are in Chapter 23.

1. A rectangle has its base on the x-axis and its two upper corners on the parabola y = 12 − x2. What is the largest possible area of the rectangle?
2. An open rectangular box is to be made from a 9 × 12 inch piece of tin by cutting squares of side x inches from the corners and folding up the sides. What should x be to maximize the volume of the box?
3. A 384-square-meter plot of land is to be enclosed by a fence and divided into two equal parts by another fence parallel to one pair of sides. What dimensions of the outer rectangle will minimize the amount of fence used?
4. What is the radius of a cylindrical soda can with volume of 512 cubic inches that will use the minimum material?
5. A swimmer is at a point 500 m from the closest point on a straight shoreline. She needs to reach a cottage located 1,800 m downshore from the closest point. If she swims at 4 m/s and she walks at 6 m/s, how far from the cottage should she come ashore so as to arrive at the cottage in the shortest time?
6. Find the closest point on the curve x2 + y2 = 1 to the point (2, 1).

8. The range of a projectile is R = , where v0 is its initial velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity and is a constant, and θ is its firing angle. Find the angle that maximizes the projectile's range.

CURVE SKETCHING
Another topic on which students spend a lot of time in calculus is curve sketching. In the old days, whole courses (called "Analytic Geometry") were devoted to the subject, and students had to master a wide variety of techniques to learn how to sketch a curve accurately.
Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your point of view), students no longer need to be as good at analytic geometry. There are two reasons for this: (1) The AP exam tests only a few types of curves; and (2) you can use a graphing calculator. Because of the calculator, you can get an idea of the shape of the curve, and all you need to do is find important points to label the graph. We use calculus to find some of these points.
When it's time to sketch a curve, we'll show you a four-part analysis that'll give you all the information you need.
Step 1: Test the Function
Find where f(x) = 0. This tells you the function's x-intercepts (or roots). By setting x = 0, we can determine the y-intercepts. Then, find any horizontal and/or vertical asymptotes.
Step 2: Test the First Derivative
Find where f′(x) = 0. This tells you the critical points. We can determine whether the curve is rising or falling, as well as where the maxima and minima are. It's also possible to determine if the curve has any points where it's nondifferentiable.
Step 3: Test the Second Derivative
Find where f′(x) = 0. This shows you where any points of inflection are. (These are points where the graph of a function changes concavity.) Then we can determine where the graph curves upward and where it curves downward.
Step 4: Test End Behavior
Look at what the general shape of the graph will be, based on the values of y for very large values of ±x. Using this analysis, we can always come up with a sketch of a curve.
And now, the rules.



(1) When f′(x) > 0, the curve is rising; when f′(x) < 0, the curve is falling; when f′(x) = 0, the curve is at a critical point.







(2) When f′(x) > 0, the curve is "concave up"; when f″(x) < 0, the curve is "concave down"; and when f″(x) = 0, the curve is at a point of inflection.







(3) The y-coordinates of each critical point are found by plugging the x-value into the original equation.



As always, this stuff will sink in better if we try a few examples.
Example 1: Sketch the equation y = x3 − 12x.
Step 1: Find the x-intercepts.

x3 − 12x = 0
x(x2 − 12) = 0
x(x − )(x + ) = 0
x = 0, ±

The curve has x-intercepts at (, 0), (−, 0), and (0, 0).
Next, find the y-intercepts.

y = (0)3 − 12(0) = 0

The curve has a y-intercept at (0, 0).
There are no asymptotes, because there's no place where the curve is undefined (you won't have asymptotes for curves that are polynomials).
Step 2: Take the derivative of the function to find the critical points.

 = 3x2 − 12

Set the derivative equal to zero, and solve for x.

3x2 − 12 = 0
3(x2 − 4) = 0
3(x − 2)(x + 2) = 0

so x = 2, −2.
Next, plug x = 2, −2 into the original equation to find the y-coordinates of the critical points.

y = (2)3 − 12(2) = −16
y = (−2)3 − 12(−2) = 16

Thus, we have critical points at (2, −16) and (−2, 16).
Step 3: Now, take the second derivative to find any points of inflection.

 = 6x

This equals zero at x = 0. We already know that when x = 0, y = 0, so the curve has a point of inflection at (0, 0).
Now, plug the critical values into the second derivative to determine whether each is a maximum or a minimum. f″(2) = 6(2) = 12. This is positive, so the curve has a minimum at (2, −16), and the curve is concave up at that point. f″(−2) = 6(−2) = −12. This value is negative, so the curve has a maximum at (−2, 16) and the curve is concave down there.
Armed with this information, we can now plot the graph.

Example 2: Sketch the graph of y = x4 + 2x3 − 2x2 + 1.
Step 1: First, let's find the x-intercepts.

x4 + 2x3 − 2x2 + 1 = 0


The good news is that if the roots aren't easy to find, ETS won't ask you to find them, or you can find them with your calculator.

If the equation doesn't factor easily, it's best not to bother to find the function's roots. Convenient, huh?
Next, let's find the y-intercepts.

y = (0)4 + 2(0)3 − 2(0)2 + 1

The curve has a y-intercept at (0, 1).
There are no vertical asymptotes because there is no place where the curve is undefined.
Step 2: Now we take the derivative to find the critical points.

 = 4x3 + 6x2 − 4x

Set the derivative equal to zero.

4x3 + 6x2 − 4x = 0
2x(2x2 + 3x − 2) = 0
2x(2x − 1)(x + 2) = 0
x = 0, , −2

Next, plug these three values into the original equation to find the y-coordinates of the critical points. We already know that when x = 0, y = 1.


When x = , y = 
When x = −2, y = (−2)4 + 2(−2)3 − 2(−2)2 + 1 = −7


Thus, we have critical points at (0, 1), , and (−2, −7).
Step 3: Take the second derivative to find any points of inflection.

 = 12x2 + 12x − 4

Set this equal to zero.

12x2 + 12x − 4 = 0
3x2 + 3x − 1 = 0
x =  ≈ 0.26, −1.26

Therefore, the curve has points of inflection at x = .
Now solve for the y-coordinates.

(0.26, 0.90) and (−1.26, −3.66)

We can now plug the critical values into the second derivative to determine whether each is a maximum or a minimum.

12(0)2 + 12(0) − 4 = −4

This is negative, so the curve has a maximum at (0, 1); the curve is concave down there.

This is positive, so the curve has a minimum at ; the curve is concave up there.

12(−2)2 + 12(−2) − 4 = 20

This is positive, so the curve has a minimum at (−2, −7) and the curve is also concave up there.
We can now plot the graph.

Finding a Cusp
If the derivative of a function approaches ∞ from one side of a point and -∞ from the other, and if the function is continuous at that point, then the curve has a "cusp" at that point. In order to find a cusp, you need to look at points where the first derivative is undefined, as well as where it's zero.
Example 3: Sketch the graph of y = .
Step 1: Find the x-intercepts.

The x-intercepts are at (±2, 0).
Next, find the y-intercepts.

The curve has a y-intercept at (0, 2).
There are no asymptotes because there is no place where the curve is undefined.
Step 2: Now, take the derivative to find the critical points.

What's next? You guessed it! Set the derivative equal to zero.

There are no values of x for which the equation is zero. But here's the new stuff to deal with: At x = 0, the derivative is undefined. If we look at the limit as x approaches 0 from both sides, we can determine whether the graph has a cusp.

Therefore, the curve has a cusp at (0, 2).
There aren't any other critical points. But we can see that when x < 0, the derivative is positive (which means that the curve is rising to the left of zero), and when x > 0 the derivative is negative (which means that the curve is falling to the right of zero).
Step 3: Now, we take the second derivative to find any points of inflection.

Again, there's no x-value where this is zero. In fact, the second derivative is positive at all values of x except 0. Therefore, the graph is concave up everywhere.
Now it's time to graph this.

There's one other type of graph you should know about: a rational function. In order to graph a rational function, you need to know how to find that function's asymptotes.
How to Find Asymptotes
A line y = c is a horizontal asymptote of the graph of y = f(x) if

 (x) = c or if  f(x) = c

A line x = k is a vertical asymptote of the graph of y = f(x) if

 f(x) = ± ∞   or if  f(x) = ± ∞

Example 4: Sketch the graph of y = .
Step 1: Find the x-intercepts. A fraction can be equal to zero only when its numerator is equal to zero (provided that the denominator is not also zero there). All we have to do is set 3x = 0, and you get x = 0. Thus, the graph has an x-intercept at (0, 0). Note: This is also the y-intercept.
Next, look for asymptotes. The denominator is undefined at x = −2, and if we take the left- and right-hand limits of the function we see the following:

 = − ∞ and  = ∞

The curve has a vertical asymptote at x = −2.
If we take  = 3 and  = 3, the curve has a horizontal asymptote at y = 3.
Step 2: Now, take the derivative to figure out the critical points.

There are no values of x that make the derivative equal to zero. Because the numerator is 6 and the denominator is squared, the derivative will always be positive (the curve is always rising). You should note that the derivative is undefined at x = −2, but you already know that there's an asymptote at x = −2, so you don't need to examine this point further.
Step 3: Now, it's time for the second derivative.

This is never equal to zero. The expression is positive when x < −2, so the graph is concave up when x < −2. The second derivative is negative when x > −2, so it's concave down when x > −2.
Now plot the graph.

Now it's time to practice some problems. Do each problem, covering the answer first, then check your answer.
PROBLEM 1. Sketch the graph of y = x3 − 9x2 + 24x − 10. Plot all extrema, points of inflection, and asymptotes.
Answer: Follow the three steps.
First, see if the x-intercepts are easy to find. This is a cubic equation that isn't easily factored. So skip this step.
Next, find the y-intercepts by setting x = 0.

y = (0)3 − 9(0)2 + 24(0) − 10 = −10

The curve has a y-intercept at (0, −10).
There are no asymptotes, because the curve is a simple polynomial.
Next, find the critical points using the first derivative.

 = 3x2 − 18x + 24

Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x.
3x2 − 18x + 24 = 0
3(x ² − 6x + 8) = 0
3(x − 4)(x − 2) = 0
x = 2, 4
Plug x = 2 and x = 4 into the original equation to find the y-coordinates of the critical points.

When x = 2, y = 10
When x = 4, y = 6

Thus, we have critical points at (2, 10) and (4, 6).
In our third step, the second derivative indicates any points of inflection.

 = 6x − 18

This equals zero at x = 3.
Next, plug x = 3 into the original equation to find the y-coordinates of the point of inflection, which is at (3, 8). Plug the critical values into the second derivative to determine whether each is a maximum or a minimum.

6(2) − 18 = −6

This is negative, so the curve has a maximum at (2, 10), and the curve is concave down there.

6(4) − 18 = 6

This is positive, so the curve has a minimum at (4, 6), and the curve is concave up there.
It's graph-plotting time.

PROBLEM 2. Sketch the graph of y = 8x2 − 16x4. Plot all extrema, points of inflection, and asymptotes.
Answer: Factor the polynomial.

8x2 (1 − 2x2) = 0

Solving for x, we get x = 0 (a double root), x = , and x = − .
Find the y-intercepts: when x = 0, y = 0.
There are no asymptotes because the curve is a simple polynomial.
Find the critical points using the first derivative.

 = 16x − 64x3

Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x. You get x = 0, x = , and x = −.
Next, plug x = 0, x = − , and x = − into the original equation to find the y-coordinates of the critical points.

When x = 0, y = 0
When x = , y = 1
When x = −, y = 1

Thus, there are critical points at (0, 0), , and .
Take the second derivative to find any points of inflection.

 = 16 − 192x2

This equals zero at x =  and x = − .
Next, plug x =  and x = −  into the original equation to find the y-coordinates of the points of inflection, which are at  and . Now determine whether the points are maxima or minima.
At x = 0, we have a minimum; the curve is concave up there.
At x = , it's a maximum, and the curve is concave down.
At x = −, it's also a maximum (still concave down).
Now plot.

PROBLEM 3. Sketch the graph of y = . Plot all extrema, points of inflection, and asymptotes.
Answer: This should seem rather routine by now.
Find the x-intercepts by setting the numerator equal to zero; x = 4. The graph has an x-intercept at (4, 0). (It's a double root.)
Next, find the y-intercept by plugging in x = 0.

y = 

The denominator is undefined at x = −3, so there's a vertical asymptote at that point.
Look at the limits.

The curve has a horizontal asymptote at y = 1.
It's time for the first derivative.

The derivative is zero when x = 4, and the derivative is undefined at x = −3. (There's an asymptote there, so we can ignore the point. If the curve were defined at x = −3, then it would be a critical point, as you'll see in the next example.)
Now for the second derivative.

This is zero when x = . The second derivative is positive (and the graph is concave up) when x < , and it's negative (and the graph is concave down) when x > .
We can now plug x = 4 into the second derivative. It's positive there, so (4, 0) is a minimum.
Your graph should look like the following:

PROBLEM 4. Sketch the graph of . Plot all extrema, points of inflection, and asymptotes.
Answer: By inspection, the x-intercept is at x = 4.
Next, find the y-intercepts. When x = 0, y =  ≈ 2.52.
No asymptotes exist because there's no place where the curve is undefined.
The first derivative is

Set it equal to zero.

This can never equal zero. But at x = 4 the derivative is undefined, so this is a critical point. If you look at the limit as x approaches 4 from both sides, you can see if there's a cusp.

The curve has a cusp at (4, 0).
There were no other critical points. But we can see that when x > 4, the derivative is positive and the curve is rising; when x < 4 the derivative is negative, and the curve is falling.
The second derivative is

No value of x can set this equal to zero. In fact, the second derivative is negative at all values of x except 4. Therefore, the graph is concave down everywhere.
Your graph should look like the following:

PRACTICE PROBLEM SET 2
It's time for you to try some of these on your own. Sketch each of the graphs below and check the answers in Chapter 23.

Chapter 10
Motion
This chapter deals with two different types of word problems that involve motion: related rates and the relationship between velocity and acceleration of a particle. The subject matter might seem arcane, but once you get the hang of them, you'll see that these aren't so hard, either. Besides, the AP exam tests only a few basic problem types.
RELATED RATES
The idea behind these problems is very simple. In a typical problem, you'll be given an equation relating two or more variables. These variables will change with respect to time, and you'll use derivatives to determine how the rates of change are related. (Hence the name: related rates.) Sounds easy, doesn't it?
Example 1: A circular pool of water is expanding at the rate of 16π in2/sec. At what rate is the radius expanding when the radius is 4 inches?
Note: The pool is expanding in square inches per second. We've been given the rate that the area is changing, and we need to find the rate of change of the radius. What equation relates the area of a circle to its radius? A = πr2.
Step 1: Set up the equation and take the derivative of this equation with respect to t (time).

In this equation,  represents the rate at which the area is changing, and  is the rate at which the radius is changing. The simplest way to explain this is that whenever you have a variable in an equation (r, for example), the derivative with respect to time  represents the rate at which that variable is increasing or decreasing.
Step 2: Now we can plug in the values for the rate of change of the area and for the radius. (Never plug in the values until after you have taken the derivative or you will get nonsense!)

16π = 2π(4)

Solving for , we get

16π = 8π and  = 2

The radius is changing at a rate of 2 in/sec. It's important to note that this is the rate only when the radius is 4 inches. As the circle gets bigger and bigger, the radius will expand at a slower and slower rate.
Example 2: A 25-foot long ladder is leaning against a wall and sliding toward the floor. If the foot of the ladder is sliding away from the base of the wall at a rate of 15 feet/sec, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the top of the ladder is 7 feet from the ground?
Here's another classic related rates problem. As always, a picture is worth 1,000 words.

You can see that the ladder forms a right triangle with the wall. Let x stand for the distance from the foot of the ladder to the base of the wall, and let y represent the distance from the top of the ladder to the ground. What's our favorite theorem that deals with right triangles? The Pythagorean theorem tells us here that x2 + y2 = 252. Now we have an equation that relates the variables to each other.
Now take the derivative of the equation with respect to t.

Just plug in what you know and solve. Because we're looking for the rate at which the vertical distance is changing, we're going to solve for .
Let's see what we know. We're given the rate at which the ladder is sliding away from the wall:  = 15. The distance from the ladder to the top of the wall is 7 feet (y = 7). To find x, use the Pythagorean theorem. If we plug in y = 7 to the equation x2 + y2 = 252, x = 24.
Now plug all this information into the derivative equation.

2(24)(15) + 2(7) = 0


Example 3: A spherical balloon is expanding at a rate of 60π in3/sec. How fast is the surface area of the balloon expanding when the radius of the balloon is 4 in?
Step 1: You're given the rate at which the volume's expanding, and you know the equation that relates volume to radius. But you have to relate radius to surface area as well, because you have to find the surface area's rate of change. This means that you'll need the equations for volume and surface area of a sphere.

V =  πr3


A = 4πr2

You're trying to find , but A is given in terms of r, so you have to get  first. Because we know the volume, if we work with the equation that gives us volume in terms of radius, we can find . From there, work with the other equation to find . If we take the derivative of the equation with respect to t we get  = 4πr2. Plugging in for  and for r, we get 60π = 4π(4)2 .
Solving for  we get

Step 2: Now we take the derivative of the other equation with respect to t.

We can plug in for r and  from the previous step and we get

One final example.
Example 4: An underground conical tank, standing on its vertex, is being filled with water at the rate of 18π ft3/min. If the tank has a height of 30 feet and a radius of 15 feet, how fast is the water level rising when the water is 12 feet deep?
This "cone" problem is also typical. The key point to getting these right is knowing that the ratio of the height of a right circular cone to its radius is constant. By telling us that the height of the cone is 30 and the radius is 15, we know that at any level, the height of the water will be twice its radius, or h = 2r.

The volume of a cone is V =  πr2h. (You'll learn to derive this formula through integration in Chapter 19.)

You must find the rate at which the water is rising (the height is changing), or . Therefore, you want to eliminate the radius from the volume. By substituting  = r into the equation for volume, we get

Differentiate both sides with respect to t.

Now we can plug in and solve for .

In order to solve related rates problems, you have to be good at determining relationships between variables. Once you figure that out, the rest is a piece of cake. Many of these problems involve geometric relationships, so review the formulas for the volumes and areas of cones, spheres, boxes, and other solids. Once you get the hang of setting up the problems, you'll see that these problems follow the same predictable patterns. Look through these sample problems.
PROBLEM 1. A circle is increasing in area at the rate of 16π in2/sec. How fast is the radius increasing when the radius is 2 in?
Answer: Use the expression that relates the area of a circle to its radius: A = πr2
Next, take the derivative of the expression with respect to t.

Now, plug in  = 16π and r = 2.

16π = 2π(2)

When you solve for , you'll get  = 4 in/sec.

Notice that velocity is given in miles per hour and the answer asks for radians per second. In situations like this one, you have to be sure to convert the units properly, or you'll get nailed.

PROBLEM 2. A rocket is rising vertically at a rate of 5,400 miles per hour. An observer on the ground is standing 20 miles from the rocket's launch point. How fast (in radians per second) is the angle of elevation between the ground and the observer's line of sight of the rocket increasing when the rocket is at an elevation of 40 miles?
Answer: First, draw a picture.

Now, find the equation that relates the angle of elevation to the rocket's altitude.

tan θ = 

If we take the derivative of both sides of this expression with respect to t, we get

We know that  = 5,400 miles per hour, but the problem asks for time in seconds, so we need to convert this number. There are 3,600 seconds in an hour, so  =  miles per second. Next, we know that tan θ = , so when h = 40, tanθ = 2. Because 1 + tan2θ = sec2θ, we get sec2θ = 5.
Plug in the following information:

 radians per second

PRACTICE PROBLEM SET 1
Now try these problems on your own. The answers are in Chapter 23

1. Oil spilled from a tanker spreads in a circle whose circumference increases at a rate of 40 ft/sec. How fast is the area of the spill increasing when the circumference of the circle is 100π feet?
2. A spherical balloon is inflating at a rate of 27π in3/sec. How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the radius is 3 inches?
3. Cars A and B leave a town at the same time. Car A heads due south at a rate of 80 km/hr and car B heads due west at a rate of 60 km/hr. How fast is the distance between the cars increasing after three hours?
4. The sides of an equilateral triangle are increasing at the rate of 27 in/sec. How fast is the triangle's area increasing when the sides of the triangle are each 18 inches long?
5. An inverted conical container has a diameter of 42 inches and a depth of 15 inches. If water is flowing out of the vertex of the container at a rate of 35π in3/sec, how fast is the depth of the water dropping when the height is 5 in?
6. A boat is being pulled toward a dock by a rope attached to its bow through a pulley on the dock 7 feet above the bow. If the rope is hauled in at a rate of 4 ft/sec, how fast is the boat approaching the dock when 25 ft of rope is out?
7. A 6-foot-tall woman is walking at the rate of 4 ft/sec away from a street lamp that is 24 ft tall. How fast is the length of her shadow changing?
8. The minute hand of a clock is 6 inches long. Starting from noon, how fast is the area of the sector swept out by the minute hand increasing in in2/min at any instant?

POSITION, VELOCITY, AND ACCELERATION
Almost every AP exam has a question on position, velocity, or acceleration. It's one of the traditional areas of physics where calculus comes in handy. Some of these problems require the use of integral calculus, which we won't talk about until the second half of this book. So, this unit is divided in half; you'll see the other half later.
If you have a function that gives you the position of an object (usually called a "particle") at a specified time, then the derivative of that function with respect to time is the velocity of the object, and the second derivative is the acceleration. These are usually represented by the following:


Position: x(t) or sometimes s(t)
Velocity: v(t), which is x′(t)
Acceleration: a(t), which is x″(t) or v′(t)



Please note that these equations are usually functions of time (t). Typically, t is greater than zero, but it doesn't have to be.

By the way, speed is the absolute value of velocity.
Example 1: If the position of a particle at a time t is given by the equation x(t) = t3 − 11t2 + 24t, find the velocity and the acceleration of the particle at time t = 5.
First, take the derivative of x(t).

x′(t) = 3t2 − 22t + 24 = v(t)

Second, plug in t = 5 to find the velocity at that time.

v(5) = 3(52) − 22(5) + 24 = −11

Third, take the derivative of v(t) to find a(t).

v′(t) = 6t − 22 = a(t)

Finally, plug in t = 5 to find the acceleration at that time.

a(5) = 6(5) − 22 = 8

See the negative velocity? The sign of the velocity is important, because it indicates the direction of the particle. Make sure that you know the following:


When the velocity is negative, the particle is moving to the left.
When the velocity is positive, the particle is moving to the right.
When the velocity and acceleration of the particle have the same signs, the particle's speed is increasing.
When the velocity and acceleration of the particle have opposite signs, the particle's speed is decreasing (or slowing down).
When the velocity is zero and the acceleration is not zero, the particle is momentarily stopped and changing direction.





Example 2: If the position of a particle is given by x(t) = t3 − 12t2 + 36t + 18, where t > 0, find the point at which the particle changes direction.
The derivative is

x′(t) = v(t) = 3t2 − 24t + 36

Set it equal to zero and solve for t.

x′(t) = 3t2 − 24t + 36 = 0
t2 − 8t + 12 = 0
(t − 2)(t − 6) = 0

So, we know that t = 2 or t = 6.
You need to check that the acceleration is not 0: x″(t) = 6t − 24. This equals 0 at t = 4. Therefore, the particle is changing direction at t = 2 and t = 6.
Example 3: Given the same position function as in Example 2, find the interval of time during which the particle is slowing down.
When 0 < t < 2 and t > 6, the particle's velocity is positive; when 2 < t < 6, the particle's velocity is negative. You can verify this by graphing the function and seeing when it's above or below the x-axis. Or, try some points in the regions between the roots and outside the roots. Now, we need to determine the same information about the acceleration.

a(t) = v′(t) = 6t − 24

So the acceleration will be negative when t < 4, and positive when t > 4.
So we have:

Whenever the velocity and acceleration have opposite signs, the particle is slowing down. Here the particle is slowing down during the first two seconds (0 < t < 2) and between the fourth and sixth seconds (4 < t < 6).
Another typical question you'll be asked is to find the distance a particle has traveled from one time to another. This is the distance that the particle has covered without regard to the sign, not just the displacement. In other words, if the particle had an odometer on it, what would it read? Usually, all you have to do is plug in two times into the position function and find the difference.
Example 4: How far does a particle travel between the eighth and tenth seconds if its position function is x(t) = t2 − 6t?
Find x(10) − x(8) = (100 − 60) - (64 − 48) = 24.
Be careful about one very important thing: If the velocity changes sign during the problem's time interval, you'll get the wrong answer if you simply follow the method in the paragraph above. For example, suppose we had the same position function as above but we wanted to find the distance that the particle travels from t = 2 to t = 4.

x(4) − x(2) = (−8) − (−8) = 0

This is wrong. The particle travels from −8 back to −8, but it hasn't stood still. To fix this problem, divide the time interval into the time when the velocity is negative and the time when the velocity is positive, and add the absolute values of each distance. Here, the velocity is v(t) = 2t − 6. The velocity is negative when t < 3 and positive when t > 3. So we find the absolute value of the distance traveled from t = 2 to t = 3, and add to that the absolute value of the distance traveled from t = 3 to t = 4.
Because x(t) = t2 − 6t,

|x(3) − x(2)| + |x(4) − x(3) = |−9 + 8| + |−8 + 9| = 2

This is the distance that the particle traveled.
Example 5: Given the position function x(t) = t4 − 8t2, find the distance that the particle travels from t = 0 to t = 4.
First, find the first derivative (v(t) = 4t3 − 16t) and set it equal to zero.

4t3 − 16t = 0 4t(t2 − 4) = 0 t = 0, 2, −2

So we need to divide the time interval into t = 0 to t = 2 and t = 2 to t = 4.

|x(2) − x(0)| + |x(4) − x(2) = 16 + 144 = 160

Here are some solved problems. Do each problem, covering the answer first, then checking your answer.
PROBLEM 1. Find the velocity and acceleration of a particle whose position function is x(t) = 2t3 − 21t2 + 60t + 3, for t > 0.
Answer: Find the first two derivatives.

v(t) = 6t2 − 42t + 60
a(t) = 12t − 42

PROBLEM 2. Given the position function in problem 1, find when the particle's speed is increasing.
Answer: First, set v(t) = 0.

6t2 − 42t + 60 = 0
t2 − 7t + 10 = 0
(t − 2)(t − 5) = 0
t = 2, t = 5

You should be able to determine that the velocity is positive from 0 < t < 2, negative from 2 < t < 5, and positive again from t > 5.
Now, set a(t) = 0.

12t − 42 = 0
t = 

You should be able to determine that the acceleration is negative from 0 < t <  and positive from t > .
The intervals where the velocity and the acceleration have the same sign are 2 < t <  and t > 5.
PROBLEM 3. Given that the position of a particle is found by x(t) = t3 − 6t2 + 1, t > 0, find the distance that the particle travels from t = 2 to t = 5.
Answer: First, find v(t).

v(t) = 3t2 − 12t

Second, set v(t) = 0 and find the critical values.

3t2 − 12t = 0     3t(t − 4) = 0     t = {0, 4}

Because the particle changes direction after four seconds, you have to figure out two time intervals separately (from t = 2 to t = 4 and from t = 4 to t = 5) and add the absolute values of the distances.

|x(4) − x(2)| + |x(5) − x(4)| = |(−31) − (−15)| + |(−24) − (−31)| = 23

PRACTICE PROBLEM SET 2
Now try these problems. The answers are in Chapter 23.

1. Find the velocity and acceleration of a particle whose position function is x(t) = t3 − 9t2 + 24t, t > 0.
2. Find the velocity and acceleration of a particle whose position function is x(t) = sin(2t) + cos(t).
3. If the position function of a particle is x(t) = sin , 0 < t < 4π, find when the particle is changing direction.
4. If the position function of a particle is x(t) = 3t2 + 2t + 4, t > 0, find the distance that the particle travels from t = 2 to t = 5.
5. If the position function of a particle is x(t) = t2 + 8t, t > 0, find the distance that the particle travels from t = 0 to t = 4.
6. If the position function of a particle is x(t) = 2sin2t + 2cos2t, t > 0, find the velocity and acceleration of the particle.
7. If the position function of a particle is x(t) = t3 + 8t2 − 2t + 4, t > 0, find when the particle is changing direction.
8. If the position function of a particle is x(t) = 2t3 − 6t2 + 12t − 18, t > 0, find when the particle is changing direction.










Chapter 11
Exponential and Logarithmic Functions, Part One
As with trigonometric functions, you'll be expected to remember all of the logarithmic and exponential functions you've studied in the past. If you're not sure about any of this stuff, review the unit on Prerequisite Mathematics in the Appendix. Also, this is only part one of our treatment of exponents and logs. Much of what you need to know about these functions requires knowledge of integrals (the second half of the book), so we'll discuss them again later.
THE DERIVATIVE OF ln x
When you studied logs in the past, you probably concentrated on common logs (that is, those with a base of 10), and avoided natural logarithms (base e) as much as possible. Well, we have bad news for you: Most of what you'll see from now on involves natural logs. In fact, common logs almost never show up in calculus. But that's okay. All you have to do is memorize a bunch of rules, and you'll be fine.


Rule No. 1: If y = ln x, then 


This rule has a corollary that incorporates the Chain Rule and is actually a more useful rule to memorize.


Rule No. 2: If y = ln u, then 


Remember: u is a function of x, and  is its derivative.
You'll see how simple this rule is after we try a few examples.
Example 1: Find the derivative of f(x) = ln(x3).

If you recall your rules of logarithms, you could have done this another way.

ln(x3) = 3ln x
Therefore, f′(x) = 3.

Example 2: Find the derivative of f(x) = ln(5x − 3x6).

Example 3: Find the derivative of f(x) = ln(cos x).

Finding the derivative of a natural logarithm is just a matter of following a simple formula.
THE DERIVATIVE OF ex
As you'll see in Rule No. 3, the derivative of ex is probably the easiest thing that you'll ever have to do in calculus.


Rule No. 3: If y = ex, then  = ex


That's not a typo. The derivative is the same as the original function! Incorporating the Chain Rule, we get a good formula for finding the derivative.


Rule No. 4: If y = eu, then 


And you were worried that all of this logarithm and exponential stuff was going to be hard!
Example 4: Find the derivative of f(x) = e3x.

f′(x) = e3x(3) = 3e3x

Example 5: Find the derivative of f(x) = ex3.

Example 6: Find the derivative of f(x) = etan x.

f′(x) = (sec2 x)etan x

Example 7: Find the second derivative of f(x) = ex2.

Once again, it's just a matter of following a formula.
THE DERIVATIVE OF logax
This derivative is actually a little trickier than the derivative of a natural log. First, if you remember your logarithm rules about change of base, we can rewrite loga x.

Review the unit on Prerequisite Mathematics if this leaves you scratching your head. Anyway, because ln a is a constant, we can take the derivative.

This leads us to our next rule.


Rule No. 5: If y = logax, then 


Once again, incorporating the Chain Rule gives us a more useful formula.


Rule No. 6: If y = logau, then 


Example 8: Find the derivative of f(x) = log10 x.

Note: We refer to the log10 x as log x.


Example 9: Find the derivative of f(x) = log8(x2 + x).

Example 10: Find the derivative of f(x) = loge x

You can expect this result from Rules 1 and 2 involving natural logs.
The Derivative of ax
You should recall from your precalculus days that we can rewrite ax as exln a. Keep in mind that ln a is just a constant, which gives us the next rule.


Rule No. 7: If y = ax, then  = (ex ln a)ln a = ax (ln a)


Given the pattern of this chapter, you can guess what's coming: another rule that incorporates the Chain Rule.


Rule No. 8: If y = au, then  = au (ln a)


And now, some examples.
Example 11: Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x.

f′(x)3x ln 3

Example 12: Find the derivative of .

Example 13: Find the derivative of f(x) = πsin x.

f′(x) = πsin x(cos x)ln π

Finally, here's every nasty teacher's favorite exponential derivative.
Example 14: Find the derivative of f(x) = xx.
First, rewrite this as f(x) = ex ln x. Then, take the derivative.

Chapter 12
Other Topics in Differential Calculus
This chapter is devoted to other topics involving differential calculus that don't fit into a specific category.
THE DERIVATIVE OF AN INVERSE FUNCTION
ETS occasionally asks a question about finding the derivative of an inverse function. To do this, you need to learn only this simple formula.
Suppose we have a function x = f(y) that is defined and differentiable at y = a where x = c. Suppose we also know that the f−1(x) exists at x = c. Thus, f(a) = c and f−1(c) = a. Then, because ,





The short translation of this is: We can find the derivative of a function's inverse at a particular point by taking the reciprocal of the derivative at that point's corresponding y-value. These examples should help clear up any confusion.
Example 1: If f(x) = x2, find a derivative of f−1(x) at x = 9.
First, notice that f(3) = 9. One of the most confusing parts of finding the derivative of an inverse function is that when you're asked to find the derivative at a value of x, they're really asking you for the derivative of the inverse of the function at the value that corresponds to f(x) = 9. This is because x-values of the inverse correspond to f(x)-values of the original function.
The rule is very simple: When you're asked to find the derivative of f−1(x) at x = c, you take the reciprocal of the derivative of f(x) at x = a, where f(a) = c.
We know that  f(x) = 2x. This means that we're going to plug x = 3 into the formula (because f(3) = 9). This gives us

We can verify this by finding the inverse of the function first and then taking the derivative. The inverse of the function f(x) = x2 is the function f−1(x) = . Now we find the derivative and evaluate it at f(3) = 9.

Remember the rule: Find the value, a, of f(x) that gives you the value of x that the problem asks for. Then plug that value, a, into the reciprocal of the derivative of the inverse function.
Example 2: Find a derivative of the inverse of y = x3 − 1 when y = 7.
First, we need to find the x-value that corresponds to y = 7. A little algebra tells us that this is x = 2. Then,

Therefore, the derivative of the inverse is

Verify it: The inverse of the function y = x3 − 1 is the function y = . The derivative of this latter function is

Let's do one more.
Example 3: Find a derivative of the inverse of y = x2 + 4 when y = 29.
At y = 29, x = 5, the derivative of the function is

 = 2x

So, a derivative of the inverse is

Note that x = −5 also gives us y = 29, so  is also a derivative. It's not that hard, once you get the hang of it.
This is all you'll be required to know involving derivatives of inverses. Naturally, there are ways to create harder problems, but the AP exam stays away from them and sticks to simpler stuff.
Here are some solved problems. Do each problem, cover the answer first, and then check your answer.
PROBLEM 1. Find a derivative of the inverse of f(x) = 2x3 + 5x + 1 at y = 8.
Answer: First, we take the derivative of f(x).

f′(x) = 6x2 + 5

A possible value of x is x = 1.
Then, we use the formula to find the derivative of the inverse.

PROBLEM 2. Find a derivative of the inverse of f(x) = 3x3 − x + 7 at y = 9.
Answer: First, take the derivative of f(x).

f′(x) = 9x2 − 1

A possible value of x is x = 1.
Then, use the formula to find the derivative of the inverse.

PROBLEM 3. Find a derivative of the inverse of y =  at y = 1.
Answer: Take the derivative of y.

Find the value of x where y = 1.

Use the formula.

Here's one more.
PROBLEM 4. Find a derivative of the inverse of y = 2x − x3 at y = 1.
Answer: The derivative of the function is

 = 2 − 3x2

Next, find the value of x where y = 1. By inspection, y = 1 when x = 1.
Then, we use the formula to find the derivative of the inverse.

PRACTICE PROBLEM SET 1
Find a derivative of the inverse of each of the following functions. The answers are in Chapter 23.

3. y = ex at y = e
4. y = x + x3 at y = −2
5. y = 4x − x3 at y = 3
6. y = ln x at y = 0

DERIVATIVES OF PARAMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Although these can seem very difficult, the questions about parametric equations on the AP exam tend to be very straightforward. As we keep pointing out, don't be intimidated by the difficult topics; the AP exam tends to keep the questions simple. By contrast, questions on simpler topics tend to be trickier.
What Is a Parametric Function?
Let's use an analogy. Suppose you're driving a car, and you want to determine a function that describes your position on the road. There are two ways that you could arrive at your position. You could figure it out based on how far you've traveled, or you could determine it based on how long you've been traveling. If you let y represent your position and x the distance, you could find your position by y = f(x).
If, on the other hand, you wanted to use the time that you've traveled, you can use two functions: x = g(t), to determine the distance you've traveled, and y = h(t), to determine your position. These latter equations are called "parametric equations." They enable you to define x and y in terms of another variable (usually t), rather than in terms of each other. Parametric equations also follow all of the standard derivative rules.




For example, suppose that x = t2 and y = t4. Then,

Now, because x = t2,  = 2x.
We can verify this by first solving for y in terms of x and then differentiating. The result is

y = x2 and  = 2x

You might also be asked to turn an equation in parametric form into an equation in Cartesian form. The simplest thing to do is to solve the equation for t and substitute that equation into the other one. Sometimes the relationship is not so obvious, as in this example.
Example 1: What curve is represented by x = cos t and y = sin t, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π?
We know from trigonometry that sin2 t + cos2 t = 1, so we can substitute y for sin t and x for cos t. If we square both and add them, we get x2 + y2 = 1. This is the equation of a circle, centered at the origin, with radius 1.
You can test this by picking values of t and finding the coordinates by using the two equations. For example,

At t = , x = 0 and y = 1; or
At t = ,  and y = 

Example 2: What curve is represented by x = t and y = t2?
If you substitute x for t, you'll find that y = x2. Thus, this curve is a parabola with vertex at the origin.
Example 3: What curve is represented by x = acos t and y = bsin t, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π?
First, rewrite the two equations.

 = cos t and  = sin t

Now, because we know that sin2t + cos2t = 1, we know that

If a ≠ b, this figure is an ellipse, centered at the origin, with axes of length 2a and 2b. If a = b, it's a circle, centered at the origin, with radius a.
Now you know how to convert an equation from parametric form to Cartesian form. You'll also need to know how to work with the parametric equations, even if you can't figure out how to convert them into Cartesian form (sometimes you don't have to). These frequently will be equations of motion.
Example 4: A particle's position in the xy-plane at any time t is given by x = 2t2 + 3 and y = t4. Find: (a) the x-component of the particle's velocity at time t = 5; (b) ; and (c) the times at which the x- and y-components of the velocity are the same.
(a) All you do is take the derivative with respect to t.
 = 4t
At time t = 5, this is 20.
(b) You know  from part (a), so now compute . This is 4t3. Using the rule, , so

To express the answer in terms of x instead of the parameter, solve for t2 in terms of x.

Then substitute.

(c) The components of the velocity are the same when 4t3 = 4t.

Now you know all you need to about the basics of parametrized curves. There will be other types of problems involving parametric equations, but you'll see them later in the book.
Try these sample problems, working with an index card, as usual.
PROBLEM 1. Find the Cartesian equation represented by the parametric equations x = 4cos t and y = 4sin t, 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π.
Answer: From Example 1, you know that sin2t + cos2t = 1. If you take each equation and rearrange the terms, you get

 = cos t and  = sin t

Next, substitute into sin2t + cos2t = 1.

This is a circle, centered at the origin, with radius 4.
PROBLEM 2. Find an equation of the line tangent to the curve x = 2cos t and y = 3sin t at t = .
Answer: You can, of course, eliminate t, obtaining

Proceed as in Example 4 in Chapter 7, but it's easier to retain the parameter t here and reach the answer. First, find the slope of the tangent line  using the formula .

 = 3cos t and  = −2sin t

Therefore, .
If we evaluate this at t = ,

At t = , x =  and y = . Now you can find the equation of the tangent line.

This can be rewritten as 3x + 2y − 6 = 0.
PROBLEM 3. A particle's position at time t is determined by the equations x = 3 + 2t2 and y = 4t4, t ≥ 0. Find the x- and y-components of the particle's velocity and the times when these components are equal.
Answer: First, figure out the x- and y-components of the velocity.

 = 4t and  = 16t3

These are equal when 16t3 = 4t. Solving for t,

t = 0, ±

Throw out the negative value of t, the answer is t = 0, .
PRACTICE PROBLEM SET 2
Now try these problems. The answers are in Chapter 23.

1. Find the Cartesian equation of the curve represented by x = sec2 t − 1 and y = tan t, − < t < .
2. Find the Cartesian equation of the curve represented by x = t and y = , −1 < t < 1.

5. Find the equation of the tangent line to x = sec t and y = tan t at t = .

7. The motion of a particle is given by x = lnt and y = t2 − 4t. Find the coordinates of the particle when its instantaneous direction of motion is horizontal.
8. The motion of a particle is given by x = 2sin t − 1 and y = sin t − , 0 ≤ t < 2π. Find the times when the horizontal and vertical components of the particle's velocity are the same.

L'HÔPITAL'S RULE
L'Hôpital's Rule is a way to find the limit of certain kinds of expressions that are indeterminate forms. If the limit of an expression results in  or , the limit is called "indeterminate" and you can use L'Hôpital's Rule to evaluate these expressions.


If f(c) = g(c) = 0, and if f′(c) and g′(c) exist, and if g′(c) = ≠ 0, then



Similarly,


If f(c) = g(c) = ∞, and if f′(c) and g′(c) exist, and if g′(c) ≠, then



In other words, if the limit of the function gives us an undefined expression, like  or , L'Hôpital's Rule says we can take the derivative of the top and the derivative of the bottom and see if we get a determinate expression. If not, we can repeat the process.
Example 1: Find .
First, notice that plugging in 0 results in , which is indeterminate. Take the derivative of the top and of the bottom.

The limit equals 1.
Example 2: Find .
If you plug in 0, you get , which is indeterminate. Now, take the derivative of the top and of the bottom.

This limit also equals 1.
Example 3: Find .
Again, plugging in 0 is no help; you get . Take the derivative of the top and bottom.

Example 4: Find .
Take the derivative of the top and bottom.

Now if you take the limit, we still get . So do it again.

Now let's try a couple of  forms.
Example 5: Find .
Now, the limit is . The derivative of the top and bottom is

Don't you wish that you had learned this back when you first did limits?
Example 6: Find .
The derivative of the top and bottom is

Example 7: Find  xcot x.
Taking this limit results in (0)(∞), which is also indeterminate. (But you can't use the rule yet!) If you rewrite this expression as , it's of the form , and we can use L'Hôpital's Rule.

That's all that you need to know about L'Hôpital's Rule. Just check to see if the limit results in an indeterminate form. If it does, use the rule until you get a determinate form.
Here are some more examples.
PROBLEM 1. Find .
Answer: First, notice that plugging in 0 gives us an indeterminate result: . Now, take the derivative of the top and of the bottom.

PROBLEM 2. Find  xe−2x.
Answer: First, rewrite this expression as . Notice that when x nears infinity, the expression becomes , which is indeterminate.
Take the derivative of the top and bottom.

PROBLEM 3. Find .
Answer: We learned this in Chapter 3, remember? Now we'll use L'Hôpital's Rule. At first glance, the limit is indeterminate: . Let's take some derivatives.

This is still indeterminate, so it's time to take the derivative of the top and bottom again.

It's still indeterminate! If you try it one more time, you'll get a fraction with no variables: , which can be simplified to  (as we expected).
PROBLEM 4. Find .
Answer: Plugging in  gives you the indeterminate response of . The derivative is

When we take the limit of this expression, we get −1.

DIFFERENTIALS
Sometimes this is called "linearization." A differential is a very small quantity that corresponds to a change in a number. We use the symbol ∆x to denote a differential. What are differentials used for? The AP exam mostly wants you to use them to approximate the value of a function or to find the error of an approximation.
Recall the formula for the definition of the derivative.

Replace h with ∆x, which also stands for a very small increment of x, and get rid of the limit.

Notice that this is no longer equal to the derivative, but an approximation of it. If ∆x is kept small, the approximation remains fairly accurate. Next, rearrange the equation as follows:


f(x + ∆x) ≈ f(x) + f′(x)∆x


This is our formula for differentials. It says that "the value of a function (at x plus a little bit) equals the value of the function (at x) plus the product of the derivative of the function (at x) and the little bit."
Example 1: Use differentials to approximate .
You can start by letting x = 9, ∆x = +0.01, f(x) = . Next, we need to find f′(x).

f′(x) = 

Now, plug in to the formula.

f(x + ∆x) ≈ f(x) + f′(x)∆x


Now, if we plug in x = 9 and ∆x = +0.01,

 ≈  + (0.01) ≈ 3.001666666

If you enter  into your calculator, you get: 3.001666204. As you can see, our answer is a pretty good approximation. It's not so good, however, when ∆x is too big. How big is too big? Good question.
Example 2: Use differentials to approximate .
Let x = 9, ∆x = +0.5, f(x) =  and plug in to what you found in Example 1.

 ≈  + (0.5) ≈ 3.083333333

However,  equals 3.082207001 on a calculator. This is good to only two decimal places. As the ratio of  grows larger, the approximation gets less accurate, and we start to get away from the actual value.
There's another approximation formula that you'll need to know for the AP exam. This formula is used to estimate the error in a measurement or to find the effect on a formula when a small change in measurement is made. The formula is


dy = f′(x) dx



Note that this equation is simply a rearrangement of  = f′(x).

This notation may look a little confusing. It says that the change in a measurement dy, due to a differential dx, is found by multiplying the derivative of the equation for y by the differential. Let's do an example.
Example 3: The radius of a circle is increased from 3 to 3.04. Estimate the change in area.
Let A = πr2. Then our formula says that dA = A′dr, where A′ is the derivative of the area with respect to r, and dr = 0.04 (the change). First, find the derivative of the area: A′ = 2πr. Now, plug in to the formula.

dA = 2πr dr = 2π(3)(0.04) = 0.754

The actual change in the area is from 9π to 9.2416π, which is approximately 0.759. As you can see, this approximation formula is pretty accurate.
Here are some sample problems involving this differential formula. Try them out, then check your work against the answers directly beneath.
PROBLEM 1. Use differentials to approximate (3.98)4.
Answer: Let f(x) = x4, x = 4, and ∆x = −0.02. Next, find f′(x), which is: f′(x) = 4x3.
Now, plug in to the formula.

f(x + ∆x) ≈ f(x) + f′(x)∆x
(x + ∆x)4 ≈ x4 + 4x3∆x

If you plug in x = 4 and ∆x = −0.02, you get

(3.98)4 ≈ 44 + 4(4)3(−0.02) ≈ 250.88

Check (3.98)4 by using your calculator; you should get 250.9182722. Not a bad approximation.
You're probably asking yourself, why can't I just use my calculator every time? Because most math teachers are dedicated to teaching you several complicated ways to calculate things without your calculator.
PROBLEM 2. Use differentials to approximate sin 46°.
Answer: This is a tricky question. The formula doesn't work if you use degrees. Here's why: Let f(x) = sin x, x = 45°, and ∆x = 1°. The derivative is f′(x) = cos x.
If you plug this information into the formula, you get: sin 46° ≈ sin 45° + cos 45°(1°) = . You should recognize that this is nonsense for two reasons: (1) the sine of any angle is between −1 and 1; and (2) the answer should be close to sin 45° = .
What went wrong? You have to use radians! As we mentioned before, angles in calculus problems are measured in radians, not degrees.
Let f(x) = sin x, x = , and ∆x = . Now plug in to the formula.

PROBLEM 3. The radius of a sphere is measured to be 4 cm with an error of ±0.01 cm. Use differentials to approximate the error in the surface area.
Answer: Now it's time for the other differential formula. The formula for the surface area of a sphere is

S = 4πr2

The formula says that dS = S′dr, so first, we find the derivative of the surface area, (S′ = 8πr) and plug away.

dS = 8πrdr = 8π(4)(±0.01) = ±1.0053

This looks like a big error, but given that the surface area of a sphere with radius 4 is approximately 201 cm2, the error is quite small.

(a) the diameter is exact, but the height is 20.1 meters; and
(b) the height is exact, but the diameter is 5.1 meters.

LOGARITHMIC DIFFERENTIATION
There's one last topic in differential calculus that you need to know: logarithmic differentiation. It's a very simple and handy technique used to find the derivatives of expressions that involve a lot of algebra. By employing the rules of logarithms, we can find the derivatives of expressions that would otherwise require a messy combination of the Chain Rule, the Product Rule, and the Quotient Rule.
First, let's review a couple of rules of logarithms (remember, when we refer to a logarithm in calculus, we mean the natural log (base e), not the common log).




lnA + lnB = ln(AB)
lnA − lnB = ln 
lnAB = BlnA




For example, we can rewrite ln(x + 3)5 as 5ln(x +3).
As a quick review exercise, how could you rewrite the following:

Answer: 2ln x − 2ln(x + 1).
The other important thing to remember from Chapter 11 is


ln u = 


Bearing these in mind, we can use these rules to find the derivative of a complicated expression without using all that mind-bending algebra. Instead, take the log of both sides of an expression, and then use the rules of logarithms to simplify it before finding the derivative.
Example 1: Find the derivative of y = .
The Quotient Rule works here just fine, but check this out instead. Take the log of both sides.

ln y = ln 

Using log rules, you can rewrite the expression

ln y = ln(x + 3) − ln(2x − 5)

Now take the derivative of both sides.

Multiply both sides by y, and you get the following:

Finally, substitute for y.

You might be thinking, "Why go through the hassle?" After all, you could have done this with the Quotient Rule, and it would have involved less work. But, as you'll see, this technique comes in very handy when the algebra is especially messy. Also, we don't usually substitute back for the y term. Instead, just leave it in the derivative (unless it needs to be defined only in terms of x).
Example 2: Find the derivative of y, where y2 = (x + 4)3(x − 2)5.
Take the log of both sides.

ln y2 = ln[(x + 4)3(x − 2)5]

Next, use those log rules to get

2ln y = 3ln(x + 4) + 5ln(x − 2)

Take the derivative of both sides.

Finally, multiply both sides by .

That's it. Now, wasn't that easier? Substitute back for y only if you have to.
Example 3: Find the derivative of y = .
Holy cripes! What a problem! Watch how using logs will save you. Take the log of both sides.

ln y = ln

Now you can simplify using log rules.

ln y = [ln(x + 3) − ln(x − 5)] + [ln(2x + 7) − ln(5x − 1)]
Take the derivative.


And then multiply by y.

Example 4: Find the derivative of y = .
Take the log of both sides.

ln y = ln

Simplify using the log rules.

ln y = [ln(x + 3) − ln(5 − x)]

Take the derivative.

Multiply by y.

And you're done.
That's all there is to logarithmic differentiation. It's a really helpful tool for simplifying complicated derivatives. There's generally one question on the AP exam that uses logarithmic differentiation, and it's usually not that complicated.
Try these solved problems on your own. Cover the answers first, and then check your work.
PROBLEM 1. Use logarithmic differentiation to find  if y = .
Answer: Take the log of both sides.

ln y = ln

Next, use the log rules to simplify the expression.

ln y = ln x2 + ln − ln(x2 + 1)2
ln y = 2ln x + ln(1 − x3) − 2ln(x2 + 1)

Taking the derivative of both sides, you should get

Then, get the derivative by itself by multiplying both sides by y.

PROBLEM 2. Use logarithmic differentiation to find  if y = .
Answer: The four-step process should be second nature by now. Take the log of both sides.

ln y = ln

Simplify the expression using log rules.

ln y = ln(x2 − 5x) + ln(cos2 x) − ln(x3 + 1)5
ln y = ln(x2 − 5x) + 2ln(cos x) − 5ln(x3 + 1)

Take the derivative of both sides.

Multiply by y.

Integral Calculus Essentials









Chapter 13
The Integral
Welcome to the other half of calculus! This, unfortunately, is the more difficult half, but don't worry. We'll get you through it. In differential calculus, you learned all of the fun things that you can do with the derivative. Now you'll learn to do the reverse: how to take an integral. As you might imagine, there's a bunch of new fun things that you can do with integrals, too.
It's also time for a new symbol , which stands for integration. An integral actually serves several different purposes, but the first, and most basic, is that of the antiderivative.
THE ANTIDERIVATIVE
An antiderivative is a derivative in reverse. Therefore, we're going to reverse some of the rules we learned with derivatives and apply them to integrals. For example, we know that the derivative of x2 is 2x. If we are given the derivative of a function and have to figure out the original function, we use antidifferentiation. Thus, the antiderivative of 2x is x2. (Actually, the answer is slightly more complicated than that, but we'll get into that in a few moments.)
Now we need to add some info here to make sure that you get this absolutely correct. First, as far as notation goes, it is traditional to write the antiderivative of a function using its uppercase letter, so the antiderivative of f(x) is F(x), the antiderivative of g(x) is G(x), and so on.
The second idea is very important: Each function has more than one antiderivative. In fact, there are an infinite number of antiderivatives of a function. Let's go back to our example to help illustrate this.
Remember that the antiderivative of 2x is x2? Well, consider: If you take the derivative of x2 + 1, you get 2x. The same is true for x2 + 2, x2 − 1, and so on. In fact, if any constant is added to x2, the derivative is still 2x because the derivative of a constant is zero.
Because of this, we write the antiderivative of 2x as x2 + C, where C stands for any constant.
Finally, whenever you take the integral (or antiderivative) of a function of x, you always add the term dx (or dy if it's a function of y, etc.) to the integrand (the thing inside the integral). You'll learn why later.
For now, just remember that you must always use the dx symbol, and teachers love to take points off for forgetting the dx. Don't ask why, but they do!
Here is the Power Rule for antiderivatives.


If f(x) = xn, then  f(x)dx =  + C (except when n = −1).


Example 1: Find  x3 dx.
Using the Power Rule, we get

 x3dx =  + C

Don't forget the constant C, or your teachers will take points off for that, too!

Think of a constant as something that is always there, and you won't forget it.

Example 2: Find  x−3dx.
The Power Rule works with negative exponents, too.

 x−3dx =  + C

Not terribly hard, is it? Now it's time for a few more rules that look remarkably similar to the rules for derivatives that we saw in Chapter 6.


 kf(x)dx = k f(x)dx
[f(x) + g(x)]dx =  f(x)dx +  g(x)dx
 k dx = kx + C


Here are a few more examples to make you an expert.
Example 3:  5 dx = 5x + C
Example 4:  7x3 dx =  + C
Example 5: (3x2 + 2x)dx = x3 + x2 + C
Example 6:  =  + C =  + C
INTEGRALS OF TRIG FUNCTIONS
The integrals of some trigonometric functions follow directly from the derivative formulas in Chapter 8.


∫ sin ax dx = − + C
∫ cos ax dx =  + C
∫ sec ax tan ax dx =  + C
∫ sec2 ax dx =  + C
∫ csc ax cot ax dx = − + C.
∫ csc2 ax dx = − + C


We didn't mention the integrals of tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant, because you need to know some rules about logarithms to figure them out. We'll get to them in a few chapters. Notice also that each of the answers is divided by a constant. This is to account for the Chain Rule. Let's do some examples.
Example 7: Check the integral  sin 5x dx = − + C by differentiating the answer.

(−sin 5x)(5) = sin 5x

Notice how the constant is accounted for in the answer?
Example 8:  sec2 3x dx =  + C
Example 9:  cos πx dx =  + C
Example 10: sec tan dx = 2 sec + C
If you're not sure if you have the correct answer when you take an integral, you can always check by differentiating the answer and seeing if you get what you started with. Try to get in the habit of doing that at the beginning, because it'll help you build confidence in your ability to find integrals properly. You'll see that, although you can differentiate just about any expression that you'll normally encounter, you won't be able to integrate many of the functions you see.
ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION
By using the rules for addition and subtraction, we can integrate most polynomials.
Example 11: Find  (x3 + x2 − x) dx.
We can break this into separate integrals, which gives us

 x3 dx +  x2 dx −  x dx

Now you can integrate each of these individually.

 + C +  + C −  + C

You can combine the constants into one constant (it doesn't matter how many C's we use, because their sum is one collective constant whose derivative is zero).

 + C

Sometimes you'll be given information about the function you're seeking that will enable you to solve for the constant. Often, this is an "initial value," which is the value of the function when the variable is zero. As we've seen, normally there are an infinite number of solutions for an integral, but when we solve for the constant, there's only one.
Example 12: Find the equation of y where  = 3x + 5 and y = 6 when x = 0.
Let's put this in integral form.

y =  (3x + 5) dx

Integrating, we get

y =  + 5x + C

Now we can solve for the constant because we know that y = 6 when x = 0.

6 =  + 5(0) + C

Therefore, C = 6 and the equation is

y =  + 5x + 6

Example 13: Find f(x) if f′(x) = sin x − cos x and f(π) = 3.
Integrate f′(x).

f(x) =  (sin x − cos x) dx = −cos x − sin x + C

Now solve for the constant.

3 = −cos(π) − sin (π) + C
C = 2

Therefore, the equation becomes:

f(x) = −cos x − sin x + 2

Now we've covered the basics of integration. However, integration is a very sophisticated topic and there are many types of integrals that will cause you trouble. We will need several techniques to learn how to evaluate these integrals. The first and most important is called u-substitution, which we will cover in the second half of this chapter.
In the meantime, here are some solved problems. Do each problem, covering the answer first, then check your answer.
PROBLEM 1. Evaluate  x dx.
Answer: Here's the Power Rule again.

 xn dx =  + C

Using the rule,

 xdx =  + C

You can rewrite it as  + C.
PROBLEM 2. Evaluate (5x3 + x2 − 6x + 4) dx.
Answer: We can break this up into several integrals.

(5x3 + x2 − 6x + 4)dx = 5x3dx +  x2dx − 6x dx +  4dx

Each of these can be integrated according to the Power Rule.

 + C +  + C −  + C + 4x + C

This can be rewritten as

 − 3x2 + 4x + C

Notice that we combine the constant terms into one constant term C.
PROBLEM 3. Evaluate (3 − x2)2dx.
Answer: First, expand the integrand.

(9 − 6x2 + x4)dx

Break this up into several integrals.

9dx −  6x2dx +  x4dx

And integrate according to the Power Rule.

9x − 2x3 +  + C

PROBLEM 4. Evaluate (4 sin x − 3 cos x)dx.
Answer: Break this problem into two integrals.

4 sin x dx − 3 cos x dx

Each of these trig integrals can be evaluated according to its rule.

−4cos x − 3sin x + C

PROBLEM 5. Evaluate (2sec2 x − 5csc2 x) dx.
Answer: Break the integral in two.

2 sec2 x dx − 5csc2 x dx

Each of these trig integrals can be evaluated according to its rule.

2tan x + 5cot x + C

15.  dx

u-SUBSTITUTION
When we discussed differentiation, one of the most important techniques we mastered was the Chain Rule. Now, you'll learn the integration corollary of the Chain Rule (called u-substitution), which we use when the integrand is a composite function. All you do is replace the function with u, and then you can integrate the simpler function using the Power Rule (as shown below).


 un du =  + C


Suppose you have to integrate  (x − 4)10dx. You could expand out this function and integrate each term, but that'll take a while. Instead, you can follow these four steps.
Step 1: Let u = x − 4. Then  = 1 (rearrange this to get du = dx).
Step 2: Substitute u = x − 4 and du = dx into the integrand.

 u10du

Step 3: Integrate.

 u10du =  + C

Step 4: Substitute back for u.

 + C

That's u-substitution. The main difficulty you'll have will be picking the appropriate function to set equal to u. The best way to get better is to practice. The object is to pick a function and replace it with u, then take the derivative of u to find du. If we can't replace all of the terms in the integrand, we can't do the substitution.
Let's do some examples.
Example 1:  10x(5x2 − 3)6dx =
Once again, you could expand this out and integrate each term, but that would be difficult. Use u-substitution.
Let u = 5x2 − 3. Then  = 10x and du = 10x dx. Now you can substitute.

 u6du

And integrate.

 u6du =  + C

Substituting back gives you

 + C

Confirm that this is the integral by differentiating  + C.

 =  (10 x) = (5x2 − 3)6(10x)

Example 2:  2x dx =
If u = x2 − 5, then  = 2x and du = 2x dx. Substitute u into the integrand.

 u du

Integrate.

And substitute back.

 + C

Note: From now on, we're not going to rearrange ; we'll go directly to "du =" format. You should be able to do that step on your own.
Example 3: 3sin(3x − 1)dx =
Let u = 3x − 1. Then du = 3dx. Substitute the u in the integral.

sin u du

Figure out the integral.

 sin u du = −cos u + C

And throw the x's back in.

−cos(3x − 1) + C

So far, this is only the simplest kind of u-substitution; naturally, the process can get worse when the substitution isn't as easy. Usually, you'll have to insert a constant term to put the integrand into a workable form.
Example 4: (5x + 7)20dx =
Let u = 5x + 7. Then du = 5 dx. Notice that we can't do the substitution immediately because we need to substitute for dx and we have 5 dx. No problem: Because 5 is a constant, just solve for dx.

 du = dx

Now you can substitute.

(5x + 7)20 dx =  u20() du

Rearrange the integral and solve.

And now it's time to substitute back.



Example 5:  x cos(3x2 + 1)dx =
Let u = 3x2 + 1. Then du = 6x dx. We need to substitute for x dx, so we can rearrange the du term.

 du = x dx

Now substitute.

cos u du

Evaluate the integral.

cos u du = sin u + C

And substitute back.

sin u + C = sin(3x2 + 1) + C

Example 6:  x sec2(x2)dx =
Let u = x2. Then du = 2x dx and  du = x dx.
Substitute.

sec2 u du

Evaluate the integral.

sec2 u du = tan u + C

Now the original function goes back in.

tan(x2) + C

This is a good technique to master, so practice on the following solved problems. Do each problem, covering the answer first, then check your answer.
PROBLEM 1. Evaluate sec2 3x dx.
Answer: Let u = 3x and du = 3dx. Then  du = dx.
Substitute and integrate.

sec2 u du = tan u + C

Then substitute back.

tan3x + C

PROBLEM 2. Evaluate  dx.
Answer: Let u = 5x − 4 and du = 5dx. Then  du = dx.
Substitute and integrate.



Then substitute back.



PROBLEM 3. Evaluate  x(4x2 − 7)10 dx.
Answer: Let u = 4x2 − 7 and du = 8x dx. Then  du = x dx.
Substitute and integrate.

 u10 du =  u11 + C

Then substitute back.

(4x2 − 7)11 + C

PROBLEM 4. Evaluate tan sec2  dx.
Answer: Let u = tan and du =sec2 dx. Then 3du = sec2 dx.
Substituting, we get

3 u du =  u2 + C

Then substitute back.

tan2 + C

Definite Integrals
AREA UNDER A CURVE
It's time to learn one of the most important uses of the integral. We've already discussed how integration can be used to "antidifferentiate" a function; now you'll see that you can also use it to find the area under a curve. First, here's a little background about how to find the area without using integration.
Suppose you have to find the area under the curve y = x2 + 2 from x = 1 to x = 3. The graph of the curve looks like the following:

Don't panic yet. Nothing you've learned in geometry thus far has taught you how to find the area of something like this. You have learned how to find the area of a rectangle, though, and we're going to use rectangles to approximate the area between the curve and the x-axis.
Let's divide the region into two rectangles, one from x = 1 to x = 2 and one from x = 2 to x = 3, where the top of each rectangle comes just under the curve. It looks like the following:

Notice that the width of each rectangle is 1. The height of the left rectangle is found by plugging 1 into the equation y = x2 + 2 (yielding 3); the height of the right rectangle is found by plugging 2 into the same equation (yielding 6). The combined area of the two rectangles is (1)(3) + (1)(6) = 9. So we could say that the area under the curve is approximately 9 square units.
Naturally, this is a pretty rough approximation that significantly underestimates the area. Look at how much of the area we missed by using two rectangles! How do you suppose we could make the approximation better? Divide the region into more, thinner rectangles.
This time, cut up the region into four rectangles, each with a width of . It looks like the following:

Now find the height of each rectangle the same way as before. Notice that the values we use are the left endpoints of each rectangle. The heights of the rectangles are, respectively,

(1)2 + 2 = 3;  + 2 = ; (2)2 = 6 and  + 3 = 

Now multiply each height by the width of  and add up the areas.

This is a much better approximation of the area, but there's still a lot of space that isn't accounted for. We're still underestimating the area. The rectangles need to be thinner. But before we do that, let's do something else.
Notice how each of the rectangles is inscribed in the region. Suppose we used circumscribed rectangles instead—that is, we could determine the height of each rectangle by the higher of the two y-values, not the lower. The following graph shows what the region would look like:

To find the area of the rectangles, we would still use the width of , but the heights would change. The heights of each rectangle are now found by plugging in the right endpoint of each rectangle.

 + 2 = ; (2)2 + 2 = 6;  + 2 = ; and (3)2 + 2 = 11

Once again, multiply each height by the width of  and add up the areas.

The area under the curve using four left endpoint rectangles is , and the area using four right endpoint rectangles is , so why not average the two? This gives us , which is a better approximation of the area.
Now that we've found the area using the rectangles a few times, let's turn the method into a formula. Call the left endpoint of the interval a and the right endpoint of the interval b, and set the number of rectangles we use equal to n. So the width of each rectangle is . The height of the first inscribed rectangle is y0, the height of the second rectangle is y1, the height of the third rectangle is y2, and so on, up to the last rectangle, which is yn − 1. If we use the left endpoint of each rectangle, the area under the curve is


[y0 + y1 + y2 + y3...+ yn − 1]


If we use the right endpoint of each rectangle, then the formula is


[y1 + y2 + y3...+ yn]


Now for the fun part. Remember how we said that we could make the approximation better by making more, thinner rectangles? By letting n approach infinity, we create an infinite number of rectangles that are infinitesimally thin. The formula for "left-endpoint" rectangles becomes


[y0 + y1 + y2 + y3...+ yn − 1]


For "right-endpoint" rectangles, the formula becomes:


[y1 + y2 + y3...+ yn]



Note: Sometimes these are called "inscribed" and "circumscribed" rectangles, but that restricts the use of the formula. It's more exact to evaluate these rectangles using right and left endpoints.

We could also find the area using the midpoint of each interval. Let's once again use the above example, dividing the region into four rectangles. The region would look like the following:

To find the area of the rectangles, we would still use the width of , but the heights would now be found by plugging the midpoint of each interval into the equation.

Once again, multiply each height by the width of  and add up the areas.

 +  +  +  =  = 12.625

The general formula for approximating the area under a curve using midpoints is





(Note: The fractional subscript means to evaluate the function at the number halfway between each integral pair of values of n.)
When you take the limit of this infinite sum, you get the integral. (You knew the integral had to show up sometime, didn't you?) Actually, we write the integral as

 (x2 + 2)dx

It is called a definite integral, and it means that we're finding the area under the curve x2 + 2 from x = 1 to x = 3. (We'll discuss how to evaluate this in a moment.) On the AP exam, you'll only be asked to divide the region into a small number of rectangles, so it won't be very hard. Let's do an example.
Example 1: Approximate the area under the curve y = x3 from x = 2 to x = 3 using four left-endpoint rectangles.
Draw four rectangles that look like the following:

The width of each rectangle is . The heights of the rectangles are

23, , and 

Therefore, the area is

 +  +  +  ≈ 13.953

Example 2: Repeat Example 1 using four right-endpoint rectangles.
Now draw four rectangles that look like the following:

The width of each rectangle is still , but the heights of the rectangles are now

, and (33)

The area is now

 +  +  +  ≈ 18.703

Example 3: Repeat Example 1 using four midpoint rectangles.
Now draw four rectangles that look like the following:

The width of each rectangle is still , but the heights of the rectangles are now

, and 

The area is now

 +  +  +  ≈ 16.211

TABULAR RIEMANN SUMS
Sometimes the AP exam will ask you to find a Riemann sum, or to approximate an integral (same thing, right?), but won't give you a function to work with. Instead, they will give you a table of values for x and f(x). These are quite simple to evaluate. All you do is use the right-hand or left-hand sum formula, plugging in the appropriate values for f(x). One thing you should watch out for is that sometimes the x-values are not evenly spaced, so make sure that you use the correct values for the widths of the rectangles. Let's do an example.
Example 4: Suppose we are given the following table of values for x and f(x).



Use a right-hand Riemann sum with 5 subintervals indicated by the data in the table to approximate  f(x)dx.
Recall that the formula for finding the area under the curve using the right endpoints is: [y1 + y2 + y3 +...+ yn]. Here, the width of each rectangle is 2. We find the height of each rectangle by evaluating f(x) at the appropriate value of x, the right endpoint of each interval on the x-axis. Here, y1 = 13, y2 = 15, y3 = 14, y4 = 9, and y5 = 3. Therefore, we can approximate the integral with:  f(x)dx = (2)(13) + (2)(15) + (2)(14) + (2)(9) + (2)(3) = 108.
Let's do another example but this time the values of x will not be evenly spaced on the x-axis.
Example 5: Given the following table of values for x and f(x):



Use a left-hand Riemann sum with 6 subintervals indicated by the data in the table to approximate  f(x)dx.
Recall that the formula for finding the area under the curve using the left endpoints is: [y0 + y1 + y2 +...+ yn − 1]. This formula assumes that the x-values are evenly spaced but they aren't here, so we will replace the values of  with the appropriate widths of each rectangle. The width of the first rectangle is 2 − 0 = 2; the second width is 5 − 2 = 3; the third is 11 − 5 = 6; the fourth is 19 − 11 = 8; the fifth is 22 − 19 = 3; and the sixth is 23 − 22 = 1. We find the height of each rectangle by evaluating f(x) at the appropriate value of x, the left endpoint of each interval on the x-axis. Here y0 = 4, y1 = 6, y2 = 16, y3 = 18, y4 = 22, and y5 = 29. Therefore, we can approximate the integral with:  f(x)dx = (2)(4) + (3)(6) + (6)(16) + (8)(18) + (3)(22) + (1)(29) = 361.
That's all there is to approximating the area under a curve using rectangles. Now let's learn how to find the area exactly. In order to evaluate this, you'll need to know...
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Before, we said that if you create an infinite number of infinitely thin rectangles, you'll get the area under the curve, which is an integral. For the example above, the integral is

 x3dx

There is a rule for evaluating an integral like this. The rule is called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and it says


 f(x)dx = F(b) − F(a); where F(x) is the antiderivative of f(x).


Using this rule, you can find  x3dx by integrating it, and we get . Now all you do is plug in 3 and 2 and take the difference. We use the following notation to symbolize this

Thus, we have

Because  = 16.25, you can see how close we were with our three earlier approximations.
Example 6: Find  (x2 + 2)dx.
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus yields the following:

 (x2 + 2)dx = 

If we evaluate this, we get the following:

This is the first function for which we found the approximate area by using inscribed rectangles. Our final estimate, where we averaged the inscribed and circumscribed rectangles, was , and as you can see, that was very close (off by ). When we used the midpoints, we were off by .
We're going to do only a few approximations using rectangles, because it's not a big part of the AP exam. On the other hand, definite integrals are a huge part of the rest of this book.
Example 7:  (x2 − x)dx =  =  −  = 
Example 8:  sin x dx = (−cos x) =  − (−cos 0) = 1
Example 9: sec2 x dx = tan x = tan − tan 0 = 1
The Trapezoid Rule
There's another approximation method that's even better than the rectangle method. Essentially, all you do is divide the region into trapezoids instead of rectangles. Let's use the problem that we did at the beginning of the chapter.
We get a picture that looks like the following:

As you should recall from geometry, the formula for the area of a trapezoid is

 (b1 + b2)h

(Note: b1 and b2 are the two bases of the trapezoid.) Notice that each of the shapes is a trapezoid on its side, so the height of each trapezoid is the length of the interval , and the bases are the y-values that correspond to each x-value. We found these earlier in the rectangle example; they are, in order: 3, , 6,  and 11. We can find the area of each trapezoid and add them up.

or 12.75
Recall that the actual value of the area is  or 12.67; the Trapezoid Rule gives a pretty good approximation.
Notice how each trapezoid shares a base with the trapezoid next to it, except for the end ones. This enables us to simplify the formula for using the Trapezoid Rule. Each trapezoid has a height equal to the length of the interval divided by the number of trapezoids we use. If the interval is from x = a to x = b, and the number of trapezoids is n, then the height of each trapezoid is . Then our formula is


[y0 + 2y1 + 2y3...+ 2yn − 2 + 2yn − 1 + yn]


This is all you need to know about the Trapezoid Rule. Just follow the formula, and you won't have any problems. Let's do one more example.
Example 10: Approximate the area under the curve y = x3 from x = 2 to x = 3 using four inscribed trapezoids.
Following the rule, the height of each trapezoid is . Thus, the approximate area is

Compare this answer to the actual value we found earlier—it's pretty close!
PROBLEM 1. Approximate the area under the curve y = 4 − x2 from x = −1 to x = 1 with n = 4 inscribed rectangles.
Answer: Draw four rectangles that look like this.

The width of each rectangle is . The heights of the rectangles are found by evaluating y = 4 − x2 at the appropriate endpoints.

(4 − (−1)2), , and (4 − (1)2)

These can be simplified to 3, , , and 3. Therefore, the area is

PROBLEM 2. Find the area under the curve y = 4 − x2 from x = −1 to x = 1 with n = 4 circumscribed rectangles.
Answer: Draw four rectangles that look like the following:

The width of each rectangle is . The heights of the rectangles are found by evaluating y = 4 − x2 at the appropriate endpoints.

, (4 − (0)2)), (4 − (0)2), and 

These can be simplified to , 4, 4, and . Therefore, the area is

PROBLEM 3. Find the area under the curve y = 4 − x2 from x = −1 to x = 1 using the Trapezoid Rule with n = 4.
Answer: Draw four trapezoids that look like the following:

The width of each trapezoid is . Evaluate the bases of the trapezoid by calculating y = 4 − x2 at the appropriate endpoints. Following the rule, we get that the area is approximately

PROBLEM 4. Find the area under the curve y = 4 − x2 from x = −1 to x = 1 using the Midpoint Formula with n = 4.
Answer: Draw four rectangles that look like the following:

The width of each rectangle is . The heights of the rectangles are found by evaluating y = 4 − x2 at the appropriate points.

Multiply each height by the width of , and add up the areas.

PROBLEM 5. Find the area under the curve y = 4 − x2 from x = −1 to x = 1.
Answer: Now we can use the definite integral by evaluating.

This can be rewritten as:

Follow the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

PROBLEM 6. Given the following table of values for t and f(t):



Use a right-hand Riemann sum with 6 subintervals indicated by the data in the table to approximate  f(t)dt.
Answer: The width of the first rectangle is 2 − 0 = 2; the second width is 4 − 2 = 2; the third is 7 − 4 = 3; the fourth is 11 − 7 = 4; the fifth is 13 − 11 = 2; and the sixth is 14 − 13 = 1. We find the height of each rectangle by evaluating f(t) at the appropriate value of t, the right endpoint of each interval on the t-axis. Here, y1 = 6, y2 = 10, y3 = 15 y4 = 20, y5 = 26, and y6 = 30. Therefore, we can approximate the integral with:

 f(t)dt = (2)(6) + (2)(10) + (3)(15) + (4)(20) + (2)(26) + (1)(30) = 239

THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM FOR INTEGRALS
As you recall, we did the Mean Value Theorem once before, in Chapter 8, but this time we'll apply it to integrals, not derivatives. In fact, some books refer to it as the "Mean Value Theorem for Integrals" or MVTI. The most important aspect of the MVTI is that it enables you to find the average value of a function. In fact, the AP exam will often ask you to find the average value of a function, which is just its way of testing your knowledge of the MVTI.
Here's the theorem.





If f(x) is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], then at some point c in the interval [a, b] the following is true:
 f(x)dx = f(c)(b − a)


This tells you that the area under the curve of f(x) on the interval [a, b] is equal to the value of the function at some value c (between a and b) times the length of the interval. If you look at this graphically, you can see that you're finding the area of a rectangle whose base is the interval and whose height is some value of f(x) that creates a rectangle with the same area as the area under the curve.

The number f(c) gives us the average value of f on [a, b]. Thus, if we rearrange the theorem, we get the formula for finding the average value of f(x) on [a, b].

 
f(c) =  f(x)dx

There's all you need to know about finding average values. Try some examples.
Example 1: Find the average value of f(x) = x2 from x = 2 to x = 4.
Evaluate the integral  x2dx.

Example 2: Find the average value of f(x) = sin x on [0, π].
Evaluate  sin x dx.

The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
As you saw in the last chapter, we've only half-learned the theorem. It has two parts, often referred to as the First and Second Fundamental Theorems of Calculus.

 
The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (which you've already seen)
If f(x) is continuous at every point of [a, b], and F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x) on [a, b], then  f(x)dx = F(b) − F(a).


 
The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
If f(x) is continuous on [a, b], then the derivative of the function F(x) =  f(t)dt is
 f(t)dt = f(x)



These theorems are sometimes taught in reverse order.

We've already made use of the first theorem in evaluating definite integrals. In fact, we use the first Fundamental Theorem every time we evaluate a definite integral, so we're not going to give you any examples of that here. There is one aspect of the first Fundamental Theorem, however, that involves the area between curves (we'll discuss that in Chapter 18).
But for now, you should know the following:

 
If we have a point c in the interval [a, b], then
 f(x)dx +  f(x)dx =  f(x)dx

In other words, we can divide up the region into parts, add them up, and find the area of the region based on the result. We'll get back to this in the chapter on the area between two curves.
The second theorem tells us how to find the derivative of an integral.
Example 3: Find  cos t dt.
The second Fundamental Theorem says that the derivative of this integral is just cos x.
Example 4: Find (1 − t3) dt.
Here, the theorem says that the derivative of this integral is just (1 − x3).
Isn't this easy? Let's add a couple of nuances. First, the constant term in the limits of integration is a "dummy term." Any constant will give the same answer. For example,

 (1 − t3)dt =  (1 − t3)dt =  (1 − t3)dt = 1 − x3

In other words, all we're concerned with is the variable term.
Second, if the upper limit is a function of x, instead of just plain x, we multiply the answer by the derivative of that term. For example,

 (1 − t3) dt = (2x) = (1 − x6)(2x)

Example 5: Find  (t + 4t2)dt = [3x4 + 4(3x4)2](12x3).
Try these solved problems on your own. You know the drill.
PROBLEM 1. Find the average value of f(x) =  on the interval [1, 3].

PROBLEM 3. Find .
Answer: According to the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,

PROBLEM 4. Find .
Answer: According to the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,

Accumulation Functions
Recently, the AP exam has been testing problems that deal with accumulation functions. These are simply functions of the form F(x) =  f(t) dt. These are called accumulation functions because the value of the integral is the area under the curve from the constant to the value x, and as x gets bigger, so does the area (it "accumulates"). In these functions, t is a dummy variable that is used as the variable of integration.
Let's do an example.
Example 1: Suppose we have the function F(x) =  t dt. Let's evaluate this at different values of x. First, let's find F(1). Graphically, we are looking for the area under the curve y = t from t = 0 to t = 1. It looks like the following:

F(1) is just the area of the triangle A = (1)(1) = . If we evaluate the integral, we get F(1) =  t dt =  =  − 0 = . Let's now find F(2). This is the area under the curve y = t from t = 0 to t = 2.
It looks like the following:

F(2) is just the area of the triangle: A = (2)(2) = 2. If we evaluate the integral, we get F(2) =  t dt =  = 2 − 0 = 2.
We can see that, as x increases, the function increases.
This was a fairly simple example. Let's do another one.
Example 2: Suppose we have the function F(x) =  sin t dt. Let's evaluate this as x increases from 0 to π. Obviously F(0) = 0 because there is no area under the curve. So, first, let's find F. Graphically, we are looking for the area under the curve y = sin t from t = 0 to t = . It looks like the following:

If we evaluate the integral, we get
F =  sin t dt = (-cos t) = -cos  + cos 0 = 1 −  ≈ 0.134.
Now let's find F. It looks like the following:

If we evaluate the integral, we get
F sin t dt = (-cos t) = -cos  + cos 0 = 1 −  ≈ 0.293.
Let's make a table of values of the accumulation function for different values of x.



We can see that the area is accumulating under the curve as x increases from 0 to π. Naturally, the values will shrink as we move from π to 2π because the values of sin x are negative. But, with accumulation functions, we are usually concerned only with positive areas.
Let's do one more example.
Example 3: Suppose we have the function F(x) =  t2 dt. Let's evaluate this as x increases from 0 to 4. First, let's find F(1). Graphically, we are looking for the area under the curve y = t2 from t = 0 to t = 1. It looks like the following:

If we evaluate the integral, we get F(1) =  t2 dt = .
As in the previous example.



We can see that the values of F(x) will increase as x increases.

Chapter 15
Exponential and Logarithmic Functions, Part Two
You've learned how to integrate polynomials and some of the trig functions (there are more of them to come), and you have the first technique of integration: u-substitution. Now it's time to learn how to integrate some other functions—namely, exponential and logarithmic functions. Yes, the long-awaited second part of Chapter 11. The first integral is the natural logarithm.





Notice the absolute value in the logarithm. This ensures that you aren't taking the logarithm of a negative number. If you know that the term you're taking the log of is positive (for example, x2 + 1), we can dispense with the absolute value marks. Let's do some examples.
Example 1: Find .
Whenever an integrand contains a fraction, check to see if the integral is a logarithm. Usually, the process involves u-substitution. Let u = x + 3 and du = dx. Then,

Substituting back, the final result is

5ln|x + 3| + C

Example 2: Find .
Let u = x2 + 1 du = 2x dx and substitute into the integrand.

Then substitute back.

ln (x2 + 1) + C

MORE INTEGRALS OF TRIG FUNCTIONS
Remember when we started antiderivatives and we didn't do the integral of tangent, cotangent, secant, or cosecant? Well, their time has come.
Example 3: Find ∫ tan x dx.
First, rewrite this integral as

Now, we let u = cos x and du = -sin x dx and substitute.

Now, integrate and re-substitute.



Thus, ∫ tan x dx = −ln|cos x| + C.


Example 4: Find ∫ cot x dx.
Just as before, rewrite this integral in terms of sine and cosine.

Now we let u = sin x and du = cos x dx and substitute.

Now integrate.

ln |u| + C = ln |sin x| + C



Therefore, ∫ cot x dx = ln|sin x| + C.


This looks a lot like the previous example, doesn't it?
Example 5: Find ∫ sec x dx.
You could rewrite this integral as

However, if you try u-substitution at this point, it won't work. So what should you do? You'll probably never guess, so we'll show you: Multiply the sec x by . This gives you

Now you can do u-substitution. Let u = sec x + tan x du = (sec x tan x + sec2 x) dx.
Then rewrite the integral as

Pretty slick, huh?
The rest goes according to plan as you integrate.

 = ln |u| + C = ln |sec x + tan x| + C



Therefore,  sec x dx = ln |sec x + tan x|+ C.


Example 6: Find  csc x dx.
You guessed it! Multiply csc x by  dx. This gives you

Let u = csc x + cot x and du = (-csc x cot x − csc2 x) dx. And, just as in Example 5, you can rewrite the integral as

And integrate.

 = -ln |u| + C = -ln |csc x + cot x| + C



Therefore,  csc x dx = -ln |csc x + cot x| + C.


As we do more integrals, the natural log will turn up over and over. It's important that you get good at recognizing when integrating requires the use of the natural log.
Integrating ex and ax
Now let's learn how to find the integral of ex. Remember that  ex = ex? Well, you should be able to predict the following formula:



∫eu du = eu + C



As with the natural logarithm, most of these integrals use u-substitution.
Example 7: Find ∫e7x dx.
Let u = 7x, du = 7dx, and  du = dx. Then you have

Substituting back, you get

 e7x + C

In fact, whenever you see ∫ekx dx, where k is a constant, the integral is



∫ ekx dx =  ekx + C



Example 8: Find  dx.
Let u = 3x2 + 1, du = 6x dx, and  du = x dx. The result is

Now it's time to put the x's back in.

Example 9: Find  esin x cos x dx.
Let u = sin x and du = cos x dx. The substitution here couldn't be simpler.

 eu dx = eu + C = esin x + C

As you can see, these integrals are pretty straightforward. The key is to use u-substitution to transform nasty-looking integrals into simple ones.
There's another type of exponential function whose integral you'll have to find occasionally.

 au du

As you should recall from your rules of logarithms and exponents, the term au can be written as eu ln a. Because ln a is a constant, we can transform  au du into  eu ln adu. If you integrate this, you'll get

Now substituting back au for eu ln a,





Example 10: Find 5x dx.
Follow the rule we just derived.

Because these integrals don't show up too often on the AP exam, this is the last you'll see of them in this book. You should, however, be able to integrate them using the rule, or by converting them into a form of  eu du.
Try these on your own. Do each problem with the answers covered, and then check your answer.
PROBLEM 1. Evaluate .
Answer: Move the constant term outside of the integral, like this.

Now you can integrate.

PROBLEM 2. Evaluate  dx.
Answer: Let u = x3 − 1 and du = 3x2 dx, and substitute.

Now integrate.

ln |u| + C

And substitute back.

ln |x3 − 1| + C

PROBLEM 3. Evaluate  e5x dx.
Answer: Let u = 5x and du = 5dx. Then  du = dx. Substitute in.

Integrate.

 eu + C

And substitute back.

5x + C

PROBLEM 4. Evaluate 23x dx.
Answer: Let u = 3x and du = 3dx. Then  du = dx. Make the substitution.

2u du

Integrate according to the rule. Your result should be

Now get back to the expression as a function of x.

Chapter 16
Integration by Parts
This chapter is about one of the most important and powerful techniques of integral calculus. This always shows up on the AP exam. You'll often find that an integral that otherwise seems to be undoable is simple once you use integration by parts.
THE FORMULA
Remember the Product Rule? It looks like this.

If we write this in differential form (i.e., eliminate the dx), we get d(uv) = u dv + v du. Rearranging, we get the following: u dv = d(uv) − v du. Integrating both sides, we obtain the integration by parts formula.



 u du = uv −  v du



This formula allows you to write one integral in terms of another integral. This will often help you turn a difficult integral into an easy one.
Example 1: Find  x sin x dx.
Upon first glance, we've got a problem. If you try u-substitution, neither term is even close to the derivative of the other. Thus, you can't substitute. What do you do? (Hint: look at the title of the chapter.)
Let u = x and dv = sin x dx. Then du = dx and v = -cos x. If you plug these parts into the formula, you get

 x sin x dx = − x cos x +  cos x dx

Now we've turned the difficult left-side integral into an easy right-side integral.

 x sin x dx = − x cos x + sin x + C

Notice that we let u = x and dv = sin x dx. If we had let u = sin x and dv = x dx, we would have calculated that

du = cos x dx and v = 

The formula would have been

Not only does this not fix our problem, but it also makes it worse. This leads us to a general rule.


If one of the terms is a power of x, let that term be u and the other term be dv. (The main exception to this rule is when the other term is ln x.)


Let's assure ourselves that the formula works. If  x sin x dx = −x cos x + sin x + C, and you differentiate the right-hand side, the result is

-x(-sin x) + (−1)cos x + cos x = x sin x

As you can see, integration by parts is the Product Rule in reverse.
Example 2: Find  x2 sin x dx.
As with Example 1, we let u = x2 and dv = sin x dx. Therefore,

du = 2x dx and v = -cos x

Now plug these into the formula.

 x2 sin x dx = x2 cos x + 2  x cos x dx

Guess what you have to do now. You have to integrate by parts a second time!
Let u = x and dv = cos x dx, so du = dx and v = sin x. Now you have

 x2 sin x dx = − x2 cos x + 2x sin x − 2  sin x dx



Often, you'll have to do integration by parts twice. Good news: The AP exam never asks you to do it three times.

The final integral becomes

x2 sin x dx = −x2 cos x + 2x sin x + 2cos x + C

Example 3: Find ln x dx.
Let u = ln x and dv = dx. (Yes, we're allowed to do this!) Then du =  dx and v = x.
Plugging into the formula, you get

ln x dx = x ln x −  dx

Now the right side becomes

ln x dx = x ln x − x + C

You should add this integral to the others you've memorized or are comfortable with deriving.



ln x dx = x ln x − x + C



There's one last type of integration by parts technique you need to know for the AP exam. It requires you to perform two rounds of integration by parts (followed by some simple algebra), and it helps you solve for an unknown integral.
Example 4: Find  excos x dx.
First, we let u = ex and dv = cos x dx. Then, du = ex dx and v = sin x. When you plug this information into the formula, you get

 ex cos x dx = ex sin x − ex sin x dx

Now do integration by parts again. This time we let u = ex and dv = sin x dx, so that du = ex dx and v = -cos x. Now the formula looks like the following:

 ex cos x dx = ex sin x −(−ex cos x +  ex cos x dx) = ex sin x + ex cos x − ex cos x dx

It looks as if you're back to square one, but notice that the unknown integral is on both the left- and right-hand sides of the equation. If you now add  ex cos x dx to both sides (isn't algebra wonderful?), you get

2 ex cos x dx = ex sin x + ex cos x

Now all you do is divide both sides by 2 and throw in the constant.

This is why integration by parts is so powerful. You can evaluate a difficult integral by repeatedly rewriting it in terms of integrals you do know.
The AP exam always has integration by parts problems, and they're generally just like these. In fact, if you can do all of the examples and problems in this chapter, you should be able to do any integration by parts problem that will appear on the test.
PROBLEM 1. Evaluate  x ln x dx.
Answer: If you let u = ln x and dv = x dx, then du =  dx and v = . Notice that this is an exception to our rule about setting the x-term equal to u.
Now you have

Now you can evaluate the right-hand integral.

PROBLEM 2. Evaluate  x2ex dx.
Answer: Let u = x2 and dv = ex dx. Then du = 2x dx and v =ex. The formula becomes

 x2e x dx = x2e x − 2  xex dx

We need to use integration by parts a second time to evaluate the right-hand integral. Let u = x and dv = ex dx, so du = dx and v = ex. Now it looks like the following:

Now evaluate the right-hand integral.

 x2ex dx = x2ex − 2xex + 2ex + C

PROBLEM 3. Evaluate  sin xe−x dx.
Answer: Let u = sin x and dv = e−x dx. Then du = cos x dx and v = −e−x. Now the integral looks like the following:

sin xe−x dx = −sin xe−x +  cos xe−x dx

It's time for another round of integration by parts to evaluate the right-hand integral. Let u = cos x and dv = e−x dx. Then du = − sinx dx and v = −e−x. This gives you

 sin xe−x dx = − sin xe−x − cos xe−x dx

Now add  sin xe−x to both sides.

2 sin xe−x dx = − sin xe−x − cos xe−x + C

Therefore,

Chapter 17
Trig Functions
INVERSE TRIG FUNCTIONS
In this unit, you'll learn a broader set of integration techniques. So far, you know how to do only a few types of integrals: polynomials, some trig functions, and logs. Now we'll turn our attention to a set of integrals that result in inverse trigonometric functions. But first, we need to go over the derivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions. (You might want to refer back to Chapter 12 on derivatives of inverse functions.)
Suppose you have the equation sin y = x. If you differentiate both sides with respect to x, you get

Now divide both sides by cos y.

Because sin2 y + cos2 y = 1, we can replace cos y with .

Finally, because x = sin y, replace sin y with x. The derivative equals

Now go back to the original equation sin y = x and solve for y in terms of x: y = sin−1 x.
If you differentiate both sides with respect to x, you get

Replace , and you get the final result.

This is the derivative of inverse sine. By similar means, you can find the derivatives of all six inverse trig functions. They're not difficult to derive, and they're also not difficult to memorize. The choice is yours. We use u instead of x to account for the Chain Rule.





Notice the domain restrictions for inverse sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant.
Example 1:  = sin-1 x2 = 
Example 2:  = tan-1 5x = 
Example 3:

Finding the derivatives of inverse trig functions is just a matter of following the formulas. They're very rarely tested on the AP exam in this form and are not terribly important. In addition, the AP exam almost always tests only inverse sine and tangent, and then usually only as integrals, not as derivatives.
Therefore, it's time to learn the integrals. The derivative formulas lead directly to the integral formulas, but because the only difference between the derivatives of inverse sine, tangent, and secant and those of inverse cosine, cotangent, and cosecant is the negative sign, only the former functions are generally used.





The first two always show up on the AP exam, so you should learn to recognize the pattern. Most of the time, the integration requires some sticky algebra to get the integral into the proper form.
Example 4: 
Don't forget about u-substitution. Let u = x2 and du = 2x dx. Thus,  du = x dx. Substituting and integrating, we get

Now substitute back.

sin−1 (x2) + C

Example 5: 
Anytime you see an integral where you have the square root of a constant minus a function, try to turn it into an inverse sine. You can do that here with a little simple algebra.

Now use u-substitution: let u =  and du =  dx, so 2du = dx, and substitute.

When you substitute back, you get

sin−1 + C

Example 6: 
Again, use u-substitution. Let u = ex and du = ex dx, and substitute.

Then substitute back.

tan−1ex + C

Let's do one last type that's slightly more difficult. For this one, you need to remember how to complete the square.
Example 7: 
Complete the square in the denominator (your algebra teacher warned you about this).

x2 + 4x + 5 = (x + 2)2 + 1

Now rewrite the integral.

Using u-substitution, let u = x + 2 and du = dx. Then do the substitution.

When you put the function of x back in to the integral, it reads:

tan−1(x + 2) + C

Evaluating these integrals involves looking for a particular pattern. If it's there, all you have to do is use algebra and u-substitution to make the integrand conform to the pattern. Once that's accomplished, the rest is easy. These integrals will show up again when we do partial fractions. Otherwise, as far as the AP exam is concerned, this is all you need to know.
Try these solved problems, and don't forget to look for those patterns. Get out your index card, and cover the answers while you work.
PROBLEM 1. Find the derivative of y = sin−1.
Answer: The rule is

The algebra looks like the following:

PROBLEM 2. Evaluate .
Answer: First, you need to do a little algebra. Factor 4 out of the denominator.

Next, rewrite the integrand.

Now you can use u-substitution. Let u =  and du =  dx, so 2du = dx.

Now integrate it.

tan−1 u + C

And re-substitute.

tan−1 + C

PROBLEM 3. Evaluate .
Answer: This time, you need to use some algebra by completing the square of the polynomial under the square root sign.

Now rewrite the integrand.

And use u-substitution. Let u = x − 2 and du = dx.

Now, this looks familiar. Once you integrate, you get

sin−1 u + C

After you substitute back it becomes

sin−1(x − 2) + C

ADVANCED INTEGRALS OF TRIG FUNCTIONS
In Chapter 13, you learned how to find the integrals of some of the trigonometric functions. Now it's time to figure out how to find the integrals of some of the more complicated trig expressions. First, recall some of the basic trigonometric integrals.





Some of these were derived by reversing differentiation, others by u-substitution.
Example 1: Evaluate sin2 x dx.
You can start by replacing sin2 x with . This comes from taking the Double Angle formula cos 2x = 1 − 2 sin2 x and solving for sin2 x. After you make that replacement, the integral looks like the following:

Remember the following substitution:

You could also use the following substitution:

(Note: This comes from taking the Double Angle formula cos 2x = 2cos2 x − 1 and solving for cos2 x.) You can also use the substitution to find cos2 x dx.
Now let's do some variations.
Example 2: Evaluate sin2 x cos x dx.
Here use some simple u-substitution. Let u = sin x and du = cos x dx and substitute.

When you substitute back, you get

In fact, you can do any integral of the form  sin2 x cos x dx using u-substitution, and the result will be





Similarly,

How about higher powers of sine and cosine?
Example 3: Evaluate sin3 x dx.
First, break the integrand into the following:

(sin x)(sin2 x) dx

Next, using trig substitution, you get

(sin x)(sin2 x) dx = (sin x)(1 − cos2 x) dx

You can turn the following into two integrals:

sin x dx − (sin x cos2 x) dx

You can do both of these integrals.

Example 4: Evaluate sin3 x cos2 x dx.
Here, break the integrand into

(sin x)(sin2 x) (cos2 x) dx

Next, using trig substitution, you get

(sin x)(sin2 x) (cos2 x) dx =  (sin x)(1 − cos2 x)(cos2 x) dx

Now you can use u-substitution. Let u = cos x, du = -sin x dx, and substitute.

Now substitute back, and you're done.

As you can see, these integrals all require you to know trig substitutions and u-substitution. The AP exam doesn't ask too many variations on these integrals, but let's do just a few other types, just in case.
Example 5: Evaluate tan2 x dx.
First, use the trigonometric substitution tan2 x = sec2 x − 1.

tan2 x dx = (sec2 x − 1) dx

Now break this into two integrals that are easy to evaluate.

sec2 x dx −  dx

And integrate.

tan x − x + C

Example 6: Evaluate tan3 x dx.
Recognize what to do here? Right! Break up the integrand!

(tan x)(tan2 x) dx

Next, use the trig substitution tan2 x = sec2 x − 1 in the expression.

(tan x) (sec2 x − 1) dx

Break this into two integrals.

tan x sec2 x dx −  tan x dx

Tackle the first integral using u-substitution. Let u = tan x and du = sec2 x dx.

Substituting back gives you

We've done the second integral before.

Thus, the integral is

Example 7: Evaluate  sec3 x dx.
Now it's time for integration by parts. Let u = sec x and dv = sec2 x dx. Therefore, du = sec x tan x dx and v = tan x. Plug these into the formula, and you get

sec3 x dx = sec x tan x −  tan2 x sec x dx

Next, substitute tan2 x = sec2 x − 1.

tan2 x sec x dx(sec2 x − 1) (sec x) dx = sec3 x dx −  sec x dx

So, the integral has become

 sec3 x dx = sec x tan x −  sec3 x dx +  sec x dx

Now, add  sec3 x dx to both sides.

2sec3 x dx = sec x tan x +  sec x dx

Finally, recall that the integral on the right is

 sec x dx = ln |sec x + tan x| + C

The combined integral is

2  sec3 x dx = sec x tan x + ln |sec x + tan x| + C

When you divide by 2, you get your final answer.

Whew! This is about as difficult as the AP exam ever gets. Believe it or not, trigonometric integrals can get even more complicated, involving higher powers or more difficult combinations of trig functions. Thankfully, the AP exam tends to limit itself to the simpler ones.

If you can integrate any power of a trig function up to 4, as well as some of the basic combinations, you'll be able to handle any trigonometric integral that appears on the AP exam.

Walk yourself through the step-by-step process by trying some solved problems below. Cover each answer first, then check your answer.
PROBLEM 1.  cos2 x dx
Answer: Use the substitution . Now the integral looks like the following:

Divide this into two integrals.

When you evaluate each one separately, you get

PROBLEM 2.  cos3 x dx
Answer: Here, split cos3 x into cos x cos2 x, and replace the second term with (1 − sin2 x).

 cos x (1 − sin2 x) dx

This can be rewritten as

cos x dx −  sin2 x cos x dx

The left-hand integral is sin x. Do the right-hand integral using u-substitution. Let u = sin x and du = cos x dx. You get

When you substitute back, the second integral becomes

Thus, the complete answer is

PROBLEM 3.  tan2 x sec2 x dx
Answer: This won't take long. Use u-substitution, by letting u = tan x and du = sec2 x dx.

The final result when you substitute back is

Chapter 18
The Area Between Two Curves
These next two units discuss some of the most difficult topics you'll encounter in AP calculus. For some reason, students have terrible trouble setting up these problems. Fortunately, the AP exam asks only relatively simple versions of these problems on the exam.
Unfortunately, this unit and the next are always on the AP exam. We'll try to make them as simple as possible. You've already learned that if you want to find the area under a curve, you can integrate the function of the curve by using the endpoints as limits. So far, though, we've talked only about the area between a curve and the x-axis. What if you have to find the area between two curves?
VERTICAL SLICES
Suppose you wanted to find the area between the curve y = x and the curve y = x2 from x = 2 to x = 4. First, sketch the curves.

You can find the area by slicing up the region vertically, into a bunch of infinitely thin strips, and adding up the areas of all the strips. The height of each strip is x2 − x, and the width of each strip is dx. Add up all the strips by using the integral.

Then, evaluate it.

That wasn't so hard, was it? Don't worry. The process gets more complicated, but the idea remains the same. Now let's generalize this and come up with a rule.


If a region is bounded by f(x) above and g(x) below at all points of the interval [a, b], then the area of the region is given by



Example 1: Find the area of the region between the parabola y = 1 − x2 and the line y = 1 − x.
First, make a sketch of the region.

To find the points of intersection of the graphs, set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x.


1 − x2 = 1 − x
x2 − x = 0
x(x − 1) = 0
x = 0, 1


The left-hand edge of the region is x = 0 and the right-hand edge is x = 1, so the limits of integration are from 0 to 1.
Next, note that the top curve is always y = 1 − x2, and the bottom curve is always y = 1 − x. (If the region has a place where the top and bottom curve switch, you need to make two integrals, one for each region. Fortunately, that's not the case here.) Thus, we need to evaluate the following:

Sometimes you're given the endpoints of the region; sometimes you have to find them on your own.
Example 2: Find the area of the region between the curve y = sin x and the curve y = cos x from 0 to .
First, sketch the region.

Notice that cos x is on top between 0 and , then sin x is on top between  and . The point where they cross is , so you have to divide the area into two integrals: one from 0 to , and the other from  to . In the first region, cos x is above sin x, so the integral to evaluate is

The integral of the second region is a little different, because sin x is above cos x.

If you add the two integrals, you'll get the area of the whole region.

Adding these, we get that the area is 2 − 2
HORIZONTAL SLICES
Now for the fun part. We can slice a region vertically when one function is at the top of our section and a different function is at the bottom. But what if the same function is both the top and the bottom of the slice (what we call a double-valued function)? You have to slice the region horizontally.

If we were to slice vertically, as in the left-hand picture, we'd have a problem. But if we were to slice horizontally, as in the right-hand picture, we don't have a problem. Instead of integrating an equation f(x) with respect to x, we need to integrate an equation f(y) with respect to y. As a result, our area formula changes a little.


If a region is bounded by f(y) on the right and g(y) on the left at all points of the interval [c, d], then the area of the region is given by



Example 3: Find the area of the region between the curve x = y2 and the curve x = y + 6 from y = 0 to y = 3.
First, sketch the region.

When you slice up the area horizontally, the right end of each section is the curve x = y + 6, and the left end of each section is always the curve x = y2. Now set up our integral.

Evaluating this gives us the area.

Example 4: Find the area between the curve y =  and the curve y =  and the x-axis from x = −3 to x = 3.
First, sketch the curves.

From x = −3 to x = 0, if you slice the region vertically, the curve y =  is on top, and the x-axis is on the bottom; from x = 0 to x = 3, the curve y =  is on top and the x-axis is on the bottom. Therefore, you can find the area by evaluating two integrals.

Your results should be

Let's suppose you sliced the region horizontally instead. The curve y =  is always on the left, and the curve y =  is always on the right. If you solve each equation for x in terms of y, you save some time by using only one integral instead of two.
The two equations are x = y2 − 3 and x = 3 − y2. We also have to change the limits of integration from x-limits to y-limits. The two curves intersect at y = , so our limits of integration are from y = 0 to y = . The new integral is

You get the same answer no matter which way you integrate (as long as you do it right!). The challenge of area problems is determining which way to integrate and then converting the equation to different terms. Unfortunately, there's no simple rule for how to do this. You have to look at the region and figure out its endpoints, as well as where the curves are with respect to each other.
Once you can do that, then the actual set-up of the integral(s) isn't that hard. Sometimes, evaluating the integrals isn't easy; however, if the integral of an AP question is difficult to evaluate, you'll only be required to set it up, not to evaluate it.
Here are some sample problems. On each, decide the best way to set up the integrals, and then evaluate them. Then check your answer.
PROBLEM 1. Find the area of the region between the curve y = 3 − x2 and the line y = 1 − x from x = 0 to x = 2.
Answer: First, make a sketch.

Because the curve y = 3 − x2 is always above y = 1 − x within the interval, you have to evaluate the following integral:

Therefore, the area of the region is

PROBLEM 2. Find the area between the x-axis and the curve y = 2 - x2 from x = 0 to x = 2.
Answer: First, sketch the graph over the interval.

Because the curve crosses the x-axis at , you have to divide the region into two parts: from x = 0 to x =  and from x =  to x = 2. In the latter region, you'll need to integrate y = −(2 − x2) = x2 − 2 to adjust for the region's being below the x-axis. Therefore, we can find the area by evaluating

Integrating, we get

PROBLEM 3. Find the area of the region between the curve x = y2 − 4y and the line x = y.
Answer: First, sketch the graph over the interval.

You don't have the endpoints this time, so you need to find where the two curves intersect. If you set them equal to each other, they intersect at y = 0 and at y = 5. The curve x = y2 − 4y is always to the left of x = y over the interval we just found, so we can evaluate the following integral:

The result of the integration should be

PROBLEM 4. Find the area between the curve x = y3 − y and the line x = 0 (the y-axis).
Answer: First, sketch the graph over the interval.

Next, find where the two curves intersect. By setting y3 − y = 0, you'll find that they intersect at y = −1, y = 0, and y = 1. Notice that the curve is to the right of the y-axis from y = −1 to y = 0 and to the left of the y-axis from y = 0 to y = 1. Thus, the region must be divided into two parts: from y = −1 to y = 0 and from y = 0 to y = 1.
Set up the two integrals.

And integrate them.

PRACTICE PROBLEM SET 1

Chapter 19
The Volume of a Solid of Revolution
Does the chapter title leave you in a cold sweat? Don't worry. You're not alone. This chapter covers a topic widely seen as one of the most difficult on the AP exam. There is always a volume question on the test. The good news is that you're almost never asked to evaluate the integral—you usually only have to set it up. The difficulty with this chapter, as with Chapter 18, is that there aren't any simple rules to follow. You have to draw the picture and figure it out.
In this chapter, we're going to take the region between two curves, rotate it around a line (usually the x- or y-axis), and find the volume of the region. There are two methods of doing this: the washers method and the cylindrical shells method. Sometimes you'll hear the washers method called the disk method, but a disk is only a washer without a hole in the middle.
WASHERS AND DISKS
Let's look at the region between the curve y =  and the x-axis (the curve y = 0), from x = 0 to x = 1, and revolve it about the x-axis. The picture looks like the following:

If you slice the resulting solid perpendicular to the x-axis, each cross-section of the solid is a circle, or disk (hence the phrase "disk method"). The radii of the disks vary from one value of x to the next, but you can find each radius by plugging it into the equation for y: Each radius is . Therefore, the area of each disk is

π()2 = πx

Each disk is infinitesimally thin, so its thickness is dx; if you add up the volumes of all the disks, you'll get the entire volume. The way to add these up is by using the integral, with the endpoints of the interval as the limits of integration. Therefore, to find the volume, evaluate the integral.

 π x dx =  =

Now let's generalize this. If you have a region whose area is bounded by the curve y = f(x) and the x-axis on the interval [a, b], each disk has a radius of f(x), and the area of each disk will be

π[f(x)]2

To find the volume, evaluate the integral.



π [f(x)]2 dx



This is the formula for finding the volume using disks.
Example 1: Find the volume of the solid that results when the region between the curve y = x and the x-axis, from x = 0 to x = 1, is revolved about the x-axis.
As always, sketch the region to get a better look at the problem.

When you slice vertically, the top curve is y = x and the limits of integration are from x = 0 to x = 1. Using our formula, we evaluate the integral.

 x2 dx

The result is

 x2 dx = π = 

By the way, did you notice that the solid in the problem is a cone with a height and radius of 1? The formula for the volume of a cone is π r2 h so you should expect to get .
Now let's figure out how to find the volume of the solid that results when we revolve a region that does not touch the x-axis. Consider the region bounded above by the curve y = x3 and below by the curve y = x2, from x = 2 to x = 4, which is revolved about the x-axis. Sketch the region first.

If you slice this region vertically, each cross-section looks like a washer (hence the phrase "washer method").

The outer radius is R = x3 and the inner radius is r = x2. To find the area of the region between the two circles, take the area of the outer circle, πR2, and subtract the area of the inner circle, πr2.
We can simplify this to

πR2 − π2 = π(R2 − r2)

Because the outer radius is R = x3 and the inner radius is r = x2, the area of each region is π(x6 − x4). You can sum up these regions using the integral.

 (x6 − x4) dx = 

Here's the general idea: In a region whose area is bounded above by the curve y = f(x) and below by the curve y = g(x), on the interval [a, b], then each washer will have an area of

π[f(x)2 − g(x)2]

To find the volume, evaluate the integral.



π [f(x)2 − g(x)2]dx



This is the formula for finding the volume using washers when the region is rotated around the x-axis.
Example 2: Find the volume of the solid that results when the region bounded by y = x and y = x2, from x = 0 to x = 1, is revolved about the x-axis.
Sketch it first.

The top curve is y = x and the bottom curve is y = x2 throughout the region. Then our formula tells us that we evaluate the integral.

π (x2 − x4)dx

The result is

π (x2 − x4)dx = π

Suppose the region we're interested in is revolved around the y-axis instead of the x-axis. Now, to find the volume, you have to slice the region horizontally instead of vertically. We discussed how to do this in the previous unit on area.
Now, if you have a region whose area is bounded on the right by the curve x = f(y) and on the left by the curve x = g(y), on the interval [c, d], then each washer has an area of

π[f(y)2 − g(y)2]

To find the volume, evaluate the integral.



π [f(y)2 − g(y)2]dy



This is the formula for finding the volume using washers when the region is rotated about the y-axis.
Example 3: Find the volume of the solid that results when the region bounded by the curve x = y2 and the curve x = y3, from y = 0 to y = 1, is revolved about the y-axis.
Sketch away.

Because x = y2 is always on the outside and x = y3 is always on the inside, you have to evaluate the integral.

π (y4 − y6) dy

You should get the following:

π (y4 − y6) dx = π 

There's only one more nuance to cover. Sometimes you'll have to revolve the region about a line instead of one of the axes. If so, this will affect the radii of the washers; you'll have to adjust the integral to reflect the shift. Once you draw a picture, it usually isn't too hard to see the difference.
Example 4: Find the volume of the solid that results when the area bounded by the curve y = x2 and the curve y = 4x is revolved about the line y = −2. Set up but do not evaluate the integral. (This is how the AP exam will say it!)
You're not given the limits of integration here, so you need to find where the two curves intersect by setting the equations equal to each other.

x2 = 4x
x2 − 4x = 0
x = 0, 4

These will be our limits of integration. Next, sketch the curve.

Notice that the distance from the axis of revolution is no longer found by just using each equation. Now, you need to add 2 to each equation to account for the shift in the axis. Thus, the radii are x2 + 2 and 4x + 2. This means that we need to evaluate the integral.

π [(4x + 2)2 − (x2 + 2)2]dx

Suppose instead that the region was revolved about the line x = −2. Sketch the region again.

You'll have to slice the region horizontally this time; this means you're going to solve each equation for x in terms of y: x =  and x = . We also need to find the y-coordinates of the intersection of the two curves: y = 0, 16.
Notice also that, again, each radius is going to be increased by 2 to reflect the shift in the axis of revolution. Thus, we will have to evaluate the integral.

  dy

Finding the volumes isn't that hard, once you've drawn a picture, figured out whether you need to slice vertically or horizontally, and determined whether the axis of revolution has been shifted. Sometimes, though, there will be times when you want to slice vertically yet revolve around the y-axis (or slice horizontally yet revolve about the x-axis). Here's the method for finding volumes in this way.
CYLINDRICAL SHELLS
Let's examine the region bounded above by the curve y = 2 − x2 and below by the curve y = x2, from x = 0 to x = 1. Suppose you had to revolve the region about the y-axis instead of the x-axis.

If you slice the region vertically and revolve the slice, you won't get a washer; you'll get a cylinder instead. Because each slice is an infinitesimally thin rectangle, the cylinder's "thickness" is also very, very thin, but real nonetheless. Thus, if you find the surface area of each cylinder and add them up, you'll get the volume of the region.

Why work in the dark? Just as you spend time practicing formulas in order to memorize them, make sure you actually work on drawing these examples. If you can't visualize the problem, you won't be able to set up the integral.

The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is 2πrh. The height of the cylinder is the length of the vertical slice, (2 − x2) − x2 = 2 − 2x2, and the radius of the slice is x. Thus, evaluate the integral:

2π x(2 − 2x2)dx

The math goes like the following:

2π x(2 − 2x2)dx = 2π (2x − 2x3)dx = 2π 

Suppose you tried to slice the region horizontally and use washers. You'd have to convert each equation and find the new limits of integration. Because the region is not bounded by the same pair of curves throughout, you would have to evaluate the region using several integrals. The cylindrical shells method was invented precisely so you can avoid this.
From a general standpoint: If we have a region whose area is bounded above by the curve y = f(x) and below by the curve y = g(x), on the interval [a, b], then each cylinder will have a height of f(x) − g(x), a radius of x, and an area of 2πx[f(x) − g(x)].
To find the volume, evaluate the integral.



2π x[(f(x) − g(x)]dx)



This is the formula for finding the volume using cylindrical shells when the region is rotated around the y-axis.
Example 5: Find the volume of the region that results when the region bounded by the curve y = , the x-axis, and the line x = 9 is revolved about the y-axis. Set up but do not evaluate the integral.
Your sketch should look like the following:

Notice that the limits of integration are from x = 0 to x = 9, and that each vertical slice is bounded from above by the curve y =  and from below by the x-axis (y = 0). We need to evaluate the integral.

2π  x( − 0)dx = 2π x ()dx

Example 6: Find the volume that results when the region in Example 5 is revolved about the line x = −1. Set up but do not evaluate the integral.
Sketch the figure.

If you slice the region vertically, the height of the shell doesn't change because of the shift in axis of revolution, but you have to add 1 to each radius.
Our integral thus becomes

2π (x + 1)()dx

The last formula you need to learn involves slicing the region horizontally and revolving it about the x-axis. As you probably guessed, you'll get a cylindrical shell.
If you have a region whose area is bounded on the right by the curve x = f(y) and on the left by the curve x = g(y), on the interval [c, d], then each cylinder will have a height of f(y) − g(y), a radius of y, and an area of 2πy[f(y) − g(y)].
To find the volume, evaluate the integral.



2π y[(f(y − g(y)]dy



This is the formula for finding the volume using cylindrical shells when the region is rotated around the x-axis.
Example 7: Find the volume of the region that results when the region bounded by the curve x = y3 and the line x = y, from y = 0 to y = 1, is rotated about the x-axis. Set up but do not evaluate the integral.
Let your sketch be your guide.

Each horizontal slice is bounded on the right by the curve x = y and on the left by the line x = y3. The integral to evaluate is

2π y(y − y3)dy

Suppose that you had to revolve this region about the line y = −1 instead. Now the region looks like the following:

The radius of each cylinder is increased by 1 because of the shift in the axis of revolution, so the integral looks like the following:

2π (y + 1)(y − y3)dy

Wasn't this fun? Volumes of this sort require you to sketch the region carefully and to decide whether it'll be easier to slice the region vertically or horizontally. Once you figure out the slices' boundaries and the limits of integration (and you've adjusted for an axis of revolution, if necessary), it's just a matter of plugging into the integral. Usually, you won't be asked to evaluate the integral unless it's a simple one. Once you've conquered this topic, you're ready for anything.
VOLUMES OF SOLIDS WITH KNOWN CROSS-SECTIONS
There is one other type of volume that you need to be able to find. Sometimes, you will be given an object where you know the shape of the base and where perpendicular cross-sections are all the same regular, planar geometric shape. These sound hard, but are actually quite straightforward. This is easiest to explain through an example.
Example 8: Suppose we are asked to find the volume of a solid whose base is the circle x2 + y2 = 4, and where cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis are all squares whose sides lie on the base of the circle. How would we find the volume?
First, make a drawing of the circle.

What this problem is telling us is that every time we make a vertical slice, the slice is the length of the base of a square. If we want to find the volume of the solid, all we have to do is integrate the area of the square, from one endpoint of the circle to the other.
The side of the square is the vertical slice whose length is 2y, which we can find by solving the equation of the circle for y and multiplying by 2. We get y = . Then the length of a side of the square is 2. Because the area of a square is side2, we can find the volume by: (16 − 4x2)dx
Let's perform the integration, although on some problems you will be permitted to find the answer with a calculator.

 (16 − 4x2)dx =  =  −  = 64 − 

As you can see, the technique is very simple. First. you find the side of the cross-section in terms of y. This will involve a vertical slice. Then. you plug the side into the equation for the area of the cross-section. Then, integrate the area from one endpoint of the base to the other. On the AP exam, cross-sections will be squares, equilateral triangles, circles, or semi-circles, or maybe isosceles right triangles. So here are some handy formulas to know.

Given the side of an equilateral triangle, the area is A = (side)2 .
Given the diameter of a semi-circle, the area is A = (diameter)2.
Given the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle, the area is A = .

Example 9: Use the same base as Example 8, except this time the cross-sections are equilateral triangles. We find the side of the triangle just as we did above. It is 2y, which is 2. Now because the area of an equilateral triangle is (side)2 , we can find the volume by evaluating the integral (4)(4 − x2)dx =  (4 − x2)dx.
We get  (4 − x2)dx = 
Example 10: Use the same base as Example 8, except this time the cross-sections are semi-circles whose diameters lie on the base. We find the side of the semi-circle just as we did above. It is 2y, which is 2. Now because the area of a semi-circle is (diameter)2, we can find the volume by evaluating the integral (4)(4 − x2)dx = (4 − x2dx.
We get (4 − x2)dx = .
Here are some solved problems. Do each problem, covering the answer first, then check your answer.
PROBLEM 1. Find the volume of the solid that results when the region bounded by the curve y = 16 − x2 and the curve y = 16 − 4x is rotated about the x-axis. Use the washer method and set up but do not evaluate the integral.
Answer: First, sketch the region.

Next, find where the curves intersect by setting the two equations equal to each other.

16 − x2 = 16 − 4x
x2 = 4x
x2 − 4x = 0
x = 0, 4

Slicing vertically, the top curve is always y = 16 − x2 and the bottom is always y = 16 − 4x, so the integral looks like the following:

π[(16 − x2)2 − (16 − 4x)2]dx

PROBLEM 2. Repeat Problem 1, but revolve the region about the y-axis and use the cylindrical shells method. Set up but do not evaluate the integral.
Answer: Sketch the situation.

Slicing vertically, the top of each cylinder is y = 16 − x2, the bottom is y = 16 − 4x, and the radius is x. Therefore, you should set up the following:

2π x[(16 − x2) − (16 − 4x)]dx

PROBLEM 3. Repeat Problem 1 but revolve the region about the x-axis and use the cylindrical shells method. Set up but do not evaluate the integral.
Answer: Sketch the situation.

To slice horizontally, you have to solve each equation for x in terms of y and find the limits of integration with respect to y. First, solve for x in terms of y.

y = 16 − x2 becomes x = 
and
y = 16 − 4x becomes x = 

Next, determine the limits of integration: They're from y = 0 to y = 16. Slicing horizontally, the curve x =  is always on the right and the curve x =  is always on the left. The radius is y, so we evaluate

2π −  dy

PROBLEM 4. Repeat Problem 1 but revolve the region about the y-axis and use the washers method. Set up but do not evaluate the integral.
Answer: Sketch.

Slicing horizontally, the curve x =  is always on the right and the curve x =  is always on the left. Your integral should look like the following:

π dy

PROBLEM 5. Repeat Problem 1, but revolve the region about the line y = −3. You may use either method. Set up but do not evaluate the integral.
Answer: Your sketch should resemble the one below (note that it's not drawn exactly to scale).

If you were to slice the region vertically, you would use washers. You'll need to add 3 to each radius to adjust for the axis of revolution. The integral to evaluate is

π[(16 − x2 + 3)2 − (16 − 4x + 3)2]dx

To slice the region horizontally, use cylindrical shells. The radius of each shell would increase by 3, and you would evaluate

2π (y+3) dy

PROBLEM 6. Repeat Problem 1, but revolve the region about the line x = 8. You may use either method. Set up but do not evaluate the integral.
Warning! This one is tricky!
Answer: First, sketch the region.

If you choose cylindrical shells, slice the region vertically; you'll need to adjust for the axis of revolution. Each radius can be found by subtracting x from 8. (Not 8 from x. That was the tricky part, in case you missed it.) The integral to evaluate is:

2π(8 − x)[(16 − x2) − (16 − 4x)]dx

If you choose washers, slice the region horizontally. The radius of each washer is found by subtracting each equation from 8. Notice also that the curve x =  is now the outer radius of the washer, and the curve x =  is the inner radius. The integral looks like the following:

  dy

PROBLEM 7: Find the volume of a solid whose base is the region between the x-axis and the curve y = 4 − x2, and whose cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis are equilateral triangles with a side that lies on the base.
Answer: The curve y = 4 − x2 intersects the x-axis at x = −2 and x = 2. The side of the triangle is 4 − x2, so all that we have to do is evaluate (4 − x2)2 dx.
Expand the integrand to get

(16 − 8x2 + x4)dx

Then integrate, which gives you

 =  ≈ 14.780

10. Find the volume of the solid whose base is the region between y = x2 and y = 4 and whose perpendicular cross-sections are isosceles right triangles with the hypotenuse on the base.

Other Applications of the Integral
LENGTH OF A CURVE
Another way to apply integrals is to find the length of the graph. It's usually a pretty simple problem. All you have to do is use a formula.
Suppose you want to find the length of the graph of a function y = f(x) from x = a to x = b. Call this length L. You could divide L into a set of line segments, Δl, add up the lengths of each of them, and you would find L. The formula for the length of each line segment can be found with the Pythagorean theorem.

If we make Δl, Δx, and Δy infinitesimally small, they become dl, dx, and dy. If we then add up all of these line segments, we get

Here's the rule.


If the function f(x) is continuous and differentiable on [a, b], then the length of the curve y = f(x) from a to b is



Example 1: Find the length of the curve y = x from x = 0 to x = 4.
First, find the first derivative of the function:  =  x.
Next, plug into the formula.

Now, evaluate the integral.

Using u-substitution, let u = 1 + , du =  dx, and  du = dx. Then substitute.

u du =  u

Once you substitute back, the result is  = .
Sometimes you'll be given the curve as a function of y instead of as a function of x. Then the formula for the length of the curve x = f(y) on the interval [c, d] is






As you can see, theformula isn't terriblydifficult, but it can oftenlead to a really uglyintegral. Fortunately, theAP exam will either giveyou a curve where theintegral works out easily,as it did here, or you'll beasked only to set up theintegral, not to evaluate it.

Example 2: Find the length of the curve x = sin y, from y = 0 to y = . Set up but do not evaluate the integral.
Because  = cos y, we can plug it into the formula: L = .
PARAMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Sometimes the curve will be defined parametrically, usually in terms of t (for time). Then the formula for the length of the curve from t = a to t = b is



L



Example 3: Find the length of the curve defined by x = sin t and y = cos t, from t = 0 to t = π.
Take the derivatives of the two t-functions:  = cos t and  = − sin t. Then use the formula.

L 

If you evaluate the integral, you get

L 

That's all there is to finding the length of a curve. As you've seen, many applications of the integral involve simple formulas. All you have to do is to plug in and evaluate the integral. If the integral is a difficult one, you probably just have to set it up.
Try these solved problems. Do each problem, covering the answer first, then check your answer.
PROBLEM 1. Find the length of the curve y =  (x2 + 2) from x = 0 to x = 3.
Answer: First, we find the first derivative  =  ·  (x2 + 2)(2x) = x(x2 + 2).
Next, plug into the formula.

L =  dx =  dx

Now, you just have to evaluate the integral.

L =  dx =  dx =  = 12

PROBLEM 2. Find the length of the curve x =  from y = 1 to y = 2.
Answer: Here, you have x in terms of y, so first we find .

 = y3 − 

Next, find .

 =  = y6 −  + 

Plug this into the formula.

L =  dy =  dy =  dy

And evaluate the integral.

L =  dy =  dy =  = 

PROBLEM 3. Find the length of the curve x = tan t and y = sec t from t = 0 to t = . Set up but do not evaluate the integral.
Answer:

L =  dt

To use the above formula, you need to determine that  = sec2 t and  sec t tan t. Plug these into the formula.

L =  dt

8. x = 3t2 and y = 2t from t = 1 to t = 2 (Set up but do not evaluate the integral.)


THE METHOD OF PARTIAL FRACTIONS
This is the last technique you'll learn to evaluate integrals. There are many, many more types of integrals and techniques to learn; in fact, there are courses in college primarily concerned with integrals and their uses! Fortunately for you, they're not on the AP exam (and therefore, not in this book). The BC exam usually has a partial fractions integral or two, and the concept isn't terribly hard.
We use the method of partial fractions to evaluate certain types of integrals that contain rational expressions. First, let's discuss the type of algebra you'll be doing.
If you wanted to add the expressions  and , you would do the following:

 +  =  = 

Now, suppose you had to do this in reverse; you were given the fraction on the right, and you wanted to determine what two fractions were added to give you that fraction. Another way of asking this is: What constants A and B exist, such that  +  = 
How do you go about solving for A and B? First, multiply through by (x − 1)(x + 2) to clear the denominator.

A(x + 2) + B(x − 1) = 8x + 1

Next, simplify the left side.

Ax + 2A + Bx − B = 8x + 1

Now, if you group the terms on the left, you get

(A + B)x + (2A − B) = 8x + 1

Therefore, A + B = 8 and 2A − B = 1.
If you solve this pair of simultaneous equations, you get A = 3 and B = 5. Surprised? We hope not.
Why would you need to know this method? Suppose you wanted to find

 dx

You now know you can rewrite this integral as

 dx +   dx

These integrals are easily evaluated.

 dx +  dx = 3ln|x − 1| + 5ln|x − 2| + C

Example 1: Evaluate  dx.
You need to find A and B such that

 +  = 

First, multiply through by (3x + 5)(x + 4).

A(x + 4) + B(3x + 5) = x + 18

Next, simplify and group the terms.

Ax + 4A + 3Bx + 5B = x + 18


(A + 3B)x + (4A + 5B) = x + 18

You now have two simultaneous equations: A + 3B = 1 and 4A + 5B = 18. If we solve the equations, we get A = 7 and B = −2. Thus, you can rewrite the integral as

 dx −  dx

These are both logarithmic integrals. The solution is

ln |3x + 5| − 2 ln |x + 4| + C

There are three main types of partial fractions that appear on the AP exam. You've just seen the first type: one with two linear factors in the denominator. The second type has a repeated linear term in the denominator.
Example 2: Evaluate  dx.
Now you need to find two constants A and B, such that

 +  = 

Multiplying through by (x − 1)2, we get A(x − 1) + B = 2x + 4. Now simplify.

Ax − A + B = 2x + 4


Ax + (B − A) = 2x + 4

Thus, A = 2 and B − A = 4, so B = 6. Now we can rewrite the integral as

The solution is

2ln|x − 1|−  + C

The third type has an irreducible quadratic factor in the denominator.
Example 3: Evaluate  dx.
For a quadratic factor, you need to find A, B, and C such that

Now you have a term Ax + B over the quadratic term. Whenever you have a quadratic factor, you need to use a linear numerator, not a constant numerator.
Multiply through by (x2 + 1)(x + 2) and you get

(Ax + B)(x + 2) + C(x2 + 1) = 3x + 5

Simplify and group the terms.

Ax2 + 2Ax + Bx + 2B + Cx2 + C = 3x + 5


(A + C)x2 + (2A + B)x + (2B + C) = 3x + 5

This gives you three equations.

A + C = 0


2A + B = 3


2B + C = 5

If you solve these three equations, the values are

A = , B = , and C = −

Now you can rewrite the integral.

Break the first integral into two integrals.

You can evaluate the first integral using u-substitution; the second integral is an inverse tangent, and the third integral is a natural logarithm.

ln|x2 + 1| +  tan−1(x) −ln|x +2| + C

Now try these solved problems. Do each problem, covering the answer first, then check your answer.
PROBLEM 1. Evaluate  dx.
Answer: First, factor the denominator.

 dx

Find A and B such that

First, multiply through by (x − 5)(x − 1).

A(x − 1) + B(x − 5) = 4

Next, simplify and group the terms.

Ax − A + Bx − 5B = 4


(A + B)x + (-A − 5B) = 4

You now have two simultaneous equations: A + B = 0 and -A − 5B = 4. If you solve the equations, you get A = 1 and B = −1. Thus, we can rewrite the integral as

These are both logarithmic integrals. The solution is: ln|x − 5| − ln|x − 1| + C.

Notice how all of theseintegrals contained anatural logarithm term?That's typical of a partialfractions integral.

PROBLEM 2. Evaluate .
Answer: You need to find A, B, and C, such that

Multiply through by x(x2 + 1).

A(x2 + 1) + (Bx + C)(x) = x + 1

Simplify and group the terms.

Ax2 + A + Bx2 + Cx = x + 1


(A + B)x2 + Cx + A = x + 1

Now you have three equations.
A + B = 0

C = 1


A = 1

You have to solve only for B: Because A = 1, B = −1. Now rewrite the integral as

Break this into

The first integral is a natural logarithm, the second integral requires u-substitution, and the third integral is an inverse tangent. The answer is

ln|x| - ln(x2 + 1) + tan−1 (x) C

IMPROPER INTEGRALS
There's one last type of integral that shows up on the BC exam. These are improper integrals, which are integrals evaluated over an open interval, rather than a closed one.


More formally, an integral is improper if: (a) its integrand becomes infinite at one or more points in the interval of integration; or (b) one or both of the limits of integration is infinite.


We integrate an improper integral by evaluating the integral for a constant (a) and then taking the limit of the resulting integral as a approaches the limit in question. If the limit exists, the integral converges and the value of the integral is the limit. If the limit doesn't exist, the integral diverges and the integral cannot be evaluated there.
Confusing, huh? Let's clear the air with an example.
Example 1: Evaluate .
At x = 4, the denominator is zero and the integrand is undefined. Therefore, replace the 4 in the limit of the integral with a and evaluate.

Multiply the numerator and the denominator of the integrand by .

Evaluate the first integral by factoring 16 out of the denominator.

Next, use u-substitution. Let u =  and du =  dx

 = 4sin−1 u = 4sin−1 

Evaluate the second integral with u-substitution. Let u = 16 − x2 and du = −2x dx.

− u− = −u− = −

The final result is

Now you have to evaluate the integral at the limits of integration.

Finally, take the limit as a approaches 4.

This may look complicated, but it was actually a very straightforward process. Because the integrand didn't exist at x = 4, replace 4 with a and then integrate. When you evaluated the limits of integration using a instead of 4, you then took the limit as a approaches 4.
Example 2: Evaluate .
Replace the upper limit of integration with a and take the limit as a approaches infinity.

Integrate.

Now, take the limit.

 tan−1 a = 

Let's do an integral that becomes undefined in the middle of the limits of integration.
Example 3: Evaluate .
Note that this integral becomes undefined at x = 1. Because of this, you have to divide the integral into two parts: one for x < 1 and one for x > 1.

 and 

If either of these limits fails to exist, then the integral from 0 to 2 diverges. Evaluate them both.


 =  +  = −  +  = 0

Because both limits exist and are finite, the integral converges and the value is 0.
There are several other facets of evaluating improper integrals that we won't explore here because they don't appear on the AP exam. You'll have to do only the most simple of these, usually one with infinity as a limit of integration.
Evaluate these integrals, and check your work.
PROBLEM 1. Evaluate .
Answer: First, evaluate the integral.

Next, we evaluate the limit:  ln a = ∞.
Therefore,  = ∞, and the integral diverges.
PROBLEM 2. Evaluate .
Answer: Evaluate the integral.

Next, evaluate the limit.

Therefore,  = 1, and the integral converges.
PROBLEM 3. Evaluate .
Answer: Evaluate the integral.

Next, evaluate.

Therefore,  = , and the integral converges.

CALCULUS OF POLAR CURVES
The topic of polar curves usually shows up as only one multiple-choice problem on the BC exam. However, we will cover the two most typical aspects of the calculus of polar curves. We expect that you had a full treatment of polar coordinates and curves in precalculus, so we won't cover them here.
Slope
The slope of a polar curve r = f(θ) is . Because x and y are defined parametrically, we need to derive  in terms of r and θ. Remember that in polar coordinates, x = rcos θ = f(θ)cos θ and y = rsin θ = f(θ)sin θ.
Note that .
We substitute for x and y in the following: .
Using the Product Rule, we get .
This is the formula for finding the slope of a polar curve r = f(θ).
Example 1: Find the slope of the tangent line to the curve r = 2 + 4sin θ.
First, let's find f′(θ): f′(θ) = 4cos θ
This gives us

Area in Polar Coordinates
We are not going to derive the formula for you. If we want to find the area of a region between the origin and the curve r = f(θ), a ≤ θ ≤ b, we use the formula

Area =  r2 dθ

Example 2: Find the area of the region in the plane enclosed by the cardioid r = 4 + 4sin θ.
First, let's graph the curve.

Because r sweeps out the region as θ goes from 0 to 2π, these are our limits of integration.
Plug into the formula for area.

Evaluate the integral.

Use the trig identity sin2θ =  to rewrite the integrand.

Evaluate the integral.

Example 3: Find the area inside the smaller loop of the limaçon: r = 1 + 2cos θ.
First, let's graph the curve.

Because in the inner loop, r sweeps out the region as θ goes from  to , these are our limits of integration.
Plug into the formula for area.

A = (1 + 2cos θ)2 dθ

Evaluate the integral.

A = (1 + 2cos θ)2 dθ = A = (1 + 4cos θ + 4cos2 θ)dθ

Use the trig identity cos2 θ =  to rewrite the integrand.

(1 + 4cos θ + 2 + 2cos θ) dθ = (3 + 4cos θ + 2cos 2θ) dθ

Evaluate the integral.

(3 + 4cos θ + 2cos 2θ) dθ = (3θ + 4sin θ + sin 2θ)| =


Area Between Two Polar Curves
Again, we are not going to derive the formula for you. If we want to find the area of a region between the curves r1 = f1(θ) and r2 = f2(θ), with 0 ≤ r1(θ) ≤ r2(θ) and a ≤ θ ≤ b, we use the formula: Area =  dθ.
Example 4: Find the area of the region inside the circle r = 4 and outside r = 4 − cos θ.
First, let's graph the region.

Because r sweeps out the region as θ goes from − to , these are our limits of integration. Here, because of symmetry, instead of evaluating A =  dθ, we can evaluate A =  dθ.
Plug into the formula for area.

Use the trig identity cos2 θ =  to rewrite the integrand.

Evaluate the integral.

Do the following problems on your own. The answers are in Chapter 23.

3. Find the area inside the limaçon r = 4 + 2cos θ.
4. Find the area inside one loop of the lemniscate r2 = 4cos 2θ.
5. Find the area inside the lemniscate r2 = 6cos 2θ and outside the circle r = .











Chapter 21
Differential Equations
There are many types of differential equations, but only a very small number of them appear on the AP exam. There are courses devoted to learning how to solve a wide variety of differential equations, but AP Calculus provides only a very basic introduction to the topic.
SEPARATION OF VARIABLES
If you're given an equation in which the derivative of a function is equal to some other function, you can determine the original function by integrating both sides of the equation and then solving for the constant term.
Example 1: If  and y(0) = 5, find an equation for y in terms of x.
The first step in solving these is to put all of the terms that contain y on the left side of the equals sign and all of the terms that contain x on the right side. We then have y dy = 4x dx. The second step is to integrate both sides.

∫ y dy = ∫ 4x dx

And then you integrate

 = 2x2 + C

You're not done yet. The final step is to solve for the constant by plugging in x = 0 and y = 5.

 = 2(02) + C, so C = 

The solution is .
That's all there is to it. Separate the variables, integrate both sides, and solve for the constant. Often, the equation will involve a logarithm. Let's do an example.
Example 2: If  = 3x2y and y(0) = 2, find an equation for y in terms of x.
First, put the y terms on the left and the x terms on the right.

 = 3x2 dx

Next, integrate both sides.

The result is: ln y = x3 + C. It's customary to solve this equation for y. You can do this by putting both sides into exponential form.

y = ex3+ C

This can be rewritten as y = ex3. ec and, because ec is a constant, the equation becomes

y = Cex3

This is the preferred form of the equation. Now, solve for the constant. Plug in x = 0 and y = 2, and you get 2 = Ce0.
Because e0 = 1, C = 2. The solution is y = 2ex3.
This is the typical differential equation that you'll see on the AP exam. Other common problem types involve position, velocity, and acceleration or exponential growths and decay (Problem 4). We did several problems of this type in Chapter 10, before you knew how to use integrals. In a sample problem, you're given the velocity and acceleration and told to find distance (the reverse of what we did before).
Example 3: If the acceleration of a particle is given by a(t) = −32 ft/sec2, and the velocity of the particle is 64 ft/sec and the height of the particle is 32 ft at time t = 0, find: (a) the equation of the particle's velocity at time t; (b) the equation for the particle's height, h, at time t; and (c) the maximum height of the particle.
Part A: Because acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time, you can write that  = − 32. Now separate the variables and integrate both sides.

∫dv = ∫ −32 dt

Integrating this expression, we get v = −32t + C. Now we can solve for the constant by plugging in t = 0 and v = 64. We get 64 = −32(0) + C and C = 64. Thus, velocity is v = −32t + 64.
Part B: Because velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time, you know that

 = −32t + 64

Separate the variables and integrate both sides.

∫ dh = ∫(−32t + 64)dt

Integrate the expression: h = −16t2 + 64t + C. Now solve for the constant by plugging in t = 0 and h = 32.

32 = −16(02) + 64(0) + C and C = 32

Thus, the equation for height is h = −16t2 + 64t + 32.
Part C: In order to find the maximum height, you need to take the derivative of the height with respect to time and set it equal to zero. Notice that the derivative of height with respect to time is the velocity; just set the velocity equal to zero and solve for t.

−32t + 64 = 0, so t = 2

Thus, at time t = 2, the height of the particle is a maximum. Now, plug t = 2 into the equation for height.

h = −16(2)2 + 64(2) + 32 = 96

Therefore, the maximum height of the particle is 96 feet.
Here are some solved problems. Do each problem, covering the answer first, then check your answer.
PROBLEM 1. If  and y(0) = 10, find an equation for y in terms of x.
Answer: First, separate the variables.

2y dy = 3x dx

Then, we take the integral of both sides.

∫2y dy = ∫3x dx

Next, integrate both sides.

Finally, solve for the constant.

102 =  + C, so C = 100

The solution is y2 =  + 100.
PROBLEM 2. If  = 4xy2 and y(0) = 1, find an equation for y in terms of x.
Answer: First, separate the variables:  = 4x dx. Then, take the integral of both sides.

Next, integrate both sides: −  = 2x2 + C. You can rewrite this as 
Finally, solve for the constant.

, so C = − 1

The solution is .
PROBLEM 3. If  and y(1) = , find an equation for y in terms of x.
Answer: This time, separating the variables gives us this: .
Then take the integral of both sides: .
Next, integrate both sides.

− = ln x + C

And rearrange the equation.

Finally, solve for the constant.  = , so C = −3. The solution is .
PROBLEM 4. A city had a population of 10,000 in 1980 and 13,000 in 1990. Assuming an exponential growth rate, estimate the city's population in 2000.
Answer: The phrase "exponential growth rate" means that  = ky, where k is a constant. Take the integral of both sides.

Then, integrate both sides (ln y = kt + C) and put them in exponential form.

y = ekt+c = Cekt

Next, use the information about the population to solve for the constants. If you treat 1980 as t = 0 and 1990 as t = 10, then

10,000 = Cek(0) and 13,000 = Cek(10)

So C = 10,000 and k =  ln1.3 ≈ 0.0262.
The equation for population growth is approximately y = 10,000e0.0262t. We can estimate that the population in 2000 will be

y = 10,000e0.0262(20) = 16,900

EULER'S METHOD
You are going to use your calculator to find an approximate answer to a differential equation. The method is quite simple. First, you need a starting point and an initial slope.
Next, we use increments of h to come up with approximations. Each new approximation will use the following rules:



xn = xn − 1 + h
yn = yn − 1 + h(y′n−1)
Repeat for n = 1, 2, 3,...



This is much easier to understand if we do an example.
Example 1: Use Euler's Method, with h = 0.2, to estimate y(1) if y′ = y − 2 and y(0) = 4.
We are given that the curve goes through the point (0, 4). We will call the coordinates of this point x0 = 0 and y0 = 4. The slope is found by y0 = 4 plugging into y′ = y − 2, so we have an initial slope of  = 4 − 2 = 2.
Now we need to find the next set of points.
Step 1: Increase x0 by h to get x1.

x1 = 0.2

Step 2: Multiply h by  and add to y0 to get y1.

y1 = 4 + 0.2(2) = 4.4

Step 3: Find  by plugging y1 into the equation for y′.

 = 4.4 − 2 = 2.4

Repeat until you get to the desired point (in this case x = 1).
Step 1: Increase x1 by h to get x2.

x2 = 0.4

Step 2: Multiply h by  and add to y1 to get y2.

y2 = 4.4 + 0.2(2.4) = 4.88

Step 3: Find  by plugging y2 into the equation for y′.

 = 4.88 − 2 = 2.88

Step 1: x3 = x2 + h

x3 = 0.6

Step 2: y3 = y2 + h()

y3 = 4.88 + 0.2(2.88) = 5.456

Step 3:  = y3 − 2

 = 5.456 − 2 = 3.456

Step 1: x4 = x3 + h

x4 = 0.8

Step 2: y4 = y3 + h()

y4 = 5.456 + 0.2(3.456) = 6.1472

Step 3:  = y4 − 2

 = 6.1472 − 2 = 4.1472

Step 1: x5 = x4 + h

x5 = 1.0

Step 2: y5 = y4 + h()

y5 = 6.1472 + 0.2(4.1472) = 6.97664

We don't need to go any further because we are asked for the value of y when x = 1.
The answer is y = 6.97664.
Let's do another example.
Example 2: Use Euler's Method, with h = 0.1, to estimate y(0.5) if y′ = y − 1 and y(0) = 3.
We start with x0 = 0 and y0 = 3. The slope is found by plugging y0 = 3 into y′ = y − 1, so we have an initial slope of  = 3 − 1 = 2.
Step 1: Increase x0 by h to get x1.

x1 = 0.1

Step 2: Multiply h by  and add to y0 to get y1.

y1 = 3 + 0.1(2) = 3.2

Step 3: Find  by plugging y1 into the equation for y′.

 = 3.2 − 1 = 2.2

Step 1: x2 = x1 + h

x2 = 0.2

Step 2: y2 = y1 + h()

y2 = 3.2 + 0.1(2.2) = 3.42

Step 3:  = y2 − 1

 = 3.42 − 1 = 2.42

Step 1: x3 = x2 + h

x3 = 0.3

Step 2: y3 = y2 + h()

y3 = 3.42 + 0.1(2.42) = 3.662

Step 3:  = y3 − 1

 = 3.662 − 1 = 2.662

Step 1: x4 = x3 + h

x4 = 0.4

Step 2: y4 = y3 + h()

y4 = 3.662 + 0.1(2.662) = 3.9282

Step 3:  = y4 − 1

 = 3.9282 − 1 = 2.9282

Step 1: x5 = x4 + h

x5 = 0.5

Step 2: y5 = y4 + h()

y5 = 3.9282 + 0.1(2.9282) = 4.22102

The answer is y = 4.22102.
Now try these on your own. Do each problem first with the answer covered, and then check your answer.
PROBLEM 1: Use Euler's Method, with h = 0.2, to estimate y(2) if y′ = 2y + 1 and y(1) = 5.
We start with x0 = 1 and y0 = 5. The slope is found by plugging y0 = 5 into y′ = 2y + 1, so we have an initial slope of  = 2(5) + 1 = 11.
Step 1: Increase x0 by h to get x1.

x1 = 1.2

Step 2: Multiply h by  and add to y0 to get y1.

y1 = 5 + 0.2(11) = 7.2

Step 3: Find  by plugging y1 into the equation for y′.

 = 2(7.2) + 1 = 15.4

Step 1: x2 = x1 + h

x2 = 1.4

Step 2: y2 = y1 + h()

y2 = 7.2 + 0.2(15.4) = 10.28

Step 3:  = 2y2 + 1

 = 2(10.28) + 1 = 21.56

Step 1: x3 = x2 + h

x3 = 1.6

Step 2: y3 = y2 + h()

y3 = 10.28 + 0.2(21.56) = 14.592

Step 3:  = 2y3 + 1

 = 2(14.592) + 1 = 30.184

Step 1: x4 = x3 + h

x4 = 1.8

Step 2: y4 = y3 + h()

y4 = 14.592 + 0.2(30.184) = 20.6288

Step 3:  = 2y4 + 1

 = 2(20.6288) + 1 = 42.2576

Step 1: x5 = x4 + h

x5 = 2

Step 2: y5 = y4 + h()

y5 = 20.6288 + 0.2(42.2576) = 29.08032

The answer is y = 29.08032.
PROBLEM 2: Use Euler's Method, with h = 0.1, to estimate y(0.5) if y′ = y2 + 1 and y(0) = 0.
We start with x0 = 0 and y0 = 0. The slope is found by plugging y0 = 0 into y′ = y2 + 1, so we have an initial slope of  = 1.
Step 1: Increase x0 by h to get x1.

x1 = 0.1

Step 2: Multiply h by  and add to y0 to get y1.

y1 = 0 + 0.1(1) = 0.1

Step 3: Find  by plugging y1 into the equation for y′.

 = (0.1)2 + 1 = 1.01

Step 1: x2 = x1 + h

x2 = 0.2

Step 2: y2 = y1 + h()

y2 = 0.1 + 0.1(1.01) = 0.201

Step 3:  = (y2)2 + 1

 = (0.201)2 + 1 = 1.040

Step 1: x3 = x2 + h

x3 = 0.3

Step 2: y3 = y2 + h()

 = 0.201 + 0.1(1.040) = 0.305

Step 3:  = (y3)2 + 1

 = (0.305)2 + 1 = 1.093

Step 1: x4 = x3 + h

x4 = 0.4

Step 2: y4 = y3 + h()

y4 = 0.305 + 0.1(1.093) = 0.414

Step 3:  = (y4)2 + 1

 = (0.414)2 + 1 = 1.171

Step 1: x5 = x4 + h

x5 = 0.5

Step 2: y5 = y4 + h()

y5 = 0.414 + 0.1(1.171) = 0.531

The answer is y = 0.531.
SLOPE FIELDS
The idea behind slope fields, also known as direction fields, is to make a graphical representation of the slope of a function at various points in the plane. We are given a differential equation, but not the equation itself. So how do we do this? Well, it's always easiest to start with an example.
Example 1: Given  = x, sketch the slope field of the function.
What does this mean? Look at the equation. It gives us the derivative of the function, which is the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point x. In other words, the equation tells us that the slope of the curve at any point x is the x-value at that point.
For example, the slope of the curve at x = 1 is 1. The slope of the curve at x = 2 is 2. The slope of the curve at the origin is 0. The slope of the curve at x = −1 is −1. We will now represent these different slopes by drawing small segments of the tangent lines at those points. Let's make a sketch.

See how all of these slopes are independent of the y-values, so for each value of x, the slope is the same vertically, but is different horizontally. Compare this slope field to the next example.
Example 2: Given  = y, sketch the slope field of the function.
Here, the slope of the curve at y = 1 is 1. The slope of the curve at y = 2 is 2. The slope of the curve at the origin is 0. The slope of the curve at y = −1 is −1. Let's make a sketch.

See how all of these slopes are independent of the x-values, so for each value of y, the slope is the same horizontally, but is different vertically.
Now let's do a slightly harder example.
Example 3: Given  = xy, sketch the slope field of the function.
Now, we have to think about both the x and y values at each point. Let's calculate a few slopes.

At (0, 0), the slope is (0)(0) = 0.
At (1, 0), the slope is (1)(0) = 0.
At (2, 0), the slope is (2)(0) = 0.
At (0, 1), the slope is (0)(1) = 0.
At (0, 2), the slope is (0)(2) = 0.

So the slope will be zero at any point on the coordinate axes.

At (1, 1), the slope is (1)(1) = 1.
At (1, 2), the slope is (1)(2) = 2.
At (1, −1), the slope is (1)(−1) = −1.
At (1, −2), the slope is (1)(−2) = −2.

So the slope at any point where x = 1 will be the y-value. Similarly, you should see that the slope at any point where y = 1 will be the x-value. As we move out the coordinate axes, slopes will get steeper—whether positive or negative.

Let's do one more example.
Example 4: Given  = y − x, sketch the slope field of the function.
We have to think about both the x and y values at each point. This time, let's make a table of the values of the slope at different points.



Now let's make a sketch of the slope field. Notice that the slopes are zero along the line y = x and that the slopes get steeper as we move away from the line in either direction.

That's really all that there is to slope fields. Obviously, there are more complicated slope fields that one could come up with, but on the AP exam, they will ask you to sketch only the simplest ones.

Chapter 22
Infinite Series
SEQUENCES AND SERIES
A sequence of numbers is an infinite succession of numbers that follow a pattern. For example: 1, 2, 3, 4,...; or ...; or 1, −1, 1, −1....
Terms in a sequence are usually denoted with a subscript; the first term of a sequence is a1, the second term of a sequence is a2, the nth term of a sequence is an, and so on.
Usually, the terms in a sequence are generated by a formula. For example, the sequence an =  beginning with n = 1 is: 0, ,....This is found by plugging in 1 for n, then 2, then 3, and so on. Notice that n is always an integer.
A sequence converges to a number if, as n gets bigger, the terms get closer to a certain number; that number is the limit of the sequence.
Here's the official math jargon.


A sequence has a limit L if for any ε > 0 there is an associated positive integer N such that |an − L| < ε for all n ≥ N. If so, the sequence converges to L and we write  an = L.


If the sequence has no finite limit, it diverges.
For example: the sequence an =  converges, because  = 1. As n gets bigger, the terms of the sequence get closer and closer to 1. The sequence an = 2n diverges, because  2n = ∞ As n gets bigger, the terms of the sequence get bigger.
Now that we've defined a sequence, we can define a series. A series is an expression of the form a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 +...an +....If the series stops at some final term an, the series is finite. If the series continues indefinitely, it's an infinite series. These are the ones that primarily show up on the AP exam. Because a series is the sum of all the terms of a sequence, we often use sigma notation like the following:

 an

The harmonic series, for example, looks like the following:



A partial sum of a series is the sum of the series up to a particular value of n. If the sequence of partial sums of a series converges to a limit L, then the series is said to converge to that limit L, and we write
 an = L


If there is no such limit, (like the harmonic series, for example) then the series diverges.
Example 1: Does the series  converge and, if so, to what value?
The nth partial sum of this series is . You can figure out the limit using the following method. First, write it out.

Next, multiply through by .

If you now subtract the second expression from the first, you get

Now, multiply through by .

Finally, take the limit.

The series converges to .
GEOMETRIC SERIES
The problem above contains an example of a series called a geometric series. Generally, this series takes the following form:


a + ar + ar2 + ar3 +...+ arn−1 +...=  arn − 1


These series often show up on the AP exam. You're usually asked to determine whether the series converges or diverges, and if it converges, to what limit. The test for convergence of a geometric series is very simple.


If |r| < 1 the series converges.
If |r| ≥ 1, the series diverges.


So, for example, the series  +...converges, whereas the series 2 + 22 + 23 +...diverges.
If a geometric series converges, you can always figure out its sum by doing the following:

Let Sn = a + ar + ar2 + ar3 +...arn − 1

Multiply the expression by r.

rSn = ar + ar2 + ar3 +...arn

Now subtract the second expression from the first.

Sn − rSn = a − arn

Factor Sn out of the left side.

Sn(1 − r) = a − arn

Divide through by 1 − r.

Thus, if we want to find the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series, we use the following formula:





For example, the sum of the first four terms of the series in Example 1 is

For an infinite geometric series, if it converges,  rn = 0, and its sum is found this way.


S = 


In Example 1, the first term is a =  and r = . The sum is: .
Many students find it is easier to work through the derivation of the sum than to actually memorize the formula. Either way, you should always be able to find the sum of an infinite geometric series.
Example 2: Find the limit to which the series 2 +  +...converges.
The first term is a = 2 and r = , so the limit is .
The AP exam's treatment of series doesn't get very complicated, and the exam usually confines itself to finding the limit of an infinite geometric series. Just remember that if |r| ≥ 1, the geometric series diverges and it has no limit. No exceptions.
THE RATIO TEST
Sometimes you'll simply be asked to determine whether a series converges. With a geometric series, you already know what to do. If the series isn't a geometric one, you can usually use the Ratio Test.


Let  an be a series where all of the terms are positive, and suppose that

Then

(a) If ρ < 1, the series converges.
(b) If ρ > 1, the series diverges.
(c) If ρ = 1, the test provides insufficient information and the series might converge or diverge.






Example 3: Determine whether the series  converges.
Use the Ratio Test.

Because ρ < 1, the series converges. Notice that it does not converge to the limit . That value simply tells us that the series is a convergent one.
Example 4: Determine whether the series  converges.
By the Ratio Test, you discover that

Because ρ = 1, the test is insufficient and we don't know whether the series converges or diverges.
One easy test to use is for a type of series that is called a p series. This is a series of the form . A p series will converge if p > 1 and will diverge if p ≤ 1. You can easily show this using the Ratio Test.
COMPARISON TEST
Another test for convergence is the Comparison Test (also known as the Direct Comparison Test).


Let 0 ≤ an ≤ bn for all n.
1) If  bn converges, then  an converges.
2) If  an diverges, then  bn diverges.





In other words, if all of the terms of a series are less than those of a convergent series, then it too converges. And, if all of the terms of a series are greater than those of a divergent series, then it too diverges.
Example 5: Does  converge?
We know that  converges because it is a geometric series with |r| < 1.
Compare the series in question with . Each term of  is less than , so  converges by comparison.
Example 6: Does  converge?
We know that  diverges because it is the harmonic series.
Compare the series in question with . Each term of  is greater than , so  diverges by comparison.
LIMIT COMPARISON TEST
In addition to the Comparison Test, there is another test for convergence called the Limit Comparison Test. This is especially useful for series where an is a rational function of n. The test is:
Suppose that an > 0 and bn > 0 for all n ≥ N, where N is an integer.



1) If  = c (where c > 0), then series an and series bn both converge or both diverge.
2) If  = 0, and series bn converges, then series an also converges.






Example 7: Does  converge?
Let's use the Limit Comparison test. For large n, the series will behave like , so let's make bn = . We know that the series  converges. Let's use the test:

This result corresponds to part 1 of the test. Because the ratio is 1 and the series  converges, the series  also converges.
Example 8: Does  converge?
Let's use the Limit Comparison test. For large n, the series will behave like , so let's make bn = . We know that the series  diverges. Let's use the test:  =  =  = 1.
This result corresponds to part 1 of the test. Because the ratio is 1 and the series  diverges, the series  also diverges.
Example 9: Does  converge?
Let's use the Limit Comparison test. Because ln n grows more slowly than nc (where c > 0), we can compare the series . We could have used any value for c, so we chose  to make the numbers work out nicely. So, let's make bn = . We know that the series  converges. Let's use the test:  =  =  = 1 (use L'Hôpital's rule). This result corresponds to part 2 of the test. Because the ratio is 0 and the series  converges, the series  also converges.
CONDITIONAL CONVERGENCE
Sometimes an Alternating Series will converge, but when we look at the absolute value of the terms, it doesn't converge. An alternating series that is not absolutely convergent is called conditionally convergent. A good example of this is the series (−1)n, which is called the alternating harmonic series. Earlier, we said that the harmonic series, , diverges. Let's apply the alternating series test to this series to see the difference.

(a) bn > 0 That is, the terms  are all positive.
(b) bn > bn + 1 for all n. That is, the terms are decreasing.
(c) bn → 0 as n → ∞.

Therefore, the series converges. Because the series (−1)n converges but the series  diverges, the series (−1)n converges conditionally.
Example 10: Does (−1)n converge absolutely or conditionally?
First, let's use the Alternating Series Test:

(a) bn > 0. That is, the terms  are all positive.
(b) bn > bn + 1 or all n. That is, the terms are decreasing.
(c) bn → 0 as n → ∞.

Therefore, the series (−1)n converges.
Now let's look at the series . This is an example of a p series, . A p series will converge if p > 1 and will diverge if p ≤ 1. Here, p = , so the series  diverges. Because the series (−1)n converges but the series  diverges, it is conditionally convergent.
ALTERNATING SERIES
The next type of series to concern yourself with is the alternating series. This is a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative. For example,

Usually, you'll be asked to determine whether such a series converges. First, test the following:


The series  (−1)n + 1bn converges if all three of the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) bn > 0 (which means that the terms must alternate in sign)
(b) bn > bn + 1 for all n
(c) bn → 0 as n → ∞



Example 11: Determine whether the series   converges.
Let's check the criteria.

(a) Each of the bn's is positive.
(b) Each bn is greater than its succeeding bn + 1.
(c) The bn's are tending to zero as n approaches infinity.

Therefore, the series converges. This series is called the alternating harmonic series. Notice that this series converges, whereas the harmonic series diverges.
Usually, you'll be asked to determine whether a series converges "absolutely."


A series  an converges absolutely if the corresponding series |an| converges.



Note that this Absolute Convergence Theorem is not limited to alternating series: it's "absolutely" true for any series.

INTEGRAL TEST
Another test that you can use to determine whether a series converges or diverges is the Integral Test.


If f is positive, continuous, and decreasing for x ≥ 1, and an = f(n), then
 an and  f(x)dx
Either both converge or both diverge.





In other words, if you want to test convergence for a series with positive terms, evaluate the integral and see if the integral converges.
Example 12: Does  converge?
In order to determine whether this converges, we can evaluate the integral, replacing n with x.
Evaluate  dx.
First, we replace the improper integral with a proper one and a limit. We get:  dx.
Use u-substitution. Let u = x3 + 1 and du = 3x2 dx.
We get

Therefore, because the integral diverges, the series diverges.
Example 13: Does  e−n converge?
In order to determine whether this converges, we can evaluate the integral, replacing n with x.
Evaluate  e−xdx.
First, we replace the improper integral with a proper one and a limit. We get:  dx.
Evaluate the integral. We get  =  =  = .
Therefore, because the integral converges, the series converges. Note that the series does not necessarily converge to .
ERROR BOUND
When summing an alternating series with a finite number of terms, the sum Sn will not be the same as the sum with an infinite number of terms, S. If we want to find the error, we need to evaluate |S − Sn|. Sometimes this can be quite difficult to calculate, but we can put a "bound" on the error; that is, a number that the error is less than. This bound will simply be the absolute value of the next term in the alternating series. For example, if we are summing the first ten terms in an alternating series, the error will be less than the absolute value of the eleventh term.
Example 14: Find the sum of the series  and the error bound for this sum and the sum of the infinite series .
The sum of the series is simply 1 −  −  ≈ 0.83124. The error bound of the sum is the absolute value of the next term, namely . In other words, the sum of the infinite series is within  of .
Note that the error bound is unlikely to show up in a multiple choice question. More likely, it will be one part of a written question.
POWER SERIES
The most important type of series, and the one that the AP exam concentrates on, is the power series, which takes the form


 cnxn = c0 + c1x + c2x2 + c3x3 +...+ cnxn +....





Notice that we're now going from n = 0 to n = ∞, rather than from n = 1 to n = ∞. This is because the first term is a constant.
You'll be asked to determine whether a power series converges. The test is to the right.
For case (c), the number R is called the radius of convergence. In case (a), the radius of convergence is zero; in case (b) the radius is all x. The set of all values of x in the interval (-R, R) is called the interval of convergence.


For any power series in x, exactly one of the following is true:

(a) The series converges only for x = 0;
(b) The series converges absolutely for all x; or
(c) The series converges absolutely for all x in some open interval (-R, R), and diverges if x < -R or x > R. The series may converge or diverge at the endpoints of the interval.



Example 15: Find the radius and interval of convergence for the power series  xn.
This is a geometric series with r = x; thus, it converges if r < 1.
Therefore, the radius of convergence is R = 1, and the interval of convergence is (−1, 1).
Example 16: Find the radius and interval of convergence for the power series .
In order to determine convergence, apply the Ratio Test for absolute convergence.

Because ρ = 0 for all x, the series converges absolutely for all x. Therefore, the radius of convergence is R = ∞ and the interval of convergence is (-∞, ∞).
TAYLOR SERIES AND POLYNOMIALS
The final, and most important, topic in infinite series is the Taylor series. The power series and the Taylor series are the most frequent question topics on infinite series on the AP exam. A Taylor series expansion about a point x = a is a power series expansion that's useful to approximate the function in the neighborhood of the point x = a.
If a function f has derivatives of all orders at a, then the Taylor series for f about x = a is

 (x − a)k = f(a) + f′(a)(x − a) +  (x − a)2 +...+  (x − a)n +...

The special case of the Taylor series for a = 0 is called the Maclaurin series.

 (x)k = f(0) + f′(0)x +  x2 +...+  xn +...


The AP exam usually asks for a Taylor series at x = 0. Note that this is the same thing as the Maclaurin series.

Let's do an example to see what one of these looks like.
Example 17: Find the Taylor series about a = 1 generated by f(x) = .
First, find the derivatives of  and compute their values at x = 1.

Next, plug into the formula to generate the Taylor series.

1 − (x − 1) + (x − 1)2 +...=  (−1)k(x − 1)k

Example 18: Find the Taylor series about a = 0 generated by f(x) = ex.
First, find the derivatives of ex and compute their values at x = 0.

Next, plug into the formula to generate the Taylor series.

This is a very important expansion to know. Memorize it and be able to use it on the exam. You're permitted to write the Taylor series expansion for ex without explaining how to generate it.
That's all you need to know about Taylor series. There are four expansions you should prepare for on the AP exam. We already discussed the expansion for ex. You'll also need to know the expansions for sin x, cos x, and ln (1 + x).
We'll give you the Taylor series expansions here, and you'll derive them in the problems.
Taylor series can also be used to approximate the value of a function at a particular value. All you have to do is to plug that value into the Taylor series expansion for the function. The highest power term that you use is the degree of the Taylor polynomial. This is easier to see with an example.





Example 19: Use a third degree Taylor polynomial to estimate e0.2.
All that we have to do is to plug 0.2 into the Taylor expansion up to the third power term.
We get e0.2 ≈ 1 + 0.2 +  = 1.22133. If we evaluate e0.2 with a calculator, we get 1.22140. As you can see, this is a pretty good approximation.
Sometimes you will be asked to find the "error bound" of a Taylor polynomial. This is also sometimes referred to as the Lagrange error. The formula for Lagrange's form of the remainder is Rn(x, a) ≤ f(n + 1)(c), where c is between a and x.
Example 20: Take the first four terms of the Maclaurin series expansion for sin x, namely sin x ≈ x − , and estimate the remainder.
Using the formula for the remainder, we get
R2n (x, 0). We know that the |sin x| ≤ 1, so R2n + 1(x, 0) ≤ . Therefore, the remainder is R(x,0) ≤ .
The proof for the rule is quite difficult, so we will simply tell you the rule. If you are finding an nth degree Taylor polynomial, a good approximation to the error bound is the next nonzero term in a decreasing series. For example, if we wanted to find the error in the above example, we know that it's less than the fourth term evaluated at 0.2, which is  = 0.000066.
PROBLEM 1. Find the sum of the series 4 +  +...+ .
Answer: This is a geometric series where a = 4, r =  and n = 7. According to the formula, the sum is

Sn = 

Plugging in, you should get

S7 =  = 5.997

PROBLEM 2. Find the limit to which the series 4 +  +...converges.
Answer: This is the same series, but now you want the limit at infinity, so use the formula.

S = 

The result is

S =  = 6

PROBLEM 3. Determine whether the series  converges.
Answer: By the Ratio Test,

Because ρ < 1, the series converges.
PROBLEM 4. Find the Taylor series about a = 0 generated by f(x) = sin x.
Answer: First, find the derivatives of sin x and compute their values at x = 0.

As you've seen us do before, plug into the formula to generate the Taylor series.

PROBLEM 5. Find the radius and interval of convergence for the series .
Answer: In order to determine convergence, apply the Ratio Test for absolute convergence.

Thus, if |x| < 1, then ρ < 1, and the series converges.
If |x| > 1, then ρ > 1, and the series diverges.


If x = 1, then  (which converges).
If x = −1, then  (which converges).


Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1 and the interval of convergence is [−1, 1].

12. (a) 4; (b) 5; (c) The limit Does Not Exist.

1. Yes. It satisfies all three conditions.
In order for a function f(x) to be continuous at a point x = c, it must fulfill all three of the following conditions:
Condition 1: f(c) exists.
Condition 2:  exists.
Condition 3:  f(x) = f(c)
Let's test each condition.
f(2) = 9, which satisfies condition 1.
 f(x) = 9 and  f(x) = 9, so  f(x) = 9, which satisfies condition 2.
 f(x) = 9 = f(2), which satisfies condition 3. Therefore, f(x) is continuous at x = 2.
2. No. It fails condition 3.
In order for a function f(x) to be continuous at a point x = c, it must fulfill all three of the following conditions:
Condition 1: f(c) exists.
Condition 2:  f(x) exists.
Condition 3:  f(x) = f(c)
Let's test each condition.
f(3) = 29, which satisfies condition 1.
 f(x) = 30 and  f(x) = 30, so  f(x) = 30, which satisfies condition 2.
But  f(x) ≠ f(3). Therefore, f(x) is not continuous at x = 3 because it fails condition 3.
3. No. It is discontinuous at any odd integral multiple of .
Recall that sec x = . This means that sec x is undefined at any value where cos x = 0, which are the odd multiples of . Therefore, sec x is not continuous everywhere.
4. No. It is discontinuous at the endpoints of the interval.
Recall that sec x = . This means that sec x is undefined at any value where cos x = 0. Also recall that cos = 0 and cos = 0. Therefore, sec x is not continuous everywhere on the interval .
5. Yes.
Recall that sec x = . This means that sec x is undefined at any value where cos x = 0. Also recall that cos = 0 and cos = 0. Therefore, sec x is continuous everywhere on the interval  because the interval does not include the endpoints.
6. The function is continuous for k = .
In order for a function f(x) to be continuous at a point x = c, it must fulfill all three of the following conditions:
Condition 1: f(c) exists.
Condition 2:  f(x) exists.
Condition 3:  f(x) = f(c)
We will need to find a value, or values, of k that enables f(x) to satisfy each condition.
Condition 1: f(4) = 0
Condition 2:  f(x) = 0 and  f(x) = 16k − 9. In order for the limit to exist, the two limits must be the same. If we solve 16k − 9 = 0, we get k = .
Condition 3: If we now let k = ,  f(x) = 0 = f(4). Therefore, the solution is k = .
7. The removable discontinuity is at .
A removable discontinuity occurs when you have a rational expression with common factors in the numerator and denominator. Because these factors can be cancelled, the discontinuity is "removable." In practical terms, this means that the discontinuity occurs where there is a "hole" in the graph. If we factor f(x) = , we get f(x) = . If we cancel the common factor, we get f(x) = . Now, if we plug in x = 3, we get f(x) = . Therefore, the removable discontinuity is at .
8. (a) 0; (b) 0; (c) 1; (d) 1; (e) f(3) Does Not Exist; (f) a jump discontinuity at; a removable discontinuity at x = 3 and an essential discontinuity at x = 5.
(a) If we look at the graph, we can see that  f(x) = 0.
(b) If we look at the graph, we can see that  f(x) = 0.
(c) If we look at the graph, we can see that  f(x) = 1.
(d) If we look at the graph, we can see that  f(x) = 1.
(e) f(3) Does Not Exist.
(f) There are three discontinuities: (1) a jump discontinuity at; x = −3; (2) a removable discontinuity at x = 3; and (3) an essential discontinuity at x = 5.

The derivative of 2 = 0 (because the derivative of a constant is zero). The derivative of 16 x−1 = 16(−1x−2) = −16x−2. The derivative of 7x−2 = 7(−2x−3) = −14x−3. The derivative of 8x−3 = 8(−3x−4) = −24x−4. The derivative of 4x−4 = 4(−4x−5) = −16x−5. Therefore, the derivative is −16x−2 + 14x−3 − 24x−4 + 16x−5 = .
19. 5ax4 + 4bx3 + 3cx2 + 2dx + e
Use the Power Rule to take the derivative of each term. The derivative of ax5 = a (5x4) = 5ax4. The derivative of bx4 = b (4x3) = 4bx3. The derivative of cx3 = c (3x2) = 3cx2. The derivative of dx2 = d (2x) = 2dx. The derivative of ex = e. The derivative of f = 0 (because the derivative of a constant is zero). Therefore, the derivative is 5ax4 + 4bx3 + 3cx2 + 2dx + e.
20. 10(x + 1)9

26. 6cos3x cos4x − 8sin3x sin4x
Recall that (sin x) = cos x and that (cos x) = −sin x. Here we use the Product Rule to find the derivative:  = 2[(sin3x)(−sin4x)(4) + (cos4x)(cos3x)(3)]. This can be simplified to  = 6cos3x cos 4x − 8sin3x sin4x.
27. (secθ)(sec2(2θ))(2) + (tan2θ) (secθ tanθ)
Recall that (tan x) = sec2 x and that (sec x) = sec x tan x. Using the Product Rule and the Chain Rule, we get  = (secθ)(sec2 (2θ))(2) + (tan2θ)(secθ tanθ).

Remember that the equation of a line through a point (x1, y1) with slope m is y − y1 = m(x − x1). We find the y-coordinate by plugging x = 2 into the equation y = 2x3 − 3x2 − 12x + 20, and we find the slope by plugging x = 2 into the derivative of the equation.
First, we find the y-coordinate,y1: y = 2(2)3 − 3(2)2 −12(2) + 20 = 0. This means that the line passes through the point (2, 0).
Next, we take the derivative:  = 6x2 − 6x − 12. Now, we can find the slope, m:  = 6(2)2 − 6(2) − 12 = 0. Finally, we plug in the point (2, 0) and the slope m = 0 to get the equation of the tangent line: y − 0(x − 2) or y = 0.

Finally, we plug in the point (3, 7) and the slope m =  to get the equation of the normal line: y − 7 =  (x − 3).
10. x = 9
A line that is parallel to the y-axis has an infinite (or undefined) slope. In order to find where the normal line has an infinite slope, we first take the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line:  = 2(x − 9)(1) = 2x − 18. Next, because the normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line, the slope of the normal line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line: . Now, we need to find where the slope is infinite. This is simply where the denominator of the slope is zero: x = 9.
11. 
A line that is parallel to the x-axis has a zero slope. In order to find where the tangent line has a zero slope, we first take the derivative:  = −3 − 2x. Now we need to find where the slope is zero. The derivative −3 −2x = 0 at x −. Now we need to find the y-coordinate, which we get by plugging x − into the equation for y: . Therefore, the answer is .
12. a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1.
The two equations will have a common tangent line where they have the same slope, which we find by taking the derivative of each equation. The derivative of the first equation is:  = 2x + a. The derivative of the second equation is  = c + 2x. Setting the two derivatives equal to each other, we get: a = c. Each equation will pass through the point (−1, 0). If we plug (−1, 0) into the first equation, we get 0 = (−1)2 + a(−1) + b, which simplifies to: a − b. If we plug (−1, 0) into the second equation, we get 0 = c(−1) + (−1)2, which simplifies to c = 1. Now we can find the values for a, b, and c. We get a = 1, b = 0, and c = 1.

Practice Problem Set 2

1. c = 0
The Mean Value Theorem says that: If f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b] and is differentiable everywhere on the interval (a, b), then there exists at least one number c on the interval (a, b) such that f′(c) = . Here the function is f(x) = 3x2 + 5x − 2 and the interval is [−1, 1]. Thus, the Mean Value Theorem says that f′(c) = . This simplifies to f′(c) = 5. Next, we need to find f′(c). The derivative of f(x) is f′(x) = 6x + 5, so f′(c) = 6c + 5. Now, we can solve for c: 6c + 5 = 5 and c = 0. Note that 0 is in the interval (−1, 1), just as we expected.
2. c = 
The Mean Value Theorem says that: If f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b] and is differentiable everywhere on the interval (a, b), then there exists at least one number c on the interval (a, b) such that f′(c) = . Here, the function is f(x) = x3 + 24x − 16 and the interval is [0, 4]. Thus, the Mean Value Theorem says that f′(c) = . This simplifies to f′(c) = 40. Next, we need to find f′(c) from the equation. The derivative of f(x) is f′(x) = 3x2 + 24, so f′(c) = 3c2 + 24. Now, we can solve for c: 3c2 + 24 = 40 and c = ±. Note that  is in the interval (0, 4), but − is not in the interval. Thus, the answer is only c = . It's very important to check that the answers you get for c fall in the given interval when doing Mean Value Theorem problems.
3. c = 
The Mean Value Theorem says that: If f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b] and is differentiable everywhere on the interval (a, b), then there exists at least one number c on the interval (a, b) such that f′(c) = . Here the function is f(x) =  − 3 and the interval is [1, 2]. Thus, the Mean Value Theorem says that f′(c) = . This simplifies to f′(c) = −3. Next, we need to find f′(c) from the equation. The derivative of f(x) is f′(x) = −, so f′(c) = −. Now, we can solve for c:  = −3 and c = ±. Note that c =  is in the interval (1, 2), but − is not in the interval. Thus, the answer is only c = . It's very important to check that the answers you get for c fall in the given interval when doing Mean Value Theorem problems.
4. No Solution.
The Mean Value Theorem says that: If f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b] and is differentiable everywhere on the interval (a, b), then there exists at least one number c on the interval (a, b) such that f′(c) = . Here, the function is f(x) =  − 3 and the interval is [−1, 2]. Note that the function is not continuous on the interval. It has an essential discontinuity (vertical asymptote) at x = 0. Thus, the Mean Value Theorem does not apply on the interval, and there is no solution.
Suppose that we were to apply the theorem anyway. We would get f′(c) = . This simplifies to f′(c) = 3. Next, we need to find f′(c) from the equation. The derivative of f(x) is f′(x) = −, so f′(c) = −. Now, we can solve for c: − = 3. This has no real solution. Therefore, remember that it's very important to check that the function is continuous and differentiable everywhere on the given interval (it does not have to be differentiable at the endpoints) when doing Mean Value Theorem problems. If it is not, then the theorem does not apply.
5. c = 4
Rolle's theorem says that if f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b] and is differentiable everywhere on the interval (a, b), and if f(a) = f(b) = 0, then there exists at least one number c on the interval (a, b) such that f′(c) = 0. Here the function is f(x) = x2 − 8x + 12 and the interval is [2, 6]. First, we check if the function is equal to zero at both of the endpoints: f(6) = (6)2 − 8(6) + 12 = 0 and f(2) = (2)2 − 8(2) + 12 = 0. Next, we take the derivative to find f′(c): f′(x) = 2x − 8, so f′(c) = 2c − 8. Now, we can solve for c: 2c − 8 = 0 and c = 4. Note that 4 is in the interval (2, 6), just as we expected.
6. c = 
Rolle's theorem says that if f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b] and is differentiable everywhere on the interval (a, b), and if f(a) = f(b) = 0, then there exists at least one number c on the interval (a, b) such that f′(c) = 0. Here the function is f(x) = x(1 − x) and the interval is [0, 1]. First, we check if the function is equal to zero at both of the endpoints: f(0) = (0)(1 − 0) = 0 and f(1) = (1)(1 − 1) = 0. Next, we take the derivative to find f′(c): f′(x) = 1 − 2x, so f′(c) = 1 − 2c. Now, we can solve for c: 1 − 2c = 0 and c = . Note that  is in the interval (0, 1), just as we expected.
7. No Solution.
Rolle's theorem says that if f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b] and is differentiable everywhere on the interval (a, b), and if f(a) = f(b) = 0, then there exists at least one number c on the interval (a, b) such that f′(c) = 0. Here the function is f(x) = 1 − , and the interval is [−1, 1]. Note that the function is not continuous on the interval. It has an essential discontinuity (vertical asymptote) at x = 0. Thus, Rolle's theorem does not apply on the interval, and there is no solution.
Suppose we were to apply the theorem anyway. First, we check if the function is equal to zero at both of the endpoints: f(1) = 1 −  = 0 and f(−1) = 1 −  = 0. Next, we take the derivative to find f′(c): f′(x) = , so f′(c) = . This has no solution.
Therefore, remember that it's very important to check that the function is continuous and differentiable everywhere on the given interval (it does not have to be differentiable at the endpoints) when doing Rolle's theorem problems. If it is not, then the theorem does not apply.
8. c = 
Rolle's theorem says that if f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b] and is differentiable everywhere on the interval (a, b), and if f(a) = f(b) = 0, then there exists at least one number c on the interval (a, b) such that f′(c) = 0. Here, the function is f(x) = x − x and the interval is [0, 1]. First, we check if the function is equal to zero at both of the endpoints: f(0) = (0) − (0) = 0 and f(1) = (1) − (1) = 0. Next, we take the derivative to find f′(c) f(x) = , so f(c) = . Now, we can solve for c:  = 0 and c = . Note that  is in the interval (0, 1), just as we expected.

Practice Problem Set 1

1. The area is 32.
First, let's draw a picture.

The rectangle can be expressed as a function of x, where the height is 12 − x2 and the base is 2x. The area is: A = 2x(12 − x2) = 24x − 2x3. Now, we take the derivative:  = 24 − 6x2. Next, we set the derivative equal to zero: 24 − 6x2 = 0. If we solve this for x, we get x = ±2. A negative answer doesn't make any sense in this case, so we use the solution x = 2. We can then find the area by plugging in x = 2 to get A = 24(2) − 2(2)3 = 32. We can verify that this is a maximum by taking the second derivative:  = −12x. Next, we plug in x = 2:  = −12(2) = −24. Because the value of the second derivative is negative, according to the second derivative test (see this page), the area is a maximum at x = 2.
2.  inches
First, let's draw a picture.

After we cut out the squares of side x and fold up the sides, the dimensions of the box will be: width: 9 − 2x; length: 12 − 2x; depth: x.
Using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, we can get an equation for the volume of the box in terms of x: V = x(9 − 2x)(12 − 2x) = 108x − 42x2 + 4x3.
Now, we take the derivative:  = 108 − 84x 12x2. Next, we set the derivative equal to zero: 108 − 84x + 12x2 = 0. If we solve this for x, we get x =  ≈5.303, 1.697. We can't cut two squares of length 5.303 inches from a side of length 9 inches, so we can get rid of that answer. Therefore, the answer must be x =  ≈1.697 inches. We can verify that this is a maximum by taking the second derivative:  = −84 + 24x. Next, we plug in x = 1.697 to get approximately  = − 84 + 24(1.697) = −43.272. Because the value of the second derivative is negative, according to the second derivative test (see this page), the volume is a maximum at x =  ≈1.697 inches.
3. 16 meters by 24 meters
First, let's draw a picture.

If we call the length of the plot y and the width x, the area of the plot is A = xy = 384. The perimeter is P = 3x + 2y. So, if we want to minimize the length of the fence, we need to minimize the perimeter of the plot. If we solve the area equation for y, we get y = . Now we can substitute this for y in the perimeter equation: . Now we take the derivative of P:  = 3-. If we solve this for x, we getx = ±16. A negative answer doesn't make any sense in this case, so we use the solution x = 16 meters. Now we can solve for y: y =  = 24 meters.
We can verify that this is a minimum by taking the second derivative: . Next, we plug in x = 16 to get . Because the value of the second derivative is positive, according to the second derivative test (see this page), the perimeter is a minimum at x = 16.
4. Radius is  inches.
First, let's draw a picture.

The volume of a cylinder is V = πr2h = 512. The material used for the can is the surface area of the cylinder (don't forget the ends!) S = 2πrh+2πr2. If we solve the volume equation for h, we get h = . Now we can substitute this for h in the surface area equation:  S = 2πr  + 2πr2 =  + 2πr2. Now we take the derivative of S:  = - + 4πr. If we solve this for r, we get r =  inches. We can verify that this is a minimum by taking the second derivative:  + 4π. Next, we plug in  and we can see that the value of the second derivative is positive. Therefore, according to the second derivative test (see this page), the perimeter is a minimum at r = .
5. 1,352.786 meters
Let's think about the situation. If the swimmer swims the whole distance to the cottage, she will be traveling the entire time at her slowest speed. If she swims straight to shore first, minimizing her swimming distance, she will be maximizing her running distance. Therefore, there should be a point, somewhere between the cottage and the point on the shore directly opposite her, where the swimmer should come on land to switch from swimming to running to get to the cottage in the shortest time.
Let's draw a picture.

Let x be the distance from the point on the shore directly opposite the swimmer to the point where she comes on land. We have two distances to consider. The first is the diagonal distance that the swimmer swims. This distance, which we'll call D1 is D1 =  = . The second distance, which we'll call D2, is simply D2 = 1,800 − x. Remember that rate × time = distance? We'll use this formula to find the total time that the swimmer needs. The time for the swimmer to travel D1 is T1 =  (because she swims at 4 m/s) and the time for the swimmer to travel D2 is T2 = . Therefore, the total time is T =  + 300 − . Now we simply take the derivative:  =  = . Next, we set this equal to zero and solve:  −  = 0. The best way to solve this is to move the  to the other side of the equals sign and cross-multiply:

Next, we square both sides: 36x2 = 16(250,000 + x2).
Simplify: 20x2 = 4,000,000.
Solve for x: x = ±447.214 m. (We can ignore the negative answer.) Therefore, she should land 1,800 − 447.214 = 1,352.786 meters from the cottage. We could verify that this is a minimum by taking the second derivative but that would be messy. It is simpler to use the calculator to check the sign of the derivative at a point on either side of the answer, or to graph the equation for the time.
6. 
First, let's draw a picture.

We need to find an expression for the distance from the point P to the point (2, 1) and then minimize the distance. If we call the coordinates of P(x, y) then we can find the distance to (2, 1) using the distance formula: D2 = (x − 2)2 + (y − 1)2. Next, just as we did in sample problem 4 (this page), we can let L = D2 and minimize L: L = (x − 2)2 + (y − 1)2 = x2 − 4x + 4 + y2 − 2y + 1.
Because x2 + y2 = 1, we can substitute for y to get: L = x2 − 4x+4+(1 − x2) − 2 + 1, which simplifies to: L = −4x+6 − 2. Next, we take the derivative:  =  = . Next, we set the derivative equal to zero: −4 +  = 0. The best way to solve this is to move the 4 to the other side of the equals sign and cross-multiply.
 = 4
2x = 4
Next, we can simplify and square both sides: x2 = 4(1 − x2). Now, we can solve this easily. We get x = ±. Next, we find the y-coordinate: y = ±. There are thus four possible answers but, if we look at the picture, the answer is obviously the point (, ). We could verify that this is a minimum by taking the second derivative, but that will be messy. It is simpler to use the calculator to check the sign of the derivative at a point on either side of the answer, or to graph the equation for the distance.
7. r =  inches
First, let's draw a picture.

Call the width of the window 2r. Notice that this is the diameter of the semicircle. Call the height of the window h. The area of the rectangular portion of the window is 2rh and the perimeter is 2r + 2h. The area of the semicircular portion of the window is  and the perimeter is  = πr. Therefore, the area of the window is A = 2rh + , and the perimeter is 2r + 2h + πr = 288. We can use the equation for the perimeter to eliminate a variable from the equation for the area. Let's isolate h: h = 144-r-. Now we can substitute for h in the equation for the area: A = 2r  = . Next, we can take the derivative:  = 288 − 4r − πr. If we set this equal to zero and solve for r, we get r =  inches. We can verify that this is a maximum by taking the second derivative:  = −4 -π. We can see that the value of the second derivative is negative. Therefore, according to the second derivative test (see this page), the area is a maximum at r =  inches.
8. θ =  radians (or 45 degrees)
We simply take the derivative:  = (2cos 2θ). Note that v0 and g are constants, so the only variable we need to take the derivative with respect to is θ. Now we set the derivative equal to zero: (2cos 2θ) = 0. Although this has an infinite number of solutions, we are interested only in values of θ between 0 and  radians (why?). The value of θ that makes the derivative zero is θ =  radians (or 45 degrees). We can verify that this is a maximum by taking the second derivative:  =  (−4 sin 2θ). We can see that the value of the second derivative is negative at θ = . Therefore, according to the second derivative test (see this page), the range is a maximum at θ =  radians.

Practice Problem Set 2

1. Minimum at (, −6 − 6); Maximum at (−, 6 − 6); Point of inflection at (0, −6).
First, let's find the y-intercept. We set x = 0 to get: y = (0)3 − 9(0) − 6 = −6. Therefore, the y-intercept is (0, −6). Next, we find any critical points using the first derivative. The derivative is  = 3x2 − 9. If we set this equal to zero and solve for x, we get x = ±. Plug x =  and x = - into the original equation to find the y-coordinates of the critical points: When x = , y = ()3 − 9() − 6 = −6 − 6. When x = -, y = ()3 − 9() − 6 = −6 − 6. Thus, we have critical points at (, −6 −6) and (-, −6 −6). Next, we take the second derivative to find any points of inflection. The second derivative is:  = 6x, which is equal to zero at x = 0. Note that this is the y-intercept (0, −6), which we already found, so there is a point of inflection at (0, −6). Next, we need to determine if each critical point is maximum, minimum, or something else. If we plug x =  into the second derivative, the value is obviously positive, so (, − 6 −6) is a minimum. If we plug x = −  into the second derivative, the value is obviously negative, so (−, 6 − 6) is a maximum. Now, we can draw the curve. It looks like the following:

2. Minimum at (−3, −4); Maximum at (−1, 0); Point of inflection at (−2, −2).
First, let's find the y-intercept. We set x = 0 to get: y = -(0)3 − 6(0)2 − 9(0) − 4 = −4. Therefore, the y-intercept is (0, −4). Next, we find any critical points using the first derivative. The derivative is  = −3x2 − 12x − 9. If we set this equal to zero and solve for x, we get x = −1 and x = −3. Plug x = −1 and x = −3 into the original equation to find the y-coordinates of the critical points: When x = −1, y = -(−1)3 − 6(−1)2 − 9(−1) − 4 = 0. When x = −3, y = -(−3)3 − 6(−3)2 − 9(−3) − 4 = −4. Thus, we have critical points at (−1, 0) and (−3, −4). Next, we take the second derivative to find any points of inflection. The second derivative is  = −6x − 12, which is equal to zero at x = −2. Plug x = −2 into the original equation to find the y-coordinate: y = -(−2)3 − 6(−2)2 − 9(−2) − 4 = −2, so there is a point of inflection at (−2, −2). Next, we need to determine if each critical point is a maximum, a minimum, or something else. If we plug x = −1 into the second derivative, the value is negative, so (−1, 0) is a maximum. If we plug x = −3 into the second derivative, the value is positive, so (−3, −4) is a minimum. Now, we can draw the curve. It looks like the following:

3. Minimum at (0, −36); Maxima at  and ; points of inflection at  and .
First, we can easily see that the graph has x-intercepts at x = ±2 and x = ±3. Next, before we take the derivative, let's multiply the two terms so we don't have to use the Product Rule. We get y = -x4 + 13x2 − 36. Now we can take the derivative:  = −4x3 + 26x. Next, we set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points. There are three solutions: x = 0, x = , and x = -.
We plug these values into the original equation to find the y-coordinates of the critical points: When x = 0, y = -(0)4 + 13(0)2 − 36 = −36. When x = , y =  .
When x = -, y =  .
Thus, we have critical points at (0, −36),  and .
Next, we take the second derivative to find any points of inflection. The second derivative is  = −12x2 + 26, which is equal to zero at x =  and x = -. We plug these values into the original equation to find the y-coordinates.
When x = , then y = -  .
When x = -, then y = −  . So there are points of inflection at  and . Next, we need to determine if each critical point is a maximum, a minimum, or something else. If we plug x = 0 into the second derivative, the value is positive, so (0, −36) is a minimum. If we plug x =  into the second derivative, the value is negative, so  is a maximum. If we plug x = - into the second derivative, the value is negative, so  is a maximum. Now, we can draw the curve. It looks like the following:

4. Vertical asymptote at x = −8; Horizontal asymptote at y = 1; No maxima, minima, or points of inflection.
First, notice that there is an x-intercept at x = 3 and that the y-intercept is . Next, we take the derivative:  =  = . Next, we set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points. There is no solution. Next, we take the second derivative: . If we set this equal to zero, there is also no solution. Therefore, there are no maxima, minima, or points of inflection. Note that the first derivative is always positive. This means that the curve is always increasing. Also notice that the second derivative changes sign from positive to negative at x = −8. This means that the curve is concave up for values of x less than x = −8 and concave down for values of x greater than x = −8.
Now, we can draw the curve. It looks like the following:



5. Vertical asymptote at x = 3; Oblique asymptote of y = x + 3; Maximum at (3 + ,6 + 2); Minimum at (3 − ,6 + 2); No points of inflection.
First, notice that there are x-intercepts at x = ±2 and that the y-intercept is . There is a vertical asymptote at x = 3. There is no horizontal asymptote, but notice that the degree of the numerator of the function is 1 greater than the denominator. This means that there is an oblique (slant) asymptote. We find this by dividing the denominator into the numerator and looking at the quotient. We get

This means that as x → ±∞, the function will behave like the function y = x + 3. This means that there is an oblique asymptote of y = x + 3. Next, we take the derivative:  =  = . Next, we set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points. There are two solutions: x = 3 +  and x = 3 − . We plug these values into the original equation to find the y-coordinates of the critical points: When x = 3 + , y =  = 6 + 2. When x = 3 − , y =  = 6 − 2. Thus, we have critical points at (3 + , 6 + 2) and (3 − , 6 − 2). Next, we take the second derivative: . If we set this equal to zero, there is no solution. Therefore, there is no point of inflection. But, notice that the second derivative changes sign from negative to positive at x = 3. This means that the curve is concave down for values of x less than x = 3 and concave up for values of x greater than x = 3. Next, we need to determine if each critical point is a maximum, a minimum, or something else. If we plug x = 3 +  into the second derivative, the value is positive, so (3 + , 6 + 2) is a minimum. If we plug x = 3 −  into the second derivative, the value is positive, so (3 − , 6 − 2) is a maximum.
Now, we can draw the curve. It looks like the following:

6. No maxima, minima, or points of inflection; Cusp at (0, 3).
First, notice that the function is always positive. There is a y-intercept at (0, 3). There is no x-intercept. Next, we take the derivative:  =  x−. If we set the derivative equal to zero, there is no solution. But, notice that the derivative is not defined at x = 0. This means that the function has either a vertical tangent or a cusp at x = 0. We'll be able to determine which after we take the second derivative. Notice also that the derivative is negative for x < 0 and positive for x > 0. Therefore, the curve is decreasing for x < 0 and increasing for x > 0. Next, we take the second derivative:  =  x−. If we set this equal to zero, there is no solution. The second derivative is always negative which tells us that the curve is always concave down and that the curve has a cusp at x = 0. Note that if it had switched concavity there, then x = 0 would be a vertical tangent. Now, we can draw the curve. It looks like the following:

7. Maximum at (1, 1); No point of inflection; Cusp at (0, 0).
First, we notice that the curve has x-intercepts at x = 0 and x =  and that there is a y-intercept at (0, 0). Before we take the derivative, let's expand the expression. That way, we won't have to use the Product Rule. We get y = 3x − 2x. Next, we take the derivative:  = 2x− − 2. Next, we set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points. There is one solution: x = 1. We plug this value into the original equation to find the y-coordinate of the critical point: When x = 1, y = 3(1) − 2(1) = 1. Thus, we have a critical point at (1, 1). But, notice that the derivative is not defined at x = 0. This means that the function has either a vertical tangent or a cusp at x = 0. We'll be able to determine which after we take the second derivative. Notice also that the derivative is negative for x < 0 and for x > 1 and positive for 0 < x < 1. Therefore, the curve is decreasing for x < 0 and for x > 1, and increasing for 0 < x < 1. Next, we take the second derivative:  = − x−. If we set this equal to zero, there is no solution. Therefore, there is no point of inflection. The second derivative is always negative which tells us that the curve is always concave down and that the curve has a cusp at x = 0. Note that if it had switched concavity there, then x = 0 would be a vertical tangent. Next, we need to determine if each critical point is a maximum, a minimum, or something else. If we plug x = 1 into the second derivative, the value is negative, so (1, 1) is a maximum. Now, we can draw the curve. It looks like the following:









CHAPTER 10 ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS
Practice Problem Set 1

1. 2,000 ft2/s
We are given the rate at which the circumference is increasing,  = 40 and are looking for the rate at which the area is increasing, . Thus, we need to find a way to relate the area of a circle to its circumference. Recall that the circumference of a circle is C = 2πr, and the area is A = πr2. We could find C in terms of r and then plug it into the equation for A, or we could work with the equations separately and then relate them. Let's do both and compare.
Method 1: First, we find C in terms of r: r = . Now, we plug this in for r in the equation for A: . Next, we take the derivative of the equation with respect to t: . Next, we plug in C = 100π and  = 40, and solve: (40) = 2,000. Therefore, the answer is 2,000 ft2/s.
Method 2: First, we take the derivative of C with respect to t:  = 2π. Next, we plug in  = 40 and solve for : 40 = 2π, so  = . Next, we take the derivative of A with respect to t:  = 2πr. Now, we can plug in for  and r and solve for . Note that when the circumference is 100π, r = 50:  = 2π(50) = 2,000. Therefore, the answer is 2,000 ft2/s.
Which method is better? In this case they are about the same. Method 1 is going to be more efficient if it is easy to solve for one variable in terms of the other, and it is also easy to take the derivative of the resulting expression. Otherwise, we will prefer to use Method 2 (See Example 3 on this page).
2.  in/s
We are given the rate at which the volume is increasing,  = 27π and are looking for the rate at which the radius is increasing, . Thus, we need to find a way to relate the volume of a sphere to its radius. Recall that the volume of a sphere is V =  πr3. All we have to do is take the derivative of the equation with respect to t:  π  = 4πr2 . Now we substitute  = 27π and r = 3: 27π = 4π(3)2. If we solve for , we get  =  in/s.
3. 100 km/hr
We are given the rate at which Car A is moving south,  = 80, and the rate at which Car B is moving west,  = 60, and are looking for the rate at which the distance between them is increasing, which we'll call . Note that the directions south and west are at right angles to each other. Thus, the distance that Car A is from the starting point, which we'll call A, and the distance that Car B is from the starting point, which we'll call B, are the legs of a right triangle, with C as the hypotenuse. We can relate the three distances using the Pythagorean theorem. Here, because A and B are the legs and C is the hypotenuse, A2 + B2 = C2. Now we take the derivative of the equation with respect to t: 2A + 2B = 2C. This simplifies to A + B + C. We know that Car A has been driving for 3 hours at 80 km/hr and Car B has been driving for 3 hours at 60 km/hr, so A = 240 and B = 180. Using the Pythagorean theorem, 2402 + 1802 = C2, so C = 300. Now we can substitute into our derivative equation: (240)(80) + (180)(60) = (300). If we solve for C, we get C = 100 km/hr.
4. 243in2/s
We are given the rate at which the sides of the triangle are increasing,  = 27 and are looking for the rate at which the area is increasing, . Thus, we need to find a way to relate the area of an equilateral triangle to the length of a side. We know that the area of an equilateral triangle, in terms of its sides, is A. (If you don't know this formula, memorize it! It will come in very handy in future math problems.) Now we take the derivative of this equation with respect to t: . Next, we plug  = 27 and s = 18 into the derivative and we get  in2/s.
5. − in/s
We are given the rate at which the water is flowing out of the container,  = −35π (Why is it negative?), and are looking for the rate at which the depth of the water is dropping, . Thus, we need to find a way to relate the volume of a cone to its height. We know that the volume of a cone is V =  πr2h. Notice that we have a problem. We have a third variable, r, in the equation. We cannot treat it as a constant the way we did in problem 4 because as the volume of a cone changes, both its height and radius change. But, we also know that in any cone, the ratio of the radius to the height is a constant. Here, when the radius is 21 (because the diameter is 42), the height is 15. Thus, . We can now isolate r in this equation: r = . Now we can plug it into the volume formula to get rid of r: . This simplifies to V =  h3. Now we can take the derivative of this equation with respect to t: . Next, we plug  = −35π and h = 5 into the derivative and we get −35π = . Now we can solve for :  = − in/s.
6. − ft/s
We are given the rate at which the length of the rope, R, is changing,  = −4 and are looking for the rate at which the boat, B, is approaching the dock, . The key to this problem is to realize that the vertical distance from the dock to the bow, the distance from the boat to the dock, and the length of the rope form a right triangle.

The vertical distance from the dock to the bow is always 7, so, using the Pythagorean theorem, we get: 72 + B2 = R2. Now we can take the derivative of this equation with respect to t: 2B = 2R, which simplifies to B = R. We know that R = 25 and can use the Pythagorean theorem to find B: 72 + B2 = 252, so B = 24. Now we plug  = −4, R = 25, and B = 24 into the derivative and we get 24 = 25(−4). Now we can solve for :  = − ft/s.
7.  ft/s
We are given the rate at which the woman is walking away from the street lamp and are looking for the rate at which the length of her shadow is changing. It helps to draw a picture of the situation.

If we label the distance between the woman and the street lamp, x, and the length of the woman's shadow, y, we can use similar triangles to get . We can cross-multiply and simplify.
24y = 6x + 6y
3y = x
Next, we take the derivative of the equation with respect to t: 3 = . Now, we can plug  = 4 into the derivative and solve:  =  ft/s.
8. in2/min
We know that it takes 60 minutes for the minute hand of a clock to make one complete revolution, so the rate at which the angle, θ, formed by the minute hand and noon increasing, in terms of radians/min, is . Next, we know that the area of the sector of a circle is proportional to its central angle, so , which can be simplified to S =  r2θ.

Note that the radius is 6 (the length of the minute hand) and is a constant. Next, we take the derivative of the equation with respect to t:.
Finally, we substitute  into the derivative: .

Practice Problem Set 2

1. v(t) = 3t2 − 18t 24; a(t) = − 6t − 18
In order to find the velocity function of the particle, we simply take the derivative of the position function with respect to t:  = v(t) = 3t2 − 18t + 24. In order to find the acceleration function of the particle, we simply take the derivative of the velocity function with respect to t:  = 6t − 18.
2. v(t) = 2cos(2t) − sin(t); a(t) = −4sin(2t) − cos(t)
In order to find the velocity function of the particle, we simply take the derivative of the position function with respect to t:  = v(t) = 2cos(2t) − sin(t). In order to find the acceleration function of the particle, we simply take the derivative of the velocity function with respect to t:  = a(t) = −4sin(2t) − cos(t).
3. t = π and t = 3π
In order to find where the particle is changing direction, we need to find where the velocity of the particle changes sign. The velocity function of the particle is the derivative of the position function: . Next, we set the velocity equal to zero. The solutions are: t = π and t = 3π. Actually, there are an infinite number of solutions but remember that we are restricted to 0 < t < 4π. Next, we check the sign of the velocity on the intervals 0 < t < π, π < t < 3π, and 3π < t < 4π. When 0 < t < π, the velocity is positive, so the particle is moving to the right. When π < t < 3π, the velocity is negative, so the particle is moving to the left. When 3π < t < 4π, the velocity is positive, so the particle is moving to the right. Therefore, the particle is changing direction at t = π and t = 3π.
4. The distance is 69.
In order to find the distance that the particle travels, we need to look at the position of the particle at t = 2 and at t = 5. We also need to see if the particle changes direction anywhere on the interval between the two times. If so, we will need to look at the particle's position at those "turning points" as well. The way to find out if the particle is changing direction is to look at the velocity of the particle, which we find by taking the derivative of the position function. We get  = v(t) = 6t + 2. If we set the velocity equal to zero, we get t = −, which is not in the time interval. This means that the velocity doesn't change signs, and thus the particle does not change direction. Now we look at the position of the particle on the interval. At t = 2, the particle's position is: x = 3(2)2 + 2(2) + 4 = 20. At t = 5, the particle's position is: x = 3(5)2 + 2(5) + 4 = 89. Therefore, the particle travels a distance of 69.
5. The distance is 48.
In order to find the distance that the particle travels, we need to look at the position of the particle at t = 0 and at t = 4. We also need to see if the particle changes direction anywhere on the interval between the two times. If so, we will need to look at the particle's position at those "turning points" as well. The way to find out if the particle is changing direction is to look at the velocity of the particle, which we find by taking the derivative of the position function. We get  v(t) = 2t + 8. If we set the velocity equal to zero, we get t = −4, which is not in the time interval. This means that the velocity doesn't change signs, and thus the particle does not change direction. Now we look at the position of the particle on the interval. At t = 0, the particle's position is: x = (0)2 + 8(0) = 0. At t = 4, the particle's position is: x = (4)2 + 8(4) = 48. Therefore, the particle travels a distance of 48.
6. Velocity is 0; acceleration is 0.
This should not be a surprise because 2 sin2 t + 2cos2 t = 2, so the position is a constant. This means that the particle is not moving and thus has a velocity and acceleration of 0.
7. t =  0.122
In order to find where the particle is changing direction, we need to find where the velocity of the particle changes sign. The velocity function of the particle is the derivative of the position function:  = v(t) = 3t 2 +16t − 2. Next, we set the velocity equal to zero. The solutions are: t =  and t = . We can eliminate the second solution because it is negative and we are restricted to t > 0. Next, we check the sign of the velocity on the intervals t < 0  and t > . When 0 < t < , the velocity is negative, so the particle is moving to the left. When t > , the velocity is positive, so the particle is moving to the right. Therefore, the particle is changing direction at t = .
8. The velocity is never 0, which means that it never changes signs and thus the particle does not change direction.
In order to find where the particle is changing direction, we need to find where the velocity of the particle changes signs. The velocity function of the particle is the derivative of the position function:  = v(t) = 6t2 − 12t + 12. Next, we set the velocity equal to zero. There are no real solutions. If we try a few values, we can see that the velocity is always positive. Therefore, the particle does not change direction.

We get f′(x) = eπ x (π) −  πeπ x. This can be simplified to f′(x) = πeπ x − π. You might have noticed that ln eπ x = πx, which would have made the derivative a little easier.
8. f′(x) = 
The rule for finding the derivative of y = loga u is  = , where u is a function of x. Before we find the derivative, we can use the laws of logarithms to expand the logarithm. We get f(x) = log12 x3 = 3 log12 x. Now we can find the derivative: f′(x) = .
9. f′(x) = 
The rule for finding the derivative of y = loga u is  = , and the rule for finding the derivative of y = eu is  = eu, where u is a function of x. Here we will use the Quotient Rule to find the derivative: f′(x) = . This can be simplified to f′(x) = .
10. f′(x) = 
The rule for finding the derivative of y = loga u is  = , and the rule for finding the derivative of y = au is  = au (ln a), where u is a function of x. Before we find the derivative, we can use the laws of logarithms to simplify the logarithm. We get f(x) = log103x. Now if you are alert, you will remember that log103x = 3x, so this simplifies to f(x) = 3x =  x. The derivative is simply f′(x) = .
11. f′(x) = 3e3x − 3ex (e)(ln3)
The rule for finding the derivative of y = eu is  = eu, and the rule for finding the derivative of y = au is  = au(ln a), where u is a function of x. We get f′(x) = 3e3x − 3eex(e)(ln3).
12. f′(x) = 10sin x (cos x)(ln 10)
The rule for finding the derivative of y = au is  = au(ln a), where u is a function of x. We get f′(x) = 10sin x (cos x)(ln 10).
13. f′(x) = ln 10
Before we find the derivative, we can use the laws of logarithms to simplify the logarithm. We get f(x) = ln(10x) = x ln 10. Now the derivative is simply f′(x) = ln 10.
14. f′(x) = x45x (5 + xln 5)
The rule for finding the derivative of y = au is  = au(ln a), where u is a function of x. Here we will use the Product Rule to find the derivative: f′(x) = x5 (5x ln 5) + (5x)(5x4), which simplifies to f′(x) = x45x (5 + xln 5).

1. x = y2
Recall the trigonometric identity 1 + tan2θ = sec2θ. We can rewrite this identity as tan2θ = sec2 θ − 1. Here we are given that x = sec2 t − 1 and y = tan t. Using this identity and plugging in our parametric equations, we get the equation x = y2.

3. y = x2 − 6x
Here we are given that x = 4t + 3 and y = 16t2 − 9. If we take the equation for x and isolate 4t, we get x − 3 = 4t. Next, because 4(t)2 = 16t2, we can substitute into the equation for y. We get y = (x − 3)2 − 9. This can be simplified to y = x2 − 6x.
4. y − 48 =  (x−40)
We could first come up with an equation for y in terms of x by eliminating the parameter, but this is often more time-consuming than necessary. Instead, we first find the slope of the tangent line using the formula . Taking the derivative of each equation with respect to t, we get  = 8 and  = 2t. Therefore,  =  = .

The particle's direction will be horizontal when it is moving only in the x direction. In other words, when  = 0. We take the derivative of y with respect to t:  = 3t2 − 3. If we set this equal to zero and solve, we get 3t2 − 3 = 0 and t = ±1. We can ignore the negative solution because t must be positive. Now, in order to find the coordinates of the particle, we simply plug t = 1 into the equations of the particle's position. We get x = −2(1)2 = −2 and y = (1)3 −3(1) + 9 = 7. Therefore, the particle's position is (−2, 7).

We get x = In 2 and y = (2)2 − 4(2) = −4. Therefore, the particle's position is (In 2, −4).
8. t = 
We find the horizontal and vertical components of the particle's velocity by taking the derivative of each parametric equation with respect to t. We get: x = 2 cos t and y = cos t − . If we set these equal to each other, we get cos t −  = 2 cos t, which can be simplified to cos t = − . If we solve this, we get t = . Note that there are actually an infinite number of solutions, but we are restricted to 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π.

Note that the height is exact, so when we take the derivative we will treat only the radius as a variable. We find the derivative of the volume: V′ = 2πrh. Now we can plug into the formula: dV = 2πrh dr. If we plug in r = 2.5, h = 20, and dr = 0.05, we get dV = 2π(2.5)(20)(0.05) = 5π ≈ 15.708.

1. y −4 = −(x−2)
Remember that the equation of a line through a point (x1 y1) with slope m is y − y2 = m(x − x2). We find the y-coordinate by plugging x = 2 into the equation y = , and we find the slope by plugging x = 2 into the derivative of the equation.
First, we find the y-coordinate, y1 : y = . This means that the line passes through the point (2, 4).
Next, we take the derivative:  = . Now, we can find the slope, m: . However, this is the slope of the tangent line. The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line, so its slope will be the negative reciprocal of the tangent line's slope. In this case, the slope of the normal line is  = −1. Finally, we plug in the point (2, 4) and the slope m = −1 to get the equation of the normal line: y − 4 = −(x − 2).
2. y = −3x + 4
Remember that the equation of a line through a point (x1 y1) with slope m is y − y1 = m(x − x1). We find the slope by plugging x = 0 into the derivative of the equation y = 4 − 3x − x2. First, we take the derivative:  = −3 −2x. Now, we can find the slope, m:  = −3 −3(0) = −3. Finally, we plug in the point (0, 4) and the slope m = −3 to get the equation of the tangent line: y − 4 = −3(x−0) or y = −3x + 4.
3. y = 0
Remember that the equation of a line through a point (x1 y1) with slope m is y1 = m(x − x1). We find the y-coordinate by plugging x = −2 into the equation y = (x2 + 4x + 4)2, and we find the slope by plugging x = −2 into the derivative of the equation.
First, we find the y-coordinate, y1 : y =  = 0. This means that the line passes through the point (-2, 0).
Next, we take the derivative: . Now, we can find the slope, m: (2(−2) + 4) = 0. Finally, we plug in the point (-2, 0) and the slope m = 0 to get the equation of the tangent line: y − 0 = 0(x + 2) or y = 0.

The Mean Value Theorem says that: If f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b] and is differentiable everywhere on the interval (a, b), then there exists at least one number c on the interval (a, b) such that . Here, the function is f(x) = x3 + 12x2 + 7x and the interval is [−4, 4]. Thus, the Mean Value Theorem says that f′(c) = . This simplifies to f′(c) = 23. Next, we need to find f′(c). The derivative of f(x) is f′(x) = 3x2 + 24x + 7, so f′(c) = 3c2 + 24c + 7. Now, we can solve for c: 3c2 + 24c + 7 = 23 and c = . Note that c =  is in the interval (−4, 4), but  is not in the interval. Thus, the answer is only c =  ≈ 0.62. It's very important to check that the answers you get for c fall in the given interval when doing Mean Value Theorem problems.
5. c = 
Rolle's theorem says that if f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b] and is differentiable everywhere on the interval (a, b), and if f(a) = f(b) = 0, then there exists at least one number c on the interval (a, b) such that f′(c) = 0. Here the function is f(x) = x3 − x and the interval is [−1, 1]. First, we check if the function is equal to zero at both of the endpoints: f(−1) = (−1)3 − (−1) = 0 and f(1) = (1)3 − (1) = 0. Next, we take the derivative to find f′(c): f′(x) = 3x2 − 1, so f′(c) = 3c2 − 1. Now, we can solve for c: 3c2 − 1 = 0 and c = . Note that  are both in the interval (−1, 1), just as we expected.
6. $15 billion
We simply take the derivative:  = 3x2 − 96x + 720. Now we set the derivative equal to zero: 3x2 − 96x + 720 = 0. The solutions to this are x = 12 and x = 20. Note, however, that the function is bounded by x = 0 and x = 40.

Thus, in order to find the maximum profit, we need to plug all four values of x into the profit equation to find which gives the greatest value. We get
P(0) = −1,000
P(12) = (12)3 − 48(12)2 + 720(12) − 1,000 = 2,456
P(20) = (20)3 − 48(20)2 + 720(20) − 1,000 = 2,200
P(40) = (40)3 − 48(40)2 + 720(40) − 1,000 = 15,000
Thus, even though we have a relative maximum at x = 12, the absolute maximum profit occurs when x = 40. The profit at that value is 15,000, or $15 billion dollars.
If we look at a graph of the profit function, we can see that the critical points gave us relative maximum and minimum, but not the absolute maximum or minimum. This is why it is always important to check the endpoints of a function in any max/min problem.

7. First, let's draw a picture of the situation. We will draw a circle of radius 10 centered at the origin.



Note that the figure is symmetric above and below the x-axis, so we could maximize the area above the x-axis and double the answer. The equation for a semi-circle of radius 10 is y = . The base of the rectangle has length 2x and a height of y, so the area of the rectangle is A = 2xy. Now, because y = , we can substitute into the area equation to get: A = 2x. Let's take the derivative and set it equal to zero. We get:  + 2x .
Now we solve for x:
Move the right-hand term to the other side of the equals sign: 
Cross-multiply: 2(100 − x2) = 2x2
Distribute: 200 − 2x2 = 2x2
And solve: 200 = 4x2
x =  = 5, so 2x = 10
Now we can solve for y: y = 
Therefore, the dimensions are 10 by 10.
8. Maximum at (0, 0); Minima at (2, −4) and (−2, −4); Points of inflection at  and .
First, we can easily see that the graph has x-intercepts at x = 0 and x = ± . Next, we take the derivative:  = x3 − 4x. Next, we set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points. There are three solutions: x = 0, x = 2, and x = −2.
We plug these values into the original equation to find the y-coordinates of the critical points: When x = 0, . When x = 2, . When x = −2, . Thus, we have critical points at (0, 0), (2, −4), and (−2, −4). Next, we take the second derivative to find any points of inflection. The second derivative is  = 3x2 − 4, which is equal to zero at x =  and x = − . We plug these values into the original equation to find the y-coordinates. When x = : y = . When x = − , then y = . So there are points of inflection at  and . Next, we need to determine if each critical point is a maximum, a minimum, or something else. If we plug x = 0 into the second derivative, the value is negative, so (0, 0) is a maximum. If we plug x = 2 into the second derivative, the value is positive, so (2. −4) is a minimum. If we plug x = −2 into the second derivative, the value is negative, so (−2, −4) is a minimum. Now, we can draw the curve. It looks like the following:

9. Maximum at (0, 0); Vertical asymptotes at x = 2 and x = −2; Horizontal asymptote at y = 3; No point of inflection.
First, notice that the curve goes through the origin. There are vertical asymptotes at x = 2 and x = −2. There is a horizontal asymptote at y = 3. Next, we take the derivative:  =  = . Next, we set the derivative equal to zero to find any critical points. There is a solution at x = 0, which means that there is a critical point at (0, 0). Note also that the function is positive for x < 0 and negative for x > 0, so the curve is increasing for x < 0 and decreasing for x > 0. Next, we take the second derivative:  =  = . If we set this equal to zero, we get no solution, which means that there is no point of inflection at the origin. Notice that the second derivative is positive for x < −2, negative for −2 < x < 2, and positive for x > 2. Therefore, the curve is concave up for x < −2 and x > 2, and concave down for −2 < x < 2. Next, we need to determine if each critical point is a maximum, a minimum, or something else. If we plug x = 0 into the second derivative, the value is negative, so (0, 0) is a maximum. Now, we can draw the curve. It looks like the following:

10. 3 m/s
We are given the rate at which the volume of the fluid is increasing,  = 108π and are looking for the rate at which the height of the fluid is increasing, . Thus, we need to find a way to relate the volume of a cylinder to its height. We know that the volume of a cylinder is V = πr2h. We will want to take the derivative of the equation with respect to t. Note that the radius of the tank doesn't change as the volume changes, therefore r is a constant in this problem, not a variable. We get  = πr2 . Because r is not changing,  = 0, and we would have ended up with the same derivative.
Now we can plug in  = 108π and r = 6, and solve for . We get 108π = π(6)2. Thus,  = 3 m/s.
11. 380 volts/s
We are given the rate at which the current is decreasing,  = −4, and the rate at which the resistance is increasing,  = 20, and are looking for the rate at which the voltage is changing. We are also given an equation that relates the three variables: V = IR. So, we simply take the derivative of the equation with respect to t (Product Rule!): . Now we can use our equation to find R, which we will need to plug into the derivative equation: 100 = 20R, so R = 5. Next, we plug  = −4,  = 20, I = 20, and R = 5 into the derivative equation:  = (20)(20) + (5)(−4) = 380 volts/s.
12. t = 3
In order to find where the particle is changing direction, we need to find where the velocity of the particle changes sign. The velocity function of the particle is the derivative of the position function:  = v(t) =  =  Next, we set the velocity equal to zero. The solutions are: t = ±3. We can ignore the negative solution because t must be positive. Next, we check the sign of the velocity on either side of t = 3. When 0 < t < 3, the velocity is positive, so the particle is moving to the right. When t < 3, the velocity is negative, so the particle is moving to the left. Therefore, the particle is changing direction at t = 3.
13. Distance is 2 + sin2 4 ≈ 2.573
In order to find the distance that the particle travels, we need to look at the position of the particle at t = 0 and at t = 2. We also need to see if the particle changes direction anywhere on the interval between the two times. If so, we will need to look at the particle's position at those "turning points" as well. The way to find out if the particle is changing direction is to look at the velocity of the particle, which we find by taking the derivative of the position function. We get  = v(t) = 4 sin(2t) cos(2t). If we set the velocity equal to zero, we get t =  and t = . Actually, there are an infinite number of solutions, but remember that we are restricted to 0 < t < 2. Next, we check the sign of the velocity on the intervals 0 < t < ,  < t < , and  < t < 2. When 0 < t < , the velocity is positive, so the particle is moving to the right. When  < t < , the velocity is negative, so the particle is moving to the left. When  < t < 2, the velocity is positive, so the particle is moving to the right. Now we look at the position of the particle on the interval. At t = 0, the particle's position is: x = sin2(0) = 0. At t = , the particle's position is x = sin2  = 1. At t = , the particle's position is: x = sin2 (π) = 0. And at t = 2, the particle's position is x = sin2 (4). Therefore, the particle travels a distance of 1 on the interval 0 < t < , a distance of 1 in the other direction on the interval  < t < , and a distance of sin2 (4) on the interval  < t < 2. Therefore, the total distance that the particle travels is 2 + sin2 4 ≈ 2.573.

This can be simplified to f′(x) = .

Or, if you are permitted, use your calculator. Remember that the AP exam won't give you a problem where it is very difficult to solve for the inverse value of y. If the algebra looks difficult, look for an obvious solution, such as x = 0 or x = 1 or x = −1.
Now we can use the formula for the derivative of the inverse of f(x) : , where f(a) = c. This formula means that we find the derivative of the inverse of a function at a value a by taking the reciprocal of the derivative and plugging in the value of x that makes y equal to a.

21. 997
Recall the differential formula that we use for approximating the value of a function: f(x + ∆x) ≈ f(x) + f′(x)∆x. Here we want to approximate the value of (9.99)3, so we'll use f(x) = x3 with x = 10 and ∆x = −0.01. First, we need to find f′(x): f′(x) = 3x2. Now, we plug into the formula: f(x + ∆x) ≈ x3 + 3x2∆x. If we plug in x = 10 and ∆x = −0.01, we get (10 − 0.01)3 ≈ (10)3 + 3(10)2(−0.01). If we evaluate this, we get (9.99)3 ≈ 1,000 + 3(10)2(−0.01) = 997.
22. −1.732 cm2
Recall the formula that we use when we want to approximate the error in a measurement: dy = f′(x) dx. Here we want to approximate the decrease in the area of an equilateral triangle when we know that it has a side of length 10 cm with a decrease of 0.2 cm, where A(x) =  (the area of an equilateral triangle of side x) with dx = −0.2. We find the derivative of the area: A′(x) = . Now we can plug into the formula: dA =  dx. If we plug in x = 10 and dx = −0.2, we get dA =  (−0.2) = − ≈ −1.732.

6. 20,000 (approximately)
The phrase "exponential growth" means that we can represent the situation with the differential equation  = ky, where k is a constant and y is the population at a time t. Here we are also told that y = 4,000 at t = 0 and y = 6,500 at t = 3. We solve this differential equation by separation of variables. We want to get all of the y variables on one side of the equals sign and all of the t variables on the other side. We can do this easily by dividing both sides by y and multiplying both sides by dt. We get  = k dt. Next, we integrate both sides.
∫ = ∫k dt
ln y = kt + C0
y = Cekt
Next, we plug in y = 4,000 and t = 0 to solve for C.
4,000 = Ce0
C = 4,000
Now, we have y = 4,000ekt. Next, we plug in y = 6,500 and t = 3 to solve for k.
6,500 = 4,000e3k
k =  ln  ≈ 0.162
Therefore, our equation for the population of bacteria, y, at time, t, is y ≈ 4,000e0.162t, or if we want an exact solution, it is y = 4,000 . Finally, we can solve for the population at time t = 10: y ≈ 4,000e0.162(10) ≈ 20,212 or y = 4,000 ≈ 20,179. (Notice how even with an "exact" solution, we still have to round the answer.

Because acceleration is the derivative of velocity, we can write  = − 9. We are also told that v = 18 and h = 45 when t = 0. We solve this differential equation by separation of variables. We want to get all of the v variables on one side of the equals sign and all of the t variables on the other side. We can do this easily by multiplying both sides by dt: dv = −9 dt. Next, we integrate both sides:
∫dv = ∫−9 dt
v = −9 + C0
Now we can solve for C0 by plugging in v = 18 and t = 0: 18 = −9(0) + C0 so C0 = 18. Thus, our equation for the velocity of the rock is v = −9t + 18. Next, because the height of the rock is the derivative of the velocity, we can write  = −9t + 18. We again separate the variables by multiplying both sides by dt: dh = (−9t + 18) dt. We integrate both sides:
∫dh = ∫(−9t + 18) dt
h = −  + 18t + C1
Next, we plug in h = 45 and t = 0 to solve for C1.
45 = − + 18(0) C1, so C1 = 45
Therefore, the equation for the height of the rock, h, at time, t, is h = −  + 18t + 45.
Finally, we can solve for the height of the rock at time t = 4: h = −  + 18t + 45, so h = −  + 18(4) + 45 = 45 m.

ln m = -kt + C0
m = Ce-kt
Now we can solve for C by plugging in m = 10,000 and t = 0: 10,000 = Ce0, so C = 10,000. This gives us the equation m = 10,000e-kt. Next, we can solve for k by plugging in m = 5,000 and t = 5,750.
5,000 = 10,000e−5,750k
 = e−5,750k
− ln  = k ≈ 0.000121
Therefore, the equation for the mass of the element, m, at time, t, is m ≈ 10,000e−.000121t, or if we want an exact solution, it is m = 10,000.
Finally, we can solve for the mass of the element at time t = 1,000: m ≈ 10,000e−.000121(1,000) ≈ 8,860 gms or m = 10,000 ≈ 8,864 gms. (And, if we are concerned with significant figures, the mass can be written as 8,900.)

UNIT 4 DRILL ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS

1. 
We find the area of a region bounded by f(x) above and g(x) below at all points of the interval [a, b] using the formula [f(x) − g(x)]dx. Here f(x) = x3 and g(x) = 3x2 − 4.
First, let's make a sketch of the region.

Next, we need to find where the two curves intersect, which will be the endpoints of the region. We do this by setting the two curves equal to each other. We get 3x2 − 4 = x3. The solutions are (−1, −1) and (2, 8). Therefore, in order to find the area of the region, we need to evaluate the integral  (x3 − (3x2 − 4))dx =  (x3 − 3x2 + 4)dx. We get  (x3 − 3x2 + 4)dx =  =  − .
2. 
We find the area of a region bounded by f(y) on the right and g(y) on the left at all points of the interval [c, d] using the formula [f(y) − g(y)]dy. Here f(y) = y3 − y2 and g(y) = 2y.
First, let's make a sketch of the region.

Next, we need to find where the two curves intersect, which will be the endpoints of the region. We do this by setting the two curves equal to each other. We get y3 − y2 = 2y. The solutions are (4, 2), (0, 0), and (−2, −1). Notice that in the region from y = −1 to y = 0, the right curve is f(y) = y3 − y2 and the left curve is g(y) = 2y, but from y = 0 to y = 2 the situation is reversed, so the right curve is f(y) = 2y and the left curve is g(y) = y3 − y2. Thus, we split the region into two pieces and find the area by evaluating two integrals and adding the answers:  (y3 − y2 − 2y)dy and (2y −(y3 − y2))dy = (2y − y3 + y2)dy We get  (y3 − y2 − 2y)dy =  = 0 −  and (2y − y3 + y2)dy = . Therefore, the area of the region is .
3. 
When the region we are revolving is defined between a curve f(x) and g(x), we can find the volume using cylindrical shells. We use the formula V = 2π x[f(x) − g(x)]dx. Here we have a region between f(x) = x3 and the line x = 2 that we are revolving around the line x = 2. If we use vertical slices, then we will need to use cylindrical shells to find the volume. If we use horizontal slices, then we will need to use washers to find the volume. Here we will use cylindrical shells. (Try doing it yourself using washers. You should get the same answer but it is much harder!) First, we need to find the endpoints of the region. We get the left endpoint by setting f(x) = x3 equal to zero and solving for x. We get x = 0. The right endpoint is simply x = 2. Next, note that we are not revolving around the x-axis but around the line x = 2. Thus, the radius of each shell is not x but rather 2 − x. The height of each shell is simply f(x) − g(x) = x3 − 0 = x3. Therefore, we will find the volume by evaluating 2π[(2 − x)(x3)]dx = 2π(2x3 − x4)dx. We get 2π(2x3 − x4)dx = 2π.
4. 
When the region we are revolving is defined between a curve f(x) and g(x), we can find the volume using cylindrical shells. We use the formula V = 2π x[f(x) − g(x)]dx. Here we have f(x) = 2 (which we get by solving y2 = 8x for y and taking the top half above the x-axis) and g(x) = −2 (the bottom half). Thus, the height of each shell is f(x) − g(x) = 4. We can easily see that the left endpoint is x = 0 and that the right endpoint is x = 2. Next, note that we are not revolving around the x-axis but around the line x = 4. Thus, the radius of each shell is not x but rather 4 − x. Therefore, we will find the volume by evaluating: 2π[(4 − x)4]dx = 8π dx. We get 8π dx = 8π = .
5. y = 
We solve this differential equation by separation of variables. We want to get all of the y variables on one side of the equals sign and all of the x variables on the other side. First, we factor the y out of the denominator of the right hand expression: . Next, we multiply both sides by y and by dx. We get y dy = . Next, we integrate both sides.
 y dy = 
 = tan−1 x + C
Now we isolate y: y2 = 2tan−1 x + C.
y = 
Now we solve for C. We plug in x = 0 and y = 2.
2 = 
C = 4
Therefore, the equation is y = .
6.  ≈ 1,800 ft3
We can express this situation with the differential equation  = kV where k is a constant and V is the volume of the sphere at time t. We are also told that V = 36π when t = 0 and V = 90π when t = 1. We solve this differential equation by separation of variables. We want to get all of the V variables on one side of the equals sign and all of the t variables on the other side. We can do this easily by dividing both sides by V and multiplying both sides by dt. We get  = k dt. Next, we integrate both sides.
 k dt
ln V = kt + C0
V = Cekt
Next, we plug in V = 36π and t = 0 to solve for C: 36π = Ce0 so C = 36π. This gives us the equation V = 36πekt. Next, we plug in V = 90π and t = 1 to solve for k: 90π = 36πek.
k = ln ≈ 0.916
Therefore, the equation for the volume of the sphere, V, at time, t, is V ≈ 36πe0.916t, or if we want an exact solution, it is V = 36π. Finally, we can solve for the volume at time t = 3: V ≈ 36πe0.916(3) ≈ 1,766 ft3 or V = ft3. (And, if we are concerned with significant figures, the volume can be written as 1,800.)

8. 
Recall that, if a curve is defined parametrically, in terms of t, from t = a to t = b, its length is found by evaluating:  dt. Here we have x = cos t and y = sin t from t =  to t = . First, we need to find the derivatives:  = −sin t and  = cos t. Now, we plug this into the formula for the length:  dt. Next, we use the trigonometric identity sin2 t + cos2 t = 1 to rewrite the integrand:  dt = .
9. −ln|x + 1| + ln(x2 + 2) + tan−1  + C
We need to find A and Bx + C such that  = .
We multiply through by (x + 1)(x2 + 2): A(x2 + 2) + (Bx + C)(x + 1) = 2x + 1.
Expand all of the terms: Ax2 + 2A + Bx2 + Bx + Cx + C = 2x + 1.
Group the terms on the left side: (A + B)x2 + (B + C)x + (2A + C) = 2x + 1.
Now we have three equations: A + B = 0, B + C = 2, and 2A + C = 1.
If we solve for A, B, and C, we get A = −, B = , and C = .
This means that we can rewrite the integral as
 =  + 
If we integrate these, we get −ln|x + 1| + ln(x2 + 2) + tan−1  + C. If you had trouble with these integrals, you should review the sections on logarithmic and trigonometric integrals.
10. Diverges
We can't evaluate an integral where a limit of integration is infinity. We remedy this by replacing the lower limit with a and taking the limit of the integral as a approaches −∞. But we have a second problem: tan is also undefined. We remedy this by replacing the upper limit with b and taking the limit of the integral as b approaches . And we overcome the difficulty of the two limits by splitting the integral into two parts at a value where we know that we can integrate and take each limit separately. A simple place to split the integral is at x = 0. We get tan θ dθ = tan θ dθ + tan θ dθ. Now we evaluate the integrals:
tan θ dθ = (−ln|cos θ|) = ln|cos a| and tan θ dθ = (−ln|cos θ|) = −ln|cos b|.
Finally, we take the limits:  ln|cos a| = D.N.E. and  − ln|cos b| = D.N.E. Neither limit exists, so the integral diverges. As a general rule, a trigonometric integral (but not an inverse trig one) is going to diverge if one of the limits of integration is infinite.
11. Diverges
We can't evaluate an integral where a limit of integration is infinity. We remedy this by replacing the limit with a and taking the limit of the integral as a approaches ∞. We also need to split the integral into two parts where it is defined at one of the limits. A simple place to split the integral is at x = 0. We get  x3 dx =  x3 dx +  x3 dx. Now we evaluate the integrals:

Now we take the limits:  = −∞ and  = ∞. Therefore, the integral diverges. This is a tricky integral. Notice that if the limits of integration were finite and equal to each other, we would always get zero. It is easy to see this if we graph the function y = x3, and look at the areas on each side of the y-axis. They will always cancel each other because of symmetry.

Thus, we would think that the integral will always be zero. But, because the limits of integration are infinite, the areas are infinite and we would be adding infinities, which do not necessarily cancel. In other words, the area from zero to infinity is infinite and the area from zero to minus infinity is infinite. We can't add two infinite quantities and get a finite one. Therefore, the integral is meaningless.
12. 
Recall that the formula for the area between the two curves r1 = f1(θ) and r2 = f2(θ), with 0 ≤ r1(θ) ≤ r2(θ) from θ = a to θ = b is A =  dθ. Here we have r2 = 2cosθ and r1 = 1. First, let's graph the curves.

If we solve for the intersection of the two curves, we find that the region runs from θ = − to θ = . Plugging into the formula, we get A = [(2cos θ)2 − 12]dθ = (4cos2 θ − 1)dθ = (2cos2 θ)dθ −  dθ. The first integral requires us to use the trigonometric substitution cos2 θ =  (see this page): 2cos2 θ dθ = 2 dθ = (1 + cos 2θ)dθ = . The second integral is simply . Therefore, the area is .

The interval of convergence of a series refers to those values of x where the series converges. A geometric series converges when the common ratio of its terms is −1 < r < 1. Here we have the series 3nxn = (3x)n, so the common ratio is 3x. To find the interval of convergence, all we have to do is set −1 < 3x < 1 and solve for x. We get − < x < . Thus the interval of convergence is . The radius of convergence is simply the distance from the center of the interval to either endpoint, or half the width of the interval. In this case, the radius of convergence is .

There are a variety of tests for convergence of a series. If a series is not alternating and is not geometric, we usually look to see if we can use a Comparison Test, a Ratio Test, or an Integral Test. We can easily integrate this integral using u-substitution, so we will use the Integral Test. Here the series is , so we need to see if converges. First, we replace the upper limit with a and take the limit as a goes to infinity. We get  Next, if we let u = ln x, then du = dx. Substituting into the integrand, we get . Substituting back, we get (ln|lnx|) = ln (lna) − ln(ln2). Finally, we take the limit: [ln(lna) − ln(ln2)] = D.N.E. Therefore, the series diverges by the Integral Test.

We can easily integrate this integral, so we will use the Integral Test. Here the series is , so we need to see if  converges. First, we replace the upper limit with a and take the limit as a goes to infinity. We get . Next, we integrate:  = . Now, we take the limit: . Therefore, the series converges by the Integral Test.

About Guessing
Many candidates wonder whether or not to guess the answers to questions about which they are not certain. Multiple choice scores are based on the number of questions answered correctly. Points are not deducted for incorrect answers, and no points are awarded for unanswered questions. Because points are not deducted for incorrect answers, you are encouraged to answer all multiple-choice questions. On any questions you do not know the answer to, you should eliminate as many choices as you can, and then select the best answer among the remaining choices.

ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS TO SECTION I

1. C We need to use implicit differentiation to find .


2x + 2x + 2y + 6y = 0

Now, if we wanted to solve for  in terms of x and y, we would have to do some algebra to isolate . But, because we are asked to solve for  at a specific value of x, we don't need to simplify. We need to find the x-coordinate that corresponds to the y-coordinate y = 1. We plug y = 1 into the equation and solve for x.
x2 + 2x(1) + 3(1)2 = 2
x2 + 2x + 3 = 2
x2 + 2x + 1 = 0
(x + 1)2 = 0
x = −1
Finally, we plug x = −1 and y = 1 into the derivative, and we get

2(−1) + 2(−1) + 2(1) + 6(1) = 0


−2 − 2 + 2 + 6 = 0


 = 0

2. B We can use u-substitution to evaluate the integral.
Let u = x2 and du = 2x dx. Then  du = x dx.
Now we substitute into the integral  eu du, leaving out the limits of integration for the moment.
Evaluate the integral to get  eu du =  eu.
Now we substitute back to get  ex2.
Finally, we evaluate at the limits of integration, and we get .
3. B If we have a pair of parametric equations, x(t) and y(t), then  = .
Here we get  = −2t sin(t2) and  = 2t.
Then  = .
4. B If we want to find the minimum, we take the derivative and find where the derivative is zero.

f′(x) = 12x2 − 16x

Next, we set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x, in order to find the critical values.

12x2 − 16x = 0
4x(3x − 4) = 0
x = 0 or x = 

Next, we can use the second derivative test to determine which critical value is a minimum and which is a maximum.
Remember the second derivative test: If the sign of the second derivative at a critical value is positive, then the curve has a local minimum there. If the sign of the second derivative is negative, then the curve has a local maximum there.
We take the second derivative: f′(x) = 24x − 16.
This is negative at x = 0 and positive at x = . This means that the curve has a relative minimum at x = , but this value is outside of the interval [−1, 1]. So, in order to find where it has an absolute minimum, we plug the endpoints of the interval into the original equation, and the smaller value will be the answer.
At x = −1, the value is f (−1) = −11. At x = 1, the value is f (1) = −3.
5. A Whenever we have an integrand that is a rational expression, we can often use the method of partial fractions to rewrite the integral in a form in which it's easy to evaluate.
First, separate the denominator into its two components and place the constants A and B in the numerators of the fractions and the components into the denominators. Set their sum equal to the original rational expression.

Now, we want to solve for the constants A and B. First, multiply through by (x + 3)(x + 2) to clear the denominators.

(x + 3)(x + 2) = x


A(x + 2) + B(x + 3) = x

Now, distribute, then group, the terms on the left side.

Ax + 2A + Bx + 3B = x


Ax + Bx + 2A + 3B = x


(A + B)x + (2A + 3B) = x

In order for this last equation to be true, we need A + B = 1 and 2A + 3B = 0.
If we solve these simultaneous equations, we get A = 3 and B = −2.
Now that we have done the partial fraction decomposition, we can rewrite the original integral as  dx. This is now simple to evaluate.

Using the rules of logarithms, the answer can be rewritten as .
6. D Here we need to use the Product Rule, which is: If f(x) = uv, where u and v are both functions of x, then f′(x) = .
We get  (x2sin2 x) = 2xsin2 x + x2 (2sin x cos x).
This can be simplified to 2xsin2 x + x2sin 2x.
7. B The normal line to a curve at a point is perpendicular to the tangent line at the same point. Thus, the slope of the normal line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line. We find the slope of the tangent line by finding the derivative and evaluating it at the point.
We need to use the Quotient Rule, which is:
Given y = , then:  = .
Here, we have  = .
Next, plug in x = 2 and solve  = .
Therefore, the slope of the normal line is −.
8. A First, let's break up the integrand:  = .
The first integral is one that you should have memorized: .
We can do the second integral using u-substitution. We let u = 1−x2 and du = −2x dx.
Now we substitute and we get: .
Integrate: . Now we just have to substitute back: −, and combine the two results: sin−1 x −  + C.
9. D Here we want to examine the slopes of various pieces of the graph of f(x). Notice that the graph starts with a slope of approximately zero and has a negative slope from x = -∞ to x = −2, where the slope is -∞. Thus, we are looking for a graph of f′(x) that is negative from x = -∞ to x = −2 and undefined at x = −2. Next, notice that the graph of f(x) has a positive slope from x = −2 to x = 2 and that the slope shrinks from ∞ to approximately one and then grows to ∞. Thus, we are looking for a graph of f′(x) that is positive from x = −2 to x = 2 and approximately equal to one at x = 0. Finally, notice that the graph of f(x) has a negative slope from x = 2 to x = ∞, where the slope starts at -∞ and grows to approximately zero. Thus, we are looking for a graph of f′(x) that is negative from x = 2 to x = ∞, where it is approximately zero. Graph (D) satisfies all of these requirements.
10. D We can integrate this using Integration by Parts. We let and u = ln x and dv = xdx. Then du =  dx and v = . We plug them into the formula and we get:  (we will ignore the limits of integration until we are done integrating). This simplifies to  = .
We integrate again: . Now we evaluate this using the limits of integration. We get:  =  = 
11. A Whenever we have an integral of the form , where a is a constant, the integral is going to be an inverse tangent. So let's put the integrand into the desired form. Also, we're going to ignore the limits of integration until after we have done the antidifferentiation.
First, divide the numerator and the denominator by 16: .
Next, we do u-substitution. Let u =  and du =  or 4 du = dx.
Substitute into the integrand:  = .
Evaluate the integral: .
Substitute back to get .
Now, we can evaluate the function at the limits of integration:

12. B If we want to find the equation of the tangent line, we first need to find the y-coordinate that corresponds to x = . It is y = sin2.
Next, we need to find the derivative of the curve at x = , using the Chain Rule.
We get  = 2sin x cos x. At x = ,  =  = 1.
Now, we have the slope of the tangent line and a point that it goes through. We can use the point-slope formula for the equation of a line, (y − y1) = m(x − x1), and plug in what we have just found. We get .
13. B First, let's factor cos2 x out of the integrand to get: sin5 xcos2 xcos x dx. Next, replace cos2 x with 1 − sinx2 to get:  u5 (1 − u2) du =  u5 -u7 du.
Integrate:  u5 -u7 du =  + C. And substitute back:  + C.
14. C This is an improper integral. We first rewrite the integral as: . Now we can integrate:  = . Now we evaluate the integral at the limits:  =  and take the limit: .
15. C First, try plugging x = −8 into f(x) = .
We get f(x) = . This does NOT necessarily mean that the limit does not exist. When we get a limit of the form , we first try to simplify the function by factoring and canceling like terms. Here we get

f(x) =  = 

Now, if we plug in x = −8, we get f(x) = .
16. B The Taylor series for ex about x = 0 is ex = 1 + x + 
Here, we simply substitute 3 for x in the series, and we get

17. D Because the derivative of velocity with respect to time is acceleration, we have
v(t) =  −10 dt = − 10t + C
Now we can plug in the initial condition to solve for the constant.
50 = −10(0) + C
C = 50              
Therefore, the velocity function is v(t) = −10t + 50.
Note that the velocity is zero at t = 5.
Next, because the derivative of position with respect to time is velocity, we have

s(t) = (-10t + 50) dt = − 5t2 + 50t + C

Now, we can plug in the initial condition to solve for the constant.
100 = −5(0)2 + 50(0) + C
C = 100
Therefore, the position function is s(t) = −5t2 + 50t + 100.
The maximum height occurs when the velocity is zero, so we plug t = 5 into the position function to get s(5) = −5(5)2 + 50(5) + 100 = 225.
18. D This is the geometric series . The sum of an infinite series of the form  is . Here, the sum is .
19. A Use the Ratio Test to determine the interval of convergence.
We get   =   = .
This converges if  < 1 or −1 <  < 1 and diverges if  > 1.
Thus, the series converges when −2 < x < 8.
Now we need to test whether the series converges at the endpoints of this interval.
When x = 8, we get the series , which converges, and when x = −2, we get the alternating series , which also converges. Thus, the series converges when −2 ≤ x ≤ 8.
20. B First, let's graph the curve.

Let's find the area of the loop in the first quadrant, which is the interval from θ = 0 to θ = . We find the area of a polar graph by evaluating A =  r2 dθ.
Thus, we need to evaluate: A = sin2 (2θ) dθ.
Next, we need to do a trigonometric substitution to evaluate this integral. Recall that cos 2θ = 1 − 2sin2 θ. We can rearrange this to obtain sin2 θ = , or in this case, sin2 2θ = .
Thus, we can rewrite the integral: A =  dθ.
Now we can evaluate this integral.

Now we evaluate the integral at the limits of integration.

21. B In order to find the average value, we use the Mean Value Theorem for integrals, which says that the average value of f(x) on the interval [a, b] is  f(x) dx.
Here we have .
Next, recall that:  = tan x = sec2 x.
We evaluate the integral:  =  = .
Next, we need to do a little algebra. Get a common denominator for each of the two expressions.

We can simplify this to  = .
22. A We can find the length of a parametric curve on the interval [a, b] by evaluating the integral.

First, we take the derivatives:  = t and  = .
Now, square the derivatives:  = t2 and  = 6t + 9.
Now, we plug this into the formula, and we get

23. C A function is decreasing on an interval where the derivative is negative.
The derivative is f′(x) = 4x3 + 12x2.
Next, we want to determine on which intervals the derivative of the function is positive and on which it is negative. We do this by finding where the derivative is zero.

4x3 + 12x2 = 0
4x2(x + 3) = 0
x = −3 or x = 0

We can test where the derivative is positive and negative by picking a point in each of the three regions -∞ < x < −3, −3 < x < 0, and 0 < x < ∞, plugging the point into the derivative, and seeing what the sign of the answer is. You should find that the derivative is negative on the interval -∞ < x < −3.
24. C Let's take a look at each series (the series are duplicated below).
I.          II.           III.    
Series I: You might recognize this as the alternating harmonic series, which converges. If you don't, use the alternating series test, which says, in order for an alternating series  an to converge: (1) an+1 < an; (2)  an = 0; and (3) an > 0. This series satisfies these conditions, so it converges.
Series II: We can rewrite this series as , which is a p-series. A p-series is a series of the form , which converges if p > 1 and diverges if p < 1. Thus, this series converges.
Series III: We can rewrite this series as , which is also a p-series. Because p < 1, this series diverges.
25. A We can solve this differential equation by separation of variables.



The integral on the right is trivial. We get t + C.
The one on the left will require the Method of Partial Fractions. First, separate the denominator into its two components and place the constants A and B in the numerators of the fractions and the components into the denominators. Set their sum equal to the original rational expression:
 = 
Now, we want to solve for the constants A and B. First, multiply through by  to clear the denominators.

Now, distribute, then group, the terms on the left side.

4A − A  + Bz = 1


In order for this last equation to be true, we need 4A = 1 and B −  = 0.
If we solve these simultaneous equations, we get A =  and B = .
Now that we have done the partial fraction decomposition, we can rewrite the original integral as . This is now simple to evaluate.

We can rewrite this with the laws of logarithms to get

Thus, the solution to the differential equation is  = t + C. We will need to do some algebra to rearrange the equation. First, exponentiate both sides to base e.

Then, because et+C = eteC, and because eC is a constant, we get  = Cet.
Next, raise both sides to the fourth power:  = Ce4t.
Invert both sides:  = Ce−4t.
Break the left side into two fractions:  = Ce−4t.
Add  to both sides: .
Invert both sides (again): .
Finally: z(t) =  (Whew!).
Now, we can take the limit:  = 400.
26. C

Notice that the slope of the differential equation is zero (horizontal tangent) at the origin. This eliminates (A) and (B) because they are undefined at the origin (so they would show a vertical tangent there). Finally, notice that the slope is negative at (0, 1), which eliminates (D), which is positive there.
27. D The Mean Value Theorem for derivatives says that, given a function f(x) which is continuous and differentiable on [a, b], then there exists some value c on (a, b) where

Here, we have  =  =  = 19.
Plus, f′(c) = 3c2 − 6, so we simply set 3c2 − 6 = 19. If we solve for c, we get c = ± . Both of these values satisfy the Mean Value Theorem for derivatives, but only the positive value, c = , is in the interval.
28. D If we want to find where g(x) is a minimum, we can look at g′(x). The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us how to find the derivative of an integral:  f(t) dt = f(x), where c is a constant. Thus, g′(x) = f(x). The graph of f is zero at x = 0, x = 2, and x = 4. We can eliminate x = 0 because we are looking for a positive value of x. Next, notice that f is negative to the left of x = 4 and positive to the right of x = 4. Thus, g(x) has a minimum at x = 4.
We also could have found the answer geometrically. The function g(x) =  f(t) dt is called an accumulation function and stands for the area between the curve and the x-axis to the point x. Thus, the value of g grows from x = 0 to x = 2. Then, because we subtract the area under the x-axis from the area above it, the value of g shrinks from x = 2 to x = 4. The value begins to grow again after x = 4.
29. D First, break up the integrand into ∫ sec4 x dx = ∫ sec2 x sec2 xdx. Next, use the trig identity 1 + tan2 x = sec2 x to rewrite the integrand: ∫ sec2 x sec2 xdx = ∫(1 + tan2 x) sec2 xdx.
Now we can use u-substitution. Let and u = tan x and du = sec2 xdx.
We get: ∫(1 + tan2 x) sec2 xdx = ∫ (1 + u2) du.
Integrate: ∫ (1 + u2) du = u +  + C. And substitute back: tan x +  + C.
30. A The acceleration vector is the second derivative of the position vector (the velocity vector is the first derivative).
The velocity vector of this particle is (2cos 2t, 2sin t cos t).
This can be simplified to (2cos 2t, sin 2t).
The acceleration vector is: (−4sin 2t, 2cos 2t)
31. A The slope of the tangent line is the derivative of the function. We get f′(x) = 3e3x. Now we set the derivative equal to 2 and solve for x.

3e3x = 2


e3x = 


3x = ln


x =  ln  ≈ −0.135

(Remember to round all answers to three decimal places on the AP exam.)
32. B The formula for the perimeter of a square is P = 4s, where s is the length of a side of the square.
If we differentiate this with respect to t, we get . We plug in  = 0.4, and we get  = 4(0.4) = 1.6.
The formula for the area of a square is A = s2. If we solve the perimeter equation for s in terms of P and substitute it into the area equation, we get

s = , so A = .

If we differentiate this with respect to t, we get .
Now we plug in  = 1.6 and we get (1.6) = 0.2P.
33. A The velocity of the mass is the first derivative of the height: v(t) = 8 sin(2t).
Now graph the equation to find how many times the graph of v(t) crosses the t-axis between t = 0 and t = 2. Or you should know that this is a sine graph with an amplitude of 8 and a period of π, which will cross the t-axis once on the interval at t = .
34. C Notice how this limit takes the form of the definition of the derivative, which is

Here, if we think of f(x) as tan−1 x, then this expression gives the derivative of tan−1 x at the point x = 1.
The derivative of tan−1 x is f′(x) = . At x = 1, we get

f′(1) = 

35. B The Trapezoid Rule enables us to approximate the area under a curve with a fair degree of accuracy. The rule says that the area between the x-axis and the curve y = f(x), on the interval [a, b], with n trapezoids, is

[y0 + 2y1 + 2y2 + 2y3 +...+ 2yn−1 + yn]

Using the rule here, with n = 4, a = 0, and b = 3, we get

36. C Use implicit differentiation to find  : x2 + 2xy + 2x = 2y.
Now we want to isolate , which will take some algebra.
First, put all of the terms containing  on one side of the equals sign and all of the other terms on the other side: 2xy + 2x = .
Next, factor  out of the right hand side: 2xy + 2x =  (2y − x2).
Finally, divide both sides by (2y − x2) to isolate 
At (1, 1), we get  = 4.
Now, we can find the second derivative by again performing implicit differentiation.

At (1, 1), we get  =  =  = − 12.
37. C Because the integral of a function can be interpreted as the area between the function and the curve, we can say that  f(x) dx =  f(x) dx +  f(x) dx, where c is a point in the interval [a, b]. Here we have  f(x) dx =  f(x) dx +  f(x) dx. We can rearrange this to:  f(x) dx −  f(x) dx =  f(x) dx. This means that a − b =  f(x) dx. Finally, we know that  f(x) dx = −  f(x) dx, so b − a =  f(x) dx.
38. B Remember that  (x) dx +  (x) dx =  (x) dx. We can use that here:  (x) dx +  (x) dx =  (x) dx. Now simply substitute the values for the respective integrals:  (x) dx + 20 = 24. Therefore,  (x) dx = 4.
39. A We are given that sin x = x −  +...
Here, we simply substitute 0.4 for x in the series, and we get

sin 0.4 = 0.4 −  +...

Find the value on your calculator. Keep adding terms until you get four decimal places of accuracy. You should get: sin(0.4) = 0.3894. If you got only 0.3893, you didn't use enough terms (you need to use the fifth power term).
40. D First, we graph the curves.

We can find the volume by taking a vertical slice of the region. The formula for the volume of a solid of revolution around the y-axis, using a vertical slice bounded from above by the curve f(x) and from below by g(x), on the interval [a, b], is

π[f(x)2 − g(x)2] dx

The upper curve is y = e-x, and the lower curve is y = sin x.
Next, we need to find the point(s) of intersection of the two curves with a calculator (Good luck doing it by hand!), which we do by setting them equal to each other and solving for x. You should get approximately: x = 0.589 (remember to round to three decimal places on the AP exam).
Thus, the limits of integration are x = 0 and x = 0.589.
Now, we evaluate the integral.

π[(e−x)2 − (sin2 x)] dx = π[e−2x − sin2 x] dx

We can evaluate this integral by hand but, because we will need a calculator to find the answer, we might as well use it to evaluate the integral.
We get π (e‒2x − sin2 x) dx = 0.888 (rounded to three decimal places).
41. C We can use Euler's Method to find an approximate answer to the differential equation. The method is quite simple. First, we need a starting point, (x0, y0) and an initial slope, y′0. Next, we use increments of h to come up with approximations. Each new approximation will use the following rules:

xn = xn − 1 + h


yn = yn − 1 + h • y′n − 1


Repeat for n = 1, 2, 3,...

We are given that the curve goes through the point (2, 6). We will call the coordinates of this point x0 = 2 and y0 = 6. The slope is found by plugging these coordinates into y′ = 2y − 4x, so we have an initial slope of y′0 = 4.
Now, we need to find the next set of points.
Step 1: Increase x0 by h to get x1: x1 = 2.2.
Step 2: Multiply h by y′0 and add to y0 to get y1: y1 = 6 + 0.2(4) = 6.8.
Step 3: Find y′1 by plugging x1 and y1 into the equation for y′.

y′1 = 2(6.8) − 4(2.2) = 4.8

Repeat until we get to the desired point (in this case x = 3).
Step 1: Increase x1 by h to get x2: x2 = 2.4.
Step 2: Multiply h by y′1 and add to y1 to get y2: y2 = 6.8 + 0.2(4.8) = 7.76.
Step 3: Find y′2 by plugging x2 and y2 into the equation for y′.

y′2 = 2(7.76) − 4(2.4) = 5.92

Step 1: x3 = x2 + h: x3 = 2.6
Step 2: y3 = y2 + h(y′2): y3 = 7.76 + 0.2(5.92) = 8.944
Step 3: y′3 = 2(y3) − 4(x3): y′3 = 2(8.944) − 4(2.6) = 7.488
Step 1: x4 = x3 + h: x4 = 2.8
Step 2: y4 = y3 + h(y′3): y4 = 8.944 + 0.2(7.488) = 10.4416
Step 3: y′4 = 2(y4) − 4(x4): y′4 = 2(10.4416) − 4(2.8) = 9.6832
Step 1: x5 = x4 + h: x5 = 3
Step 2: y5 = y4 + h(): y5 = 10.4416 + 0.2(9.6832) = 12.378
42. B First, break up the integrand: ∫ sec4 x dx = ∫ (sec2 x)(sec2 x) dx.
Next, use the trig identity 1 + tan2 x = sec2 x to rewrite the integral.

∫(sec2 x)(sec2 x) dx = ∫ (1 + tan2 x)(sec2 x) dx = ∫sec2 x + (sec2 x)(tan2 x) dx

We can evaluate these integrals separately.
The left one is easy: ∫sec2 x dx = tan x + C.
We will use u-substitution for the right one. Let u = tan x and du = sec2 x dx. Then, substitute into the integral and integrate: ∫ sec2 x tan2 x dx = ∫ u2 du =  u3 + C.
Now, substitute back:  tan3 x + C.
Combine the two integrals to get tan x +  tan3 x + C.
43. D We find ∫ cot x dx by rewriting the integral as . Then we use u-substitution. Let u = sin x and du = cos x. Substituting, we can get

Then, substituting back, we get ln(sin x) + C. (We can get rid of the absolute value bars because sine is always positive on the interval.) Next, we use f  = 1 to solve for C.
We get

1 = ln  + C


1 = ln  + C


1 − ln  = C = 1.693147

Thus, f(x) = ln(sin x) + 1.693147.
At x = 1, we get f(1) = ln(sin1) + 1.693147 = 1.521 (rounded to three decimal places).
44. C We solve an integral of the form  by performing the trig substitution x = asin θ. Here we will use x = 2sin θ, which means that dx = 2cos θ dθ. We get:  dθ. Next, factor out the 4:  cos θ dθ.
Next, simplify the radicand:  cos θ dθ, which gives us 4 ∫ cos2 θ dθ. Now, we need to use another trig identity. Recall that cos 2θ = 2cos2 θ − 1, which can be rewritten as cos2 θ = .
Now, we can rewrite the integral: 4 ∫ cos2 θ dθ =  dθ = 2∫ (1 + cos 2θ) dθ.
Integrate: 2 ∫ (1 + cos 2θ) dθ = 2θ + sin 2θ + C
Now, we have to substitute back.
Because x = 2sin θ, we know that θ = sin−1 and that cos θ = .
This gives us 2θ + sin 2θ + C = 2 sin−1  + C.
45. D Hooke's law says that the force needed to compress or stretch a spring from its natural state is F = kx, where k is the spring constant. We can find the value of k from the initial information, namely F = 250 N for a stretch of 5 m. Thus, we can solve to find the value of k: k = 250/5 = 50 N/m.
We find the work done by a variable force along the x-axis from x = a to x = b by evaluating the integral for the Work, W =  F(x) dx.
Using the information we have, W =  F(x) dx = 50(7)2 = 1,225 N.

ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS TO SECTION II

1. An object moving along a curve in the xy-plane has its position given by (x(t), y(t)) at time t seconds, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, with  = 8tcos t units/sec and  = 8tsin t units/sec.
At time t = 0, the object is located at (5, 11).
(a) Find the speed of the object at time t = 1.
The equation for the speed of an object is speed = .
Here, we get: speed = .
This can be simplified to speed =  =  = 8t.
Thus, the speed of the object at time t = 1 is 8.
(b) Find the length of the arc described by the curve's position from time t = 0 to time t = 1.
We can find the length of a parametric curve (x(t), y(t)), on the interval [a, b], by evaluating the integral:  dt.
We found the integrand in part (a):  = 8t. Thus, all we have to do is integrate this with respect to t from t = 0 to t = 1.
We get  8t dt = (4t2) = 4.
(c) Find the location of the object at time t = .
First, we will need to find the equations for the coordinates, which we can do by solving the differential equations. Let's find x:  = 8tcos t.
We can solve this by separation of variables. First, we move dt to the right side of the equals sign: dx = 8tcos t dt.
Integrate both sides (pulling the constant out of the integrand): ∫ dx = 8 ∫ t cos t dt.
The integral on the left is trivial: ∫ dx = x.
We will need to use integration by parts to solve the integral on the right.
The rule for integration by parts says that ∫ u dv = uv − ∫ v du.
Here, we let u = t and dv = cos t dt. Then, du = dt and v = sin t.
Substituting the terms we get 8∫t cos t dt = 8t sint − 8∫sint dt.
Now, we integrate the second term, which gives us

8∫t cos t dt = 8t sin t + 8cos t + C

Thus, the x-coordinate is x(t) = 8t sin t + 8cos t + C.
Now, we plug in the initial condition: 5 = (8)(0)sin(0) + (8)cos(0) + C.
This means that C = −3, so the equation for the x-coordinate is

x(t) = 8tsin t + 8cos t − 3

Now, let's find y:  = 8tsin t.
First, move dt to the right side of the equals sign: dy = 8tsin t dt.
Integrate both sides (pulling the constant out of the integrand): ∫ dy = 8 ∫ t sin t dt.
The integral on the left is trivial: ∫ dy = y.
Again, we will need to use integration by parts to solve the integral on the right.
Here, we let u = t and dv = sin t dt. Then, du = dt and v = -cos t.
Substituting the terms we get 8∫ tsin t dt = −8tcos t + 8 ∫cos t dt.
Now, we integrate the second term, which gives us

8∫tsin t dt = −8tcos t + 8 sin t + C

Thus, the y-coordinate is y(t) = −8tcos t + 8sin t + C.
Now, we plug in the initial condition: 11 = -(8)(0)cos(0) + (8)sin(0) + C.
This means that C = 11, so the equation for the y-coordinate is

y(t) = −8tcos t + 8sin t + 11

Finally, we plug t =  into the equations for the coordinates.

Therefore, the object's location at time t =  is (4π − 3,19).
2.

A baseball diamond is a square with each side 90 feet in length. A player runs from second base to third base at a rate of 18 ft/sec.
(a) At what rate is the player's distance from first base, A, changing when his distance from third base, D, is 22.5 feet?
A is related to D by the Pythagorean theorem: 902 + (90 − D)2 = A2. This can be simplified to 16,200 − 180D + D2 = A2.
Take the derivative of both sides with respect to t: .
Now, we are given that  = − 18 (it's negative because D is shrinking) and D = 22.5.
Next, we need to solve for A: 902 + (90 − 22.5)2 = A2. You should get A = 112.5.
Now, we can plug in and solve for .

−180(−18) + 2(22.5)(−18) = (2(112.5)


3,240 − 810 = 225


 = 10.8 ft/sec

(b) At what rate is angle α increasing when D is 22.5 feet?
Notice that tan α = . We differentiate both sides with respect to t.

Next, we need to solve for sec2 α when D = 22.5. From part (a), we know that A = 112.5, so sec2 α = , so sec2 α = .
Now, we plug in to solve for  (−18).

 = 0.128 radians/sec

(c) At what rate is the area of the trapezoidal region, formed by line segments A, B, C, and D, changing when D is 22.5 feet?
The area of the trapezoid is a =  C(B + D). Notice that B and C are constants. We differentiate both sides with respect to t: .
Now, we plug in and solve for (90)(−18) = −810 ft2/sec.
3. Consider the equation x2 − 2xy + 4y2 = 64.
(a) Write an expression for the slope of the curve at any point (x, y).
Step 1: The slope of the curve is just the derivative. But, here we have to use implicit differentiation to find the derivative. If we take the derivative of each term with respect to x, we get

Remember that  = 1, which gives us

Step 2: Now just simplify and solve for .

2x − 2x − 2 y + 8 y = 0


x − x − y + 4 y = 0


−x + 4 y = y − x


(4 y − x) = y − x


(b) Find the equation of the tangent lines to the curve at the point x = 2.
Step 1: We are going to use the point-slope form of a line, y − y1 = m(x − x1), where (x1, y1) is a point on the curve, and the derivative at that point is the slope m. First, we need to know the value of y when x = 2. If we plug 2 for x into the original equation, we get

4 − 4y + 4y2 = 64


4y2 − 4y − 60 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get

y =  ≈ 4.41, −3.41

Notice that there are two values of y when x = 2, which is why there are two tangent lines.
Step 2: Now that we have our points, we need the slope of the tangent line at x = 2.

Step 3: Plugging into our equation for the tangent line, we get

y − 4.41 = 0.15(x − 2)


y + 3.41 = 0.35(x − 2)

It is not necessary to simplify these equations.
(c) Find  at (0, 4).
Step 1: Once we have the first derivative, we have to differentiate again to find .
But we have to use implicit differentiation again.

Using the Quotient Rule,

Simplifying, we get

Now we plug in  for , which gives us

Now we would have to use a lot of algebra to simplify this but, fortunately, we can just plug (0, 4) in immediately for x and y, and solve from there.

Three trains, A, B, and C, each travel on a straight track for 0 ≤ t ≤ 16 hours. The graphs above, which consist of line segments, show the velocities, in kilometers per hour, of trains A and B. The velocity of C is given by v(t) = 8t − 0.25t2.
(Indicate units of measure for all answers.)
(a) Find the velocities of A and C at time t = 6 hours.
We can find the velocity of train A at time t = 6 simply by reading the graph. We get vA(6) = 25 km/hr. We find the velocity of train C at time t = 6 by plugging t = 6 into the formula. We get vC(6) = 8(6) − 0.25(62) = 39 kilometers per hour.
(b) Find the accelerations of B and C at time t = 6 hours.
Acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. For train B, we look at the slope of the graph at time t = 6. We get: aB (6) = 0 km/hr2. For train C, we take the derivative of v. We get: a(t) = 8 − 0.5t. At time t = 6, we get aC (6) = 5 km/hr2.
(c) Find the positive difference between the total distance that A traveled and the total distance that B traveled in 16 hours.
In order to find the total distance that train A traveled in 16 hours, we need to find the area under the graph. We can find this area by adding up the areas of the different geometric objects that are under the graph. From time t = 0 to t = 2, we need to find the area of a triangle with a base of 2 and a height of 20. The area is 20. Next, from time t = 2 to t = 4, we need to find the area of a rectangle with a base of 2 and a height of 20. The area is 40. Next, from time t = 4 to t = 8, we need to find the area of a trapezoid with bases of 20 and 30 and a height of 4. The area is 100. Next, from time t = 8 to t = 12, we need to find the area of a rectangle with a base of 4 and a height of 30. The area is 120. Finally, from time t = 12 to t = 16, we need to find the area of a triangle with a base of 4 and a height of 30. The area is 60. Thus, the total distance that train A traveled is 340 km.
Let's repeat the process for train B. From time t = 0 to t = 4, we need to find the area of a triangle with a base of 4 and a height of 40. The area is 80. Next, from time t = 4 to t = 10, we need to find the area of a rectangle with a base of 6 and a height of 40. The area is 240. Finally, from time t = 10 to t = 16, we need to find the area of a triangle with a base of 6 and a height of 40. The area is 120. Thus, the total distance that train B traveled is 440 km.
Therefore, the positive difference between their distances is 100 km.
(d) Find the total distance that C traveled in 16 hours.
First, note that the graph of train C's velocity, v(t) = 8t − 0.25t2, is above the x-axis on the entire interval. Therefore, in order to find the total distance traveled, we integrate v(t) over the interval.
We get  (8t − 0.25t2) dt.
Evaluate the integral:  (8t − 0.25t2) dt = .
5. Let y be the function satisfying f′(x) = x(1 − f(x)); f (0) = 10.
(a) Use Euler's Method, starting at x = 0, with step size of 0.5 to approximate f(x) at x = 1.
We use Euler's Method to find an approximate answer to the differential equation. First, we need a starting point (x0, y0) and an initial slope, y′0. (Note that here f(x) = y.) Next, we use increments of h to come up with approximations. Each new approximation will use the following rules:

xn = xn − 1 + h


yn = yn − 1 + h • y′n − 1


Repeat for n = 1, 2, 3,...

We are given that the curve goes through the point (0, 10). We will call the coordinates of this point x0 = 0 and y0 = 10. The slope is found by plugging these coordinates into y′ = x(1 − y), so we have an initial slope of y′0 = 0.
Now we need to find the next set of points.
Step 1: Increase x0 by h to get x1: x1 = 0.5.
Step 2: Multiply h by  and add to y0 to get y1: y1 = 10 + 0.5(0) = 10.
Step 3: Find  by plugging x1 and y1 into the equation for y′.

 = (0.5)(1 − 10) = −4.5

Repeat until we get to the desired point (in this case x = 1).
Step 1: Increase x1 by h to get x2: x2 = 1.
Step 2: Multiply h by  and add to y1 to get y2.

y2 = 10 + 0.5(−4.5) = 7.75

(b) Find an exact solution for f(x) when x = 1.
Here we need to solve the differential equation  = x(1 − y). We can use separation of variables. Move the term containing y to the left side and the dx to the right side.
We get  = x dx.
Integrate both sides.

It's traditional to isolate y. First, exponentiate both sides to base e: .
Next, use the rules of exponents to rewrite the following: .
Because eC is a constant, we can rewrite this as .
Finally, we isolate y: y = 1 − .
Now, we use the initial condition to solve for C: 10 = 1 − Ce0.
Therefore, C = −9.
Thus, because f(x) = y, the exact solution is: f(x) = 1 + .
Therefore, f(1) = 1 + .
(c) Evaluate  x(1 − f(x)) dx.
Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we know that

 f′(x) dx = f(b) − f(a)

In part (b), we found that f(x) = 1 + , so here we need to evaluate f at infinity and at zero.
We can find f at infinity using limits: .
We can find f at zero by plugging in: f(0) = 1 + 9e0 = 10.
Therefore,  x(1 − f(x)) dx = 1 − 10 = − 9.
6. Given f(x) = tan‒1(x) and g(x) = , for |x| ≤ 1
(a) Find the fifth-degree Taylor polynomial and general expression for g(x) about x = 0.
The formula for a Taylor polynomial of order n about x = a is

Pn(x) = f(a) + f′(a)(x − a) +  (x − a) +...+  (x − a)k +...+  (x − a)n

First, we need to find the derivatives of g(x) = .

g′(x) = -(1 + x)−2


g″(x) = 2(1 + x)−3


g(3)(x) = −6(1 + x)−4


g(4)(x) = 24(1 + x)−5


g(5)(x) = −120(1 + x)−6

Next, evaluate the derivatives about x = 0.

g(0) = 1; g′(0) = −1; g″(0) = 2; g(3)(0) = −6; g(4)(0) = 24; g(5)(0) = −120

Now, if we plug in the formula for the Taylor polynomial, we get

g(x) =  = 1 − x + x2 − x3 + x4 − x5

The general expression is g(x) = (−1)n xn.
(b) Given that  tan−1 x = , for |x| ≤ 1, use the result of part (a) to find the fifth-degree Taylor polynomial and general expression for f(x) about x = 0.
We can find the Taylor polynomial for  by substituting x2 for x in the formula above. We get:  = 1 − x2 + x4 − x6 +...(actually, we don't need the last term). Then, because  tan−1 x = , if we perform term-by-term integration on the series for  we will get the Taylor polynomial for tan−1 x.
We get: tan−1 x = ∫(1 − x2 + x4) dx = x −  + C. Because tan−1(0) = 0, C = 0, and thus the general expression for f(x) is tan−1 x = .
(c) Use the fifth-degree Taylor polynomial to estimate .
We can estimate  simply by plugging into the expression that we found in part (b). We get  =  = , which you don't need to simplify.

ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS TO SECTION I

1. B Remember that the derivative of tan x is sec2 x. We take the derivative, using the Chain Rule and get:  = (2π)sec2 (2πx).
2. A  =
Notice that if we plug in 0 for x, we will get . This is an indeterminate form and we can use L'Hôpital's rule to find the limit. We take the derivative of the numerator and the denominator separately and get:  = . Now if we plug in 0 for x, we get  = 0.
3. A Use the trig identity tan2 x = sec2 x − 1 to rewrite the integrand: tan2 x dx = (sec2 x − 1) dx.
Integrate: (sec2 x − 1) dx = tan x − x + C.
4. B We can find the slope of the tangent line by  and evaluating it at t = . First, we find the derivatives separately:  = 2cos t and  = 3sin t. Thus . Now we plug in t =  and get:  = . Note that we also could have written  = .
5. C First, let's determine if f(x) is continuous at x = 2. The  f(x) = 8 − 8 = 0 and  f(x) = 8 − 8 = 0, so  f(x) = 0. Next, f(2) = 0. Because  f(x) = f(2), we know that f(x) is continuous at x = 2. So we can eliminate (B) and (D). Now, let's determine if f(x) is differentiable at x = 2. We can take the derivative of both pieces of (x): f′(x) = . Now we evaluate both pieces of f′(x) to see if they are the same. For x < 2, we get f′(2−) = 4 − 4(2) = −4 and for x > 2, we get f′(2+) = 3(22) − 4 = 8. The two pieces of f′(x) are not the same so f(x) is continuous but not differentiable at x = 2.
6. D We can use u-substitution. Let u = tan x and du = sec2 x dx. We get: ∫ tan2 x sec2 x dx = ∫ u2 du.
Integrate ∫ u2 du =  + C. Substitute back:  + C.
7. A The particle will be at rest when it is not moving in either the x or y direction. We can find these times by finding where the respective derivatives are zero. First, let's find :  = 6t2 + 6t − 12. Now we set it equal to zero: 6t2 + 6t − 12 = 0. Divide through by 6: t2 + t − 2 = 0, which factors to (t + 2)(t − 1) = 0. Thus,  = 0 at time t = 1 (we can throw out the other answer because t can't be negative). Now let's repeat the process for :  = 6t2 + 30t + 24. Set it equal to zero: 6t2 + 30t + 24 = 0. Divide through by 6: t2 −5t + 4 = 0, which factors into: (t − 4)(t − 1) = 0. Thus,  = 0 at times t = 1, 4. In order for the particle to be at rest, both  and  must be zero. The only time that this occurs is at t = 1.
8. C Here, we can use u-substitution. Let u = x2. Then du = 2x dx, which we can divide through by 2 to get  du = x dx. Now we substitute into the integrand: 3x csc2 x2 dx = csc2 u du. Now we can integrate this to get: csc2 u du = −cot u + C. Substituting back, we get: −cot(x2) + C.
9. A Remember that (logb x) = . Here, we use the Chain Rule to get: f′(x) =  · (3x2 − 1) Now we plug in x = 2: f′(2) =  · (3(2)2 − 1) = .
10. D If we factor a 5 out of the top, we can rewrite the sum as a Geometric series:  = . Remember that a Geometric series converges when the common ratio −1 < r < 1, and diverges otherwise. Here, r is , so the series diverges.
11. B To find the MacLaurin series for ex3, simply take the series for ex, and replace x with x3. We get: ex3 =  =  = 1 + x3 + 
12. B We can write the rate of growth of the Algae as . When we are told that a variable is directly proportional to another one, we can think of it as an equation where the one variable is equal to a constant times the other one. Thus, we get:  =  kA, where k is the constant of proportionality.
13. A Remember that  f(x) dx +  f(x) dx =  f(x) dx. Also, remember that  f(x) dx = − f(x) dx. First we can rewrite  f(x) dx = 75 as  f(x) dx = −75. Now we get:  f(x) dx +  f(x) dx =  f(x) dx. Now simply substitute the values for the respective integrals:  f(x) dx − 75 = 100. Therefore,  f(x) dx = 175.
14. A We can find the correct differential equation by testing some values of x and y and seeing what the slope is at those values. At the origin, the slope is 0, which unfortunately, does not eliminate any of the choices. At (1, 1), the slope is positive, which eliminates (B) and (C). At (−1, 1), the slope is again positive, which eliminates (D). This leaves (A).
15. B The formula for the length of the curve y = f(x) from x = a to x = b is given by  dx. So in this case,  must be 5x3. The derivative of (A) and (B) are both 5x3, but only (B) goes through the point (2, 10).
16. D The tangent line passes through the points (8, 2) and (2, 5), so the slope of the tangent line is  = −. Thus f′(8) = −.
17. B For a parametric equation, . Here,  = 2t and  3t2 + 2. This means that the slope of the tangent line,  = . Now we have to figure out what value of t to plug in. Note that our equation for y = t2, and y = 4. Thus t = ±2. If we plug t = 2 into our equation for x, we get x = 11. So we can plug t = 2 into  = , to get the slope of the tangent line. We get  = . Now we plug the slope and the point into the equation for a line to get: y − 4 =  (x − 11), which we can rearrange to 7y − 2x = 6.
18. C The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that  f(t)dt = f′(x). Here, we get: g′(x) =  f(t)dt = f(x2) · x2 (the x2 term comes from applying the Chain Rule to the limit in the integral). Therefore, g′(2) = f(4) · 4. From the graph, we can see that f(4) = 2, so g′(2) = 2 · 4 = 8.
19. B Simply take the derivative of each of the answer choices. Only (B) and (C) have a derivative of 3x2 + 5, and of those, only (B) goes through the point (2, 18).
20. C The first four terms of the MacLaurin series for f(x) = sin x are sin x ≈ x − . To find the series for f(x) = sin(x2), we replace x with x2: sin x2 ≈ x2 −, which can be simplified to x2 − .
21. D Note that this differential equation is a logistic equation. Recall that the solution of a differential equation of the form  is y = , where A = . Here we get y =  and A = . Thus our equation becomes y = . Now we can find  = 10,000.
22. A We can apply the Ratio Test:
 =  = . Now we need |ρ| < 1. If we evaluate the limit, we get ρ =  =  = 5x(1), so we are only concerned with |5x| < 1, which is true when − < x < .
23. B We can find the answer using Integration By Parts, which says that we can evaluate an integral of the form ∫ u dv by the formula ∫ u dv = uv − ∫ v dv. Let u = x and dv = e6x dx. Then du = dx and . Plug it into the formula: ∫xe6x dx. Now we just have to integrate . We get: . Therefore, the answer is ∫ xe6x dx = .
24. B Series I is a geometric series. These series converge if the ratio is −1 < ρ < 1 and diverge otherwise. Here, the ratio is r = , which is greater than 1, so it diverges. We can now eliminate (A) and (C). We can rewrite series II as . This is a p-series. These series converge if p > 1 and diverge if p ≤ 1. Because p > 1, the series converges. Now we have to test series III. Here, we can determine whether it converges by the Ratio Test.  =  =  =  = ∞. Therefore series III diverges. Thus, only series II converges.
25. C We need to add up the areas of the four rectangles whose widths are the distances between the x-coordinates and whose heights are determined by evaluating f at the left coordinate of each interval. We get: R = (2) f(0) + (3) f(2) + (2) f(5) + (3) f(7). Now we can use the table to find the appropriate values of f. We get: R = (2)(8) + (3)(11) + (2)(20) + (3)(29) = 16 + 33 + 40 + 87 = 176.
26. A We can evaluate the integral using the Method of Partial Fractions. First, we rewrite the integrand as  = . Next, we multiply both sides by (x − 2)(x + 3) to clear the denominators: (x − 2)(x + 3) + (x − 2)(x + 3) = (x − 2)(x + 3).
This simplifies to A(x + 3) + B(x − 2) = (x + 8). Now distribute the terms on the left side: Ax + 3A + Bx − 2B = x + 8. Group the terms: Ax + Bx + 3A − 2B = x + 8. This tells us that A + B = 1 and 3A − 2B = 8. Using a little algebra, we get A = 2 and B = −1. Now that we have solved for A and B, we can rewrite the integral as:  = . Evaluating the integrals, we get:  = 2ln|x − 2|− ln|x − 3| + C.
27. C This is an improper integral. We first rewrite the integral as:  dx. Next, let's use u-substitution. Let u = 1 − e-x and du = e-x dx. Substitute (ignore the limits for now): − ∫.
Integrate:  = −ln|u|. And substitute back: −ln|u| = − ln|1 − e−x. Now we can evaluate the limits:  = . Now we evaluate the integral at the limits: (−ln|1 − e−n| + ln|1 − e−10 and take the limit: (−ln|1 − e−n| + ln|1 − e−10) = −ln|1 − e−10| = ln|1 − e−10|.
28. B The Taylor series for ex is ex ≈ 1 + x + , so we can find the Taylor series for ex2 by replacing x with x2: ex2 ≈ 1 + x2 = . Therefore, the coefficient of x8 is .
29. A Remember that the formula for the Taylor polynomial about x = 0 is: P(x) = f(0) + f′(0)+ f″(0)  + f ″′(0)  +....If we look at the terms of the polynomial, we can see that f(0) = 0 and thus . Therefore, f ″(0) = −4.
30. D We can find h′(x) using the Chain Rule. We get: h′(x) = g′(f(x)). f′(x). Now, we just have to evaluate h′(2). We get: h′(2) = g′(f(2)). f′(2) = 6. −3 = −18.
31. C Euler's Method is quite simple. First, we need a starting point (x0, y0) and an initial slope . Next, we use increments of h to come up with approximations. Each new approximation will use the following rules:

xn = xn − 1 + h
yn = yn − 1 + h • 
Repeat for n = 1, 2, 3,...

We are given that the curve goes through the point (1, 5). We will call the coordinates of this point x0 = 1 and y0 = 6. The slope is found by plugging these coordinates into y′ = 2x − y, so we have an initial slope of  = 2 − 5 = −3. Now we need to find the next set of points.
Step 1: Increase x0 by h to get: x1 = 1.5.
Step 2: Multiply h by  and add y0 to get y1: y1 = 5 − 3(.5) = 3.5.
Step 3: Find  by plugging x1 and y1 into the equation for y′:  = 2(1.5) − 3.5 = −0.5.
Repeat these three steps until we get to x = 3.
Step 1: x2 = 2
Step 2: y2 = 3.5 − 0.5(0.5) = 3.25
Step 3:  = 2(2) − 3.25 = 0.75
Step 1: x3 = 2.5
Step 2: y3 = 3.25 + 0.5(0.75) = 3.625
Step 3:  = 2(2.5) − 3.625 = 1.375
Step 1: x4 = 3
Step 2: y4 = 3.625 + .5(1.375) = 4.3125
32. D We need to find a relationship between the side of a square and its perimeter. If we call the length of a side of the square x, then we know that  = −0.4. We also know that when the area of the square is 16 m, the side of the square is 4 m. The perimeter of the square is P = 4x, so . Plugging in, we get  = 4(−0.4) = −1.6m/s.
33. A Note that this is NOT the limit as x approaches 0. It is the limit as x approaches 1. If we plug in 1, we get . Make sure that your calculator is in radian mode!
34. B If we want to find the total profits, we need to evaluate the integral of P(t), with the limits of integration being from t = 5 to t = 8. We get: . We can evaluate this on a calculator to get $2,618.
35. A The speed of the particle is given by v = , which we then evaluate at t = 5. We get  = −8sin 2t and  = 12cos 4t. Now we plug in t = 5 and find v: v =  ≈ 6.551.
36. A First, we need to find f ′(x) to get the critical points. We get: f ′(x) = 2e-x2 − 4x2e-x2 = e-x2(2 − 4x2). Next, we set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points. Note that the exponential term is always positive, so we only need to find when 2 − 4x2 = 0. We get x = . Now, we can just evaluate f at the critical points and the end points, and the smallest value is the minimum. We get: f(−1) ≈ −0.736,  ≈ −0.858, ≈ −0.858, and f(2) ≈ 0.073, so the minimum is ≈ −0.858.
37. C We can find the area of the polar curve by evaluating the integral . Here we get: (3 − 2cos4θ)2 dθ.
38. D First, we need to find the width of each subinterval. We find this by subtracting the endpoints and dividing by n = 4. We get: . Now, we have to add up the areas of all of the trapezoids. Remember that the formula for the area of a trapezoid is  (b1 + b2)h. The height of each trapezoid is the width of the subinterval, and the bases are found by evaluating f(x) at the left and right endpoints of the subinterval. We get:  + . Plugging into the formula, we get: S = [3 + 2(3.75) + 2(5) + 2(6.75) + 9] = 10.75
39. B We can find the particle's velocity by integrating its acceleration and using the initial condition. v(t) = ∫8sin 2t + 4cos 2t dt = −4cos 2t 2sin 2t + C. Now we use the fact that its velocity is 8 units/sec when t = 0 to solve for C. We get: 8 = −4 + 0 + C, so C = 12. Now that we have the particle's velocity, we can solve for its position by integrating the velocity and using the initial condition. x(t) = ∫−4 cos 2t + 2sin 2t + 12dt = 2 sin 2t − cos 2t + 12t + C. Now we can use the fact that the position is 4 units when t = 0 to solve for C. We get: 4 = 0 − 1 + 0 + C, so C = 5. Thus, the position function is x(t) = −2sin 2t − cos 2t + 12t + 5. Now we can find x(2) = −2sin 4 − cos 4 + 24 + 5 ≈ 31.167.
40. B First, distribute the x in the integrand:  =  and integrate  =  − 0 = .
41. A Here, we use the Second Fundamental Theorum of Calculus, which says that  f(t) dt = f(x). We get:  cost dt = cos(x2) · 2x
Remember that we need to use the Chain Rule when we have a function in the limits of integration.
42. D First, let's make a sketch of the region:

We can see that the bounds of the region are x = 0 and x = 4. We can find the volume using Washers. We get: V = π(4x − x2)2 dx. We could evaluate this by hand but we are in the calculator portion of the AP, so simply plug it into the calculator. We get V = π(4x − x2)2 dx ≈ 107.233.
43. C The formula for the length of the curve y = f(x) from x = a to x = b is given by . In this case, . We get:  dx≈ 2.121.
44. D The Mean Value Theorem states that if f(x) is continuous on the interval [a, b] and differentiable on the interval (a, b), then there exists at least one value c, on the interval (a, b), such that f′(c) = . Let's find the various terms. We get: f(3) = 9 − 27 = −18 and f(1) = 3 − 1 = 2, so  = − 10. Now we need to find f ′(c) = 3 − 3c2. If we set them equal to each other and solve, we get: −10 = 3 − 3c2 and c = ≈ 2.082. We can throw out the negative answer because it is not in the interval.
45. D We can find the average value of a function f(x) with the formula favg =  f(x)dx. Here, we get: favg =  arctan x dx. We can evaluate this with a calculator to get 0.360.

ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS TO SECTION II

1. Let R be the region bounded by the graphs of y = 4 ln x, y = , and x = 1, as shown in the figure below.

(a) Find the area of R.
Remember that the area of the region can be found by evaluating the integral  f(x) − g(x)dx. Here, f(x) = , g(x) = 4ln x, and a = 1. We now need to find b, which is the intersection of the two curves. We can find the intersection using the calculator. We get x = 2.410. Thus, we need to evaluate the integral . We can evaluate this with the calculator and get  ≈ 3.563. Remember that the AP expects three decimal places for answers unless it states otherwise.
(b) Find the volume of the solid that results when R is revolved about the vertical line x = 1.
We can find the volume of the solid either using washers or cylindrical shells. The difficulty using washers is twofold: first, we would have to convert the equations from being in terms of x to being in terms of y, and second, we would have to use two integrals because the region consists of f(x) =  on the right and x = 1 on the left until they intersect, and then switches to g(x) = 4 ln x on the right and x = 1 on the left. However, if we use cylindrical shells, we can avoid both of these problems. The formula is 2π x(f(x) − g(x))dx. Here, we get:  ≈ 32.091.
(c) Let R be the base of a solid. Every cross-section of the solid perpendicular to the x-axis is an equilateral triangle with one side across the base. Find the volume of the solid.
Here, we can use the formula V =  side2 dx, where the side of each cross-section is found by f(x) − g(x). We get:≈ 5.662.
2. For t ≥ 0, a particle is moving along a curve with its position at time t given by (x(t), y(t)) and  = 3t2 − 4,  = 2t. At time t = 1, its position is (−3, 1).
(a) Find the slope of the particle's path at time t = 3.
We can find the slope of the particle's path by . At time t = 3,.
(b) Find the x-coordinate of the particle's position at time t = 5.
We can find the x-coordinate of the particle's position by evaluating the integral ∫ dt and using the information about its location at time t = 1 to solve for the constant. We get: x(t) = ∫3t2 − 4 dt = t3 − 4t + C. Now we can plug in t = 1 to solve for C: −3 = 1 − 4 + C, so C = 0. Thus, x(t) = t3 − 4t. Finally, we plug in t = 5: x(5) = 53 − 20 = 105.
(c) Find the speed of the particle at time t = 5.
We can find the speed of the particle by v = . At time t = 5,  = 71 and  = 10. Therefore, the speed is v = ≈ 71.701.
(d) Find the acceleration vector of the particle at time t = 5.
The acceleration vector is given by . Here,  = 6t and  = 2. So, the acceleration vector is (36t2, 4).
3. A water storage tank is in the shape of an inverted cone whose height is 16 meters and radius is 4 meters. The tank initially contains 36p m3. The water is filling the tank at a rate of 2πh m3/min.
(a) Find  in terms of h.
The volume of a cone is V = πr2h. We also know that, because the height of the cone is 16 meters and radius is 4 meters, the ratio of the height to the radius of the water in the cone is always  = 4, or or r = . We can substitute this ratio into the equation for volume to get it in terms of h only. We get V =  h =  h3. Now we can find  by taking the derivative of the volume with respect to t: . We are given that  = 2πh3, so 2πh3 = . With a little algebra, we get:  = 32h.
(b) If h = 12 m at time t = 0, find an equation for h as a function of t.
We know that  = 32h. If we separate the variables and integrate, we get: ∫ = ∫32 dt, which gives us ln h = 32t + C (h can't be negative so we don't need the absolute value). If we exponentiate both sides, we get: h = Ce32t. Now we can solve for C: 12 = C. Therefore, we get: h = 12e32t.
(c) At what time is the storage tank full?
Here, we simply need to find when h = 16. We get: 16 = 12e32t. We can solve this for t:  = e32t, ln  = 32t, so  ln  min.
4. The function f is differentiable everywhere and the MacLaurin series is  = 
(a) Use the Ratio Test to find the interval of convergence of the MacLaurin series of f.
The Ratio Test gives us:
 =  =  =  = x2. In order for the series to converge, −1 < ρ < 1. Here, we get: x2 < 1. If we take the square root, we get: −1 < x < 1.
(b) Approximate fusing the first three nonzero terms.
All we have to do is plug  in for x. We get:  = 1 − .
(c) Write the first four nonzero terms and the general term for the MacLaurin series for f ′(x).
We can find f′(x) by differentiating each of the terms. We get: .
5. 

The figure above shows the graph of f, which is a continuous function defined on −4 ≤ x ≤ 4. The graph of f from x = −4 to x = 0 is a semi-circle, and from x = 0 to x = 4 consists of three line segments. Let g(x) =  f(t) dt.
(a) Find g(2) and g(−2).
From the definition of g, we get g(2) =  f(t) dt. This is the area under f(t) from x = 0 to x = 2. This is simply the area of the triangle: (2)(−2) = −2. Similarly, g(−2) =  f(t) dt. Note that here, the greater limit of integration is on the bottom of the integral sign and the smaller one is on top. We can reverse the order of the limits and change the sign of the integral: g(−2) f(t) dt = − f(t) dt. This time, we are finding the area under f(t) from x = −2 to x = 0. This is simply the area of the quarter circle: π(2)2 = π, so g(−2) = -π.
(b) Evaluate g′(1).
We can use the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find the derivative of g:  f(t) dt = f(x). So, g′(1) = f(1) = −2.
(c) Find all values of x where g(x) has a point of inflection.
In order to find where g(x) has a point of inflection, where g″(x) = 0. We know that g′(x) = f(x), so g″(x) = f ′(x). If we look at the graph of f(x), we can see that f ′(x) = 0 at x = −2. Furthermore, f ′(x) > 0 to the left of x = −2 and f ′(x) < 0 to the right of x = −2. Therefore, g(x) has a point of inflection at x = −2.
(d) At what value of x is g(x) a minimum?
We can see from the graph that g′(x) = f(x) = 0 at x = 0 and at x = 2. At x = 0, g′(x) is positive to the left and negative to the right, so at x = 2, g(x) has a maximum. At x = 2, g′(x) is negative to the left and positive to the right, so at x = 2, g(x) has a minimum.
6. Bacteria is growing in a Petri dish at a rate that satisfies the differential equation  =  (A− 40), where A is the number of bacteria and t is measured in days. There are initially 1200 bacteria in the dish.
(a) Use the line tangent to the graph of A at t = 0 to estimate the number of bacteria the end of t = 5 days.
First, we need to find  at t = 0. We get:  (A(0) − 40) = (1200 − 40) = 348. The tangent line is thus A(t) = 1200 + 348t. Therefore, at t = 5, A(t) = 1200 + 348(5) = 2940.
(b) Find  in terms of A.
 =  =  (A − 40), where A ≥ 1200.
(c) Find the particular solution to the above differential equation with the initial condition A(0) = 1200.
First, we separate the variables: . Now we can integrate both sides: . We get: ln|A − 40| t + C. If we exponentiate both sides, we get: A − 40 = Cet. (Because A is always greater than 1200, we can ignore the absolute value signs).
Now, we can solve for C: 1200 − 40 = Ce0, so C = 1160 and A = 1160et + 40.

PREREQUISITE MATHEMATICS
One of the biggest problems that students have with calculus is that their algebra, geometry, and trigonometry are not solid enough. In calculus, you'll be expected to do a lot of graphing. This requires more than just graphing equations with your calculator. You'll be expected to look at an equation and have a "feel" for what the graph looks like. You'll be expected to factor, combine, simplify, and otherwise rearrange algebraic expressions. You'll be expected to know your formulas for the volume and area of various shapes. You'll be expected to remember trigonometric ratios, their values at special angles, and various identities. You'll be expected to be comfortable with logarithms. And so on. Throughout this book, we spend a lot of time reminding you of these things as they come up, but we thought we should summarize them here at the end.
Powers
When you multiply exponential expressions with like bases, you add the powers.

xa • xb = xa+b

When you divide exponentiated expressions with like bases, you subtract the powers.

When you raise an exponentiated expression to a power, you multiply the powers.

(xa)b = xab

When you raise an expression to a fractional power, the denominator of the fraction is the root of the expression, and the numerator is the power.

When you raise an expression to the power of zero, you get one.

x0 = 1

When you raise an expression to the power of one, you get the following expression.

x1 = x

When you raise an expression to a negative power, you get the reciprocal of the expression to the absolute value of the power.

Logarithms
A logarithm is the power to which you raise a base, in order to get a value. In other words, logbx = a means that ba = x. There are several rules of logarithms that you should be familiar with.
When you take the logarithm of the product of two expressions, you add the logarithms.

log(ab) = log a + log b

When you take the logarithm of the quotient of two expressions, you subtract the logarithms.

log  = log a − log b

When you take the logarithm of an expression to a power, you multiply the logarithm by the power.

log(ab) = b log a

The logarithm of 1 is zero.

log 1 = 0

The logarithm of its base is 1.

logb b = 1

You cannot take the logarithm of zero or of a negative number.
In calculus, and virtually all mathematics beyond calculus, you will work with natural logarithms. These are logs with base e and are denoted by ln. Thus, you should know the following:

ln 1 = 0


ln e = 1


ln ex = x


eln x = x

The change of base rule is: logb x = 
Geometry
The area of a triangle is  (base)(height).
The area of a rectangle is (base)(height).
The area of a trapezoid is  (base1 + base2)(height).
The area of a circle is πr2.
The circumference of a circle is 2πr.
The Pythagorean theorem states that the sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle equals the square of the hypotenuse. This is more commonly stated as a2 + b2 = c2 where c equals the length of the hypotenuse.
The volume of a right circular cylinder is πr2 h.
The surface area of a right circular cylinder is 2πrh.
The volume of a right circular cone is  πr2 h.
The volume of a sphere is  πr3.
The surface area of a sphere is 4πr2.
Trigonometry
Given a right triangle with sides x, y, and r and angle θ below:






sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B
sin(A − B) = sin A cos B − cos A sin B
cos(A + B) = cos A cos B − sin A sin B
cos(A − B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B

You must be able to work in radians and know that 2π = 360º.
You should know the following:
