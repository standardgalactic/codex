Preface








IF ANYONE NEEDS TWO TERRIFYING EXAMPLES to illustrate the nature of today's refugee problem and the inadequacy of the current approach to dealing with this crisis, they can be found in Bosnia and Rwanda. In Bosnia, attempts by the United Nations to protect so-called safe areas call into question the very definition of the word safe. In Rwanda, the numbers alone tell the story: 2 million persons displaced, including over 1 million people who crossed into Zaire in one 48-hour period.








While those two examples happen to be the ones attracting the most headlines today, they are far from the only ones. Indeed, the 1990s represent a decade of displacement in which all regions of the world are experiencing forced population movements. Since the end of the Cold War, local wars and civil unrest in many regions of Africa, the Balkans, Southeast Asia, and the former Soviet Union have uprooted millions of people. International refugee issues are deeply embedded in the social, economic, and political conditions of our times and pose a range of difficult issues for the world community. The international community is ill-prepared to deal with the complexities of post-Cold War humanitarian issues. To be fully effective in managing these problems, the international system for protecting and assisting refugees will have to undertake major changes in its outlook, capabilities, and resource allocations, and the refugee issue will have to be factored into international political, economic, and security policies to a far greater extent than exists today.








As a result of rapid changes in international relationsin particular the end of the Cold War and the rise of internal conflicts, along with the merging of refugee issues with migration issues in the minds of both officials and the publica consensus is emerging, internationally and nationally, on the need for giving






 












Page xii




more attention to forced population movements. Despite the growing recognition that refugee movements are a force for change and conflict in the post-Cold War era, there is little systematic thinking about the refugee issue and about what the implications of the new era are for assistance and protection of refugees both nationally and worldwide.








This book is designed to describe and discuss the current controversy concerning the handling of the global refugee problem by the United States government and the international community. It (1) discusses who refugees are and the transformation in the character and duration of refugee movements worldwide; (2) describes the international system that has developed a number of institutions, a body of international law, and a set of solutions to protect and assist those forced to flee their countries of origin; (3) analyzes the causes and consequences of refugee movements both for refugees and the countries involved; and (4) discusses the future challenges refugee movements pose and the evolving strategies of response to this rapidly growing global problem.








The text provides readers with sufficient background information about the global refugee issue to permit them to contribute to the debate about what needs to be done to respond to this complex problem. The first three chapters provide a historical account of the refugee issue, outlining the global dimensions of the problem and the political and economic strategies needed to deal with the issue in the future, as well as giving some biographical sketches of famous refugees, both past and present, and important activists for refugees' rights. Chapter 4 provides the principal statistics and legal documents regarding refugees. Chapters 5 through 7 offer resources for those who wish to pursue the study of refugees in more detaila list of organizations already working on this issue and print and nonprint references on the topic. The book also includes a glossary of terms commonly used in the study of refugees and a listing of acronyms of the principal organizations and programs in the refugee field.

NUMEROUS ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE ASSISTED us and provided us the information necessary in the preparation of this book. We are particularly grateful to the United States Committee for Refugees (USCR) in Washington, D.C., which provided the information for the directory of organizations in chapter 5 and for many of the statistics that appear in chapter 4. Tom Argent and Ginny Hamilton of USCR were especially helpful in this regard. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva provided useful information on the chronology in chapter 2 and on electronic databases and videos in chapter 7. Both the UNHCR and the Secretariat for Inter-Governmental Consultations in Vienna also assisted with our compilation of statistics in chapter 4. We thank Robert DeVecchi of the International Rescue Committee, Philip Rudge of the European Council of Refugees, Arthur Helton of the Open Society Institute of the Soros Foundation, Beth Ferris of Church World Service, and Roger Winter of the USCR for providing biographical information for their entries in chapter 3. We gratefully acknowledge all of these organizations' and individuals' assistance and permission to reprint some of their material.








Finally, Joetta Schlabach of the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the University of Notre Dame typed two of these chapters and helped us a great deal with the handling of the statistical material. Linyu Sha of the Department of Government and International Studies at the University of Notre Dame provided some key research assistance.

1 Overview








ON EVERY CONTINENT PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED from their homes, their communities, and their countries because of persecution or violence. Almost on a daily basis we see paraded across our television screens women and children forced out of their villages and deported to faraway places, while men are herded into detention centers where they are tortured and starved. Such images graphically illustrate the daily reality of millions of people, caught up in the crosscurrents of war, revolution, and famine, who have been forced into exile.








From the mid-1970s to 1994 there was an alarming increase in refugees. The total rose from 2.8 million in 1976 to 8.2 million in 1980. By August 1994, there were almost 20 million refugees. In addition, there were an estimated 25 million displaced people inside their own countries. Adding their numbers to those of refugees means that, in a world population of 5.5 billion, approximately 1 in every 130 people on earth has been forced into flight.








There are fears that many more people could become displaced, since ethnic and religious tensions previously suppressed by totalitarian regimes or East-West competition have been unleashed, potentially leading to violence.








In the 1990s, refugee emergencies have included the former Yugoslavia, where the number of displaced people rose from half a million in 1991 to more than 4 million in 1994; Somalia, where hundreds of thousands of people became refugees in neighboring Kenya, Ethiopia, and Yemen as a result of vicious interclan

conflict; Armenia and Azerbaijan, where more than 1 million people have been displaced by the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh; Tajikistan, where 60,000 people fled across borders and half a million have been uprooted by civil war between clans; Burma, where a quarter of a million Muslim refugees fled to poverty-stricken Bangladesh; Burundi and Rwanda, where well over 1 million refugees fled across borders because of intertribal war and mass slaughter; and Bhutan, where nearly 100,000 have fled ethnic strife.








It cannot be denied that a global refugee problem exists. In recent years, the international community has been confronted with one refugee emergency after another in rapid and sometimes overlapping succession. Refugee crises in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, the Balkans, and the former Soviet republics have strained the capacities of the United Nations almost to the breaking point. In particular, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the international community's principal institution for protecting and assisting refugees, has been stretched to the limit of its capacities.








Who Is a Refugee?








At a time when the numbers of refugees and asylum-seekers are growing rapidly, the question of precisely who is and who is not a refugee is one of considerable controversy. Presently, the principal international definition is the United Nations concept that was formulated in the immediate post-World War II period, largely in response to European refugee flows. According to the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, a refugee is ''any person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country." Thus, the term refugee refers to a person who has fled across the physical borders of his homeland to seek refuge in another place and who, upon being granted refugee status, receives certain rights not available to other international migrants, including the right of resettlement and legal protection from deportation or forcible return to his






 












Page 3




country of origin (the so-called nonrefoulement protection). People requesting refugee status and seeking permanent settlement in a country to which they have fled are referred to as asylum-seekers. The UNHCR is mandated to oversee the implementation of the 1951 convention and offer protection to the world's 20 million refugees.








Apart from the narrow internationally agreed-upon definition, the term refugee has been widened in practice to cover a variety of people in diverse situations who need assistance and protection. The most notable of these expansions is found in the Convention on Refugee Problems in Africa, a regional instrument adopted by the Organization of African Unity in 1969. It includes people fleeing "external aggression, internal civil strife, or events seriously disturbing public order" in African countries. The Cartagena Declaration of 1984 covering Central American refugees also goes beyond the 1951 UN convention by including "persons who have fled their country because their lives, safety or freedom have been threatened by generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal conflicts, massive violation of human rights or other circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order."








These regional legal norms are in fact much more inclusive and in keeping with the actual causes of flight throughout the Third World than are the UN norms. Accordingly, over the past several decades UNHCR has interpreted its mandate to extend to people who have been forcibly displaced from their countries because of internal upheavals or armed conflicts. In recent years, however, there has been great resistance in the West to this pragmatic expansion of the refugee definition and of UNHCR's mandate. In most industrialized nations the 1951 definition is used for resettlement and asylum purposes, although groups of people at risk of death or grave harm from violence are often given temporary protection.








Although anyone uprooted because of exposure to violence and the denial of human rights is commonly referred to as a refugee, the definition of the 1951 UN convention is much more precise. By UN standards, the key criterion determining refugee status is persecution, which usually means a deliberate act of government against individuals. This excludes victims of general upheaval, insecurity, and oppression; victims of systemic economic deprivation; or people who have not crossed national






 












Page 4




frontiers to seek refuge. From the perspective of international law, a refugee is outside his home country and does not have the protection of his country of origin.








In addition to the variety of legal definitions for refugees, there are several other categories of uprooted people. For example, 2.4 million Palestinians are registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), whose mandate is limited geographically to Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Israeli-occupied territories. There are also large numbers of people who are displaced within their own countries because of armed conflict and ethnic strife or because of forcible relocation by their governments. Many of them are victims of the same civil wars that sent refugees out of Angola, Mozambique, Cambodia, Guatemala, or Afghanistan, or they are victims of ethnic strife in Rwanda, Liberia, Ethiopia, Somalia, or throughout the Balkans or the former Soviet Union. Because internally displaced persons remain within their own country and do not cross international boundaries, they cannot be protected as refugees. In addition, there are those who have been refugees who voluntarily return to their countries of origin. Sometimes returnees go home under the auspices of UNHCR, from whom they receive assistance for a limited time, but more often returnees go back on their own without international sponsorship because they do not want public recognition as former refugees. There are many constraints on providing protection and assistance to returnees, however, especially when the conditions that generated the exodus continue to exist in the countries of origin.








Finally, there are those who leave their countries because of economic factors and who are considered to be economic migrants. These people do not qualify for UNHCR protection or assistance; however, in developing countries that have few resources and weak government structures, economic hardships are generally exacerbated by political violence. Because of the close relationship between political conflict and economic and social problems, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between refugees and migrants. While refugees flee to save their lives and migrants flee to improve their economic prospects, to distinguish between them becomes extremely difficult when people flee from countries where poverty and violence are direct consequences of the political system. Since the late 1950s, Haitian people have fled a country impoverished






 












Page 5




by the corrupt and violent Duvalier family, and until September 1994 they fled again from the military regime that overthrew Jean Bertrand Aristide, the elected president of Haiti. The influx of Albanians into Italy in 1990-1991 continued even after the election of a democratic government in their homeland, demonstrating anew the complexity of the problem.








While the definition contained in the 1951 UN convention remains important as a statement of legal responsibility and international commitment to protect refugees, increasingly large numbers of politically coerced and displaced people do not fall within its strict definition. As a result, migrants who flee threatening circumstances that do not involve individual persecution have not been widely accepted as refugees. There is a growing perception in the industrialized world that these movements of people can no longer be handled adequately by uncoordinated responses on the part of receiving countries.








The stark fact that must be faced is that the world is witnessing a huge growth in forcibly displaced people. In terms of sheer numbers, nonconvention refugeesthose who flee civil wars, ethnic conflicts, and generalized violence in the Third World and Eastern Europeare a bigger problem for the international community than those who fall within the 1951 UN definition. Nonconvention refugees are not adequately protected by present international normsa situation that brings to question whether or not the current UN definition of refugee should be changed in order to respond to contemporary needs.








International Organizations








A number of international agencies exist to respond to refugee crises. Among these are the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); the International Committee for the Red Cross, which assists people caught in conflicts; the World Food Program, which coordinates food aid to refugees; and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which aids women and children. The United Nations Relief and Works Administration for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) aids Palestinians in the Middle East, and the International Organization for Migration arranges for the transportation of refugees resettled overseas and for the






 












Page 6




safe and humane return home of refugees and migrants from countries unable or unwilling to absorb them.








The international community also relies on a vast network of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), ranging from large international agencies to small organizations working in a single country, to offer assistance programs. As the implementing partners for the UNHCR, NGOs bear the brunt of delivering food and providing shelter, water, sanitation, and health care to refugees. Where funding is available, they also provide community outreach services and educational and skills programs.








Refugees and the UNHCR in a Changing World








Formally established in 1950 at the height of East-West confrontation, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was initially charged with protecting and assisting people displaced in the aftermath of World War II and those fleeing communist persecution in Europe. From the 1960s until recently, however, the focus shifted away from Europe to the Third World. During the last 30 years, the majority of UNHCR's budget has been allocated for operations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. While the assistance contributed by the international community has at times been substantial, the pressures created by the presence of large refugee populations and sudden mass exoduses in recent years have been enormous.








More than two-thirds of all international assistance is channelled through UNHCR. With a staff of about 4,000 people in over 100 countries and annual expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion, the UNHCR protects and assists refugees and works toward one of three durable solutions: (1) voluntary repatriation, (2) local integration, or (3) third-country resettlement.








The growth in numbers and the complexity of refugee flows in recent years have presented enormous challenges to UNHCR to plan, manage, and fund its worldwide network of protection and relief programs. It is increasingly asked to bear more responsibility and leadership, but with diminishing resources. Despite its size and budget, the UNHCR is chronically underfunded and understaffed. It serves twice the number of refugees as it did a decade ago, but the financial support for basic care and maintenance for refugees worldwide has remained virtually the same. Thus, the UNHCR has been in many cases unable to fulfill its mandate in






 












Page 7




recent years because it lacks the necessary financial resources and personnel.








The Dimensions of the Refugee Problem








For many reasonswar, famine, poverty, environmental degradation, and persecutiona large portion of humanity is now on the move. Most of this movement occurs in the developing world, although larger numbers of people are migrating both from the Third World to the developed world and from Eastern Europe to the West. To a large extent, states have had great difficulty coping with these massive flows of migration, which are having disruptive effects within both the sending and the receiving countries.








The magnitude of refugee flows in recent years has generated urgent concern throughout the world. Widely perceived as an unprecedented crisis, these flows have produced a mixture of humanitarian concern for the millions of people forced into exile and fear for the potential threat to the social, economic, and political stability of host states caused by streams of unwanted newcomers. States are struggling to strike a proper balance between the need to maintain control over their borders and the need to protect refugees who seek asylum within their borders.








As alarming as current numbers are, there is nothing new in the phenomenon of forced displacement. Explosions of political and ethnic violence, persecution, and pogroms have produced large-scale movements of refugees throughout history. Some previous global migrations have been comparatively much larger in scope than contemporary population movements. For example, during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the intercontinental migrations from the Old World to the New World involved some 50 million people, many of whom were fleeing persecution and pogroms in Europe.








The growing recognition in the West of the refugee problem as a factor in international relations is, however, a phenomenon of only the last 70 years. This is because the twentieth century has produced the greatest number of refugees ever in history. Indeed, the twentieth century is, as the German novelist Heinrich BÃ¶ll once remarked, "the century of refugees and prisoners." Millions of refugees were generated by World War I and the breakup






 












Page 8




of multinational empires in the early part of the century. World War II uprooted approximately 30 million civilians in Europe alone. The Cold War of the 1950s was marked by refugees fleeing the newly established communist regimes in Eastern Europe. The 1960s and 1970s witnessed new Third World refugee movements uprooted in the wake of anticolonial struggles and conflicts within newly independent states and by the economic migration of about 10 million guestworkers to Europe. The late 1970s and 1980s saw more massive refugee exoduses in the Third World with consequent spillover in the form of asylum-seekers in the industrialized world, and the 1990s have brought growing East-West migration and increasing South-North immigration pressures from regions on the southern peripheries of Europe and the United States. The refugee problem receives increasing international prominence due to the fact that policies affecting refugees are linked directly with the political and security interests of states.








Refugee Movements in the Post-Cold War Era








While violence and persecution have produced large-scale movements of refugees throughout history, there are many new and unique features to the contemporary refugee crisis.








Recent advances in communication and transportation have had a dramatic effect on the situation. Communications satellites transmit the reality of more prosperous and safer conditions in the West to the most impoverished and oppressive regions of the world, while making the West far more cognizant of worldwide suffering, the magnitude of the refugee problem, and its responsibility to the rest of humankind. The greater availability of long-range transportation facilitates transcontinental movements and makes it possible for people to reach distant countries where they can seek asylum and try to improve their situation.








The 1990s are years of fundamental political and economic changes in the international system. This fact is reflected by mass movements of people, which in turn affect political, economic, and strategic developments worldwide. Refugee movements played a key role in bringing down the Berlin Wall and in bringing about the unification of the two Germanies, thus generating the most significant transformation in international relations since World






 












Page 9




War II. Early in the post-Cold War era, refugee movements precipitated external intervention in Iraqi affairs on behalf of the Kurds. In the early 1990s, maltreatment of minorities, forced displacement, famine, and environmental damage in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, Southern Africa, Liberia, Burma, and most recently parts of the former Yugoslavia and the ex-Soviet Union have preoccupied international leaders.








The end of the Cold War has also revealed the scope and intensity of specific local tensions around the world. The most common form of warfare in the developing world and Eastern Europe in the 1990s is internal conflict, fueled by the increasing availability of modern weaponry, sharp socioeconomic inequalities, and human rights abuses. Contemporary refugee movements are likely to be the result of ethnic, communal, and religious conflicts. Ethnic antagonisms between Armenians and Azeris, Hutus and Tutsis, Tamils and Sinhalese, Serbs and Croatians and Muslims, and Palestinians and Israelis illustrate the local roots of many refugee exoduses.








Internal wars have been fought not only by military means but by preventing international aid from reaching people living in conflict areas. In such situations, the international community is frequently unable to assist or intervene, and the ability of governments or international organizations to influence the behavior of warring factions is limited or virtually nil. For example, in the former Yugoslavia, UNHCR staff not only distribute relief but also try to restrain ethnic cleansing and protect human rights. In the face of cynical manipulation by all the protagonists to the conflict, however, these humanitarian efforts have been stopgap measures only. One of the principal lessons of the conflict in Bosnia is that the humanitarian mandate of UNHCR cannot be viewed as a satisfactory substitute for wider-ranging political solutions.








While refugee flows frequently occur as the result of persecution at the hands of brutal rulers or because of indiscriminate violence and the collapse of civil authority, external powers can significantly influence the factors that generate them. By arming past and present dictators like Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Pol Pot of Cambodia, Mohammed Siad Barre of Somalia, and Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia, among others, outside powers help prolong instability, exacerbate nationality conflicts, divert scarce resources into militaristic activities, and increase repression, thereby multiplying the numbers of refugees. Only when governments and international organizations address






 












Page 10




the refugee issue in its international political context will the problem be given sufficient priority and resources by policymakers.








Challenges Confronting UNHCR and the International Community








The rapidly changing international context and the highly politicized nature of refugee problems are likely both to determine the humanitarian needs of the 1990s and to define the limitations under which UNHCR will have to operate.








Complex Emergencies








Refugee crises are complex emergencies, combining political instability, ethnic tensions, armed conflict, economic collapse, and the disintegration of civil society. Refugee movements frequently spill over borders and aggravate existing problems, such as environmental damage or severe food shortages. Rather than being confined to single countries, refugee emergencies often affect entire regions, such as the Horn of Africa or the Balkans. In recent years, few refugee crises have been fully resolved. Consequently, resources from one crisis often have not been made available for use in the next.








Assisting and Protecting Internally Displaced Persons








A critical weakness of the international humanitarian system is that at present there is no special international organization to protect and assist the world's 25 million internally displaced persons. While there is a clear mandate for the protection and the provision of humanitarian assistance to refugees, there is a lack of clarity within existing international instruments regarding the allocation of responsibilities and mechanisms for addressing the immediate needs of the internally displaced. There is no adequate body of international law to regulate their treatment by governments. Thus, internally displaced people are unprotected precisely because they do not become refugees, remaining instead within the boundaries of their own countries.








Nevertheless, in the post-Cold War period, the UNHCR is being asked to assume new roles within a de facto expanded man-






 












Page 11




date in an increasing number of internal conflicts. In the former Yugoslavia, it is the leading UN agency for humanitarian assistance both to displaced people and to besieged populations, and it is a partner with UN peacekeeping troops on the ground. In northern Kenya and Tajikistan, it has launched cross-border operations with the intention of stabilizing populations at home so refugee flight is unnecessary. In these cases, and in many others around the world, the responses demanded of UNHCR extend far beyond its traditional humanitarian role of working only with people who have crossed international borders to seek asylum. The challenge of assisting and protecting people within their own countries raises difficult questions concerning UNHCR's mandate and fundamental principles.








Repatriation and Reintegration








The immediate short-term issues of the refugee problem include dealing with the consequences of refugee exoduses and determining when and how repatriation and reintegration are most appropriate. Even as new refugee crises emerge, there remain numerous long-standing refugee populations in the Third Worldsome dating back 10 years, others 20 or more years. Unlike earlier forced migrations that were ultimately resolved by repatriation or overseas resettlement, during the 1980s Third World refugees found only temporary asylum in neighboring states. During most of the 1980s, the majority of Third World refugee populations languished in camps or survived illegally without any hope of a permanent place of settlement or eventual return home.








Although the international community is still dealing with immediate problems of handling sudden mass outflows of refugees and problems of reception in countries of asylum, there is much greater attention today on repatriation and even returns to situations of widespread conflict. About 2.5 million refugees returned home in 1993. If large numbers of refugees continue to repatriate in the coming years, the focus of concern must inevitably shift from repatriation to more long-standing reintegration and development. It is becoming increasingly evident that in countries such as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ethiopia, and Mozambique one of the preconditions for successful returns is development aid and reintegration assistance aimed at alleviating poverty in countries of origin. Without careful reintegration and reconciliation,






 












Page 12




returning refugees will compete for scarce developmental resources, which, in turn, might result in fierce political and economic competition with local populations that did not flee.








Repatriation and reconstruction raise new, difficult questions for UNHCR. For how long should UNHCR seek to provide protection to returning refugees, particularly in situations of continuing conflict? Does UNHCR have the capacity to engage in human rights monitoring in countries of origin? How much and what kinds of assistance are required for returnees to reestablish themselves successfully? Should international economic development agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provide refugee-targeted development assistance from the early stages of a repatriation? Should assistance be extended not only to returning refugees but also to needy local populations? Although answers to these questions have yet to be found, they are of critical importance if UNHCR is to respond effectively in the future.








Going beyond traditional refugee emergency assistance to facilitating reintegration of returnees requires the development of new or different competencies on the part of international agencies. A focus on reintegration will involve rethinking the roles and mandates of international organizations and NGOs; the shifting of their operational priorities from receiving countries to countries of return; and closer cooperation between development, human rights, and refugee agencies than has hitherto been the case.








Asylum Crises in the West








While in the Third World the contemporary situation is characterized by refugee-generating ethnic conflicts and repatriations, the numbers of asylum-seekers in the West rose from 90,000 in 1983 to about 825,000 in 1992. The attitudes of receiving countries, many of which have relied on migrants to fill a variety of labor needs in the past, have become increasingly negative and have spawned xenophobia, racism, and a deterioration in community relations. As a result, the advanced industrialized states are increasingly reluctant to let refugees enter their countries to apply for political asylum. To date, the political debate in the North concerning asylum-seekers and migrants has largely been informed by governmental concerns about border controls, not by






 












Page 13




human rights concerns. In Eastern and Central Europe, the collapse of communism has greatly increased the numbers of asylumseekers and migrants and has opened up the possibility of mass migration from the East. Refugees have become an increasingly contentious issue in the post-Cold War era, particularly in Europe.








Confusions abound, both at the institutional level and in the minds of the general public, regarding definitions, standards of treatment of nonnationals, and methods for the management of the movement, reception, resettlement, or return of refugees. In shaping policy responses to the asylum crisis, many Western leaders have been prone to being influenced by extremists who seek to exploit anti-immigrant feelings and tensions. As a result, the refugee problem has reached such a critical point in some Western countries that the very institution of asylum is being threatened. What is required in today's situation is for political leaders to articulate and guide public opinion regarding the complex facets of the refugee problem and the shortand long-range measures that might help address its various aspects.








Migration of People Worldwide








It is important to recognize that the nature of migratory movements is changing worldwide. The refugee problem is a part of the emerging global crisis of mass migration, which is generated by economic, political, and social changes. The growing interdependence of the economies of nation statesincluding the creation of regional free-trade zones, the transnational impact of the world's communication, media, and transport systems, and the ever-increasing gap between poor and rich countrieshas caused millions of people from less developed countries to seek opportunities in other parts of the world. The numbers of sending and receiving countries throughout the world continue to expand, and social networks, or bridgeheads, support migration flows once they have begun. The number of people seeking entry has increased not only in the advanced industrialized states of North America and Europe but also in the newly industrialized states of Asia and the oil-producing states of the Middle East. The contemporary global migration situation is considered by the United Nations to be one of the top five issues of the 1990s.

Organizational and Other Constraints Facing UNHCR








Extended Emergency Relief Care








Today, UNHCR is concerned primarily with meeting the immediate needs of refugees and internally displaced people who live under conditions that are precarious, difficult, and frequently dangerous. For example, UNHCR has committed approximately one-quarter of its staff and one-third of its total funds worldwide to providing assistance and protection to over 4 million people in the former Yugoslavia. UNHCR is increasingly concerned that it will be swamped by its involvement in chronic internal conflicts, such as in Bosnia, and that the political interest of donor governments to continue funding such protracted operations will eventually wane, leaving UNHCR with limited resources to assist dependent civilian populations.








The priority given to extended emergency relief aid in prolonged refugee situations has swallowed up most of UNHCR's resources, and it has also made it more difficult to achieve traditional solutions. Voluntary repatriation is not a realistic solution until political circumstances in the country of origin have changed. Local integration is virtually impossible in situations of mass influx where land and other resources are scarce and where ethnic or religious tensions exist. Resettlement in third countries is likewise a solution for only a very small percentage of the world's refugeesless than 1 percent of the world's refugees were resettled during 1993. Faced with economic difficulties and growing popular xenophobia, Western nations are much more reluctant to admit large numbers of people who are not easily assimilable. There is a need to go further than traditional solutions to improve conditions in countries of origin so the majority of refugees can either remain at home or repatriate in safety while at the same time preserving the most fundamental principle of refugee protectionthe right of refugees to flee their countries, to seek asylum from persecution in other countries, and not to be returned into the hands of their persecutors.








Challenges of a Preventive Strategy








In the 1990s, the international community must place a greater emphasis on addressing the underlying causes of the refugee






 












Page 15




problem through a preventive policy that includes early warning, preventive diplomacy and on ensuring respect for human rights. Recently, UNHCR has adopted a comprehensive protection strategy designed both to address the root causes of refugee flows, with the aim of preventing the underlying conditions that force people to flee, and to reduce or contain refugee flows that have already begun, with the aim of providing immediate protection and assistance and obviating the need for further displacement.








This shift to a preventive strategy, however, cannot be accomplished easily or in a short time. Involvement in internal conflicts requires skills and competencies that many UNHCR staff do not now possess. In situations such as in Bosnia or Somalia, UNHCR is using techniques closely akin to the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), but without the special training, skills, and experience of ICRC staff. While in countries of asylum the UNHCR has a well-established history of providing protection and assistance to refugees, in countries undergoing civil war the internally displaced are often viewed as the enemy, and UNHCR staff are seen as sympathizers. The UNHCR finds itself working with opposition groups and guerrilla forces as well as with recognized governments. Under extremely stressful and dangerous conditions, UNHCR staff now engage in activities that include protecting civilians against reprisals and forced displacement, relocating and evacuating civilians from conflict areas, and assisting besieged populations who choose not to move from their homes. This is done without any firm institutional and legal basis. For many UNHCR officials and staff these are entirely new activities. If UNHCR is to respond effectively to these new situations of internal displacement, there is an urgent need both to reorganize its staffing, training, and operations to reflect the new roles and to give it the necessary resources and mandate to do the job.








Financial Constraints








One of the most significant weaknesses of UNHCR is its dependence on voluntary contributions to carry out new programs. Apart from a modest annual contribution from the UN Regular Budget toward administrative expenses, all of UNHCR's resources depend on voluntary contributions. Its assistance activities are divided broadly into General and Special Programs. Each year, UNHCR's Executive Committee approves a General Program budget, which comprises activities financed through the






 












Page 16




annual program as well as the Emergency Fund, and appeals to all UN members to provide the resources needed to cover the program year. The primary allocation of these resources goes to the traditional areas of the high commissioner's competence: emergency relief, voluntary repatriation, integration into host societies, and resettlement.








In addition to its General Program budget, UNHCR, at the request of the secretary-general or the United Nations General Assembly, undertakes Special Programs that include major new and unforeseen emergency operations (such as in Bosnia or Rwanda) and transportation and rehabilitation assistance to refugees and displaced people who have returned to their homes (such as in Mozambique). Special Programs are the subject of specific fund-raising appeals to interested governments and are financed from trust funds constructed with particular purposes and conditions. Thus, UNHCR must raise funds for each new refugee problem.








The 1990s have presented UNHCR with several new refugee emergencies, and its overall expenditures have therefore grown significantly. In 1991, as a result of emergency relief operations in northern Iraq and the Horn of Africa, total voluntary funds expenditure amounted to $862.5 million, an increase of almost 60 percent over 1990. In 1992 and 1993, new refugee and humanitarian crises in Bangladesh, Central Africa, the Horn of Africa, Southern Africa, and the former Yugoslavia, as well as continued responsibilities in northern Iraq and new repatriation programs in Cambodia, Ethiopia, and Mozambique, pushed UNHCR expenditures to about $1.5 billion annually. The sum for 1994 will be at least that high.








While the amounts for Special Programs have increased substantially, in recent years, contributions by donor countries to UNHCR's core activities (General Programs) have not kept pace with the ever-growing numbers of refugees. Indeed, the financial support levels for General Programs have remained virtually unchanged during the past decade. The lack of General Program funds has threatened to reduce or postpone repatriation programs, cancel needed improvements in refugee facilities, and force UNHCR to make cuts in certain nutrition and education programs.








The flow of assistance from donor governments is neither reliable nor always in the most appropriate form. Funding is often earmarked for particular uses; it is frequently provided late and






 












Page 17




does not allow sufficiently for operational flexibility. In addition, the funding of humanitarian operations has often been infused with a strong political element. During the Cold War, for example, Western donor governments often funded refugee programs to express condemnation of communist governments whose repressive policies forced their citizens to flee their countries. Today, however, refugee situations increasingly are seen as local or regional problems of little, if any, foreign policy or security concern to major donor governments. Without compelling strategic and ideological motivations, funding for refugee operations is in danger of being cut back in favor of the domestic priorities of industrialized states.








Challenges of Addressing Human Rights Violations








A final organizational constraint that makes preventive action difficult for UNHCR is that the root causes of contemporary refugee situations require political intervention against governments that violate human rights, preferably before people need to flee. For the most part, UN institutions have been unable or unwilling either to prevent human rights violations or to punish those responsible. In some measure, this is because prevention of human rights abuses depends on overcoming the barrier of national sovereignty, something no international organization has yet managed to accomplish consistently. As it is presently structured, UNHCR does not have the capability to politically intervene against governments that violate human rights. The UNHCR was designed to appear nonpolitical and strictly humanitarian in order to gain permission to work in host countries and secure funding from donor governments. UNHCR officials thus avoid raising political questions for fear of overstepping their mandate or damaging relations with sensitive governments, many of whom would consider such intervention as an interference in their internal affairs.








Hindered both by its dependence on voluntary contributions to carry out its programs and its need to obtain the acquiescence of host governments, UNHCR alone cannot resolve the global refugee problem. A comprehensive solution requires efforts going well beyond the scope of humanitarian organizations. International and regional peace, security, human rights, and economic structures must be strengthened with broader mandates and financial support to become more constructive interlocutors.






 












Page 18




A Framework for Future Action








Refugee emergencies of the post-Cold War era have highlighted the fact that combating the causes of forced migration cannot proceed solely within the confines of international humanitarian organizations. There is a need for a better interface between relief agencies and political and security operations, on the one hand, and between emergency relief, development, and human rights mechanisms on the other. A multidimensional strategy to refugee crises must involve practically the entire UN system, as well as regional organizations and NGOs, and it requires enhancing these organizations' capacities to defuse, deter, and mediate incipient crises before they may need more serious and costly trans-sovereign intervention. The United Nations must be able to respond more quickly and effectively in order to address humanitarian needs in a growing number of emergency situations. Prevention is itself a form of intervention to stop a major crisis from expanding.








The end of the Cold War gives the international community a unique opportunity to lay the foundations of an action program that includes the elements outlined below.








Establishing and Utilizing More Effective Early Warning Systems








Early information on impending crises is critical not only for possible preventive action but also for effective and timely humanitarian responses and adequate preparedness. Establishing an effective monitoring body within the United Nations that would alert the secretary-general, the emergency relief coordinator, and the Security Council to potential conflicts and refugee emergencies could provide an early warning mechanism. The UN system should be broadly mobilized to provide timely warnings. Members of the monitoring body would include UN officials, NGO representatives, and governments.








For example, the capability and mandate of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights needs to be strengthened to enable it to monitor and collect accurate and up-to-date human rights information, identify situations that have the potential to produce mass refugee flows, and bring these to the attention of the international community. Furthermore, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights could assign its Sub-Commission






 












Page 19




on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to monitor the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities and to alert the secretary-general when action is needed. Similarly, the early warning capabilities of UNHCR and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) should be bolstered, and full support should be extended to initiatives aimed toward sharing such information at interagency levels.








Potentially among the most important new instruments added to the capacities of the United Nations is its ability to send fact-finding missions to defuse disputes and prevent major crises from expanding. Fact-finding missions are likely to play important roles at the early stages of conflict development and may prevent the misunderstandings that escalate conflict and result in more rigid positions. Observers in the field can also serve as a deterrent for those considering actions that cause forcible displacement. Nongovernmental organizations, such as Amnesty International or Helsinki Watch, may in some instances be more successful than UN monitors in collecting information and bringing human and minority rights abuses to the attention of the international community. It is not enough, however, for monitors to be in place and for information about potential refugee movements to be widely availablepolitical obstacles frequently must be overcome to enable the relevant international and regional organizations to react in time to minimize suffering and problems of insecurity.








Early warning programs must be connected to decision-making and response strategies both in governments and in relief, development, and human rights organizations. Moreover, in many recent refugee crises, information about impending conflicts and mass migrations was available and well known in advance, but there was no willingness to act upon it. In exYugoslavia and in Somalia, for instance, international agencies and analysts had accurately predicted what would happen well before the disasters unfolded, but there existed no mechanisms or institutions for averting conflicts or for dealing effectively and rapidly with these crises at a time when they were still manageable. Unless trigger mechanisms for prompt action regarding conflicts and refugee problems are established, and unless existing tools of diplomacy, human rights, and conflict resolution are reinforced, any measures that might be taken to prepare for future refugee flows are likely to be of limited use. The value of such measures depends largely on the willingness of states and






 












Page 20




international organizations to take the necessary concerted preventive action.








Interagency Cooperation








Interagency cooperation is the key to a more effective response to the problems of displacement. If UNHCR hopes to ensure cooperation in achieving a solution to displacement and phasing out the political source of such operations in the future, it must continue to work at improving coordination with other international, regional, and nongovernmental agencies, particularly in strategic planning and in making legal and institutional arrangements with other agencies charged with responding to refugees.








Improving Overall UN Coordination








Making the system work better requires a more effective division of labor among those responding to the humanitarian, political, and security dimensions of internal conflicts. The UN General Assembly took an important first step in December 1991 by creating the Office of Emergency Relief Coordinator, charged with providing a focal pointin government, intergovernmental, and nongovernmental organization communicationduring UN emergency relief operations. In early 1992, Jan Eliasson, the emergency relief coordinator, became the first under secretary-general in the newly formed UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA). The creation of the DHA was an essential step in clarifying and assigning responsibilities to UN agencies in complex emergencies. This is particularly apparent in situations where mandates overlap or where no entity has a clear mandate to act; in making quick decisions on the best coordinating mechanisms to respond to humanitarian emergencies at the field level; and in negotiating access for these agencies without waiting for a formal government request. Donor states influential in creating the DHA envision it gathering data and managing information, mobilizing resources and orchestrating field activities, negotiating a framework of action with political authorities, and providing overall leadership to humanitarian aid efforts.








Unfortunately, in the past two years the vision has not been realized. Lack of adequate staff in the field, a rapid succession of humanitarian crises in the post-Cold War period, and incompletely established and largely untested mechanisms for interagency coordination have been problematic for DHA, leaving it






 












Page 21




wholly unprepared to assume its intended leadership role in most of the recent emergencies. Perhaps the greatest difficulty confronting DHA is that specialized agencies such as UNHCR possess a high degree of constitutional autonomy and consistently resist any attempt by DHA to impose strong authority over their actions in humanitarian emergencies. If DHA's presence is to lead to improvements in the response capacity of the United Nations, the significance of its coordinating role must be recognized by UN HCR and other agencies. DHA must also be equipped both politically and financially to undertake its assigned tasks effectively.








Coordinating Relief and Development








Closer coordination between UNDP and UNHCR represents a key solution to situations involving refugees, returnees, and the internally displaced. Cooperation between these agencies already takes place in joint projects aimed at assisting a variety of displaced groups in Central America, Mozambique, and Cambodia. In the early 1990s, UNHCR and UNDP also established joint management structures to create preventive zones and cross-mandate programs to prevent displacement and to stabilize border areas in the Horn of Africa.








Although there have been greater efforts at UNDP-UNHCR coordination in field operations, far more effective interagency planning, consultation, and implementation are required. Institutional constraints inhibit closer cooperation between the two agencies. The UNHCR is not a development agency, and although it can be a catalyst in initiating development-oriented assistance, the UNDP is more suited to the task. Unfortunately, in most countries humanitarian or emergency relief aid is administratively and programmatically divorced from developmental concerns. Thus a ''development gap" exists between short-term humanitarian relief assistance and long-term development. UNHCR-UNDP joint projects have attempted to fill this gap in Central America, the Horn of Africa, and Indochina, where there are large returnee and displaced populations, but because these projects have been small in size and of a limited nature they have only partially filled the gap between immediate assistance and longer-term development. The task of the overall rehabilitation of these communities must be carried out by UNDP or other UN agencies that can more appropriately deal with reconstruction and development. This requires a full transfer of responsibility from UNHCR to UNDP






 












Page 22




after the immediate emergency relief phase is overagain, an idea that UNDP consistently resists because it views itself as having a development purpose without even a partial focus on emergency situations.








Increasing Human Rights Monitoring and Enforcement








Greater development assistance alone is not enough to create safe conditions for refugees; international cooperation must also ensure democratization and respect for human rights. Neither the enforcement of good governance or respect for human rights, however, fall within UNHCR's domain. The existing UN human rights machinery needs to be strengthened and applied more effectively to deal with refugees, returnees, and the internally displaced, because it is integral to the success of UN peacemaking.








In recent years, the UN human rights system has demonstrated its potential capabilities to respond quickly to a select number of human rights emergencies involving the internally displaced. In 1992, it called an unprecedented meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights and appointed a special rapporteur to investigate human rights abuses of minority populations in Bosnia and to make recommendations to the Security Council. Similarly, an incriminating UN report on human rights violations in Iraq, including the alleged forced deportation and murder of the Shi'ite population by the Iraqi army, provided humanitarian justification for the establishment of an air exclusion zone over southern Iraq.








At the same time, the United Nations Centre for Human Rights, through its Advisory Services, has worked on a number of UN peacekeeping or peace-enforcement missions, providing significant technical assistance and cooperation to the UN human rights presence in the field in areas such as El Salvador, Somalia, and Cambodia. These actions underscore the potentially key role of the UN human rights machinery, the growing involvement of the Security Council in humanitarian matters, and the recognition that the promotion and protection of the human rights of refugees, returnees, and the internally displaced are an integral part of UN peacemaking.








At present the UN human rights program is grossly understaffed and underfunded. The Advisory Services section of the Centre for Human Rights, for example, has an annual budget of approximately $700,000. This is a minuscule sum in view of both






 












Page 23




the massive amounts being spent on relief and peacekeeping operations and the potential of the Advisory Services section to strengthen civil society, to promote democratic and pluralistic institutions and procedures, and thereby to prevent human rights abuses and mass displacements.








If the United Nations hopes to respond more effectively to the refugee crisis, it must strengthen its capacity to monitor developments in human rights issues. The creation of the post of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in late 1993 was a step in this direction; however, a greater protection role in the field should be granted to UN human rights personnel. In the short term, the Centre for Human Rights can strengthen its coverage in the field by the continued expansion of its advisory services and technical cooperation. In addition, by offering services such as training judges, strengthening electoral commissions, establishing ombudsmen, training prison staff, and advising governments on constitutions and legislation regarding national minorities and human rights, the Centre for Human Rights is likely to be more successful in its activities and less threatening to governments than in more straightforward, fieldwork-oriented human rights monitoring.








In recent years, there has been much discussion about the creation of special human rights machinery for the internally displaced. At its 1993 session, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights reappointed the special representative on the internally displaced to monitor mass displacements of people, to collect information on violations of their human rights, and to help to sustain a positive dialogue toward achieving solutions with governments of the country of origin. The special representative must be given proper political support and funding, however, to carry out his tasks effectively. A General Assembly resolution confirming the role and mandate of the special representative is now required to institutionalize this office further. A significant first step toward trying to deal with the problem would be to designate a permanent representative for the internally displaced. This representative could undertake fact-finding missions, intercede with governments, embark on activities that strengthen institutions for sustaining democracy and civil society, publish reports, and bring violations to the attention of human rights bodies and the Security Council.








Recently, there have been attempts to create closer links between UNHCR and the human rights organs and activities of the UN system. In 1992, for example, the Centre for Human Rights






 












Page 24




and UNHCR drafted a memorandum of understanding so human rights information collected by UNHCR could be forwarded to the Centre for Human Rights. At the end of 1992, the two agencies established a joint working group to study mechanisms and approaches for enhanced and continuous collaboration. Such consultation should be strengthened to ensure that displacements emanating from human rights violations are brought to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights and that the work of the centre's Advisory Services section adequately addresses human rights issues associated with refugee movements and internal displacements.








Providing Asylum and Stability








The refugee crises in ex-Yugoslavia, Somalia, Haiti, and numerous other places and the reluctance of states to open their borders to people who are forcibly driven from their homes and subjected to murder, physical abuse, and starvation illustrate the vital importance of maintaining the principle of asylum. The major lesson we can learn from past efforts to deal with refugee problems is that building walls is no answer to those who feel compelled to move. The need to assure asylum to refugees is critical to maintaining human rights protection worldwide. The capacity of Western countries to improve prospects for granting asylum in the Third World depends on the fairness and generosity of their own policies in the heart of Europe and in the Caribbean and on the assistance they provide to others.








A generous commitment to asylum is not simply a matter of charity or burden-sharing; it is also a matter of regularizing and controlling large numbers of people whose irregular situation creates interstate tensions and regional instability. The success of economic liberalism and political pluralism in the new democracies of Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union is of decisive importance, not only in averting future refugee and migrant flows but also in the political realm. Unduly restrictionist Western policies would lead to more isolation and deprivation in those countries forced to play host to rejected refugees and migrants.








Liberalizing domestic regimes and economic systems is scarcely possible without free movement of people, goods, and ideas. No single international development is likely to be more successful in improving economic growth in developing countries






 












Page 25




and Eastern Europe (thereby reducing economic incentives for emigration) than trade liberalization aimed at reducing economic disparities between countries in the South and North and the East and West. An angry, excluded world outside the West would inevitably give rise to conditions in which extremist and aggressive groups and governments can emerge and pose new political and security threats. Dealing effectively with refugee movements both at home and abroad through a combination of generous asylum policies and preventive programs in aid, trade, and human rights diplomacy is, therefore, in the interest of the industrialized states and coincides with their search for long-term global stability.








The Importance of American Leadership








Never before has it been so appropriate to launch a series of bold initiatives to deal with national and international policies and practices toward refugees. Although the leadership of the UNHCR is crucial, it is not enough. The president of the United States and other political leaders also hold key assets in any serious effort to strengthen the UN refugee system, and UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali must be prepared to proceed with imagination and political courage to invigorate multilateral mechanisms. These initiatives would draw attention to the serious deterioration in norms and proper conduct that has occurred in some states with respect to the treatment of citizens and refugees. They would attempt to deal with the causes of refugee flows rather than with the consequences.








The United Nations is still the only body capable of managing many of the complex global problems of the post-Cold War era. The international community needs to take advantage of both the structural and technical reforms that have occurred within the UN system and the higher expectations for the United Nations that now exist. Events in Iraq, in ex-Yugoslavia, and in Somalia, however, have demonstrated that the United Nations is not a separate entity capable of imposing order by itself, nor is it capable of achieving success in every endeavor. The United Nations is the sum of its member states, and U.S. and Western leadership in invigorating multilateral programs is a key factor if the United Nations is to achieve optimum results. The United States is still the only nation whose leadership most other nations are willing to follow, and it is the country most capable of setting up all sorts of measures to direct international efforts toward a constructive






 












Page 26




goal. Therefore, American leadership is vital in galvanizing collective efforts to resolve many of the complex humanitarian problems of the post-Cold War era. Without active U.S. involvement, the international community would be limited to reactive damagecontrol measures in the event of humanitarian crises. A failure by the United States and its allies to increase the capacities of the United Nations at this time would almost inevitably lead to a breakdown in international security, to costly military interventions to restore order, and to further needless drains on aid programs to deal with war-caused famines or refugee movements in the future. Not since 1945 has the United States and the international community been presented with such an opportunity to make substantial progress on many political and humanitarian issues. That opportunity should now be seized.








A Final Note








The time has come to broaden the scope of approach to the refugee problem to the larger agenda for peace and security in the post-Cold War world. Generosity and humanitarian action are still essential, but they alone are insufficient to deal with today's global refugee crisis. The time cannot be too distant when governments and people in the West will become profoundly tired of refugee emergencies, and the consequences of our compassion fatigue will be dehumanizing to us all. What is required is not only rededication to some fundamental values regarding asylum and human rights protection but also a reorientation of policy that more effectively addresses the abuses, violence, and social inequities that cause forced migration.

2 Chronology








REFUGEES HAVE EXISTED FOR AS LONG as humankind has lived in organized groups where intolerance and persecution have been prominent; however, refugees have only become an issue of international concern during the twentieth century. Organized international efforts to assist and protect refugees began in 1921 when the League of Nations appointed the first high commissioner for refugees. The following chronology provides a listing of the major events in the development of the global refugee problem and in the international community's response to the issue during the past 70 years.









1914-
1919



Millions of people are displaced and made stateless in Europe and the Middle East as a result of World War I and the breakup of the Hapsburg, Romanov, Ottoman, and Hohenzollern empires.1921The League of Nations appoints Fridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian, as the first high commissioner for refugees. 




Over 1 million Russians become refugees as a result of the collapse of czarist Russia, the Russian Civil War, the RussoPolish War, and the Soviet famine.



1922The Graeco-Turkish War of 1922 displaces more than 1 million people. Following the war, Nansen negotiates the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey, and, later, between Greece and Bulgaria.

3 Biographical Sketches








THIS BIOGRAPHICAL SELECTION IS ONLY A PARTIAL LIST of men and women who are important in the area of refugees, either because they were refugees themselves or because they actively sought to find solutions to the refugee problem. The chapter is divided into two sections: distinguished refugees and activists for refugees.








Distinguished Refugees








Many more people should be included in a list of famous refugees, but space does not permit it. Every year there will be more people who earn recognition. Each influx of refugees brings with it people who will go on to distinguish themselves in their new homelands. They will become some of the poets and writers, scientists and doctors, politicians, educators, and philosophers of future generations. The schools and universities of receiving countries are now graduating refugee children, many of whom have distinguished themselves in their studies. Since refugees often need a great deal of help, it is easy for receiving countries sometimes to forget that refugees themselves have a great deal to give. In the future, lists like this one will also include people with Chinese, Cambodian, Ethiopian, Sudanese, Spanish, Croat, Serb, and Bosnian names.

Yasir Arafat (1929- 








Yasir Arafat was born in Jerusalem in 1929, before the establishment of the state of Israel left the Palestinians without a country. Both his father and his older brother were committed antiZionists. It was in the local secondary school that Arafat first began to develop an interest in politics. Arafat went to Cairo to study engineering and continued his political activities there. He was elected president of the League of Palestinian Students in 1952 and served in the Egyptian army during the Suez Crisis in 1956. He then worked as an engineer in Kuwait from 1957 to 1965. In 1956, he helped establish the Arab guerrilla movement called Al Fatah. This organization developed into the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), and Arafat became leader of the PLO in 1968. The PLO was, at that time, the government of the stateless, displaced Palestinian people who were living in refugee camps in what had been Palestine. As leader of the PLO, Arafat finally recognized Israel and denounced terrorist methods in 1989, and in 1990 he announced the existence of the Palestinian state. His reputation with the West was damaged when he supported Saddam Hussein's regime during the Gulf War. Palestine is still not recognized by all countries, and the struggle of Palestinians to establish their own state continues with Arafat at the forefront of the effort. In 1993, Arafat signed an agreement with Israel regarding the future autonomy of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 








Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906-1943)








Dietrich Bonhoeffer was born in 1906 in Breslau. He was the son of a professor at Berlin University, and he and his twin sister enjoyed a happy childhood in pre-Second World War Germany. Bonhoeffer studied theology at Berlin and Thubingin universities and Union Theological Seminary in New York. He became a Lutheran minister and took up a professorship at Berlin University in 1931. From the outset of Hitler's rise to power, Bonhoeffer was an outspoken adversary of Nazism and was a central figure in the church's opposition to Hitler. Bonhoeffer became a refugee when his position put him in danger. He went to New York in 1939, but remained a refugee for only two weeks. He realized he had to ''share the trials of this time" with the German people. It was after considerable soul searching that Bonhoeffer concluded it was right to kill someone as evil as Hitler. Bonhoeffer took part






 












Page 43




in a plot to plant a bomb in an aircraft that was to carry the fuhrer. The bomb failed to detonate, the plotters were arrested, and Bonhoeffer was tortured and imprisoned. He was hanged in prison at Flossenberg in 1943 at age 39. Since then his writings, published postmortem, have made him a renowned and respected contemporary theologian.








Willy Brandt (1913-1993)








Willy Brandt was born Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm in 1913 in Lubeck, Germany. He left school in 1932 to become an apprentice shipbuilder. An outspoken anti-Nazi and a socialist worker, he held dangerous opinions in the changing political climate of Germany in the 1930s. He emigrated from Germany to Norway, became a Norwegian citizen, and changed his name to Willy Brandt. He then attended the University of Oslo and became a journalist. During World War II Brandt was active in the Norwegian and German resistance movements. He was able to return to Germany in 1945 and regained his German citizenship in 1947. Brandt was elected to the German parliament in 1949 as the member for Berlin. In 1957, he was elected mayor of Berlin and served in that capacity until 1966. In 1964, he became chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). He was minister of foreign affairs and vice chancellor, and then, in 1969, he became chancellor of West Germany. Brandt resigned after a 1974 scandal named his personal aide as an East German spy. He continued to work in international politics, however, including four years as a member of the European parliament. Willy Brandt worked tirelessly for reconciliation between East and West Germany during the Cold War. This policy was known as Ostpolitik. For his efforts he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971. He received numerous other awards, including the Reinhold Neibuhr Award in 1972 and the B'nai B'rith Gold Medal in 1981.








Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956)








Bertolt Brecht was first a refugee from Nazism in Germany and then from McCarthyism in the United States. Born in Germany in 1898, he would become one of the most influential dramatists of the twentieth century. His work in Germany before World War II included the wildly successful Three Penny Opera, which he wrote with Kurt Weill in 1928. Brecht's work was despised by Hitler, and he found it necessary to leave Germany in 1933. Joined by his wife






 












Page 44




and son, he went first to Denmark and then to Sweden. As the Nazis closed in, the family decided to go to the United States, hoping to get aboard a boat in Finland to make the crossing. Their visas were delayed, however, and by the time they could leave there was no escape by sea. They went instead via the transSiberian railway and crossed the Pacific from Vladivostok. Once settled in the United States, Brecht continued to write plays, producing such theatrical classics as Mother Courage (1939), The Good Woman of Szechuan (1941), and The Caucasian Chalk Circle (1945). With the rise of McCarthyism in the United States, however, a number of creative minds were being censured. Brecht was among those suspected of communist leanings, and he was investigated by the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities. He came away vindicated but decided to leave the United States. In the meantime, the East German government had invited him to create a state theater there, and he and his family went to Berlin. He remained in Germany, working with his new company, producing imaginative versions of classics, and staging his own works.








Marc Chagall (1887-1985)








Marc Chagall was born in Vitebsk, Russia, in 1887 of a poor Jewish family. From an early age, he was determined to be famous and finally decided to become a painter. His mother believed in his remarkable abilities, and he was fortunate to be taken on as a student with a well-known local artist. As a Jew, there were restrictions on his movement, but in spite of this, Chagall managed to go to Petersburg, the capital of imperial Russia. There he further developed his style of painting, combining realism and fantasy. He received a stipend to go to Paris, which was then the hub of artistic creativity in Europe. He was invited to show some of his work in Berlin in 1914. He went, and intending to return to Paris after a short absence, left a number of canvases behind. The war and the Russian Revolution kept Chagall from returning for nine years, by which time his friends had sold his canvases. After the revolution, he returned to his homeland and enjoyed a short period as an art teacher. When famine gripped Russia, however, artists became viewed first as unnecessary and then as reactionary. Chagall was forced to flee back to Paris in 1919. His reputation grew, and he enjoyed several years of familial happiness. As a Jew living in France, he was forced once again into exile by the Nazi invasion.






 












Page 45




He went to the United States, where he lived and worked, returning to Europe after the war. He died in France.








Albert Einstein (1879-1955)








A slightly wistful-looking, white-haired man looks out of a UNHCR poster under the words, "A bundle of belongings isn't the only thing a refugee brings to his new country." The face is unmistakably that of Albert Einstein, probably the most famous of all refugees. His valuable mathematical and scientific works guaranteed him a welcome in his new home, the United States. Born in Germany of Jewish parents in 1879, Einstein was destined to become a refugee. He showed little promise during his formal education, but in 1905, left to his own insightful thinking, he came up with theories that would revolutionize twentieth-century physics. Because he was Jewish and a pacifist, the Nazis denounced his work as worthless, and Einstein left Germany when Hitler came to power. He went first to Belgium, where he stayed until fear of the Nazi invasion drove him to seek refuge in Britain and finally in the United States. Knowing he was fortunate to have escaped Nazism, Einstein worked to help others like himself leave Germany and settle in the United States. He was attached to Princeton University, where he lived quietly and worked on the theoretical aspects of nuclear physics, his knowledge adding greatly to the collective genius that led to the development of the atom bomb. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics. After seeing what the atom bomb could do, he campaigned for peace until his death in 1955.








Enrico Fermi (1901-1954)








Born in Italy in 1901, Enrico Fermi earned his Ph.D. from the University of Pisa in physics in 1924. He then worked at the University of Florence, where he made his first important contribution to physicsworking out the statistics of particles (fermions) that would later be named after him. In 1927, he was appointed professor of physics at the University of Rome. After the discovery of the neutron in 1932, Fermi focused his genius on investigating the structure of nuclei. He was to discover over 40 isotopes. Because he was an outspoken anti-Fascist with a Jewish wife, he began to fear the rising Fascist movement in Italy. When he was invited to Stockholm in 1938 to receive the Nobel Prize for Physics, he saw it as an opportunity to escape to safety. He and his






 












Page 46




wife sailed to Sweden, and, after the prize-giving, they continued on to New York, where Fermi worked first at Columbia University. During World War II, when the drive was on to create nuclear weapons, he worked at the University of Chicago and helped build the first atomic reactor, or pile, in a unused squash court. He was present at Los Alamos when the first nuclear bomb was detonated. After the war he continued to serve the United States as an advisor to the government and to the Atomic Energy Commission. Fermi defended the reputation of his fellow scientist, Robert Oppenheimer, when he was accused of being a communist sympathizer during the McCarthy era. Enrico Fermi died of cancer in 1954.








Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)








Sigmund Freud was born in Austria in 1856. By the 1920s, his theories and work in the field of psychoanalysis were world famous. He excited controversy as his ideas spread. When Austria was absorbed into the Third Reich in the Anschluss, Freud, aged 80, was still working in Vienna. Hitler despised Freud and very possibly feared the man who could shed light on his deeply disturbed and vindictive personality. When Freud's books were burned in Vienna, he is reported to have commented that mankind had progressed from burning people only to burning their books. Freud's children, Anna and Martin, were arrested but released. This experience, coupled with the insistence of his friends, convinced Freud that he should leave Austria and seek refuge outside Nazi-occupied areas. Until then he had steadfastly refused to leave Vienna. Due to his reputation, he had no difficulty getting a visa to enter Britain, but exit visas from Austria for himself and his family had to be bought with bribes and diplomatic pressure. Freud and his immediate family members relocated in London, where he was able to continue his valuable work until his death in 1939.








Lenin (1870-1924)








Born Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov in 1870, Lenin became known to the world by his pen name. The name excited and enraged people, depending upon their reception of his views on Marxist socialism. Young Ulyanov was a lawyer in Russia at the turn of the century, when political activity against the czar was growing. His brother was hanged for attempting to assassinate the czar, another






 












Page 47




brother and a sister were imprisoned for circulating revolutionary propaganda, and Ulyanov and his wife spent time in exile in Siberia. In 1900, Ulyanov found himself under observation by the political police, and leaving Russia seemed a good idea. He went first to Geneva, where he attempted to publish a propagandist newspaper called The Spark. Quarrels with fellow revolutionaries forced him to move to Munich, where he took the pen name that was to be his label for the rest of his life. Lenin wrote, spoke, and raged against a political system he saw as profoundly unfair. He gathered around him other Russian refugees who agreed with his views, and they spent long hours debating how to change the world. During this time Lenin developed the qualities of certainty and leadership that would put him in good stead when the revolution finally took place. Lenin left Munich and made his way to Londonthe beginning of the somewhat frantic wanderings back and forth across Europe that characterized Lenin's life until he could finally return to Russia to lead the Revolution of 1917.








Golda Meir (1898-1978)








Golda Meir was born in Kiev, Russia, in 1898. Anti-Semitism was rife there, and although her family was very poor, they managed to leave Russia illegally and flee to Canada. They eventually settled in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Golda grew up. By the age of 18, she had become a committed Zionist and was travelling around the United States to gather support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In 1917, she married Morris Myerson. They moved to Palestine after the World War I and eventually hebraicized Myerson to Meir in response to an appeal from BenGurion that all Jews have Hebrew names. In Israel, Meir continued her work toward a Jewish homeland and held various positions of leadership. She was a member of the Histradut party, and when the party leader was arrested in 1946, Golda took his place in negotiations with the British. In 1947, when war with the surrounding Arab states looked inevitable, Golda went to the United States to raise $50 million for arms for the Jews. In 1956, she became an Israeli foreign minister. When she was 67 years old, she was asked to form a coalition government, and at age 70 she became the prime minister of Israel. She resigned in 1974, four years before her death.

Rudolf Nureyev (1938-1993)








Most refugees are driven from their home countries by war, oppression, or natural disaster. Some, however, such as Rudolf Nureyev, leave home to find a country where they are free to express themselves. Born in Ufa in the USSR's Bashkir province, Nureyev was a ballet dancer of some renown in his country. His artistic expression, however, was proscribed by government preferences on the nature of ballet. For that reason, he defected to the West in 1961, when the Kirov ballet company with which he was travelling was about to leave Paris and return to Moscow. He lived and worked in Paris, gaining a reputation as both dancer and choreographer. He later worked with a number of major dance companies in the West. His dynamism brought the male dancer to the center of the ballet stage and drew wider audiences to ballet than the discipline had previously enjoyed. He worked until his death in 1993. Nureyev will remain an important influence in the field of dance for years to come.








Alexander Solzhenitsyn (1918- )








Alexander Solzhenitsyn was born in 1918 in Rostov, Russia. He studied physics and mathematics at the university level and served in the Soviet army during World War II as an artillery commander. In 1945, he was arrested, charged with anti-Soviet behavior, and imprisoned for eight years. He spent an additional three years in internal exile in Siberia. Solzhenitsyn was rehabilitated in 1956, and he took up a teaching post. In 1962, he published One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, a novel about life in Stalin's prison camps. This caused him further trouble with the authorities, and in 1969 he was forbidden to publish both inside and outside the Soviet Union. He ignored the order, publishing The First Circle (1968) and Cancer Ward (1969). Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970, but he could not travel to Sweden to receive it, nor would his government allow a member of the Swedish Academy to present it to him in the Soviet Union. Following the publication of The Gulag Archipelago in 1973, Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Soviet Union and went to live in Switzerland. He moved from there to the United States, where he continued to write and speak out about Soviet denial of human rights. He also spoke out against the decadence and materialism of the West. With the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the






 












Page 49




USSR, Solzhenitsyn's Russian citizenship was restored, and he returned home to Russia in mid-1994.








Sun Yat-sen (1866-1925)








Sun Yat-sen was born in Kwantung, China, to a peasant family in 1866. He lived most of his young life in Hawaii, where he went to school and was brought up in the Christian tradition. He returned to China to study medicine in Canton and Hong Kong, graduating in 1895. In 1894, he founded the Revive China Society. As a result of his participation in an unsuccessful uprising in Canton in 1895, he was forced into exile. He went first to the United States and then to Britain, where he achieved some notoriety by being briefly imprisoned at the Chinese Legation in London in 1896. In 1905, Sun Yat-sen founded the Alliance Society and began to develop his notion of the three principles to which everyone is entitlednationalism, democracy, and livelihood. After an absence of 16 years, Sun returned to China when the 1911 revolution overthrew the Manchu dynasty. He was elected president of the provisional government, but resigned in 1912 in the face of conservative opposition. He then led an unsuccessful revolt in 1913 and was once again forced to leave his country. The Soviet Union helped him regain power in 1923, and he was again elected president, this time of the republican government in Canton. Using what he had learned in the Soviet Union, he founded the Chinese nationalist party called the Kuomintang and formed an early alliance with the Chinese Communist party. When he died in 1925, he was respected by both the Kuomintang and the communists. The reconciliation of the two parties, however, was to be short-lived.








Tenzin Gyatso (1935- )








Tenzin Gyatso was born Lhamo Dhondrub in Tibet in 1935. An expedition of Tibetan Buddhist lamas searching for the child who was the reincarnation of the late Dalai Lama decided two-year-old Lhamo Dhondrub was that child. His name was changed to Tenzin Gyatso, and he began the long period of training needed to become the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He was enthroned as the fourteenth Dalai Lamathe Tibetan God Kingin Lhasa in 1940. After Tibet was invaded by the Chinese in 1950, the Chinese allowed the Tibetans to continue their traditional way of life for a short time, but more and more pressure was put on them

to become more like the Chinese. The Dalai Lama tried to negotiate with the Chinese to reach compromises that would allow the continuation of Tibetan cultural and religious traditions. The Chinese would not compromise, however, and they seriously mistreated the Tibetans in their own land. The Tibetans began to stage revolts that were cruelly put down. After an uprising in Lhasa in 1959, many Tibetans fled across the Himalayas to safety in India. The Dalai Lama was among them. He has been forced to remain in exile since then, but he has worked tirelessly for a solution to his country's difficulty. He has travelled extensively and made many overtures for peace with the Chinese. He continues to lead and inspire the Tibetan peoplethose in exile and those still in Tibet. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 in recognition for his continued efforts to preserve his people's cultural heritage through nonviolent struggle.








Activists for Refugees








The people whose names appear on this list are those for whom biographical information was readily available. There are many activists in the refugee field, both in the United States and abroad, whose names do not appear in this section. Lack of time and space prohibits mentioning them all. In the United states, for instance, Charles Sternberg and Leo Cherne of the International Rescue Committee, the late Charles McCarthy of the U.S. Catholic Conference/Migration Service, Julia Taft of InterAction, Wells Klein of the American Council for Nationalities Service, and many others have worked tirelessly and against great odds to succeed at what appears to be an almost hopeless task.








Robert P. DeVecchi (1930- )








Robert DeVecchi was born in New York City in 1930 into a family with a tradition of public and social service. His parents devoted much time to volunteer work, and his paternal grandfather, Paolo DeVecchi, was on the first International Red Cross field surgical team in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Robert DeVecchi was educated at Yale and Harvard. He became a foreign service officer for the U.S. Department of State, serving from 1956 to 1966 in Washington, D.C., Warsaw, Rome, and in Paris with NATO. From

1972 to 1975 he was the New York director for Save the Children Federation. In 1975, DeVecchi decided to make a change. He volunteered to work with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) in Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, helping to resettle Vietnamese refugees who had been evacuated from Saigon and brought to the United States. He subsequently became IRC Indochina program director, then IRC program director, and executive director. During those years he visited many areas where refugees needed the help of the International Rescue Committee, including Malaysia, Thailand, Kurdistan, Mogadishu (Somalia), and Sarajevo (exYugoslavia). DeVecchi is currently president of the International Rescue Committee. During the years he has been with the organization, its role has shifted from being mainly concerned with resettlement to devoting much of its effort and budget to relief and assistance to refugees and internally displaced peoples. Of his involvement with the IRC, DeVecchi says: "The work has called upon every possible talent or energy I may have, and represents the coming together in a single focus, of every interest and passion of my life. I feel truly blessed."








Elizabeth G. Ferris (1950- )








Elizabeth (Beth) Ferris's interest in the world beyond U.S. borders began when she was a high school exchange student to Manaus, Brazil. She continued to travel during her university years, including a year in the Andean countries researching her dissertation. Ferris received her B.A. in history from Duke University and an M.A. in Latin American studies and Ph.D. in political science from the University of Florida. After finishing her degrees in 1975, she taught at Miami University of Ohio and Lafayette College, among others. During 1981-1982, she was a Fulbright Professor at Universidad Autonoma de Mexico. She was then based in Geneva with the Refugee Service of the World Council of Churches from 1985 to 1991. From 1991 to 1993, she was research director for the Life and Peace Institute in Uppsala, Sweden, where she coordinated the work of researchers around the world working on peace issues and the nonviolent resolution of conflict. Beth Ferris is a Quaker, and this has been central to shaping her commitment to justice issues and refugees. She is currently director of the Immigration and Refugee Program of Church World Service in New York City, where she is involved not only with refugee resettlement and asylum work in the United






 












Page 52




States but also with mobilizing U.S. church support for international refugee work. Ferris says that work in the field of refugees is ''special because individual human beings are at the center of concern. [It is] about relieving suffering, offering hope for lasting solutions, and working to make it possible for people to return [home]."








Arthur Cleveland Helton (1949- )








Arthur Helton was born in 1949 in St. Louis, Missouri, where he attended local schools. In 1971 he graduated from Columbia College in New York City, and in 1976 he graduated from New York University School of Law, where he currently teaches immigration and refugee law. After becoming a lawyer, Helton worked in private practice, providing legal assistance to the underprivileged. His first work in the field of refugees was in 1981, when he represented Haitian boat people who were transferred to New York from detention in Florida. In 1982, he joined the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and directed its Refugee Project for 12 years. During Helton's time with the Lawyers Committee, it was one of the leading voices on asylum and refugee protection. He trained over 1,000 lawyers around the country in techniques of representing Haitians and established the country's largest volunteer lawyer program assisting refugees. He worked on the creation of a corps of government asylum adjudicators, a program to release detainees who would not abscond, and the granting of temporary permission to remain in the United States to Bosnians, Liberians, and Somalis until it was safe for them to return home. Helton's work has been recognized worldwide, and he has investigated the plights of refugees and displaced persons wherever emergencies have arisen. In 1991, he received the Ninoy Aquino Refugee Recognition Award from the president of the Republic of the Philippines. In 1994, Helton was appointed director of migration programs at the Open Society Institute in New York, where his first task was to establish an organization to ameliorate forced population movements in the countries of the former Soviet Union. When asked why he became involved with refugees, Helton explained: "I have great sympathy for innocent victims."








Gaynor Jacobson (1912- )








Gaynor Jacobson's father, Morris, was a member of a Jewish socialist organization in Latvia and had been arrested and sen-






 












Page 53




tenced to life in a Siberian labor camp. After serving five years, he was able to bribe his way to freedom, and he and his wife Rose emigrated to the United States in 1907. Gaynor Jacobson was born Israel Gaynor Jacobson in Buffalo, New York, in 1912. When he was about three years old, he experienced his first taste of racism. His was the only Jewish family in the small New York town of Angola, and other young children taunted him about being Jewish. He graduated from high school with very good grades and went on to attend Columbia University in New York City. Unfortunately, family funds ran out during the Depression, and Gaynor was forced to leave before he finished. Eventually he was able to complete his degree in social work at the University of Buffalo. He went to work for the Jewish Welfare Society of Buffalo in 1937 and for the Jewish Family Agency in Rochester, New York, in 1938. While in Rochester he became executive secretary of the Jewish Community Council and executive director of the Jewish Family and Children's Agency. He also became the first vice president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He was very much involved in social and political activities, doing weekly radio talks to counteract proNazi, racist broadcasts. Jacobson's refugee work began with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in 1944. He was given the job of helping Jews who were coming out of concentration camps at the end of World War II. He was determined that the only solution to problems facing Jews in Europe was the establishment of the state of Israel. For many years up to the present, Jacobson has been involved in helping refugees and immigrants through the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society. He divides his time between his homes in New York and Arizona.








James G. McDonald (1886-1955)








James McDonald was born in Ohio in 1886. He did his graduate work at Harvard University, began his career as a professor of politics and history, and went on to become a journalist. From 1919 to 1933, he was chairman of the Foreign Policy Association and was keenly interested and well informed about all international issues. In 1933, the flood of refugees from Germany required the international community to urgently address the problem, and McDonald was appointed the high commissioner for refugees coming from Germany. He felt the rise of Hitler was a tragedy for Germany as well as for Jews, and he tried to






 












Page 54




counteract prejudice against all things German. He was a devout Christian and believed Christians had a special responsibility to fight Nazism. During his short tenure of office, many countries were becoming less disposed to receive Jewish refugees, and McDonald took a great interest in Palestine as a place of refuge for them. In 1935, as it became apparent that more and more refugees would be forced to flee Germany, McDonald decided to resign his post in a manner that would bring the impending horrors of Nazism to world attention. He wrote a letter of resignation, which was widely published, denouncing Hitler and the Third Reich. It was an outspoken condemnation of Nazi policies that endangered the Jews of Europe. McDonald continued to work in the field of refugees, becoming chairman of the President's Advisory Committee on Political Refugees. He later became the first U.S. ambassador to Israel.








Rigoberta Menchu (1959- )








Rigoberta Menchu is a Guatemalan human rights activist. A Mayan Indian, she was born in 1959 to Vincente and Juana Menchu. As a teenager, she became concerned about the plight of indigenous peoples and began to campaign for their rights. (Guatemala has a particularly bad record of repression and violence against its indigenous peoples.) Because of Rigoberta's political involvement, her mother, father, and brother were murdered by Guatemalan security forces in 1980. She continued to oppose her government's repressive policies toward the indigenous and, fearing for her own life, was forced to flee Guatemala and seek refuge in Mexico. Since then she has continued to fight for social justice and the rights of indigenous peoples. In 1992, in San Marcos, Guatemala, she coordinated protests against the celebrations of the 500th anniversary of the landing of Columbus in the New World. She became internationally well known when she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992 for her work on behalf of the indigenous peoples of Central America.








Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930)








Fridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian born in 1861, first achieved notoriety as an arctic explorer. He was a member of the first expedition to cross Greenland in 1888 and was part of a team that tried to






 












Page 55




reach the North Pole between 1893 and 1895. Being in the public eye, he later went on to become the Norwegian minister in London. Nansen was very enthusiastic about the idea of a League of Nations, and he worked hard toward its inception. He became leader of the Norwegian delegation to the League and argued that it had a humanitarian role to play in the world. He worked against difficult odds to convince other member countries to give humanitarian aid where it was needed. Europe was in chaos after World War I, and hundreds of thousands of people were displaced and starving. After the war, Nansen was put in charge of the repatriation of 500,000 prisoners of war, becoming in 1921 the first high commissioner for refugees for the League of Nations. That same year he headed the Red Cross mission to relieve famine in Russia. In 1922, Nansen instituted the Nansen Passport, an identification document for stateless persons without which they were unable to move around or find employment. Nansen was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1922 for his humanitarian work on behalf of casualties of World War I. His efforts to help the impoverished and displaced peoples of Europe did not confine themselves to politics. He used imagination and understanding to develop meaningful aid programs. At his urging, the League of Nations loaned Â£10 million to exiles living in Greece so they could develop fallow farmland. This was the first economic development project funded by an international organization. Nansen's work to establish a homeland for displaced Armenian people displaced by Turkey was never realized.








Sadako Ogata (1927- )








Sadako Ogata became the United Nations high commissioner for refugees in 1991. She was born Sadako Nakamura in Tokyo, Japan, in 1927 and was the daughter and granddaughter of diplomats. She was educated at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and at the University of California at Berkeley. She is married to Shijiro Ogata, a Tokyo banker. She was a professor and director and dean of the Institute of International Relations at Sophia University in Tokyo, where she worked until 1990. She was a senior member of the Japanese delegation to the United Nations from 1976 to 1979 and a minister of the Japanese mission to the United Nations from 1978 to 1979. From 1982 to 1985, Ogata was the Japanese representative to the United Nations Commission






 












Page 56




on Human Rights in Geneva. She has served as chairperson to the Executive Board of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). She led the Human Rights Mission in Myanmar (formerly Burma) in 1990 and was a member of the Trilateral Commission in 1984. Ogata was the UN special emissary investigating problems of Cambodian refugees on the Thai-Cambodian border and has, since becoming high commissioner, shown particular interest in instituting programs of repatriation for refugees and developing preventive strategies for dealing with refugee movements. Ogata is the first female high commissioner and one of the few women in the senior leadership of the United Nations, where she has earned a reputation as an energetic and determined advocate for the human rights of refugees, asylum-seekers, and the internally displaced. In 1994, she was the recipient of the International Human Rights Law Group's annual award.








Joyce Pearce (1915-1985)








Born in 1915, Joyce Pearce took a degree in modern history at Oxford University and taught secondary school for a short time. She was one of those rare individuals who believed that one person could make a difference, and she worked to do just that. In 1951, Pearce started the Ockenden Venture when five displaced teenage girls from Eastern Europe were invited to her home in Surrey, England, for "health, home and education." Even Pearce did not realize that from this small beginning the Ockenden Venture would go on to help thousands of refugees. In the beginning, it concentrated its efforts on helping refugee children, but it has branched out to help refugees of all ages as well as disabled and disadvantaged people all over the world. Wherever there was a need, the Ockenden Venture was ready to help. In 1956, it went to the aid of Hungarian refugees. In 1963, Pearce's attention was turned to Tibetan refugees, and she became a close friend of the Dalai Lama. In 1971, Pearce went to Vietnam, set up an orphanage in Saigon, and arranged for seriously ill children to be treated in Britain. She helped refugees from places as far apart as Chile, Ethiopia, and Southeast Asia. The Ockenden Venture encourages refugees to take an active part in the projects it establishes to help them. It now has a number of centers around the world, all funded by charitable donations. Although Pearce died in 1985, the work of the Ockenden Venture continues.

Philip Rudge (1945- )








Philip Rudge was born in Cheltenham, England, in 1945. He attended London University from 1963 to 1971, earning degrees in English Language and Literature, Philosophy, Economics, Sociology, and Comparative Education in Developing Countries. He was a lecturer at the University of Tuebingen, Germany, from 1969 to 1970. Rudge's life changed direction and his interest in refugee issues grew as a result of his experiences in Laos in the mid-1970s, a time of great upheaval in Southeast Asia. Rudge was then working in Laos as a development aid officer under the Colombo Plan, a project sponsored jointly by the British Council/ Ministry of Overseas Development and the government of Laos. He stayed on in Laos to help with postwar reconstruction. In 1983, Rudge became Reorientation Adviser with World University Service. He was responsible for coordinating programs for Latin American refugees at British universities. Since 1983, Rudge has been general secretary of the London-based European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE), a pan-European network concerned with the treatment of refugees and asylum-seekers in Europe and the development of European governmental refugee policies. During the past decade, Rudge has been a key contributor to the development of this organization. He views work in the refugee field as challenging to head and heart, and says that anyone pursuing refugee work will "need to think about internationalism and solidarity; they will be able to see how the way we live (in the West) all too often depends on the economic and political suppression of others. They will also have the chance to meet some of the most extraordinary human beings."








Raoul Wallenberg (1912-?)








Raoul Wallenberg was born in Sweden in 1912. His mother had been widowed before his birth, and she and his grandparents brought him up. His grandfather was a banker, and the family was one of the most privileged in Sweden. Wallenberg's education took him to Europe to learn languages and to the United States to study architecture. His early career in banking led him to South Africa and Haifa. When President Franklin Roosevelt set up the War Refugee Board and a person from a neutral country was needed to negotiate in Hungary on behalf of the Hungarian Jews,






 












Page 58




Raoul Wallenberg was asked to go. He was given diplomatic status, but the tactics he employed to save Hungarian Jews from the gas chambers at Auschwitz-Birkenau were not all diplomacy. He resorted to bribery and extortion and many times risked his own life to save others. He had thousands of false documents made that declared the holders to be Swedish citizens. He distributed the documents in the ghettoes and even at stations where trains were being loaded for the death camps. He set up safe houses that flew the flag of neutral Sweden, and thousands of Jews sheltered in them. When the Russians liberated Budapest, Wallenberg apparently made the mistake of trusting them. He went off to negotiate with General Malinovsky in 1945 and was never seen again. No one is certain what happened to Raoul Wallenberg.








Elie Wiesel (1928- )








Elie Wiesel was born in 1928 in Sighet, Romania, to Shlomo and Sarah Wiesel. In 1944, when Elie was still a teenager, he and the rest of his family were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. Wiesel went from Auschwitz to Buchenwald and became the only member of his family to survive the camps. Like so many others after the war, Wiesel was a refugee and went to the United States. Since then, he has taught, written, and lectured about the Holocaust. His unforgettable message is that such horror must never happen again. Wiesel has received numerous awards for his important work. Among them are the Jewish Heritage Award (1965), the Ellis Island Medal of Honor (1992), and the President's Medal of Freedom (1993). In 1986, Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his tireless work in the area of human rights. Upon receiving the prize he said, "Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, international borders and sensitivities become irrelevant. Wherever men and women are persecuted because of their race, religion or political views, that place must, for the moment, become the center of the universe. This is awareness in action." Wiesel continues to be a prolific writer and vociferous lecturer against violence, repression, and racism.








Roger Paul Winter (1942- )








Roger Winter was born in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1942. He did his undergraduate work in psychology at Wheaton College in Illinois and his graduate work in urban sociology at the Univer-






 












Page 59




sity of Connecticut. He went on to do antipoverty and social welfare work in Hartford, Chicago, Boston, and New Britain, Connecticut. From 1970 to 1979, Winter worked for the state of Maryland as assistant secretary of human resources and assistant secretary for budget and fiscal planning. In 1980, he became the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) under the Carter administration, and in that capacity was instrumental in implementing the Refugee Act of 1980. Shortly thereafter, he became director of the U.S. Committee for Refugees (USCR), and he helped make it the country's principal refugee advocacy agency. USCR operates like a human rights agency for refugees, publishes the influential World Refugee Survey, and has had a significant impact over the years in matters such as pirate attacks on boat people, humanitarian assistance in southern Sudan, and the setting up of a legal framework for uprooted people in the former Soviet Union. In January 1994, Winter was made executive director of Immigration and Refugee Services of America, the parent organization of USCR, and, as such, is involved in issues of immigration and diversity. He currently serves as director of USCR. Winter holds that "the worth of individuals [is] paramount [and that] the promotion of justice is a prerequisite for true peaceful relations among people...." Moreover, as an American, he believes that he is "accountable for assisting those who are less well-positioned in life."

4 Facts, Statistics, and Legal Documents








THIS CHAPTER PROVIDES SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT statistics, data, and legal documentation relating to refugees.








Refugee Statistics








Counting refugees is at best an approximate undertaking. Not only is the collection of accurate statistical data on refugees and asylum-seekers extremely problematic, but the figures provided by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and journalists frequently conflict with each other. 








There are several reasons for these differences. The term refugee means different things to different organizations. For the United Nations, refugees are people who have left their country because they have a well-founded fear of persecution or because their safety is threatened by events seriously disturbing public order. Governments will describe refugees as either those people whom they have accepted as recognized refugees or those people who have applied for political asylum. The media and many NGOs, on the other hand, often use a much broader approach, considering a refugee to be anyone who has been forced to leave 61






 












Page 62




their usual place of residence by circumstances beyond their control. These differing interpretations lead to widely varying refugee statistics. 








Apart from definitional problems, there are many practical and political obstacles to the collection of accurate refugee statistics. Contemporary refugee movements are often sudden mass exoduses in which as many as a million people can flee their countries within weeks or even days. In such situations, it is impossible to register all the refugees. Moreover, in many parts of the world refugees do not live in organized camps, but settle with family relatives or among ethnically related local people. Because local populations may themselves register as refugees to receive international assistance, it is often difficult to establish how many refugees actually live in an area. In addition, refugees are highly mobile populations, moving between refugee camps and local communities, frequently registering more than once in order to gain higher levels of assistance, and sometimes even moving back and forth between countries. It is very difficult for agencies to keep track of such movements. It is also the case that governments will at times either deliberately exaggerate the numbers of refugees in order to gain more international assistance or deliberately downplay the numbers in order to not embarrass the country from which the refugees fled. Given these conceptual, practical, and political factors, the statistics can at best be considered approximate figures. 








Table 1 lists the total numbers of refugees and asylum-seekers who are unwilling to repatriate due to fear of persecution and violence in their homelands as of 31 December 1993. This table does not include refugees permanently settled in other countries. In some cases, refugees listed in Table 1 may no longer require assistance, but they still need international protection. Host countries are printed in bold type. 








The global number of refugees has been growing rapidly in the past decade. There are nearly twice as many refugees now as there were in 1984. Most of the growth in recent years has occurred in the developing world, the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa, and as Table 1 illustrates, it is in these regions where most of the world's refugees originated and stayed during the year 1993. Countries such as Tanzania, Iran, and Croatia saw the refugee population that they host swell by hundreds of thousands.






 












Page 63




Table 2 lists selected populations in refugee-like situations as of 31 December 1993. Many people who fear persecution or harm if returned to their home countries, and thus who may be refugees, are not recognized by governments as refugees or asylum-seekers. Some are given temporary refuge or allowed to remain on humanitarian grounds; others remain undocumented. Because information on such groups is fragmentary, this table presents only reported estimates, and no total is provided. 








Table 3 identifies selected countries in which substantial numbers of people have been displaced within their homeland as a result of human conflict or forced relocations. Practically every country that generates refugees also creates internally displaced persons. In recent years, Angola, Mozambique, Afghanistan, Sudan, Peru, Colombia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan have been among many countries whose numbers of internally displaced are in the millions. Although the internally displaced share many characteristics with refugees who cross international borders, they are generally not eligible for protection under international refugee law. Because information on internal displacement is fragmentary, this table presents only reported estimates, and no total is provided. It is important to note, however, that even this selected list includes more than 25 million people, and that the number of internally displaced is undoubtedly much higher. 








Table 4 identifies countries that have generated the greatest number of the world's refugees in recent years. The majority of contemporary refugee movements are caused by war, ethnic strife, and persecution. The countries involved in the most destructive wars of the last decadeAfghanistan, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Burundi, Cambodia, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Vietnam, and the former Yugoslavia-have also been the main sources of refugees. It is also true that the principal sources of the current world refugee problemAngola, Burma, Iran, Iraq and Sudanare among the world's most repressive societies. 








Counts may understate the total number of refugees from a given country, as asylum states do not always specify refugees' countries of origin. This table does not include populations considered to be in the refugee-like circumstances listed in Table 2, many of whom are also refugees. It also does not include refugees or people in refugee-like circumstances who have been offered permanent resettlement and status in another country. Examples






 












Page 64




of such refugees include 42,775 Vietnamese who were resettled in the United States and nearly 105,000 members of religious minorities who departed the former Soviet Union for Israel and the United States in 1993. 








Table 5 reflects estimated numbers of refugees who participated in formal voluntary repatriation programs administered by UNHCR, as well as those who spontaneously returned to their homelands during 1993. The largest repatriations occurred in Afghanistan and Mozambique, and in total, some 2.5 million refugees returned home during 1993. 








Repatriations generally occur under difficult conditions. Nevertheless, in recent years the international community has begun to give much greater attention to repatriation and even to returning refugees to countries that continue to experience widespread conflict. There is hope that millions of refugees may be able to return safely to their homes in Africa, South Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and elsewhere in the next few years. Accordingly, UNHCR has declared the 1990s as the ''decade of repatriation" and has committed a high proportion of its resources to repatriation programs. Much will depend on continued progress toward peace in countries still undergoing civil conflict and on the willingness of the international community to encourage and support repatriation and reconstruction. 








Table 6 lists some instances of involuntary returns and expulsions that occurred during 1993. The United Nations Refugee Convention and Protocol prohibits the forced repatriation of refugees (refoulement), and governments rarely force the repatriation of persons they acknowledge to be refugees. More often, however, they forcibly repatriate persons who are either denied access to refugee determination procedures or who are subjected to unfair procedures. Not all the persons listed on this table are bona fide refugees; instead, they were expelled under questionable procedures, which could result in refoulement of genuine refugees among those returned. As this is not a comprehensive list, no total is given. 








Table 7 lists refugees in relation to total population and per capita gross national product (GNP) of the asylum country in 1993. The table demonstrates that the greatest burden of refugee flows is borne by the world's poorest countries. The sheer size of refugee populations and their rapid growth seriously strain host countries. For example, in the aftermath of the Gulf War, Jordan played host to 1 million refugeesone for every four of its citi-






 












Page 65




zens! Malawi, one of Africa's poorest and most densely populated countries, gave refuge to nearly 1 million Mozambican refugeesequivalent to about one-tenth of its population. The Iranian government granted asylum and assistance to more than 1 million Kurdish and Shi'ite Muslim refugees from Iraq on top of an existing refugee population of more than 2 million Afghans and another 400,000 Iraqis who had fled Iraq during the previous decade. Mass refugee influxes can endanger social and economic security, particularly in countries already suffering from economic underdevelopment, unstable political systems, and ethnic and other social cleavages.








Donor governments assist refugees through direct assistance to host governments, usually in the form of food aid, and by supporting international agencies and nongovernmental organizations. Donor governments support the international refugee agencies through annual contributions to their budgets.








Table 8 lists the top 20 countries that contributed to international refugee aid agencies during 1993. The table ranks countries by the financial contribution of their governments per capita. The United States was the largerst single donor in 1993. However, the U.S. contribution per capita ranks only number eight among donor countries. The most generous countries on a per capita basis are the Nordic states.








U.S. contributions have not grown nearly as quickly as the number of refugees, nor as quickly as the contributions of other donors. Up until the mid-1980s, U.S. contributions for humanitarian assistance generally kept pace with the explosive growth in refugee numbers. Then, during 1985-1989, U.S. financial support declined consistently. For example, its share of the UNHCR's total expenditures dropped from 30 percent in 1982 to 22 percent in 1989, during a period when the number of refugees under UNHCR care increased by 50 percent. American financial support for the International Committee of the Red Cross, another important refugee agency, dropped from 30 percent to 15 percent of the agency's total expenditures, from 1985 to 1988. One reason for the decline in U.S. aid for overseas refugees is the increase in spending on refugee admissions, primarily for those refugees from the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia. Recent American administrations have done little to rectify the situation. Since the end of the Cold War, the major donor governments have lost interest in the now much less strategic regions where many refugees are located. As a result, the Western powers,






 












Page 66




including the United States, are not investing the resources that countries experiencing refugee flows or just emerging from conflict need to make the transition to peace, development, and economic stability.








The generosity of the industrialized states can also be measured by the number of refugees resettled and granted asylum in relation to domestic population. 








Table 9 details the numbers of refugees resettled and persons granted asylum in relation to total population in the major resettlement countries of North America, Europe, and Australia from 1975 to 1992. The most generous countries are Sweden, Canada, and Australia, with the United States ranked fourth out of 14 countries. 








Overall, in terms of both financial aid and resettlement of refugees, the Scandanavian countries are the most generous of the industrialized nations; southern European countries are the least generous; and the traditional resettlement countriesthe United States, Canada, and Australiaare in the middle. Although Japan has substantially increased its financial contributions in recent years, it stands out as a rich country that provides mid-level assistance but admits practically no refugeesa record that could clearly stand continued improvement. 








Table 10 lists the numbers of asylum applications in Western Europe, North America, and Australia from 1983 to 1992. The annual totals for those countries covered in the table have increased from 90,400 in 1983 to 825,200 in 1992. Over 3 million applications have been made in Europe during the past decade. Governments are skeptical of the claims of political persecution made by the majority of asylum applicants, and, as a result, the acceptance rate for asylum applicants in Europe in 1993 was less than 5 percent. Nevertheless, governments permitted most of the more than 1 million rejected asylum applicants over the past decade to stay under temporary statuses. The numbers of asylum applications make heavy demands on asylum adjudication systems and have caused great expense. Care for asylum applicants in industrial countries and adjudication of their claims are estimated to cost from $8 billion to $10 billion annually. This contrasts with a 1993 budget for the UNHCR of approximately $1.5 billion. 








Table 11 details the numbers of emigrants from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to the West from 1984 to 1992. With the disintegration of communist regimes at the end of the 1980s, citizens from former Eastern Bloc countries arriving in

Western Europe represented the biggest population movement the continent had seen since the late 1940s. In 1989, over 1.2 million people left Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union for the West. During the next two years, the East-to-West flow moderated, with 923,000 moving westward in 1990 and 800,000 in 1991. Most of the emigrants have been members of ethnic minority or religious groups with close links to receiving countries such as Germany, Hungary, Turkey, the United States, Israel, and Greece. But there have also been unanticipated outflows of war refugees from the former republics of Yugoslavia, of boat people from Albania, and of Gypsies and other minorities from Romania.








In the early 1990s, emigration from Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovinia, and Kosovo to other European countries increased dramatically as a result of ethnically motivated violence and prolonged and brutal civil war among Yugoslavia's erstwhile republics. By 1994, more than 2.5 million had been displaced in the former Yugoslavia, and several hundred thousand had taken refuge in Germany, Hungary, Austria, Italy, and Sweden. Any extension of the war into Macedonia or Kosovo, with an attendant and massive spillover of ethnic conationals into Albania, Greece, Turkey, or Bulgaria, could internationalize the conflict and increase the likelihood of further refugee outflows.








Table 12 gives the ceilings for U.S. refugee admissions by region from fiscal years (FY) 1986 to 1993. The refugee resettlement program in the United States has, in recent years, increasingly resettled persons leaving their home countries through direct departure programs rather than refugees who have fled to countries of asylum. This table demonstrates that the great majority of refugees admitted to the United States over the past eight years have originated from Asia (mostly Vietnamese, Laotians, and Cambodians) and from the former Soviet Union (mainly Jews, Armenians, and Pentacostal Christians). In addition, increasing proportions of those resettled have weak claims to refugee status. U.S. resettlement slots for refugees in regions with the largest refugee concentrations (Africa and countries hosting Muslim refugees) are comparatively few. For example, the United States has always had a low ceiling for the number of African refugees to be resettled here. Although the number has been raised in recent years, the allocation for Africa still represents a small percentage of the overall number of persons admitted to the United States as refugees each year. The resettlement priorities of the United States have always been strongly biased by foreign






 












Page 68




policy and ideological considerations. Even though the number of refugees worldwide continues to grow, the U.S. resettlement program will probably shrink over the next few years, and it is unlikely that any reduction in U.S. resettlement will be compensated by increases in the resettlement programs of Canada and Australia, the other principal resettlement countries.








Table 13 lists the numbers of asylum cases filed with immigration and naturalization service asylum officers and those cases approved or denied, by selected nationalities, from April 1991 to September 1993 in the United States. Persecution of individuals is supposed to be the criteria upon which asylum decisions are made, but foreign policy and ideological considerations continue to influence these decisions. Throughout the 1980s, asylum adjudications clearly showed that an applicant's country of origin and the relationship of that country to the U.S. government were the primary factors determining the granting of asylum. For example, a 1987 U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) study of asylum compared the treatment of four different nationalitiesSalvadorans, Nicaraguans, Poles, and Iranians. The study found that "aliens who stated on their application forms that they were arrested, imprisoned, had their life threatened, or were tortured had much lower approval rates if they were from El Salvador and Nicaragua than if they were from Poland or Iran." Among asylum-seekers making such claims, the approval rates were: Iranians, 64 percent; Poles, 55 percent; Nicaraguans, 7 percent; and Salvadorans, 3 percent. Only Haitians (1.8 percent) and Guatemalans (0.9 percent) fared worse. Moreover, of the four groups examined in the GAO study, only Salvadorans were deported to their home country after having been denied asylum.








In 1992 and 1993, most asylum applicants came from the Western Hemisphere. Salvadorans and Nicaraguans were arriving in smaller numbers, only to be replaced by Guatemalans who accounted for some 40 percent of the total applications in 1992. The island nations of Haiti and Cuba present the greatest risk of mass, uncontrolled refugee movement to the United States in the near future.








Table 14 details the budget of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees by region for 1991 and 1992. The table indicates that Africa and Asia consume the largest resources, but that in recent years refugee emergencies in Europe have required larger financial attention. In general, UNHCR expenditures have tracked the shifts in geographic distribution of






 












Page 69




refugees around the world, and they continue to grow as refugee numbers increase.








The most significant institutional weakness of the UNHCR is its dependence on voluntary contributions to carry out its programs. Less than 5 percent of the UNHCR's annual expenditures are covered by the UN regular budget; the remainder of UNHCR's funding and resources comes from national governments. Its assistance programs are divided broadly into general and special programs. Each year the High Commissioner's Executive Committee approves a General Program budget, which comprises activities financed through the annual program as well as the Emergency Fund, and appeals to all UN members to provide the resources needed to cover the program year. The primary allocation of these resources goes to the traditional areas of the High Commissioner's competence: emergency relief, voluntary repatriation, integration into host societies, and resettlement.








In addition to its General Program budget, UNHCR, at the request of the secretary-general or the UN General Assembly, undertakes Special Programs, which include major new and unforeseen emergency operations and transportation and rehabilitation assistance to refugees and displaced people who have returned to their homes. Special Programs are the subject of specific fund-raising appeals to interested governments and are financed from trust funds constricted with particular purposes and conditions. Thus, the UNHCR must raise funds for each new refugee problem.








The level of annual UNHCR expenditures has increased progressively over the years. Until the mid-1970s, the UNHCR spent only modest sums, the annual average remaining less than $10 million during the 1960s and just exceeding $20 million during the early 1970s. Annual expenditures rose from $9 million in 1971 to $135 million in 1978, and from $270 million in 1979 to nearly $500 million in 1980. The dramatic leaps in expenditures were in response to major refugee emergencies in Indochina, Africa, and Afghanistan. During the 1980s, the annual spending of UNHCR remained over $400 million, and, even allowing for inflation, the level of expenditures amounted to a fifteenfold increase over the early 1970s.








The 1990s have presented UNHCR with several new refugee emergencies and its overall expenditures have therefore continued to grow. In 1991, as a result of emergency relief operations in northern Iraq and in the Horn of Africa, total voluntary funds






 












Page 70




expenditure amounted to $882.9 million, an increase of almost 60 percent over 1990. In 1992, new refugee and humanitarian crises in the former Yugoslavia, Bangladesh, the Horn of Africa, and Southern Africa, as well as continued responsibilities in northern Iraq and new repatriation programs in Cambodia, Ethiopia, and Angola, pushed UNHCR expenditures over $1 billion.

Figures for Europe and North America are generally those for individuals who applied for asylum in 1993, except for countries such as Armenia, Croatia, and others that do not use individualized asylum procedures. U.S. Committee for Refugees considers Bosnians and Croatians as having a prima facie claim to refugee status within the parameters of the Refugee Convention and has therefore attempted to include all such persons who have received temporary legal status, applied for asylum in 1993, or have been excluded from applying for status. Because many countries do not report the republic or origin of ''former Yugoslavs," this table may include under that heading other asylum-seekers from the former Yugoslavia.

Note: The primary source for numbers on refugees resettled or granted asylum was the U.S. State Department. Countries that have established resettlement programs generally provide particularly precise data, but data were not available for all countries for all years. Israel is not included because it does not differentiate between resettled refugees and immigrants. The primary source for total population was the Population Reference Bureau, Inc. 




* Statistics were unavailable for 1975-1981. 








 Does not include ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union, Poland, and Romania.

UNHCR Commissioners, Executive Committee Members, and Signatories








Table 15 lists the past and present United Nations high commissioners for refugees. There have been eight high commissioners since UNHCR was established in 1950. The high commissioner for refugees is elected by the UN General Assembly on the nomination of the secretary-general. The current incumbant, Mrs. Sadako Ogata of Japan, took up office on 1 January 1991. The high commissioner acts under the authority of the UN General Assembly and reports to UNHCR's Executive Committee.








Table 16 lists the composition of the Executive Committee (governing body) of UNHCR. Following the election of Spain, at present there are forty-seven governments who are members of the Executive Committee. It is the governing body of UNHCR. It oversees UNHCR assistance budgets and advises on refugee protection. The Executive Committee has its principal meetings each year in early October in Geneva.








Table 17 lists governments according to whether they have signed the 1951 United Nations Convention and/or the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, as of 1 March 1994. Despite the fact that over 120 governments are signatories to the Convention, many major asylum countries have not yet signed the basic instruments. As of 1994, the only Asian signatories were Japan, the Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, Fiji,






 












Page 89




Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines; and the only Middle East signatories were Israel, Iran, and Yemen. Many of the world's largest and most urgent refugee situations have arisen in these regions. While many of these nonsignatories have offered asylumseekers at least temporary refuge, they have done so on the basis of their own policy decisions rather than from an incurred responsibility to international legal instruments.

International Refugee Law








International refugee law mainly comprises international instruments that define basic standards for the treatment of refugees. The texts of the major international and regional refugee instruments are presented in this section.








The Statute of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) of 1950 sets out the functions of UNHCR, the principal international institution with the mandate to protect and assist refugees. Its functions include ''providing international protection" and "seeking permanent solutions" to the problems of refugees by way of voluntary repatriation or assimilation in new national communities. Of these, the provision of international protection is of primary importance, for without protection, lasting solutions cannot possibly be found. The UNHCR statute also prescribes the relationship of the high commissioner with the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Economic and Social Council, makes provision for organization and finance, and lists the ways in which the high commissioner is to provide for protection.








The Statute of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 








GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 428 (V) of 14 December 1950

(a)



Becoming parties to international conventions providing for the protection of refugees, and taking the necessary steps of implementation under such conventions;(b)Entering into special agreements with the High Commissioner for the execution of measures calculated to improve the situation of refugees and to reduce the number requiring protection;


 












Page 93





(c)








Admitting refugees to their territories, not excluding those in the most destitute categories;



(d)Assisting the High Commissioner in his efforts to promote the voluntary repatriation of refugees;(e)Promoting the assimilation of refugees, especially by facilitating their naturalization;(f)Providing refugees with travel and other documents such as would normally be provided to other aliens by their national authorities, especially documents which would facilitate their resettlement;(g)Permitting refugees to transfer their assets and especially those necessary for their resettlement;(h)Providing the High Commissioner with information concerning the number and condition of refugees, and laws and regulations concerning them. 




3. Requests the Secretary-General to transmit the present resolution, together with the annex attached thereto, also to States nonmembers of the United Nations, with a view to obtaining their co-operation in its implementation.

1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees Done at Geneva on 28 July 1951








The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is the major document in international refugee law since it:








contains a general definition of the term refugee (Article 1);








embodies the principle of nonrefoulement (Article 33) according to which no person may be returned to a territory where he or she may be exposed to persecution;








sets the minimum standard of treatment of refugees, including the basic rights to be granted, and the duties of refugees vis-a-vis their country of refuge;








contains provisions that concern refugees' judicial status, gainful employment, and welfare;








contains provisions regarding the issue of identity and travel documents, naturalization, and other administrative matters;








requires states to cooperate with UNHCR in the exercise of








its functions and to facilitate the task of supervising the application of the convention. 








At the time the convention was adopted, governments were anxious to focus on the existing refugee problems, and not to






 












Page 99




assume obligations for the future, the extent of which could not be foreseen. This resulted in two major limitations:








1. The benefits of the convention were not to apply to persons who corresponded to the definition, but who became refugees as a result of events occurring after 1 January 1951 (Article 1);








2. When becoming a party to the convention, states had the possibility of making a declaration, limiting their obligations under the convention to European refugees.








Entry into force: 22 April 1954, in accordance with Article 43








Text: United Nations Treaty Series No. 2545, Vol. 189, p. 137








PREAMBLE
The High Contracting Parties








Considering that the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights approved on 10 December 1948 by the General Assembly have affirmed the principle that human beings shall enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination,








Considering that the United Nations has, on various occasions, manifested its profound concern for refugees and endeavoured to assure refugees the widest possible exercise of these fundamental rights and freedoms,








Considering that it is desirable to revise and consolidate previous international agreements relating to the status of refugees and to extend the scope of and the protection accorded by such instruments by means of a new agreement,








Considering that the grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries, and that a satisfactory solution of a problem of which the United Nations has recognized the international scope and nature cannot therefore be achieved without international co-operation,








Expressing the wish that all States, recognizing the social and humanitarian nature of the problem of refugees, will do everything within their power to prevent this problem from becoming a cause of tension between States,








Noting that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is charged with the task of supervising international conventions providing for the protection of refugees, and recognizing that the effective co-ordination of measures taken to deal with this problem






 












Page 100




will depend upon the cooperation of States with the High Commissioner,








Have agreed as follows:








CHAPTER I 
GENERAL PROVISIONS








ARTICLE 1

D. This Convention shall not apply to persons who are at present receiving from organs or agencies of the United Nations other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees protection or assistance.








When such protection or assistance has ceased for any reason, without the position of such persons being definitively settled in

Nothing in this Convention shall be deemed to impair any rights and benefits granted by a Contracting State to refugees apart from this Convention.






 












Page 103




ARTICLE 6
THE TERM ''IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES"








For the purpose of this Convention, the term "in the same circumstances" implies that any requirements (including requirements as to length and conditions of sojourn or residence) which the particular individual would have to fulfil for the enjoyment of the right in question, if he were not a refugee, must be fulfilled by him, with the exception of requirements which by their nature a refugee is incapable of fulfilling.








ARTICLE 7

5. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 apply both to the rights and benefits referred to in Articles 13, 18, 19, 21 and 22 of this Convention and to rights and benefits for which this Convention does not provide.








ARTICLE 8
EXEMPTION FROM EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES








With regard to exceptional measures which may be taken against the person, property or interests of nationals of a foreign State, the Contracting States shall not apply such measures to a refugee who is formally a national of the said State solely on account of such nationality. Contracting States which, under their legislation, are prevented from applying the general principle expressed in this Article, shall, in appropriate cases, grant exemptions in favour of such refugees.






 












Page 104




ARTICLE 9
PROVISIONAL MEASURES








Nothing in this Convention shall prevent a Contracting State, in time of war or other grave and exceptional circumstances, from taking provisionally measures which it considers to be essential to the national security in the case of a particular person, pending a determination by the Contracting State that that person is in fact a refugee and that the continuance of such measures is necessary in his case in the interests of national security.








ARTICLE 10
CONTINUITY OF RESIDENCE








1. Where a refugee has been forcibly displaced during the Second World War and removed to the territory of a Contracting State, and is resident there, the period of such enforced sojourn shall be considered to have been lawful residence within that territory.








2. Where a refugee has been forcibly displaced during the Second World War from the territory of a Contracting State and has, prior to the date of entry into force of this Convention, returned there for the purpose of taking up residence, the period of residence before and after such enforced displacement shall be regarded as one uninterrupted period for any purposes for which uninterrupted residence is required.








ARTICLE 11
REFUGEE SEAMEN

Representatives of Non-Governmental Organizations which have been granted consultative status by the Economic and Social Council as well as those entered by the Secretary-General on the Register referred to in Resolution 288 B (X) of the Economic and Social Council, paragraph 17, had under the rules of procedure adopted by the Conference the right to submit written or oral statements to the Conference.








The Conference elected Mr. Knud Larsen, of Denmark, as President, and Mr. A. Herment, of Belgium, and Mr. Talat Miras, of Turkey, as Vice-Presidents.








At its second meeting, the Conference, acting on a proposal of the representative of Egypt, unanimously decided to address an invitation to the Holy See to designate a plenipotentiary representative to participate in its work. A representative of the Holy See took his place at the Conference on 10 July 1951.








The Conference adopted as its agenda the Provisional Agenda drawn up by the Secretary-General (A/CON2/2/Rev.1). It also adopted the Provisional Rules of Procedure drawn up by the SecretaryGeneral, with the addition of a provision which authorized a representative of the Council of Europe to be present at the Conference without the right to vote and to submit proposals (A/CONF2/3/Rev.1).






 












Page 121




In accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Conference, the President and Vice-Presidents examined the credentials of representatives and on 17 July 1951 reported to the Conference the results of such examination, the Conference adopting the report.








The Conference used as the basis of its discussions the draft Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the draft Protocol relating to the Status of Stateless Persons prepared by the ad hoc Committee on Refugees and Stateless Persons at its second session held in Geneva from 14 to 25 August 1950, with the exception of the preamble and Article 1 (Definition of the term "refugee") of the draft Convention. The text of the preamble before the Conference was that which was adopted by the Economic and Social Council on 11 August 1950 in Resolution 319 B 11 (X1). The text of Article 1 before the Conference was that recommended by the General Assembly on 14 December 1950 and contained in the Annex to Resolution 429 (V). The latter was a modification of the text as it had been adopted by the Economic and Social Council in Resolution 319 B 11 (X1).








The Conference adopted the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees in two readings. Prior to its second reading it established a Style Committee composed of the President and the representatives of Belgium, France, Israel, Italy, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America, together with the High Commissioner for Refugees, which elected as its Chairman Mr. G. Warren, of the United States of America. The Style Committee re-drafted the text which had been adopted by the Conference on first reading, particularly from the point of view of language and of concordance between the English and French texts.








The Convention was adopted on 25 July by 24 votes to none with no abstentions and opened for signature at the European Office of the United Nations from 28 July to 31 August 1951. It will be re-opened for signature at the permanent headquarters of the United Nations in New York from 17 September 1951 to 31 December 1952. The English and French texts of the Convention, which are equally authentic, are appended to this Final Act.








II








The Conference decided, by 17 votes to 3 with 3 abstentions, that the titles of the chapters and of the articles of the Convention are included for practical purposes and do not constitute an element of interpretation.








III








With respect to the draft Protocol relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, the Conference adopted the following resolution:








The Conference,






 












Page 122




Having considered the draft Protocol relating to the Status of Stateless Persons,








Considering that the subject still requires more detailed study,








Decides not to take a decision on the subject at the present Conference and refers the draft Protocol back to the appropriate organs of the United Nations for further study. 








IV








The Conference adopted unanimously the following recommendations:








A. [Facilitation of refugee travels]








The Conference,








Considering that the issue and recognition of travel documents is necessary to facilitate the movement of refugees, and in particular their resettlement,








Urges Governments which are parties to the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Refugee Travel Documents signed in London on 15 October 1946, or which recognize travel documents issued in accordance with the Agreement, to continue to issue or to recognize such travel documents, and to extend the issue of such documents to refugees as defined in Article 1 of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or to recognize the travel documents so issued to such persons, until they shall have undertaken obligations under Article 28 of the said Convention.








B. [Principle of unity of the family]








The Conference,








Considering that the unity of the family, the natural and fundamental group unit of society, is an essential right of the refugee, and that such unity is constantly threatened, and








Noting with satisfaction that, according to the official commentary of the ad hoc Committee on Statelessness and Related Problems (E/1618, p. 40) the rights granted to a refugee are extended to members of his family,








Recommends Governments to take the necessary measures for the protection of the refugee's family, especially with a view to:








(1) Ensuring that the unity of the refugee's family is maintained particularly in cases where the head of the family has fulfilled the necessary conditions for admission to a particular country,






 












Page 123




(2) The protection of refugees who are minors, in particular unaccompanied children and girls, with special reference to guardianship and adoption. 








C. [Welfare services]








The Conference,








Considering that, in the moral, legal and material spheres, refugees need the help of suitable welfare services, especially that of appropriate non-governmental organizations,








Recommends Governments and inter-governmental bodies to facilitate, encourage and sustain the efforts of properly qualified organizations.








D. [International co-operation in the field of asylum and resettlement]








The Conference,








Considering that many persons still leave their country of origin for reasons of persecution and are entitled to special protection on account of their position,








Recommends that Governments continue to receive refugees in their territories and that they act in concert in a true spirit of international co-operation in order that these refugees may find asylum and the possibility of resettlement.








E. [Extension of treatment provided by the Convention]








The Conference,








Expresses the hope that the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees will have value as an example exceeding its contractual scope and that all nations will be guided by it in granting so far as possible to persons in their territory as refugees and who would not be covered by the terms of the Convention, the treatment for which it provides. 








IN WITNESS WHEREOF the President, Vice-Presidents and the Executive Secretary of the Conference have signed this Final Act.








DONE at Geneva this twenty-eighth day of July one thousand nine hundred and fifty-one in a single copy in the English and French languages, each text being equally authentic. Translations of this Final Act into Chinese, Russian and Spanish will be prepared by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who will, on request, send copies thereof to each of the Governments invited to attend the Conference.

The 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees








The 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees removed both the dateline and the geographical limitations of the 1951 UN convention, giving the convention a truly universal character. It had become apparent the movement of refugees was not a phenomenon confined to World War II and its aftermath. New refugee groups emerged, particularly in Africa, throughout the late 1950s and 1960s. It therefore became necessary to make the 1951 UN convention applicable in all such refugee situations.








The 1967 protocol is an independent instrument to which states may accede without becoming parties to the convention. States that accede to the protocol undertake to apply the provisions of the convention to refugees who meet the convention definition, but without the 1951 dateline. If a state accedes to the protocol alone, there is no possibility of introducing a geographical limitation.








When acceding to the convention and/or protocol, states may make reservations to articles they feel unable to apply. There are, however, certain articles to which no reservations are permitted, and acceding states must therefore accept. They are as follows:








Article 1, refugee definition
Article 3, nondiscrimination as to race, religion, or country of origin
Article 4, freedom to practice religion
Article 16 (1), free access to courts
Article 33, nonrefoulement








In recent years, the number of accessions to the convention and protocol has grown to over 120. Nevertheless, many major asylum states, including governments in Asia and the Middle East, have not yet signed the major refugee instruments. One of UNHCR's major and ongoing protection tasks is to encourage states to accede to international instruments for the protection of refugees, as well as to supervise their application.








Entry intoforce: 4 October 1967, in accordance with Article VIII








Text: United Nations Treaty Series No. 8791, Vol. 606, p. 267

The States Parties to the present Protocol,








Considering that the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 (hereinafter referred to as the Convention) covers only those persons who have become refugees as a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951,








Considering that new refugee situations have arisen since the Convention was adopted and that the refugees concerned may therefore not fall within the scope of the Convention,








Considering that it is desirable that equal status should be enjoyed by all refugees covered by the definition in the Convention irrespective of the dateline 1 January 1951,








Have agreed as follows:








ARTICLE I
GENERAL PROVISION








1. The States Parties to the present Protocol undertake to apply Articles 2 to 34 inclusive of the Convention to refugees as hereinafter defined.








2. For the purpose of the present Protocol, the term "refugee" shall, except as regards the application of paragraph 3 of this Article, mean any person within the definition of Article 1 of the Convention as if the words "As a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951 and .. ." and the words "... as a result of such events", in Article 1 A (2) were omitted.








3. The present Protocol shall be applied by the States Parties hereto without any geographic limitation, save that existing declarations made by States already Parties to the Convention in accordance with Article 1 B (1) (a) of the Convention, shall, unless extended under Article 1 B (2) thereof, apply also under the present Protocol.

APPENDIX 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 2198(XXI) 
Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees








The General Assembly,








Considering that the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, signed at Geneva on 28 July 1951, covers only those persons who have become refugees as a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951,








Considering that new refugee situations have arisen since the Convention was adopted and that the refugees concerned may therefore not fall within the scope of the Convention,








Considering that it is desirable that equal status should be enjoyed by all refugees covered by the definition in the Convention, irrespective of the date-line of 1 January 1951,






 












Page 129




Taking note of the recommendation of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that the draft Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees should be submitted to the General Assembly after consideration by the Economic and Social Council, in order that the SecretaryGeneral might be authorized to open the Protocol for accession by Governments within the shortest possible time,








Considering that the Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1186 (XLI) of 18 November 1966, took note with approval of the draft Protocol contained in the addendum to the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and concerning measures to extend the personal scope of the Convention and transmitted the addendum to the General Assembly, 









1.



Takes note of the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, the text of which is contained in the addendum to the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees;




2.



Requests the Secretary-General to transmit the text of the Protocol to the States mentioned in article V thereof, with a view to enabling them to accede to the Protocol.




1495th plenary meeting, 
16 December 1966.








The United Nations Declaration on Territorial Asylum (1967)








The United Nations Declaration on Territorial Asylum (1967) recalls Articles 13 and 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and states the principle of nonrefoulement in broad terms, including nonrejection at the frontier. It also recognizes that the granting of asylum by a state is a peaceful and humanitarian act that cannot be regarded as unfriendly by another state. 








Adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 14 December 1967 (resolution 2312 (XXII))








The General Assembly,








Recalling its resolutions 1839 (XVII) of 19 December 1962, 2100 (XX) of 20 December 1965 and 2203 (XXI) of 16 December 1966 concerning a declaration on the right of asylum,








Considering the work of codification to be undertaken by the International Law Commission in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1400 (XIV) of 21 November 1959,








Adopts the following Declaration:






 












Page 130




DECLARATION ON TERRITORIAL ASYLUM








The General Assembly,








Noting that the purposes proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations are to maintain international peace and security, to develop friendly relations among all nations and to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion,








Mindful of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which declares in article 14 that:








1. Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.








2. This right may not be invoked in the case of prosecutions genuinely arising from non-political crimes or from acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations,'' 








Recalling also article 13, paragraph 2, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states:








"Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country,"








Recognizing that the grant of asylum by a State to persons entitled to invoke article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a peaceful and humanitarian act and that, as such, it cannot be regarded as unfriendly by any other State,








Recommends that, without prejudice to existing instruments dealing with asylum and the status of refugees and stateless persons, States should base themselves in their practices relating to territorial asylum on the following principles: 








ARTICLE 1








1. Asylum granted by a State, in the exercise of its sovereignty, to persons entitled to invoke article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including persons struggling against colonialism, shall be respected by all other States.








2. The right to seek and to enjoy asylum may not be invoked by any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes.








3. It shall rest with the State granting asylum to evaluate the grounds for the grant of asylum.






 












Page 131




ARTICLE 2








1.The situation of persons referred to in article 1, paragraph 1, is, without prejudice to the sovereignty of States and the purposes and principles of the United Nations, of concern to the international community.








2. Where a State finds difficulty in granting or continuing to grant asylum, States individually or jointly or through the United Nations shall consider, in a spirit of international solidarity, appropriate measures to lighten the burden on that State. 








ARTICLE 3








1. No person referred to in article 1, paragraph 1, shall be subjected to measures such as rejection at the frontier or, if he has already entered the territory in which he seeks asylum, expulsion or compulsory return to any State where he may be subjected to persecution.








2. Exception may be made to the foregoing principle only for overriding reasons of national security or in order to safeguard the population, as in the case of a mass influx of persons.








3. Should a State decide in any case that exception to the principle stated in paragraph 1 of this article would be justified, it shall consider the possibility of granting to the person concerned, under such conditions as it may deem appropriate, an opportunity, whether by way of provisional asylum or otherwise, of going to another State. 








ARTICLE 4








States granting asylum shall not permit persons who have received asylum to engage in activities contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. 








The Organization of African Unity Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa








The Organization of African Unity (OAU) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, adopted in 1969, is the most important of several regional refugee instruments. It contains a broader refugee definition than the internationally accepted definition found in the 1951 UN convention and the 1967 UN protocol. It does not include any temporal or geographical limitations or any reference to earlier categories of refugees. The OAU convention also regulates the question of asylum (Article II) and prohibits subversive activities by refugees






 












Page 132




(Article III). In addition, it stipulates that repatriation must be a voluntary act (Article V). 








Adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government at its Sixth Ordinary Session (Addis Ababa, 10 September 1969)








Entry into Force: 20June 1974, in accordance with Article XI








Text: United Nations Treaty Series No. 14 691








PREAMBLE








We, the Heads of State and Government assembled in the city of Addis Ababa, from 6-10 September 1969,









1.



Noting with concern the constantly increasing numbers of refugees in Africa and desirous of finding ways and means of alleviating their misery and suffering as well as providing them with a better life and future,




2.



Recognizing the need for and essentially humanitarian approach towards solving the problems of refugees,




3.



Aware, however, that refugee problems are a source of friction among many Member States, and desirous of eliminating the source of such discord,




4.



Anxious to make a distinction between a refugee who seeks a peaceful and normal life and a person fleeing his country for the sole purpose of fomenting subversion from outside,




5.



Determined that the activities of such subversive elements should be discouraged in accordance with the Declaration on the Problem of Subversion and Resolution on the Problem of Refugees adopted at Accra in 1965,




6.



Bearing in mind that the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have affirmed the principle that human beings shall enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination,

8.



Convinced that all the problems of our continent must be solved in the Spirit of the Charter of the Organization of African Unity and in the African context,




9.



Recognizing that the United Nations Convention of 28 July 1951, as modified by the Protocol of 31 January 1967, constitutes the basic and universal instrument relating to the status of refugees and reflects the deep concern of States for refugees and their desire to establish common standards for their treatment,


 












Page 133





10.



Recalling Resolutions 26 and 104 of the OAU Assemblies of Heads of State and Government, calling upon Member States of the Organization who had not already done so to accede to the United Nations Convention of 1951 and to the Protocol of 1967 relating to the Status of Refugees, and meanwhile to apply their provisions to refugees in Africa,




11.



Convinced that the efficiency of the measures recommended by the present Convention to solve the problem of refugees in Africa necessitates close and continuous collaboration between the Organization of African Unity and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 




Have agreed as follows:








ARTICLE I DEFINITION OF THE TERM "REFUGEE"








1.For the purposes of this Convention, the term "refugee" shall mean every person who, owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country, or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.








2.The term "refugee" shall also apply to every person who, owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of origin or nationality, is compelled to leave his place of habitual residence in order to seek refuge in another place outside his country of origin or nationality.








3.In the case of a person who has several nationalities, the term "a country of which he is a national" shall mean each of the countries of which he is a national, and a person shall not be deemed to be lacking the protection of the country of which he is a national if, without any valid reason based on well-founded fear, he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national.








4. This Convention shall cease to apply to any refugee if:









(a)



he has voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of the country of his nationality, or,

(e)



he can no longer, because the circumstances in connection with which he was recognized as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality, or,




(f)



he has committed a serious non-political crime outside his country of refuge after his admission to that country as a refuge, or,




(g)



he has seriously infringed the purposes and objectives of this Convention. 




5. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom the country of asylum has serious reasons for considering that: 









(a)



he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;




(b)



he committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;




(c)



he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the Organization of African Unity;




(d)

2. The grant of asylum to refugees is a peaceful and humanitarian act and shall not be regarded as an unfriendly act by any Member State.








3. No person shall be subjected by a Member State to measures such as rejection at the frontier, return or expulsion, which would compel him to return to or remain in a territory where his life, physical integrity or liberty would be threatened for the reasons set out in Article I, paragraphs 1 and 2.






 












Page 135




4. Where a Member State finds difficulty in continuing to grant asylum to refugees, such Member State may appeal directly to other Member States and through the OAU, and such other Member States shall in the spirit of African solidarity and international co-operation take appropriate measures to lighten the burden of the Member State granting asylum.








5. Where a refugee has not received the right to reside in any country of asylum, he may be granted temporary residence in any country of asylum in which he first presented himself as a refugee pending arrangement for his resettlement in accordance with the preceding paragraph.








6. For reasons of security, countries of asylum shall, as far as possible settle refugees at a reasonable distance from the frontier of their country of origin. 








ARTICLE III PROHIBITION OF SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES








1. Every refugee has duties to the country in which he finds himself which require in particular that he conforms with its laws and regulations as well as with measures taken for the maintenance of public order. He shall also abstain from any subversive activities against any Member State of the OAU.








2. Signatory States undertake to prohibit refugees residing in their respective territories from attacking any State Member of the OAU, by any activity likely to cause tension between Member States, and in particular by use of arms, through the press, or by radio.

Whenever necessary, an appeal shall be made through national information media and through the Administrative Secretary-General of the OAU, inviting refugees to return home and giving assurance that the new circumstances prevailing in their country of origin will enable them to return without risk and to take up a normal and peaceful life without fear of being disturbed or punished, and that the text of such appeal should be given to refugees and clearly explained to them by their country of asylum.








5. Refugees who freely decide to return to their homeland, as a result of such assurances or on their own initiative, shall be given every possible assistance by the country of asylum, the country of origin, voluntary agencies and international and intergovernmental organizations, to facilitate their return.








ARTICLE VI TRAVEL DOCUMENTS








1. Subject to Article III, Member States shall issue to refugees lawfully staying in their territories travel documents in accordance with the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Schedule and Annex thereto, for the purpose of travel outside their territory, unless compelling reasons of national security or public order otherwise require.

The Convention on Territorial Asylum of 1954








 The Convention on Territorial Asylum of 1954 is one of a series of instruments on territorial and diplomatic asylum in Latin America. It reaffirms the territorial state's sovereign right to grant asylum, the duty of other states to respect such asylum, and the state's exemption from any obligation to surrender or expel persons "sought for political offenses" or "persecuted for political reasons or offenses." 








Signed in Caracas on March 28, 1954 
at the Tenth Inter-American Conference








Entry intoforce: 29 December 1954, in accordance with Article 14








Text: OAS Official Records, OEA/Ser.X/I. Treaty Series 34








The Governments of the Member States of the Organization of American States, desirous of concluding a Convention regarding Territorial Asylum, have agreed to the following articles: 








ARTICLE 1








Every State has the right, in the exercise of its sovereignty, to admit into its territory such persons as it deems advisable, without, through the exercise of this right, giving rise to complaint by any other State.






 












Page 140




ARTICLE 2








The respect which, according to international law, is due to the jurisdictional right of each State over the inhabitants in its territory, is equally due, without any restriction whatsoever, to that which it has over persons who enter it proceeding from a State in which they are persecuted for their beliefs, opinions, or political affiliations, or for acts which may be considered as political offenses.








Any violation of sovereignty that consists of acts committed by a government or its agents in another State against the life or security of an individual, carried out on the territory of another State, may not be considered attenuated because the persecution began outside its boundaries or is due to political considerations or reasons of state.








ARTICLE 3








No state is under the obligation to surrender to another State, or to expel from its own territory, persons persecuted for political reasons or offenses.








ARTICLE 4








The right of extradition is not applicable in connection with persons who, in accordance with the qualifications of the solicited State, are sought for political offenses, or for common offenses committed for political ends, or when extradition is solicited for predominantly political motives.








ARTICLE 5








The fact that a person has entered into the territorial jurisdiction of a State surreptitiously or irregularly does not affect the provisions of this Convention.








ARTICLE 6








Without prejudice to the provisions of the following articles, no State is under the obligation to establish any distinction in its legislation, or in its regulations or administrative acts applicable to aliens, solely because of the fact that they are political asylees or refugees.








ARTICLE 7








Freedom of expression of thought, recognized by domestic law for all inhabitants of a State, may not be ground of complaint by a third State on the basis of opinions expressed publicly against it or its government by asylees or refugees, except when these concepts constitute systematic propaganda through which they incite to the use of force or violence against the government of the complaining State.






 












Page 141




ARTICLE 8








No State has the right to request that another State restrict for the political asylees or refugees the freedom of assembly or association which the latter States's internal legislation grants to all aliens within its territory, unless such assembly or association has as its purpose fomenting the use of force or violence against the government of the soliciting State.








ARTICLE 9








At the request of the interested State, the State that has granted refuge or asylum shall take steps to keep watch over, or to intern at a reasonable distance from its border, those political refugees or asylees who are notorious leaders of a subversive movement, as well as those against whom there is evidence that they are disposed to join it.








Determination of the reasonable distance from the border, for the purpose of internment, shall depend upon the judgment of the authorities of the State of refuge.








All expenses incurred as a result of the internment of political asylees and refugees shall be chargeable to the State that makes the request.








ARTICLE 10








The political internees referred to in the preceding article shall advise the government of the host State whenever they wish to leave its territory. Departure therefrom will be granted, under the condition that they are not to go to the country from which they came and the interested government is to be notified.








ARTICLE 1 1








In all cases in which a complaint or request is permissible in accordance with this Convention, the admissibility of evidence presented by the demanding State shall depend on the judgment of the solicited State.








ARTICLE 12








This Convention remains open to the signature of the Member States of the Organization of American States, and shall be ratified by the signatory States in accordance with their respective constitutional procedures.








ARTICLE 13








The original instrument, whose texts in the English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish languages are equally authentic, shall be






 












Page 142




deposited in the Pan American Union, which shall send certified copies to the governments for the purpose of ratification. The instruments of ratification shall be deposited in the Pan American Union; this organization shall notify the signatory governments of said deposit.








ARTICLE 14








This Convention shall take effect among the States that ratify it in the order in which their respective ratifications are deposited. 








ARTICLE 15








This Convention shall remain effective indefinitely, but may be denounced by any of the signatory States by giving advance notice of one year, at the end of which period it shall cease to have effect for the denouncing State, remaining, however, in force among the remaining signatory States. The denunciation shall be forwarded to the Pan American Union which shall notify the other signatory States thereof.








IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries, having presented their plenary powers which have been found in good and satisfactory form, sign this Convention, in the name of their respective Governments, in the city of Caracas, this twenty-eighth day of March, one thousand nine hundred and fifty-four.








Here follow the signatures of the Plenipotentiaries.








RESERVATIONS








GUATEMALA








We make express reservation to Article 3 (three) wherein it refers to the surrender of persons persecuted for political reasons or offenses; because according to the provisions of our Political Constitution, we maintain that such surrender of persons persecuted for political reasons may never be carried out.








We affirm, likewise, that the term ''internment" in Article 9 means merely location at a distance from the border. 








DOMINICAN REPUBLIC








The delegation of the Dominican Republic subscribes to the Convention on Territorial Asylum, with the following reservations:








Article 1. The Dominican Republic accepts the general principle embodied in that article in the sense that "Every State has the right to admit into its territory such persons as it deems 






 












Page 143




advisable", but it does not renounce the right to make diplomatic representation to any other State, if for considerations of national security it deems this advisable.








Article 2. It accepts the second paragraph of this article with the understanding that the latter does not affect the regulations of the frontier police.








Article 10. The Dominican Republic does not renounce the right to resort to the procedures for pacific settlement of international disputes that may arise from the exercise of territorial asylum.








MEXICO








The delegation of Mexico makes express reservation to Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention regarding territorial asylum because they are contrary to the individual guarantees enjoyed by all the inhabitants of the Republic in accordance with the Political Constitution of Mexico.








PERU








The delegation of Peru makes reservation to the text of Article 7 of the Convention regarding Territorial Asylum, insofar as it differs from Article 6 of the draft proposal of the Inter-American Council of Jurists, with which the delegation concurs.








HONDURAS








The delegation of Honduras gives its approval to the Convention regarding Territorial Asylum with reservations with respect to those articles opposed to the Constitution and to the laws in force in the Republic of Honduras.








ARGENTINA








The delegation of Argentina has voted in favor of the Convention regarding Territorial Asylum, but makes express reservations in regard to Article 7, as it believes that the latter does not duly consider nor satisfactorily resolve the problem arising from the exercise, on the part of political asylees, of the right of freedom of expression of thought. 








The Convention on Diplomatic Asylum Signed in Caracas, March 28,1954 at the Tenth Inter-American Conference








The Convention on Diplomatic Asylum, signed in 1954, is another of several major refugee instruments in Latin America, a continent






 












Page 144




with a long history of political asylum. While acknowledging that "every state has a right to grant asylum," the Convention on Diplomatic Asylum stresses that an asylum country "is not obligated to do so or state its reasons for refusing [asylum]" and that it remains with ''the state granting asylum to determine the nature of the offense or the motives for the persecution."








Entry into force: 29 December 1954, in accordance with Article 23








Text: OAS Official Records, OEA/Ser.X/I. Treaty Series 34








The Governments of the Member States of the Organization of American States, desirous of concluding a Convention on Diplomatic Asylum, have agreed to the following articles:








ARTICLE 1








Asylum granted in legations, war vessels, and military camps or aircraft, to persons being sought for political reasons or for political offenses shall be respected by the territorial State in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.








For the purposes of this Convention, a legation is any seat of a regular diplomatic mission, the residence of chiefs of mission, and the premises provided by them for the dwelling places of asylees when the number of the latter exceeds the normal capacity of the buildings.








War vessels or military aircraft that may be temporarily in shipyards, arsenals, or shops for repair may not constitute a place of asylum.








ARTICLE 2








Every State has the right to grant asylum; but it is not obligated to do so or to state its reasons for refusing it.








ARTICLE 3








It is not lawful to grant asylum to persons who, at the time of requesting it, are under indictment or on trial for common offenses or have been convicted by competent regular courts and have not served the respective sentence, nor to deserters from land, sea, and air forces, save when the acts giving rise to the request for asylum, whatever the case may be, are clearly of a political nature.








Persons included in the foregoing paragraph who de facto enter a place that is suitable as an asylum shall be invited to leave or, as the case may be, shall be surrendered to the local authorities, who may not






 












Page 145




try them for political offenses committed prior to the time of the surrender.








ARTICLE 4








It shall rest with the State granting asylum to determine the nature of the offense or the motives for the persecution.








ARTICLE 5








Asylum may not be granted except in urgent cases and for the period of time strictly necessary for the asylee to depart from the country with the guarantees granted by the Government of the territorial State, to the end that his life, liberty, or personal integrity may not be endangered, or that the asylee's safety is ensured in some other way.








ARTICLE 6








Urgent cases are understood to be those, among others, in which the individual is being sought by persons or mobs over whom the authorities have lost control, or by the authorities themselves, and is in danger of being deprived of his life or liberty because of political persecution and cannot, without risk, ensure his safety in any other way.








ARTICLE 7








If a case of urgency is involved, it shall rest with the State granting asylum to determine the degree of urgency of the case.








ARTICLE 8








The diplomatic representative, commander of a warship, military camp, or military airship, shall, as soon as possible after asylum has been granted, report the fact to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the territorial State, or to the local administrative authority if the case arose outside the Capital.








ARTICLE 9








The official furnishing asylum shall take into account the information furnished to him by the territorial government in forming his judgment as to the nature of the offense or the existence of related common crimes; but this decision to continue the asylum or to demand a safe-conduct for the asylee shall be respected.








ARTICLE 10








The fact that the Government of the territorial State is not recognized by the State granting asylum shall not prejudice the application of the






 












Page 146




present Convention, and no act carried out by virtue of this Convention shall imply recognition.








ARTICLE 11








The Government of the territorial State, may, at any time, demand that the asylee be withdrawn from the country, for which purpose the said State shall grant a safe-conduct and the guarantees stipulated in Article 5.








ARTICLE 12








Once asylum has been granted, the State granting asylum may request that the asylee be allowed to depart for foreign territory, and the territorial State is under obligation to grant immediately, except in case of force majeure, the necessary guarantees, referred to in Article 5, as well as the corresponding safe-conduct.








ARTICLE 13








In the cases referred to in the preceding articles the State granting asylum may require that the guarantees be given in writing, and may take into account, in determining the rapidity of the journey, the actual conditions of danger involved in the departure of the asylee.








The State granting asylum has the right to transfer the asylee out of the country. The territorial State may point out the preferable route for the departure of the asylee, but this does not imply determining the country of destination.








If the asylum is granted on board a warship or military airship, departure may be made therein, but complying with the previous requisite of obtaining the appropriate safe-conduct.








ARTICLE 14








The State granting asylum cannot be held responsible for the prolongation of asylum caused by the need for obtaining the information required to determine whether or not the said asylum is proper, or whether there are circumstances that might endanger the safety of the asylee during the journey to a foreign country.








ARTICLE 15








When, in order to transfer an asylee to another country it may be necessary to traverse the territory of a State that is a party to this Convention, transit shall be authorized by the latter, the only requisite being the presentation, through diplomatic channels, of a safeconduct, duly countersigned and bearing a notation of his status as asylee by the diplomatic mission that granted asylum.






 












Page 147




En route, the asylee shall be considered under the protection of the State granting asylum.








ARTICLE 16








Asylees may not be landed at any point in the territorial State or at any place near thereto, except for exigencies of transportation.








ARTICLE 17








Once the departure of the asylee has been carried out, the State granting asylum is not bound to settle him in its territory; but it may not return him to his country of origin, unless this is the express wish of the asylee.








If the territorial State informs the official granting asylum of its intention to request the subsequent extradition of the asylee, this shall not prejudice the application of any provision of the present Convention. In that event, the asylee shall remain in the territory of the State granting asylum until such time as the formal request for extradition is received, in accordance with the juridical principles governing that institution in the State granting asylum. Preventive surveillance over the asylee may not exceed thirty days.








Payment of the expenses incurred by such transfer and of preventive control shall devolve upon the requesting State.








ARTICLE 18








The official furnishing asylum may not allow the asylee to perform acts contrary to the public peace or to interfere in the internal politics of the territorial State.








ARTICLE 19








If as a consequence of a rupture of diplomatic relations the diplomatic representative who granted asylum must leave the territorial State, he shall abandon it with the asylees. If this is not possible for reasons independent of the wish of the asylee or the diplomatic representative, he must surrender them to the diplomatic mission of a third State, which is a party to this Convention, under the guarantees established in the Convention. If this is also not possible, he shall surrender them to a State that is not a party to this Convention and that agrees to maintain the asylum. The territorial State is to respect the said asylum.








ARTICLE 20








Diplomatic asylum shall not be subject to reciprocity. Every person is under its protection, whatever his nationality.






 












Page 148




ARTICLE 21








The present Convention shall be open for signature by the Member States of the Organization of American States and shall be ratified by the signatory States in accordance with their respective constitutional procedures.








ARTICLE 22








The original instrument, whose texts in the English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese languages are equally authentic, shall be deposited in the Pan American Union, which shall send certified copies to the governments for the purpose of ratification. The instruments of ratification shall be deposited in the Pan American Union, and the said organization shall notify the signatory governments of the said deposit.








ARTICLE 23








The present Convention shall enter into force among the States that ratify it in the order in which their respective ratifications are deposited.








ARTICLE 24








The present Convention shall remain in force indefinitely, but may be denounced by any of the signatory States by giving advance notice of one year, at the end of which period it shall cease to have effect for the denouncing State, remaining in force, however, among the remaining signatory States. The denunciation shall be transmitted to the Pan American Union, which shall inform the other signatory States thereof.








IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries, having presented their plenary powers, which have been found in good and due form, sign this Convention, in the name of their respective Governments, in the city of Caracas, this twenty-eighth day of March, one thousand nine hundred and fifty-four.








Here follow the signatures of the Plenipotentiaries.








RESERVATIONS








GUATEMALA








We make an express reservation to Article 2 wherein it declares that the States are not obligated to grant asylum; because we uphold a broad, firm concept of the right to asylum.








Likewise, we make an express reservation to the final paragraph of Article 20 (Twenty), because we maintain that any person, without any discrimination whatsoever, has the right to the protection of asylum.






 












Page 149




URUGUAY








The government of Uruguay makes a reservation to Article 2, in the part that stipulates that the authority granting asylum, is, in no case, obligated to grant asylum nor to state its reasons for refusing it. It likewise makes a reservation to that part of Article 15 that stipulates: "... the only requisite being the presentation, through diplomatic channels, of a safe-conduct, duly countersigned and bearing a notation of his status as asylee by the diplomatic mission that granted asylum. En route, the asylee shall be considered under the protection of the State granting asylum." Finally, it makes a reservation to the second paragraph of Article 20, since the government of Uruguay understands that all persons have the right to asylum, whatever their sex, nationality, belief, or religion.








DOMINICAN REPUBLIC








The Dominican Republic subscribes to the above Convention with the following reservations:








First: The Dominican Republic does not agree to the provisions contained in Article 7 and those following with respect to the unilateral determination of the urgency by the State granting asylum; and








Second: The provisions of this Convention shall not be applicable, consequently, insofar as the Dominican Republic is concerned, to any controversies that may arise between the territorial State and the State granting asylum, that refer specifically to the absence of a serious situation or the non-existence of a true act of persecution against the asylee by the local authorities.








HONDURAS








The delegation of Honduras subscribes to the Convention on Diplomatic Asylum with reservations with respect to those articles that are in violation of the Constitution and laws in force in the Republic of Honduras.








Other Significant Universal Refugee Instruments








In addition to the key legal refugee instruments listed above, there have been a number of other significant refugee instruments at both the universal and regional levels. Because of the limited space available, these texts are not reproduced here. The full documents can be found in UNHCR, Collection of International Instruments concerning Refugees (1979); Guy Goodwin-Gill, The Refugee in Intenational Law (1983); and UN Center for Human Rights, Human Rights Bibliography: United Nations Documents and






 












Page 150




Publications, 1980-1990) (1993). Many of the most important ones are summarized below.








Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons (1954)








This convention defines the standards of treatment to be accorded to stateless persons, which are, broadly speaking, the same as those for refugees.








Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness (1961)








This document seeks mainly to avoid statelessness at birth by granting the nationality of the acceding state to persons born in their territory who would otherwise be stateless. It also provides, subject to certain exceptions, that a person should not be deprived of his or her nationality if this would result in making them stateless, and specifies that a person shall not be deprived of his or her nationality on racial, religious, or political grounds.








Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of CivilianPersons in Time of War (1949)








The Fourth Geneva Convention contains an article dealing with refugees and displaced persons. This Protocol Additional (1977) provides specifically (Article 73) that refugees and stateless persons shall be protected persons under the meaning of Parts I and III of the Fourth Geneva Convention. These legal instruments, the so-called laws of warfare, have become increasingly important with the mounting number of internal conflicts in recent years.








Other Significant Regional Refugee Instruments








Cartagena Declaration on Refugees of 1984








This declaration, like the 1969 OAU convention (see Text 5 above), broadens the definition of the term refugee found in the 1951 UN convention to include those persons who have fled their country because their lives, safety, or freedom have been threatened by generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal conflicts, massive violation of human rights, or other circumstances that have seriously disturbed public order (Conclusion 3). Although a nonbinding instrument, the Cartagena Declaration has been accepted and is being






 












Page 151




applied by Latin American states to the degree that it has entered the domain of international law.








Dublin Convention








The Convention Determining the State Responsible for Examining Applications for Asylum Lodged in One of the Member States of the European Community was signed by the member states of the European Community at Dublin on 15 June 1990 in what is known as the Dublin Convention. It is one of the collective measures taken by member states towards the realization of a single market and the elimination of controls at internal European Union borders.








In the preamble, the signatories to the Dublin Convention express their determination to guarantee adequate protection to refugees in keeping with their common humanitarian tradition. The Dublin Convention also contains an expression of the signatories' awareness of the need to take measures to avoid leaving applicants for asylum in doubt for too long as regards the likely outcome of their applications. The signatories also state their concern to provide all asylum applicants with a guarantee that their applications will be examined by one of the member states and to ensure that applicants are not referred successively from one member state to another.








In accordance with these objectives, the Dublin Convention sets rules for determining the state responsible for examining applications for asylum. It also elaborates on the circumstances and the conditions that govern the transfer or readmission of applicants between member states. It provides, moreover, for the mutual exchange between member states of general information as well as information on individual cases. A number of safeguards are included concerning the protection of personal data.








In Article 2 of the Dublin Convention, member states of the European Union reaffirm their obligations under the 19.51 UN convention and the 1967 UN Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, with no geographic restriction of the scope of these instruments, and restate their commitment to cooperate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in applying them.








Schengen Agreement (1990)








Signed by the Benelux countries (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal) but not ratified as of 1994, this agreement contains criteria similar to the Dublin Convention, within the context of the progressive abolition of frontier controls between countries of the European Union.






 












Page 152




The Schengen Agreement contains provisions establishing uniform principles for controlling member states' common borders and for harmonizing conditions of entry and visa requirements. In an effort to prevent unsuccessful applicants from lodging successive asylum claims in the same or other countries, the Schengen Agreement also includes a formula for determining which country is responsible for receiving an asylum request. Finally, the agreement specifies that a permanent information system, known as the Schengen Information System, is to be set up and computerized.








International Human Rights Instruments and Their Significance








There is a close link between the protection of refugees and the broader context of human rights. The link is confirmed, moreover, in the preamble to the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which makes reference to the principle that all human beings shall enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination. The preamble also recalls that the United Nations has, on various occasions, manifested its profound concern for refugees and endeavored to assure refugees the widest possible exercise of these fundamental rights and freedoms. Therefore, a number of key human rights instruments must be added to the various legal texts of direct or indirect relevance to the protection of refugees. The major ones are as follows:








The Universal Declaration of Human Rights








Adopted and proclaimed by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 217 A(III) of 10 December 1948, this document stipulates:









1.



No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile. (Article 9)




2.



Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state; and every one has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country. (Article 13)




3.



Everyone has the right to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution. (Article 14)




4.








Everyone has the right to a nationality; and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality or denied the right to change his nationality. (Article 15)






 












Page 153




The United Nations has set international human rights standards in about 70 covenants, conventions, and treaties. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are among the UN treaties that impose legally binding obligations on states concerning the rights of people under their jurisdiction. These two covenants were adopted by the UN General Assembly and opened for signature in December 1966. Both were entered into force in early 1976.








International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights








The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that:








1. Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. (Article 2)








2. Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence; Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own; The above-mentioned rights shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (order public) public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other rights recognized in the present Covenant; No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country. (Article 12)








3. An alien lawfully in the territory of a State Party to the present Covenant may be expelled therefrom only in pursuance of a decision reached in accordance with law and shall, except where compelling reasons of national security otherwise require, be allowed to submit the reasons against his expulsion and to have his case reviewed by, and be represented for the purpose before, the competent authority or a person or persons especially designated by the competent authority. (Article 13)








The Covenant against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment








This document, approved by consensus by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1984 as Annex to UN General Assembly Resolution 39/46, states:






 












Page 154




No State Party shall expel, return (''refouler") or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture. For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights. (Article 3)








The United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women








Signed in 1979, this document contains a series of provisions for the benefit of women. It is considered to be a cornerstone for the protection of refugee women.








The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child








This document, approved in 1989, makes special provision for refugee children. It stipulates:








States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure that a child who is seeking refugee status or who is considered a refugee ... shall ... receive appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance ... " (Article 22)








The African Charter on Human and People's Rights








Adopted by the 18th Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on 27 June 1981 at Nairobi, this charter states:








Every individual shall have the right, when persecuted, to seek and obtain asylum in other countries in accordance with the law of those countries and international conventions. (Article 12)








The American Convention on Human Rights








Signed on 22 November 1969 at the Inter-American Specialized Conference on Human Rights, held at San Jose, Costa Rica, this document states:








Every person has the right to leave any country freely, including his own; No one can be expelled from the territory of the state of which






 












Page 155




he is a national or be deprived of the right to enter it; Every person has the right to seek and granted asylum in a foreign territory, in accordance with the legislation of the state and international conventions, in the event he is being pursued for political offenses or related common crimes; In no case may an alien be deported or returned to a country, regardless of whether or not it is his country of origin, if in that country his right to life or personal freedom is in danger of being violated because of his race, nationality, religion, social status or political opinion. (Article 22)








The European Convention for Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms








This document, signed in Rome in 1950 and enhanced by several additional protocols, details certain rights that bear on refugees:








Liberty of movement and freedom to choose one's residence (Fourth Protocol, Article 2);








Freedom from exile and the right to enter the country of which one is a national (Fourth Protocol, Article 3);








Prohibition of the collective expulsion of aliens (Fourth Protocol, Article 4);








The right of an alien not to be expelled from a state without due process of law (Seventh Protocol, Article 1).








Recent Significant Developments








In recent years there have been several new developments in the international protection and assistance offered refugees and displaced persons. In particular, the international community has established two new mechanisms of relevance to refugees worldwide: (1) the creation within the United Nations of an emergency coordinator for humanitarian assistance and an under secretarygeneral for humanitarian assistance within the newly established Department of Humanitarian Affairs and (2) the appointment of a special representative of the UN secretary-general for internally displaced persons.








The office of emergency coordinator was created in December 1991 in order to strengthen and expedite international action in humanitarian emergencies, especially in cases where governments refuse to cooperate. The new office fills an important gap






 












Page 156 




by integrating the activities of the wide array of UN agencies and imposing a structural approach that will include long-term strategies to refugee problems where only short-term ad hoc humanitarian efforts now exist. The coordinator will facilitate the relief work of the different UN agencies, make contact with outside organizations, and negotiate access for such agencies in an emergency situation without waiting for a formal government request. UN General Assembly Resolution (46/182), which established the new mechanism, allows humanitarian aid to be provided with "the consent of the affected country" rather than at its request, as was the case in the past.








The emergency relief coordinator reports directly to the UN secretary-general and is mandated to coordinate all relief measures within the UN system and among other organizations. To support the coordinator, a central funding mechanism has been established at a cost of $50 million. The coordinator is also responsible for coordinating appeals for financial assistance for emergencies from donor governments. Finally, an Interagency Standing Committee coordinates the relief activities of all UN agencies (including UNHCR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and the Inter-Governmental Committee for Migration.








The special representative of the UN secretary-general for internally displaced persons has helped put the issue of protection and assistance to internally displaced persons on the international agenda. The position was created when the UN Human Rights Commission passed a resolution (1992/73) at its 48th session (5 March 1992) calling on the UN secretary-general to "designate a representative to seek to gain views and information from all governments on the human rights issues related to internally displaced persons, including an examination of existing international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law and standards and their applicability to protection of and relief assistance to internally displaced persons...."








The UN secretary-general subsequently appointed Francis Deng, a former Sudanese ambassador, as his special representative for the internally displaced. Ambassador Deng presented a comprehensive study of internally displaced persons to the 49th session of the UN Human Rights Commission in 1993. At this session, the UN Human Rights Commission passed a further resolution (1993/105) requesting "the Secretary-General to mandate his Representative for a period of two years to continue his work






 












Page 157




aimed at a better understanding of the general problems faced by internally displaced persons and their possible long-term solutions, with a view to identify, where required, ways and means for improved protection for and assistance to internally displaced persons."








Future Directions








Despite the impressive array of legal instruments and institutions directed to the protection and assistance of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons, increasing numbers of commentators and advocates view the international treaty regime that protects refugees as inadequate to ensure respect for the basic human rights of those forced to migrate. The need to strengthen refugee protection at the international level is pressing, particularly to address issues such as guaranteeing initial asylum to those in flight from persecution and violence, respecting the human rights of asylum-seekers, including the right to be free from arbitrary detention, and extending of refugee rights to those displaced within countries as a result of persecution and violence. Governments, acting through the United Nations and regional intergovernmental organizations, must not only expand the coverage of international law but also improve its enforcement. Until governments establish comprehensive international standards and meaningful mechanisms, many refugees and asylum-seekers will simply remain insecure and subject to human rights violations.
