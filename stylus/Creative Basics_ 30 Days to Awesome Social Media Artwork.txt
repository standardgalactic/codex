About "Creative Basics"
 
I've struggled for a long time with the technical aspects of blogging and especially graphics for my photos. As a food blogger, I have a good handle on iPhone photography but for the life of me, couldn't figure out how to make my graphics pop.  
With Crystal Stine's Creative Basics course, it's like she's sitting with you at your computer taking you step by step and helping you create beautiful graphics.  
In this course, you'll learn how to master both Pic Monkey and Canva and some iPhone apps as well. Crystal's course has helped me tremendously and if you're wanting to take your images to the next level, I encourage you to get this eBook!

What a fun and helpful course! Crystal takes the reader step by step through the process of creating fun graphics, and she makes it incredibly user-friendly. The steps are not overwhelming and can definitely can be done in a day. She gives photos, resources, and examples of everything she teaches. I also love how encouraging she is along the way, it's like she's celebrating with us in our progress of learning to create graphics! I'm so thankful Crystal is willing to share her expertise in this area with others.

I can't say enough about how helpful and fun this course was! I've been blogging since 2007 and have learned bits & pieces along the way to liven up my photos but this course definitely took me to the next level. The daily assignments were bite-sized and not overwhelming but also built on each other so you were able to build and reinforce your skills along the way. The final thing I didn't add? I just had my 69th birthday during the month we took this course. It proves you CAN teach an old dog new tricks!Martha Brady

I have positively enjoyed Crystal's course. I have learned how to use all the extra pictures I take to enhance my blog. I never would have thought to use Canva or PicMonkey without her instructions, and because of that, I feel that I've gone from a ho-hum blogger to a "Wow, look at that!"

Like many people with a small business I relied on larger companies for my media. The problem with that is all of it has someone else's watermark embedded in it. All I was really doing by using it was sending more business to them. With Crystal's course, Creative Basics, I have learned to make my own amazing media. I can tailor it to my clients and to the media format I need. This course has taught me to change the formatting of my images to fit my Blog, Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, & even Twitter. 
 
With the first post I made myself for Facebook my reach increased three fold. People are sharing my creations! This in turn is bringing more traffic to my blog and increasing my client numbers. The Creative Basics course is the best investment I've made this year and I had fun doing it. Rebecca Moninghoff, LMT, CMCP

In today's visual world, graphics and photos or a combination of the two, are more important than ever. Images are a critical element of any blog or website. You're going to have trouble hooking and keeping subscribers or fans without a store of visuals. So you owe it to yourself to learn Creative Basics from Crystal Stine. Crystal made it so easy for me, a very non-visual person, to make eye-catching graphics, which garnered comments.  
In just 20 days, I had a command of free graphic design programs PicMonkey and Canva. I learned about new and free design apps and photo sources. Thanks to Crystal Stine's Creative Basics course:

I'm more confident creating graphics than I ever imagined I would be.
I gained several new followers on Instagram and Twitter. 
I brainstormed several new ways for presenting my food blog posts in a more visually-friendly way.
I've been inspired to provide graphics to my readers on a daily basis.

 
I can't say enough good things about Crystal and her course.

As an older gal, I confess techy stuff intimidates me. When I heard about Crystal's Creative Basics course, I got totally excited. I have been following the lessons all month and have made some really lovely things for my blog, Facebook and Pinterest page. Crystal's instruction was so clear and encouraging that I had fun, gained confidence and learned some great stuff! Highly recommend her work to everyone!

Creative Basics gave me the tools to find my creative side again. It introduced me to new apps for creating graphics and it helped me use the ones I already knew of in better ways. Crystal keeps it simple and attainable, but also gives the confidence to take what you've learned from the course and discover more in each app. Now instead of seeing quote graphics and wishing I could create something similar, I know that I can create something better!
Julie Wilson
 
 
A wonderful resource! I've always seen what other bloggers post, and wondered how to make graphics like theirs - and now I know! It's easier (and more fun) than I anticipated. This has definitely connected my blog with my social media - I love having a unique eye-catching picture or quote to put on Instagram or Facebook that goes along with a post I've written.
Sarah Jo Burch
 
Crystal has put together a very doable course to help us learn more about making creative images to share on our social media channels and blogs. I loved learning about the other web sites and apps she shares, and how each step builds upon each other. Highly recommend it!
Yvonne Reynolds
 
 
Crystal keeps things fun and easy to understand. What a gift Creative Basics is, whether you're a beginner or more experienced with design. I feel more confident, knowledgeable and excited about creating shareable images now that I've taken this course!

I'll be honest. I had played around with the various sites Crystal covers, but I had no idea of the depth of tweaking that could be done. Her directions were clear and she walked through each of the tools available to create awesome graphics. Now I feel more confident in what I create for my personal blog and for my husband's business!

I was excited to be a part of this course because I love designing things. I have design experience in several different realms, so I was definitely not a beginner, but I really enjoyed learning about new apps and websites and all the functionality they offer. Crystal did an excellent job of making the challenges basic enough for beginners (with explanations), and yet interesting enough that I enjoyed the daily challenge as well. It was a great course!
Tammy Markus
 
 
I am so thankful for Crystal's Creative Basics course. I love to write but have always struggled with creating graphics on my blog and through social media. Each day, Crystal gave us great, detailed instructions to help us become familiar with apps, websites, and the tools we needed to make creative graphics. The daily assignments were easy to understand, do-able within my margin of time, and so fun! The best part is how Crystal encourages us, answers our questions, and helps us along the way! I highly recommend the Creative Basics course to help you take your graphics to the next level.

The Creative Basics course was amazing. Creating my own graphics has been something that has been so overwhelming and frustrating for me in the past. I have tried to use some websites and been frustrated. Crystal was able to teach simple basics of graphic design that slowly built on each other each day. This class has given me the confidence that I lacked before it. The organization of the course was doable for someone who doesn't have big pockets of time to learn. Each day was simple yet informative and left me feeling very successful. I would highly recommend it!

Creative Basics rocks! In bite-sized pieces, Crystal teaches such important information for bloggers and social media users. Learning how to create wonderful images for your blog will make good writing even more appealing to readers. In this course, Crystal offers clear instructions on how to use varied platforms such as PicMonkey and Canva to make images that pop! I learned so much in this course that I will use every time I create a blog post, Facebook post, or Pinterest pin. The Creative Basics course is time exceedingly well spent for any blogger.
Leah Adams
 
 
I was inspired attending a session at Declare Conference where Crystal taught a similar class. So much information packed into a small lab session. When her Creative Basics course was announced I jumped on quickly. I love how Crystal teaches in daily bite-size portions that are very easy to follow and understand. I do know Photoshop Elements, but it is so much easier and faster to utilize the multiple apps and websites that Crystal teaches in this class. By putting into practice what I have learned, I am much more confident about my social media posts by including an image that is more appealing to my audience. I highly recommend this course / e-book!

I absolutely love Crystal for this Creative Basics course. I have learned so much in such a short amount of time. I have used PicMonkey quite a bit, but I learned about so many other FREE tools available on the web and I even learned things about PicMonkey I didn't know before. The tips were great. The practice didn't require too much time from my day, but the knowledge gained was IMMENSE! I will definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a little help in image expertise.Stacy Moss

Crystal does a wonderful job of presenting usable websites with oodles of tools and resources. She makes each step in the course achievable in short bursts of time which keeps it simple and straightforward. Without being overwhelmed, I was quickly creating great images I was proud to showcase on my social media.

What You'll Learn:

Where to find photos
Some rules about fonts
How to use Canva, PicMonkey, and three of my favorite apps

A basic understanding of how to save and retrieve files to/from your computer
Internet access
A smartphone is optional, but several challenges will involve using apps
Social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest) are also optional but the majority of this content will be focused on creating micro-content for those platforms

 
Here's how it will work:
Each day you'll find one challenge to tackle. Every challenge will build upon the one before so that, by the end, you'll have all the tools you need to create our final project - a free printable!

Day 1 - "Mise en Place"
Grab your coffee and we're going to get started. I'll let you know right now that you're going to want to hold tight with me through the first 6 days as we prepare to make some awesome images.
 
In cooking, what we're going to be doing on days 1-6 is called "mise en place," or if you aren't up on your French (coming from the gal who took Spanish & Italian) "putting in place." It's the important organizing, arranging, and prep work that helps us make sure we have everything in order before we dive in!
 
But don't worry - this isn't a bait & switch course where I give you the bare minimum and then charge you a fee for the rest. I promise you'll leave having created more than 15 different types of images and learning every tip & trick I can think to share with you!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Find at least one beautiful scenic photo to save to your desktop from Unsplash.
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to Unsplash.com 
2. Scroll through the images until you find one you like 
3. Click on it to open it in a new window 
4. Right click to save the image to your desktop as a JPG 
5. Repeat as needed ;)
 
  
 
Unsplash is a great site that offers free photos that are completely free for you to modify as you wish. When you're first starting to use photos from around the internet for your projects, understanding licenses and royalty-free options can be a challenge, so this is a great place to start!
 
Generally speaking most photo sites as that you not use the image on anything you intend to make a profit on, and most will give suggested language on how to properly credit the photographer if they require it. While I might suggest sites during this course that I love to use, it's up to you to learn the terms of use and understand them before you do anything with the images!
 
 
We'll be building a little library over the next few days so that when we're ready to jump into creating graphics we won't have to spend time hunting for a photo! On Day #3 I'll also share with you my pros & cons when it comes to using free images.
 
Your Notes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     









Day 2 - Finding Photos
Were you able to find a scenic image on Unsplash yesterday? Or, if you're like me, maybe you ended up spending way too long looking at ALL the beautiful photos! Those are some incredibly talented photographers!
 
Bonus Tip: In case you found several images you'd love to use for future projects, you might want to create a folder on your desktop, Google Drive, or Dropbox called "Unused Images." You can save the images you find to one location (so you don't have to scroll forever trying to find it again), and when you've created a blog or social media graphic with it, you can move it to a new file called "Used Images." Just another little "mise en place" tool to help keep you organized!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Head over to CreationSwap and grab a free photo - any photo you like - and save it to your computer.
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to CreationSwap
2. Create an account (click "Sign Up") at the top right corner 
3. Click on "Photos" 
4. Make sure only the "Free" box is checked in the left sidebar (so you don't fall in love with a $10 photo, like I usually do) 
5. Type a keyword into the "search" box and click the magnifying glass
6. Hover over the image that you like and click on the eyeball to view it larger 
7. Choose from the various download options & save to your computer
  
 
Although CreationSwap has several paid options, they allow you to download 3 images per month absolutely free (as long as it's not marked "premium" or assigned a price). All the images on this site are family friendly and targeted towards churches, so you won't have to worry about accidentally coming across any images you wish you could un-see!
 
We'll do one more piece of photo-collecting prep work tomorrow (and I'll share with you a paid photo site I love, as well as my pros & cons for using these sites)!
 
Your Notes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     









Day 3 - Phone Fun
Isn't CreationSwap a fun site? I hope you were able to find at least one image you really felt would work well on your blog or website.
 
Yep, that's right. Did you know that the images you're finding should reflect your blog and social media brand as much as the topic of your blog post or quote? As you continue to build up an image library, think about the colors that you already use on your blog, the types of photos you want to use:
 

Outdoor
Indoor
People
Animals
Abstract

 
...and the feel you want readers to experience:

Light
Inviting
Dark 
Serious
Playful 
Whimsical

 
Today's Challenge: 
Grab your phone - or your camera - and snap a few of your own photos that work with the style and feel of your site.
 
  
 
  
 
While I love Unsplash, CreationSwap, and even DollarPhoto Club (my favorite paid resource for images), there's honestly nothing better than using your own photos if you can. 
 
On one hand, free and paid image sites will give you the option of hundreds of photos to choose from - which is perfect if you want a photo of a woman walking through an open field in the spring and it's currently the depths of winter where you live.
 
But the downside? If you find a photo you love on those sites, it's only a matter of time before you see it appearing on other blogs and social media sites, too.
 
The only way to avoid that? Use your own images! Even with just your phone (which is how I snap most of my photos lately) you can create a library of images that not only represent you and your style, but will already fit into your brand - because they're yours!
 
Tomorrow we'll jump over to one of my favorite sites and we'll put those photos you've found in a safe place!
 
Your Notes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     










Day 4 - Uploading to Canva
So are you ready to do something with those photos you've been finding this week? We're not going to create any graphics with them quite yet, but we're going to get them set up today on my favorite site!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Upload your photos to Canva!
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to www.canva.com
2. Sign in, or if you're new to Canva, set up your free account 
3. Pause :: Don't get overwhelmed. There are a lot of options when you get into Canva, and I promise we'll walk through all of them. Don't panic! 
4. Click on "Social Media" under "Create a Design" 
5. Ignore all the pretty templates (so hard! I know!) and click "Uploads" on the left sidebar 
6. Click the green "Upload Your Images" button and add the images you've been saving to your computer this week
 
  
FAQs
Q: Why won't my photo upload? It's just spinning? 
 
 
A: Really large images from some of the sites we've visited sometimes save in a file size that is too large for Canva to handle. If you run into that problem, you can use your favorite tool to resize the image if you already know how to do that, or do what I do and use PicMonkey. Simply go to PicMonkey, upload your image, and click "Resize" (it will be on the bottom left when your image opens). Change the width dimension - the first box - to 900. The height dimension should automatically change to keep the original image proportion correct. Click "save" and save the resized image to your desktop (and rename it so you know it's the smaller version). Now you should be able to upload to Canva with no problem!
 
Q: Can I upload multiple images at a time?
 
A: Technically, yes. As long as the images are all small enough you can hold down the CTRL key and select several files at one time. However, Canva sometimes gets overwhelmed when you do that and forgets to upload one, or freezes. If you have the time, uploading one-by-one is the best practice for this exercise.
 
That's it! No need to save - Canva does that for you. And there are some other brilliant features to this site that we'll get into in a few days - but rest easy knowing your images are safe and sound and waiting for you!
 
Tomorrow we'll talk fonts! Woot!

Day 5 - Fonts!
One of the easiest ways to take your graphic or text from "eh" to "amazing" is to limit the number of fonts you put in front of your reader's eye. They want to know where to look, and fonts are your way of telling them READ THIS FIRST.
 
Today's Challenge: 
Choose 2-3 fonts to use throughout the challenge.
 
Just 2 or 3? But there are hundreds of font options, and they're all so pretty, and wouldn't it be better if I used more?
 
Lean in, friend. When it comes to chocolate, more is more. When it comes to fonts? Less is more.
  
 
Maybe you already have a font family on your blog design that you love and want to use (mine is PT Sans, for example) and that's great. 
 
Consistency creates brand awareness!
 
But if you're thinking of fonts for the first time, consider choosing one or two sans serif fonts (fonts that appear plain, with no short lines across the top and bottom of the letters, like Arial - the font used in this book) and one serif font (a font with short lines across the top and bottom of the letters, like American Typewriter), or a font that looks like handwriting, like Allura. 
 
You'll be totally set up for success, AND you'll have a beautiful fancy font to use when you want to call out certain words or phrases as we jump into some quote creation next week (it's coming soon! I promise!).
 
Need help finding fonts? Head over to Canva and browse through some of the pre-created templates - when you click on the text it will tell you which font is used! 
 
Or if you want to have a lot of fun and browse a ton of options, you can check out Google Fonts, where you can sort the options by Serif, Sans Serif, Handwriting, and more!
 
And feel free to be inspired by Pinterest - take a look at the images you've pinned and shared and think about why you love the design and try to find similar fonts to use in your graphics.
 
Tomorrow we'll finish up our graphic design "mise en place"!

Day 6 - Quotable Quotes
You have stuck with me through the tedious prep work! Woot! Today is the last day we'll spend getting our thoughts and details organized, and tomorrow we'll get to create!
 
But before we do that, we need one last item. We have the images. We have the fonts. Now we need the words!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Make a list of quotes (famous quotes, Scriptures, your own awesome content from your blog) to use later this week.
 
Whether we're making text-only images, quote images, or printables, one thing is a "must have" - words! Open a Google Drive doc or Word Doc and start collecting your favorite quotes and phrases. 
 
Maybe there is a Scripture that you'd love to share with your social media followers, or a key phrase from one of your recent blog posts that you'd like to put on Facebook - write them down!
 
Unlike fonts, when it comes to quotes, the more the merrier! But if you're in a time crunch today, I'd suggest finding at least 4 quotes. Try to find some that are shorter - think "tweet" length (around 140 characters or one short sentence) for now. When we get to the printable creation part of the course we'll have room for more text!
 
Tomorrow we'll create our first graphic using one of my favorite apps!

Day 7 - Text Only Graphics: InstaQuote
It's time to create!!
 
Here's how we're going to work through the next 24 days - we're going to spend 10 days working on text-only graphics, which means you won't be using any of those gorgeous images you found quite yet. We're going to refine our skills in adding text to a background in several formats first, so we can get comfortable with that, and then we'll jump up to the next level.
 
Then we'll spend 10 days working through various image editing and quote graphic challenges, followed by two days of creating very specific social media images, and then wrapping it up with a printable.
 
Sounds good? Let's get to it! You'll be a pro in no time!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a text-only graphic using the InstaQuote app
 
Disclosure: The apps referenced in this book are for use on an iPhone, so if you're on something else, I'm so sorry. Many of them are also available on Andriod phones, but you might need to find alternatives occasionally.
Also, I only use the free version of most apps and websites, but feel free to upgrade to "Pro" if you think you'll use it frequently!
 
The How To: 
1. Download the free InstaQuote app from the App Store or Google Play 
2. Double tap where it tells you to type one of the quotes you collected yesterday 
3. Add the name of the author and click the green checkmark in the upper right corner 
4. Scroll through the preset background & font combos at the bottom until you find one you like (click it on it to choose it) 
5. You can change the fonts by clicking on the "aA" button (keep in mind you might not be able to find the fonts you chose on Day 5, but you can find something close), change the font color by clicking on the paint can, upload one of your own photos as a background by clicking on the photo icon, and edit the background options by clicking on the last icon. 
  
 
  
6. Once you have it looking the way you want, click on the "Q" in the bottom right, click "Instagram" and share it!
 
Tomorrow we'll do a little work on one of my other favorite websites - PicMonkey!

Day 8 - Text Only Graphics - PicMonkey
So how'd you do yesterday? Were you able to create an image using the InstaQuote app? There are so many great options available to create beautiful quote graphics on your phone that it was hard for me to pick just one, but hopefully that one was pretty easy to figure out!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a text-only graphic using PicMonkey
 
Before we get into this one, I want you know that I just flat don't know how to use anything fancy like Photoshop. And if you do, you have skills that are beyond me! 
 
Everything I've learned to do on my own blog has happened in PicMonkey, Canva or some combination of the two!
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to PicMonkey.com 
2. Click on "design" to use one that has been pre-loaded 
  
3. Click on the "textures" icon (it looks like a blue crisscross pattern, right above the snowflake) to choose a background design 
4. Click "apply" when you've found one you like (I like the chalkboard designs under "Boards" personally) 
5. Click "Tt" in the left sidebar to add text to the background (tip: click the "add text" button first, type your quote" then go back and change the fonts later - you'll need to play around a bit to figure out what works best) 
6. When you like how it looks, click "save" and save it to your desktop!
  
A few hints: 

To change the font or color of just one word in your quote, double click the word, then choose the font style 
If your 2 or 3 fonts from day 5 are on your computer, you can use them in PicMonkey by clicking "Yours" to access your fonts 
If you happen to see something you want to use, but it has a "crown" icon on it, it means you need to have a Royale (paid) subscription to the site to use it

 
FAQ
Q: If I want to share this image on Instagram, can I upload it on my computer?
 
A: Unfortunately, no. Instagram doesn't allow you to upload your images directly from your computer without using a third-party tool (see Day 23 for my favorite option). If you'd rather not learn to use another tool, you can simply open your email, attach your image and email it to yourself. Open your email on your phone, click on the image and save it to your photo file. Then simply open Instagram and 
 
Tomorrow we'll jump back over to Canva and learn how to use one of the their beautiful templates!

Day 9 - Text Only Facebook Graphic - Canva
Isn't PicMonkey so fun? It offers so many wonderful free image creation tools - but in case you didn't notice, they also have some fabulous paid tools for their "Royale" members. I've actually paid for those before and - if at the end of this - PicMonkey is your website of choice, then I HIGHLY recommend it.
 
But today we're going to head back over to our buddy Canva. Even though you already have some great photos waiting there for you, we're going to spend some more time working just with fonts & quotes today!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a text-only Facebook graphic using a Canva template
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to canva.com 
2. Log in if you aren't still connected, then click on "Facebook Post" 
3. Scroll through the designs until you've found a free template you like - it'll be marked "free" in the bottom right corner (you can choose one that costs money, but I happen to prefer "free") 
  
4. Click the template you want to use to bring it up on the page 
5. Click on the text you want to edit, and enter your quote 
6. When you like how it looks, click "download" and save it to your desktop as an image!
  
 
A few hints: 

To change the font, size or color use the dropdowns that appear when you click on the text. 
Canva doesn't allow you to change just one word in your quote as easily as PicMonkey, so you'll need to start a new text box (for now, just click "copy" from the text editor dropdown to make life easy) and format those words separately.

 
Tomorrow we'll be back in Canva to try one of their other templates!

Day 10 - Text Only Instagram Graphic - Canva
You are doing such an awesome job. I mean it. It's so fun to see your creativity and I love that you've been brave enough to try this with me!
 
We're heading back to Canva today for another little template challenge to get you used to the features and options that are available. By the time we get to the part where you're designing with your own images you'll be a ROCK STAR at these basics!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a text-only Instagram graphic using a Canva template
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to canva.com 
2. Log in if you aren't still connected, then click on "Instagram Post" 
3. Scroll through the designs until you've found a free template you like - it'll be marked "free" in the bottom right corner (you can choose one that costs money, but I happen to prefer "free") 
  
4. Click the template you want to use to bring it up on the page 
5. Click on the text you want to edit, and enter your quote 
6. When you like how it looks, click "download" and save it to your desktop as an image!
  
 
A few hints: 

To change the font, size or color use the dropdowns that appear when you click on the text - if you want to change the background color simply click on the background and use the dropdown tools in the editor that opens! Easy peasy! 
Canva doesn't allow you to change just one word in your quote as easily as PicMonkey, so you'll need to start a new text box (for now, just click "copy" from the text editor dropdown to make life easy) and format those words separately. 
Have you noticed that Canva has these templates already at the optimum size for you, so you don't have to change anything when you share it online? I love that :)

 
Need help using Instagram? They have a fabulous "help" section that can answer almost all of your questions!
 
Tomorrow we'll be back in Canva to wrap up this little section on creating text-only images using templates!
 
Your Notes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     









Day 11 - Text Only Blog Graphic - Canva
I know it can be a little hard to keep up with these challenges, so hopefully you've realized that they're easy enough to do more than one each day if you need to catch up (or, if you need to skip one, that's ok, too! You'll still learn a BUNCH by the end of this series!).
 
We're spending some more time at Canva today, so let's get to it!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a text-only blog graphic using a Canva template.
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to canva.com 
2. Log in if you aren't still connected, then click on "More" and then "Blog Graphic" 
3. Scroll through the designs until you've found a free template you like - it'll be marked "free" in the bottom right corner (you can choose one that costs money, but I happen to prefer "free") 
  
4. Click the template you want to use to bring it up on the page 
5. Click on the text you want to edit, and enter your quote 
6. When you like how it looks, click "download" and save it to your desktop as an image!
 
One of my favorite parts about the templates under "Blog Graphics" is the ability to create easy infographics! These are perfect if you need a visual representation of a process, a recipe, or a timeline - and they're already set up and ready for you - and they look great on Pinterest.
 
You can choose new icons or images by clicking on "Text" on the left sidebar, then clicking in the search bar at the top of the page. 
 
You can either search for a specific image OR click in one of the categories and choose from there (I find that to be the easiest way to find the free options!).
 
Tomorrow we'll be back in Canva - but we'll say good-bye to templates!

Day 13 - Text Only Graphic  Using Overlays - Canva
It's good to see you again, friend! I hope you're enjoying this course and learning a few new things!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a text-only graphic in Canva - using shape overlays!
 
I feel like you just looked at me with a question mark in your eyes. Shape overlays are the shapes and banners you often see on quote images that contain the quote and make the text pop. This is a super useful tool when we start using images, since our text can sometimes get lost on a busy background!
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to canva.com 
2. Log in if you aren't still connected, then click on the format you'd like to use 
3. Click "background" in the left sidebar to choose your background style (you can change the color using the options at the top - click the plus sign if you don't see the color you want) 
  
4. Click "Text" in the left sidebar to open the text editor 
5. The shape-overlays will appear below the "Add Text" options
6. Click on the one you like best to add it to your background 
7. Enter your quote, adding other text fields as needed and having fun with the fonts, size, and color - keep in mind you might need to find a different text holder to fit the length of your quote. Shape overlays in Canva are created to auto-resize your text to fit the size of the text holder. 
8. When you like how it looks, click "download" and save it to your desktop as an image!
 
  
 
Tomorrow we'll be back in Canva to learn how to make our fonts work for us!
 
 
Your Notes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     









Day 14 - Text Only Graphic Fonts - Canva
Have you ever tried to make a quote image and couldn't quite figure out how to get the font size, spacing, or transparency exactly right? It's hard enough trying to decide which fonts to use, and then when they won't work the right way it can be even more frustrating!
 
Never fear - we'll figure this one out together!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a text-only graphic in Canva - changing the font spacing & transparency.
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to canva.com 
2. Log in if you aren't still connected, then click on one of the text images you've already created that Canva has saved for you (You can edit or reuse those any time!) 
3. Click the text you want to edit 
4. Click the dropdown arrow on the right side and then choose "text space" 
5. Play time! Look at what happens when you make the text closer together or further apart until you like what you have 
6. Click the dropdown arrow again and choose "transparency" 
7. Slide the bar around until your text has the faded look you think looks best - this works especially well for watermarks (we'll get to those) and if you want a softer or aged look to your text 
8. When you like how it looks, click "download" and save it to your desktop as an image!
  
 
In the image above, you'll see how the font looks when it's slightly transparent, stretched out, or smooshed together (technical terms. Ahem.)
 
Different spacing gives the text a different feel - and these tools can be particularly useful when we're trying to fit text onto a busy photo or if a little less space between the words conveys the feeling you're looking for with your quote!
 
Tomorrow we'll be back in Canva to make one last text-only image before we get back to those gorgeous images that have been patiently waiting for us since Day Four.

Day 15 - Text Only Pinterest Graphic - Canva
We're almost there!
 
You have done an amazing job making some really beautiful text-only images, and today we'll make our last one! We're halfway through the course, can you believe it?
 
Tomorrow we'll get back to those images you found in our first week together, but for today? It's time to play with Pinterest!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a text-only Pinterest graphic in Canva.
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to canva.com 
2. Log in if you aren't still connected, click "More" and scroll until you find the Pinterest template 
3. Find a free template you want to use and add your own quote 
4. You've totally got this! Use all those font/style/size/spacing/transparency tricks we've learned over the last two weeks to create a beautiful Pinterest image. 
5. When you like how it looks, click "download" and save it to your desktop as an image!
 
  
 
It's a perfect, pinnable image! Pinterest loves tall, vertical images so I love how easy it is to make these in Canva. If you happen to already have a square image created for Instagram or Facebook, you can add it to a Pinterest layout (either using one that already has a spot for an image or adding an image frame to a plain layout), add a little extra text or a border, and POOF! Awesome, right?
 
Tomorrow we'll be back in Canva to learn how to add those watermarks to the photos we've already saved!
 
Your Notes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     









Day 16 - Watermarks
Remember those images you found on Unsplash, CreationSwap and on your own phone? It's time to do a little work with them today! That's right - this is the start of the section of the course that focuses on images - woot!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a watermark on your images in Canva.
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to canva.com 
2. Log in if you aren't still connected and choose the Instagram post template, just to make it easier when you share later! 
3. Scroll all the way down until you find a blank template already set up to hold one image 
  
 
4. Click "Uploads" in the left sidebar to choose one of the photos you've already uploaded - drag and drop it over onto the Instagram post square 
5. Click "Text" in the left sidebar to add text to your image (I choose "add a little bit of body text" for watermarks, because you want a small font) 
6. Use the text toolbars to change the font, size, and transparency (I go with a 14 point font or smaller for a watermark, and I decrease the transparency to around 90%) 
7. When you like how it looks, click "download" and save it to your desktop as an image!
 
  
 
So what's the big deal about adding your website or watermark to your images? If you are creating beautiful quote images, they'll probably be shared. And when they're shared, they might not be linked back to your original blog post, or even your account. 
 
 
BUT if you have your name, website, or other identifying watermark on your image, readers will be able to find their way back to you (and it gives you proper credit for creating the image!).
 
Bonus Tip: If you have a signature or logo that you'd rather use as your watermark, using PicMonkey is the easiest way to add those to your images. Simply: 
1. Go to PicMonkey 
2. Click "Edit" and upload your image 
3. On the left sidebar, click the butterfly icon to access the overlays, and choose "Your Own" 
4. Upload your logo/signature image, adjust the size, and use the "fade" feature to adjust the transparency 
5. Save it to your desktop and tada! All done :)
 
Tomorrow we'll spend a little time in PicMonkey learning to create collages!
 
Your Notes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     









Day 17 - Photo Collage - PicMonkey
Raising my cup of coffee to you today, friends!
 
{Insert happy dance}
 
Today we're going to create a photo collage. Which might not seem like something you'll use very often, but if you ever host a giveaway on your blog, want to create a great Pinterest graphic using photos from a party, or you simply want to do a round up of your favorite things, collages can really make your content pop!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a photo collage in PicMonkey.
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to PicMonkey 
2. Click on "Collage" and choose the 3-5 photos you want to include (you can either do cmd+click on a Mac or ctrl+click on a PC to choose multiple photos at once, or you can do one at a time - you can always add more after the collage page opens by clicking "open photo") 
 
  
 
3. Drag and drop your photos into the template OR choose a different template by clicking on the icon with three squares and choosing the one that works best for your photos 
4. Move the image boxes around to find the best fit for your photos (you can also add and delete image boxes to customize your collage - to add one, simply drag a new photo onto the collage. To delete one, just click the "x" in the upper right corner.) 
5. When you like how it looks, change the size (I prefer 600 wide instead of 2000 - it just looks better on my blog & takes up less space) and save it!
  
Right after "drag & drop" - not so great
  
Ah, that's better!
 
Bonus Tip: You can, of course, also create collages in Canva with some of their really fun layouts. The process is really similar - choose the template you like, upload your photos, and drag & drop! 
 
I happen to think PicMonkey makes editing/cropping your images a little easier, but both tools are great (and now that you're becoming pros at using both sites, you can have fun playing to figure out what works best for you!).
 
Tomorrow we'll do part 2 of our collage creation using another one of my favorite apps!
 
Your Notes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     









Day 18 - Photo Collage - Moldiv
So we've already played a little on InstaQuote to create some text-only images, and today I'm introducing you to my favorite collage creation app -Moldiv! 
 
Because sometimes you have photos on your phone that you want to share (maybe you want to do a "Follow Friday" series on Instagram, for example), and you want to show them off in a collage, but you don't want to email them to yourself, make the collage in PicMonkey, email it back to yourself, and then upload to Instagram.
 
Moldiv has more basic (see: free) collage layouts than any other app I've found, and I love how creative you can get with them! Plus, it couldn't be easier to use!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a photo collage in Moldiv.
 
The How-To: 
1. Add Moldiv to your phone (again, I have an iPhone, so if you have something else I'm so sorry if the steps don't match) 
2. Click on the collage layout you want to use 
3. Tap where it says "Tap Here" to choose your photos from your phone (choose "Gallery") 
4. When you've chosen all your photos, click the little checkmark..then ooh and aah as Moldiv adds them for you and they look amazing ;) 
5. Add a watermark to your collage by clicking the "T" button and adding text. Click the "Aa" button to change the font, color, and style of your text. 
6. Click "Ok" to finish and then resize your text by pinching and dragging the edges together to make it smaller. Move it where you want it on your collage, and click the "Upload" button (bottom right) 
7. Add to Instagram!
  
Choose your collage layout (scroll right to see more options!)
  
Photos added, watermark added, ready for Instagram!
 
Fun and easy, right? Be sure to take some time to play with Moldiv when you have a moment - you can't break it, and if you don't like what you create you can always start over!
 
 
Bonus Tip: If you want to create a collage that includes a video, I like the InstaVid app. Super easy to use, free, and a fun way to combine photos and video into one collage!
 
Tomorrow we'll head back over to Canva and learn about some of their great photo editing tools!
 
Your Notes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     









Day 19 - Photo Filters - Canva
We're keeping it pretty simple today so you can play catch up on this one if you'd rather hang with your friends & family :)
 
Even though this challenge won't take long, learning how to use the image filter options in Canva will be a HUGE tool for you when we start creating quote images. 
 
So let's get to it!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Turn one of your photos black & white using the filter tools in Canva.
 
The How-To: 
1. Head over to Canva and choose the Instagram post template 
2. Scroll WAY down through the templates until you find the one set up with one image holder and click to choose it 
  
 
3. Click "Uploads" in the left sidebar and drag and drop your photo onto the template 
4. Click on your photo and then choose "Filter" from the toolbar 
5. Click on "grayscale" 
6. Feel free to add a watermark to your photo before you click "Download" and save
  
The "Before"
  
The "After!"
 
Learning to use the filters in Canva - or any photo editing tool - will really help you so much as you make quote graphics. 
 
This is the section that will allow you adjust the amount of brightness in your photo to help your text pop. It's also where (under "Advanced") you can blur the image to help your reader focus.
 
Just because we find great photos online (or take great photos!) doesn't mean we don't sometimes have to make little changes to help it fit our style, work with our text, or just look awesome!
 
Tomorrow we'll head back over to PicMonkey to create our first quote graphic! WOOT!!

Day 20 - Quote Image - PicMonkey
Day 20!!
 
Can you believe we only have 10 more days? I can't thank you enough for sticking this out with me and doing these challenges. It's been so fun!
 
We're going to get started today making some quote images, and I'm so excited for you to use all those tools and tricks we've learned the last 19 days to rock this one!
 
I'm not going to go into all the detail about where to find the tools & how to use them since we've already covered that part, but definitely flip back to any days you need to reference the steps.
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a quote-image in PicMonkey.
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to PicMonkey and click "Edit" to choose the photo you want to use (choose one of the ones you found in our first few days together) 
2. Click "Tt" in the sidebar to add text 
3. Adjust the font, size, and transparency (don't forget to add your watermark, and feel free to play with text overlays!) 
4. Click "Save" (keeping in mind you might want to resize the photo before you save so it isn't a gigantic file)
 
  
 
Can I tell you a secret?
I almost never get the right look on an image the first time. I get an idea, or find inspiration on Pinterest and try it out. Sometimes it takes me a few tries to get the fonts sized the right way, or I need to scrap an idea for a text overlay because it's just not working.
 
The trick is to keep trying! The more often you make these graphics, the more you'll refine your specific "look" - and that will make it easier for you each time you do a new one!
 
Tomorrow I'll show you how to do something really fun in PicMonkey that I just love :)

Day 21 - Shape Cutouts - PicMonkey
I wish we could all share cupcakes with extra sprinkles today before we get started :) Grab a cup of coffee and let's get into today's challenge, which I think is a really fun feature of PicMonkey and something I've had trouble figuring out how to do for a long time.
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a circle graphic using the shape cutouts in PicMonkey.
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to PicMonkey and click "Edit" to choose the photo you want to use (choose one of the ones you found in our first few days together) 
2. Click on the "Frames" icon in the left sidebar 
3. Choose "Shape Cutouts" at the top - it will automatically choose the circle for you (but if you're feeling sassy you can totally choose a different shape!) 
4. Drag the circle on your photo around until you like what you see - this is what your final image will look like (if you want it to be a smaller circle, simply use the size slider in the editor on the left) 
5. Click "Apply" and then feel free to either leave it as is and save, or add text first. 
6. Click "Save" when you're finished!
  
This is what it will look like in PicMonkey as you work
  
 
Here's an example of a circle cutout image with text that I've used
 
So fun, right?
 
Make sure you check back in tomorrow because we're going to head back to Canva!

Day 22 - Facebook Quote Graphic - Canva
Today is the part of the course I think most of you were waiting for - spending a few days making quote graphics in Canva!
 
Let's get to it, shall we?
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a quote graphic in Canva using a Facebook post template.
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to Canva and choose "Facebook Post" - this is already set up to be the preferred size for images to be shared with you audience on Facebook 
2. Choose a template that you'd like to use, keeping in mind that you might need to delete or replace some of the "paid" features if you don't want to ... you know ... pay for them 
3. Head to "Uploads" to drag and drop your photo onto the background (just an FYI: Canva will automatically apply the template filter settings to your photo, so you might need to change those if you don't like how it looks) 
4. Click on the text you want to edit and add one of your quotes you've been collecting - you can keep the font formatting in the template, or adjust it to fit your font preferences 
5. When you like how it looks, click "download" and save as an image to your desktop!
 
  
A fun background with a bit of blur, two solid fonts & a dash of whimsy work for this quote!
 
I can't wait to see what you've created today!
 
Tomorrow we'll be back in Canva, this time to work with an Instagram template :)
 
Your Notes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     









Day 23 - Instagram Quote Graphic - Canva
Can you believe we only have a week left? The amount of work you've done is simply amazing, and I hope each lesson leaves you feeling a little more confident in your abilities to make beautiful social media graphics!
 
As we get into today's challenge, I want to encourage you to think about the space your text takes up on your image. Often when I'm creating a quote image and can't figure out why it's not looking right, it's because I'm either making the text too large and it's overwhelming the photo, or the text is too small and getting lost.
 
Don't be afraid to leave some space around your text, to move it from one side to the other, or to use different sizes of the same font to help direct your reader's eye!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a quote graphic in Canva using an Instagram post template.
 
The How-To: 
1. Go to Canva and choose "Instagram Post" - this is already set up to be the preferred size for images to be shared with you audience on Instagram 
2. Choose a template that you'd like to use, keeping in mind that you might need to delete or replace some of the "paid" features if you don't want to ... you know ... pay for them 
3. Head to "Uploads" to drag and drop your photo onto the background (just an FYI: Canva will automatically apply the template filter settings to your photo, so you might need to change those if you don't like how it looks) 
4. Click on the text you want to edit and add one of your quotes you've been collecting - you can keep the font formatting in the template, or adjust it to fit your font preferences 
5. When you like how it looks, click "download" and save as an image to your desktop!
  
You can do shape cutouts in Canva, too - just find the right template!
 
Bonus Tip: There aren't many great tools for scheduling Instagram posts, but one that I've found and like a lot is Latergramme. 
 
Creating Instagram images in Canva will ensure that your images are the right size (and shape!) for Instagram, and then you can use Latergramme to upload, schedule and post!
Tomorrow we'll be back in Canva, and we're going to get creative!

Day 24 - Quote Graphic - Canva
I'm really excited to see what everyone designs today :) We've figured out how to format fonts, edit photos with filters, use overlays and text holders and now it's your turn to create something that is genuinely YOU.
 
No templates, no rules, just whatever you think looks best using the skills you already have. Ready?
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a quote graphic in Canva - anything goes!
 
The How-To: 
1. Head over to Canva 
2. Create whatever you want! 
3. When you love it, download & save the image to your computer.
  
This is something I use as my featured image on every blog post!
 
Bonus Tip: Here's what I love about a tool like Canva. Once you've created an image that you really like, it's saved for you to edit and use as many times as you want!
 
My blog home page, for example, looks best when I have a standard "featured image" look for every post. So all I did was create one I loved, and then when I have a post ready, I pop over to Canva, swap out the text, change the text holder color for some variety, and download!
 
Easy peasy!
 
Tomorrow we'll be back in Canva to make Pinterest graphics!

Day 25 - Pinterest Quote Graphic - Canva
Did you have fun yesterday? As much as I love learning something new, I feel like I don't really absorb it until I'm left on my own to play and create. 
 
Although in school I remember hating the "freedom" to write about any topic I wanted, so hopefully yesterday was fun and not stressful.
 
I'm just going to pretend you all loved it, ok? Okay.
 
Today we're going to jump back into using a Canva template to create a quote image for Pinterest. You might remember making a text-only image for Pinterest on Day 15, and today we're going to take it up a level by using one of our images!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a quote graphic in Canva using a Pinterest template!
  
I'm not going to walk you through the steps because I think you've figured it out by now! Just start with a Pinterest template that you like and add your own photo, quote, and font styles, keeping in mind that you can always use the image filters and text holders to help you text pop (you can go back to some of the previous sections for reminders on how to use those).
 
For the image I created, above, I added an Instagram image I'd already created and placed it on a Pinterest template with some extra text in a text holder to create a new image that would be much more visually appealing when shared on Pinterest. 
 
You don't need to totally reinvent the wheel if you have a graphic you already like!
 
Tomorrow I'm going to share with you my #1 tool to make sharing images on Instagram a breeze!

Day 26 - Squaready
Today is another easy challenge day (in case you want to catch up tomorrow) but it was, surprisingly, the tip that attendees at a conference said was their favorite takeaway of a 3 hour graphics lab. Are you ready?
 
Today's Challenge: 
Share a horizontal image on Instagram using Squaready.
 
The How-To: 
1. Download the free Squaready app to your phone 
2. Open the app and click the "1" to choose an image from your phone (find one that is horizontal if you can) 
3. Click the 4th button on the bottom of the screen to fit your image to a square 
4. Click the "upload" arrow in the top right to add to Instagram!
  
Not quite the look I was going for...
 
  
Ahh...that's better!
 
That's it! No more frustration over Instagram chopping your images off, losing your watermark, or trying to figure out which friend to crop out of the photo before you share ;)
 
Tomorrow we're going to use the skills we've been learning to give our Facebook pages a little makeover ;)
 
Your Notes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     









Day 27 - Facebook Cover - Canva
We are wrapping up this course with our last week of challenges, and we're going to do a few things that will take the tools we've learned and use them to give our social media spaces a little makeover.
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a Facebook Cover in Canva.
 
The How-To: 
1. Head to Canva 
2. Click on the "Facebook Cover" template 
3. Find a design you like, or make one from scratch (whatever makes you happy!) 
4. Add your photos and text, make your edits, and "download" to save to your computer 
5. Don't forget to upload it to your Facebook page!
 
  
 
I've tried making Facebook cover images in other tools, and they never seem to line up just right.
A few hints: you'll want to make sure your text falls closer to the center and bottom of your image, and you'll want to leave some space around your text to make sure nothing is chopped off accidentally by a random Facebook cropping incident.
 
If you're like me, I don't have a Facebook page for my blog (I have more fun on Twitter and Instagram), so I like to use the photo collage templates to share recent photos of my family on my Facebook page. 
 
If you have a page for your blog or website, however, using Canva is a great way to create cover images that match your branding on your text and quote images!
 
Speaking of Twitter, tomorrow we'll be back to give our Twitter profiles a makeover!
 
Your Notes:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     









Day 28 - Twitter Header - Canva
I heard a rumor that your Twitter page is feeling a little neglected now that you've given your Facebook page a bit of a makeover. Fortunately for us, Canva has a tool and a template for almost anything we'd want to do - including Twitter Headers!
 
Today's Challenge: 
Create a Twitter Header in Canva.
 
The How-To: 
1. Head to Canva 
2. Scroll WAY over and click on the "Twitter Header" template 
3. Find a design you like, or make one from scratch (whatever makes you happy!) 
4. Add your photos and text, make your edits, and "download" to save to your computer 
5. Don't forget to upload it to your Twitter page!
 
  
 
You might be wondering why you couldn't just upload the Facebook Cover image as your Twitter Header. 
 
 
Well, depending on your design, it might work. But unfortunately for us, Facebook and Twitter like to be JUST different enough that the sizes, location of our avatar, and general spacing sometimes make it challenging to use one image in two places.
 
Bonus Tip: Consistency in your brand is key, which means keeping a similar look and feel to your avatars and header images across your social media platforms, and make sure your bio is consistent as well!
 
See you tomorrow!

Day 29 - Upgrade Time!
Sniffle.
I won't be sad that we end our time together tomorrow. Nope.
SNIFFLE.
 
Today's Challenge: 
Update one of your first text-only images in Canva.
 
The How-To: 
1. Head to Canva 
2. Find one of your first text-only images and give it a makeover! 
3. When you're happy with how it looks, click "Download" and save as an image to your computer.
 
Why go back and update one of your first images? The same reason we go back and update our evergreen content with new links on our blogs, or why we redesign our blogs or take new headshots. 
 
We're always learning, always growing, and refreshing archived graphics is a great way to give your content new life on social media!
 
Tomorrow we'll do our final challenge together - creating a printable!

Day 30 - Printable - Canva
You did it!! This is it - our last day together and I can't tell you how much fun I've had. I hope you've enjoyed our time together and that you've learned at least one thing you didn't know before - that will make it totally worth it in my book!
 
We're going to end our course with what I've lovingly termed our "final" project - just like in college, we're going to take all we've learned and put it together into one gorgeous, beautiful, PRINTABLE!
 
And yes, I'll even share some tools you can use to share your printable with your audience once you've created it.
 
Today's Challenge: 
Created a printable in Canva.
 
The How-To: 
1. Head to Canva 
2. Scroll over and click on "Real Estate Flyer" (because it's already sized to be 8.5 x 11, which is what you'll want) 
3. Choose a layout if one will work for you, or start with a blank image holder template 
4. Drag & drop your desired background image from your Uploads, or choose a background 
5. Add your text, using overlays and various text sizes that work well with your quote and brand 
6. When you like how it looks, add your watermark, and download to your computer as a PDF
 
  
 
This will probably be your most time consuming project that we've done. It takes me awhile to find the right combination of font sizes and design to match my quote - but I find that checking out printables I've already added to my Pinterest boards helps a lot. Not to copy, but for inspiration. 
 
Here are some things to ask yourself when you're looking at a printable someone else created that you like a lot:

What is it about the fonts that I like?
How did they use size to add interest?
Are there other design elements I could add?
How many colors do they use in their design?

 
Maybe all of your favorite printables are chalkboard art - that's a pretty clear direction to go in for yours! Or maybe you like handlettering, or you prefer a shorter quote in large blocky letters. Whatever it is that you try, just don't be afraid to start! You can always start over :)
 
Once your printable is saved to your computer, there are a few ways you can share it with your readers. You can save it to your Google Drive or Dropbox and share the link with your readers, or you could use a WordPress tool called "Easy Digital Downloads." 
 
I love this tool and it's a great way to control not only your free content (and track downloads) but also gives you the opportunity to sell products in the future, in case you ever have an eBook or set of printables that you want to offer you readers. 
 
You'll also have a clear link to share with your email subscribers, if a free printable is something you'd like to gift them when they sign up!

So that's it! I feel like I should hand you a diploma with a beautiful gold seal and tell you "well done!" Actually, head here for one I created for you in Canva ;)
 
Because even if you don't love everything you created, or you're still not sure about some of the steps, making it the whole way through this course is no small thing. 
 
If I can be honest with you, there are A LOT of images on my own site that I'd love to change, simply because every time I learn a new skill or find a new tool, I realize how much better my images COULD be. 
 
But as long as we keep trying, keep growing, and keep learning, we're well on our way! My job puts me in a position to create several social media images every day, and my own blog requires the same work. It takes practice, it takes being willing to start over when it's going the way you planned, and it takes courage. 

Make the image. 
Add it to your blog post.
Share it to Instagram.
Update your Facebook page. 
Create the printable. 

 
Take a deep breath and click "publish." You'll never regret the art you create, but you might regret not making it. 
 
Many thanks to Katrina Lee, Heidi Guyer, and Janelle Allen for always encouraging and supporting me. Thank you to my husband Matt who cheers for me even when he doesn't understand what I'm talking about {wink}, and to my team at (in)courage/DaySpring for helping me see this dream become a reality. And last, but not least, to the amazing #creativebasics community - there is good in the world, and on the internet, and you are it, friends. 
With love,
