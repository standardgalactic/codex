Chapter 1: Getting Started
In this chapter, you will learn some of the most commonly used features of NX. Also, you will learn about the user interface.
In NX, you construct 3D parts and use them to generate 2D drawings and 3D assemblies.
NX is Feature Based. Features are shapes that are combined to build a part. You can modify these shapes individually. 
              
Most of the features are sketch-based. A sketch is a 2D profile and can be extruded, revolved, or swept along a path to construct features.
  
NX is parametric in nature. You can specify standard parameters between the elements of a part. Changing these parameters changes the size and shape of the part. For example, see the design of the body of a flange before and after modifying the parameters of its features

TUTORIAL 1
This tutorial takes you through the creation of your first NX model. You construct the Disc of an Old ham coupling: 
  

 

Starting a New Part File

To start a new part, click the New  button on ribbon; the New dialog appears.
The Model template is the default selection, so click OK; a new model window appears.

               
Starting a Sketch

To start a new sketch, click the Sketch button on the Direct Sketch group; the Create Sketch dialog appears.

 
  
 

Select the XZ plane.

  

Click the OK button on the Create Sketch dialog; the sketch starts.

 
The first feature is an extruded from a sketched circular profile. You will begin by sketching the circle.
 

Click Circleon the Direct Sketch group.
Move the pointer to the sketch origin, and then click. 
Drag the pointer and click to draw a circle.

  

Press ESC to quit the tool.

Adding Dimensions
In this section, you will specify the size of the sketched circle by adding dimensions.  
Note: You may notice that dimensions are applied automatically. However, they do not constraint the sketch.
As you add dimensions, the sketch can attain any one of the following three states:
Fully Constrained sketch: In a fully constrained sketch, the positions of all the entities are fully described by dimensions or constraints or both. In a fully constrained sketch, all the entities are dark green color.
Under Constrained sketch: Additional dimensions or constraints or both are needed to completely define the geometry. In this state, you can drag the sketch elements to modify the sketch. An under constrained sketch element is in maroon color.
Over Constrained sketch: In this state, an object has conflicting dimensions or relations or both. An over constrained sketch entity is grey. The over constraining dimensions are in red color.
 

Double-click on the dimension displayed on the sketch; the Dimension edit box appears.
To change the dimension to 100 mm, type a new value, and then press Enter.
Press Esc to quit the Dimension tool.

To display the entire circle at a full size and to center it in the graphics area, use one of the following methods:

Chapter 3: Constructing Assembly
 
               
               
In this chapter, you will: 
               

Add Components to an assembly
Apply constraints between components        
Produce exploded view of the assembly               

               

 

TUTORIAL 1
This tutorial takes you through the creation of your first assembly. You construct the Oldham coupling assembly: 
                
Copying the Part files into a new folder

Create a folder named Oldham_Coupling at the location NX 10/C3.
Copy all the part files constructed in the previous chapter to this folder.

 
Opening a New Assembly File

To open a new assembly, click File > New; the New dialog appears.

 

Click Assembly in the Template group.
Click OK; a new assembly window appears. In addition, the Add Component dialog appears.

Click OK to place the Flange at the origin.

 
There are two ways of constructing any assembly model. 
 

Top-Down Approach 
Bottom-Up Approach

Top-Down Approach
You open the assembly file, and then construct components files in it. 
               
Bottom-Up Approach
You construct the components first, and then add them to the assembly file. In this tutorial, you construct the assembly using this approach.
 
Adding the second component

Click OK on the Add Component dialog; the Assembly Constraints dialog appears.

 
After adding the components to the assembly environment, you have to apply constraints between them. By applying constraints, you establish relationships between components. You can apply the following types of constraints between components.
  Touch Align: Using this constraint, you can make two faces coplanar to each other. Note that if you set the Orientation to Align, the faces will point in the same direction. You can also align the centerlines of the cylindrical faces.
 Concentric: This constraint makes the centers of circular edges coincident. In addition, the circular edges will be on the same plane.
  Distance: This constraint provides an offset distance between two objects.
 Fix: This constraint fixes a component at its current position. 
 Parallel: This constraint makes two objects parallel to each other.
Perpendicular: This constraint makes two objects perpendicular to each other.
 Fit: This constraint brings two cylindrical faces together. Note that they should have the same radius.
 Bond: This constraint makes the selected components rigid so that they move together.
 Center: This constraint positions the selected component at a center plane between two components.
 Angle: Applies angle between two components.
 Align/Lock: Aligns the axes of two cylindrical faces and locks the rotation.               
 

On the Assembly Constraints dialog, select Type > Touch Align.
Under the Geometry to Constrain section, select Orientation > Infer Center/Axis.
On the Assembly Constraints dialog, uncheck the Preview Component in Main Window option.
