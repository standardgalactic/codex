Introduction
Before You Get Started Reading

I have a VERY important message that you MUST READ!
I promise you it's not spam and I'm not trying to sell you anything!

Most people have heard of body language, but fewer have heard of the term 'kinesics'. Kinesics is the fancy psychological term for body language and is technically defined as the study of facial expressions and gestures. 
 
The basis of kinesics is simple; movement, expression and gesture are all part of communication. They can convey meaning and intent in order to understand other people better. Kinesics is still a nascent science - you won't suddenly become a Machiavellian mind reader by studying it. However, you will start to, on occasion, read and interpret the people around you more successfully by being mindful of small cues - such as body posture - to understand what other people may be feeling. 
 
The allure of kinesics is in it's hidden power. We like to be in control of our own actions and how we present ourselves to other people. The notion that our own body language can betray what we are saying, or that we can pick up on the duplicity of other people is intoxicating. 
 
This is especially true in the workplace or unfamiliar social settings. We all want to give the impression of confidence, calmness and competence but sometimes our body language may undermine us. If you've ever walked away from an interview wondering why you didn't get that job you wanted, or why people don't seem to take to you as quickly as they should, your failure may be due to poor understanding of kinesics. This book aims to solve that! 
 
There are six chapters in this book. The first chapter will take you through the basics of kinesics, informing you about how body language is categorized.
 
The second chapter will take you through other categorizations of body language that you might hear on occasion, such as haptics and paralanguage.
 
The third chapter will teach you how to improve your non-verbal communication, by managing stress and being mindful of body language-verbal inconsistencies and much more.
 
The fourth chapter will help you get to grips with how to make a good first impression and the psychological factors that influence how you are perceived on first appearance. 
 
The fifth chapter will give you a small introduction to some of the cultural differences in body language and the interpretation of gestures.
 
Finally the sixth chapter will go into depth about an array of body language habits that people regularly display and how you should interpret them. 
 
By the time you have read this book you should have a thorough understanding of the basis of body language, to help you improve and flourish in your relationships with other people. 










The Basics of Kinesics
Body language, or kinesics as it is technically referred to, has been separated into five categories by social scientists. In this chapter learn about each of these five categories in turn. 
 









Emblems
Emblems are signals that are 'concrete' and have a defined meaning in a certain culture or context. A thumbs up gesture is understood to communicate that everything is "ok" or that something went well. 
 
Bear in mind that emblems are culturally sensitive however and that different regions in the world will have different meanings for the same emblems (covered in more detail in chapter 5).
 
Specific groups or subcultures may have their own emblems. It is not unusual for gangs or groups to develop their own emblems as a welcoming gestures or to show who is a member of the in-group. Think back to your school days - it is likely that you either had one of these emblems yourself or knew someone that did.
 
Alternatively people develop their own signals to communicate in social situations without other people understanding - such as secret 'sign language' or codes that children might use in school during lessons to not get the attention of the teachers. 
 









Illustrators
Illustrators are gestures and movements that help convey and exaggerate what a person is saying. People commonly use illustrators when they are trying to describe something, moving their hands to signal shape, size or direction. Illustrators can also include pointing.
 
Bear in mind that illustrators are less consciously controlled than emblems. However, this nature can be used to help make inferences about other people. If someone is making a vast display with illustrators this often means they are highly engaged, but they may not have a huge degree of conscientiousness about their actions. 
 
Conversely, if someone isn't displaying any illustrators they may not be engaged in the conversation at all or may not be enjoying it. 
 
Illustrators can also often betray our true intents. If we are trying to say one thing, but we actually think or feel differently than our illustrators are one of main ways our body language can undermine us, as they can signal something different. Inconsistency between illustrators and our verbal communication, at the very least gives the impression of insincerity. 
 
A common illustrator is often is a karate chop motion onto one open palm. This shows assertiveness and forcefulness. If someone displays this illustrator they often strong believe what they are saying, or they have a slightly aggressive slant. 
 
Similarly, showing or tensing the knuckles often symbols aggression or a desire to be aggressive. 
 
Not all illustrators are aggressive however! A raised palm and wagging finger for example, is often very condescending and in poor taste. It is used to signal that someone has made a mishap or done something wrong, but in a childish or lowly way. This illustrator should almost never be used as it will immediately turn people away from you. 
 
Likewise, holding a palm over your heart is another illustrator that you need to carefully consider before using. It can be interpreted in the sense that you are being emotional and that what you are saying or listening to is heartfelt.
 
However, it can also come across as incredibly sarcastic, especially when apologizing or saying something that should be taken as sincere. 
 
It is important to recognize how illustrators can be interpreted, especially as they are non-conscious - you may be turning people away from you or giving signals that you didn't intend to give (although these may display non-conscious feelings). 
 
A full list of illustrators is likely to be rather more extensive then this guide can cover. However, try and start recognizing them in your daily life and whether you frequently display them (or whether people around you do). 
 









Affect Displays
In psychology, affect is a term used that means emotion. Hence, affect displays are emotional displays - movements that confer an emotional meaning. 
 
This includes expressions, but also other aspects of kinesics. We tend to interpret people who are slouched or clinging to their own body with their arms as lacking in confidence or sad. Conversely, people who walk with a spring in their step or who bounce and are quite bodily animated when they talk as being happy. These are both examples of affect displays. Affect displays are often rather uncontrolled and spontaneous - as compared to emblems, which are used deliberately. 
 
One common affect display is rubbing one's hands together. This is generally interpreted as a signal of excitement and anticipation. This movement actually serves a purpose however - it warms your hands together, which prepares them for action. 
 
The intensity of this movement typically correlates to how powerful the emotion is felt - with faster rubbing motions, designating higher levels of anticipation. 
 
Another affect display is rolling your sleeves up. This is another display that is preparing yourself for action - in this case, ensuring that your clothes don't get dirty or in the way of whatever you are trying to accomplish. 
 
Affect displays are particularly hard to handle because they are one of the most spontaneous types of action. However, you can also learn about how they are portrayed and how to consider you should respond to them. If you make an aggressive affect display, you may want to make more passive or open displays which don't give out such aggressive impressions. 
 









Regulators
Regulators are nonverbal movements that help moderate what people are saying and the flow of conversation. Nodding or shaking one's head for example, communicates agreement or disagreement, which helps the other members of the conversation direct what they want to say. Other regulators may include simply walking away (or starting to walk away) or raising a finger (to gesture for silence). 
 
Regulators tend to go unnoticed apart from the instances where they are not being used. If there is a lack of regulators, it is painfully obvious that they are not present. People interrupt each other, or one person overtakes the conversation and overall the conversation does not flow naturally. 
 
If you find that you are one of these people that often interrupts other people then perhaps you are not registering the regulators other people are making. 
 
Any signal that the other people in a conversation are impatient is a sign that its probably your turn to stop talking, this may include fidgeting or shuffling the body. Alternatively, it might include learning forward or sitting with the mouth open (in preparation to speak). Other signals might include people displaying illustrators or emblems, which also signals that they are ready to communicate and that you might need to give them a chance to speak. 
 
Similarly if people seem distracted or otherwise uninterested, perhaps you are not giving them enough opportunity to voice themselves. Overall, sometimes it is better just to prompt other people and listen, rather than feel the need to speak yourself, especially if you suspect your might inhibit conversation through not recognising regulators. 
 









Adaptors
Adaptors are behaviors that people employ, at low levels of self-awareness, which may indicate how they are feeling. To clarify, these include movements such as fiddling with one's hair, fidgeting with stationary, scratching at itches, bouncing on chairs, biting your lip (and so on). 
 
Typically these actions are not interpreted as due to a conscious desire to perform a specific action, but rather as a habitual response. Adaptors are interesting because they do not have an intended meaning, but rather can be trigger by anxiety or stress. Adaptors are often developed in our younger years and can be increasingly displayed the more anxious we feel. Owing to the fact that they develop due to environmental conditions, adaptors can vary wildly between different people. 
 
Adaptors can be useful in uncovering lies and moments of tension. If someone isn't telling you the truth - or is fabricating their story or account in some way (such as exaggerating) they tend to feel more anxious and stressed than normal. Therefore they may start to display adaptors and other signs of stress. 
 
They may also highlight different parts of the conversation which are stress inducing. If you have mentioned a topic of conversation that makes other people uncomfortable for example, you might notice they start to produce adaptors. 
 
However, they may also be entirely meaningless. Not everyone fidgets due to anxiety - sometimes people are uncomfortable for common sense reasons. Alternatively, some people have a tendency to fidget or otherwise move around. Be sure that you do not over-interpret! 










Academic Fields of Body Language
Kinesics is the academic term for body language, but there is an entire spectrum of non-verbal communication each of which has their own field of study. In this chapter learn about the other types of non-verbal communication.
 









Motorics
Motorics, as the name implies, is the study of movement in regards to communication. This includes the sub-groups of;
 
Mimics - movements of the face
 
Pantomimics - the movement/position of the entire body
 
Gesture - movements of the arms and hands
 
There the most important point to make here is that expressions (which fall under the category of mimics) are universal. 
 
No matter where you are in the world and what culture you are talking to, all people will interpret an expression in the same way. This provides a useful basis for communication between people of different languages or origins - let your expressions speak for you! 
 









Oculesics
Oculescis the study or use of eye movements in non-verbal communication. 
 
Humans have a great ability in interpreting the eye movements of other humans. We can interpret a wandering gaze as a sign of distraction or lack of interest in the current conversation. 
 
Direct eye contact can cause a feeling of intimacy or confidence and an avoidant gaze can imply insecurity or lack of confidence. Yet conversely, at times direct eye gaze can feel inappropriate or awkward.
 
Eye movement can also influence the flow and control of a conversation. Changes in eye movement can be used to signal a new event which requires attention or to direct people to where we are looking.  
 









Haptics
The study or use of physical touch in non-verbal communication.
 
The use of touch in non-verbal communication is incredibly complicated and nuanced. Touch can convey a vast range of emotions and intents, from playfulness to sexual attraction, to love & intimacy or even threat & violence. Touch can also be part of social convention and ritual, such as a handshake or high five. 
 
The use of touch also varies dramatically across cultures and countries. Even within western countries, friendly touch is more common and accepted within continental Europe, as opposed to in the U.K and U.S. 
 
Touch also varies notably across genders. Studies suggest that men interpret being touched as different than woman and are more likely to respond negatively - potentially due to implications of dominance and submissiveness. 
 
The main take-home point of touch is that it is a very emotional method of communication, often with a greater level of intensity than other methods. If touch is used in conjunction with language and non-verbal communication, it can emphasize and reinforce the impression you make. This is a double-edged sword however - if someone is uncomfortable with your presence, or perceives you negatively, touching them will likely strengthen this perception. 
 









Proxemics
The study and use of space in non-verbal communication. Proxemics interacts and influences haptics - you will need to be within a certain distance before touching even becomes appropriate. 
 
If someone is standing 'too close' this can be interpreted as uncomfortable or inappropriate by the other person in the conversation. The appropriate level of closeness largely depends on the relationship between the two people involved. Study of proxemics has distinguished four approximate regions of space people can occupy in relation to another. 
 
Intimate Distance - Less than 1.5ft 
Personal Space - 1.5ft to 4ft
Social Space -  4ft to 12ft
Public Space - 12ft - 25ft 
 
Intimate space is used for direct touch, embraces or whispering. Naturally intimate space conveys a strong and close relationship between the two people involved, often being lovers.
 
Personal space is typically for close friends and family. If other less familiar individuals enter this space, it is determined uncomfortable by the majority of people. 
 
Social space is for acquaintances and other people who do not fall into the previous categories. This space is close enough to be considered reasonably engaged with the other person, but does not display any kind of intimacy or closeness.
 
The public space is often used for public speaking or group interactions. This is the upper bound for when conversations or verbal communication take place between people and groups. 
 









Chronemics
The study and use of time in non-verbal communication. A fast tempo to a conversation can often be the result of anger or frustration, but it can also be as a result of engagement and excitement. Slower tempo can be the result of a lack of interest in both parties, but it can also imply that they are comfortable in each others presence. Slow tempo and pauses can often imply confidence.
 
Outside of conversation, the use of time also carries various connotations. In the western  and east asian world, the use of time is called 'monochronic', which basically means precise or measured. Arriving exactly on time to an event is considered; being five, ten or any amount of time later is interpreted as rude (at least without reason). 
 
Conversely, in other regions, such as Latin America or Africa, time usage is often called 'polychronic'. Broader time categories are used to signal events, such as 'morning', 'afternoon', 'dusk' and there is more wideness and variance for when a person can appear for events. 
 









Paralanguage
The study and use of the voice in non-verbal communication. This may sound rather contradictory but paralanguage is actually hugely relevant. Psychology considers that a large factor in our communication are non-verbal (i.e not language based) aspects of our speech. This includes factors such as rhythm, intonation, speaking style and stress. 
 
Think about your own experiences. You are more likely to engage with a person who is not speaking in a monotone and likewise, greater orators know how to alter and control the pace and emphasis of what they are saying for greater impact.  
 
Similarly, if someones voice is cracking or shacking we will interpret what  they are saying as being more emotional than if their voice were calm, even if they are saying the exact same message. 
 
To improve your paralanguage, you will need to practice. Speakers typically train themselves by giving their speech or presentation in front of a full length mirror so they can see themselves whilst speaking. Likewise, it is common for speakers and orators to record their own speech so they can better analyze their speaking habits. 
 









 Bipedics
The study and use of foot and leg gestures in non-verbal communication. Bipedics is a relatively new addition to the other categories, with far less research on how influential it is. Nonetheless, be aware of its existence! You may hear of bipedics in the future!
 
As you can see, there are a lot of categories! Many of these categories overlap or cover the same conceptual space - bipedics (movement of the legs & feet) for example, can be interpreted as a sub-group of motirics (movement). Similarly, the categories mentioned in chapter 1 will also fit into the categories (emblems for example are a type of gesture). 
 
It's not crucial to appreciate the exact categorizations, but they can give you a great lead for further research and well as the striking variety of body language signals that people actually consider. Chances are, before reading this chapter you were not aware that bipedics - or the body language of the legs and hips - was a scientific field of its own accord! Yet now you know that even your legs can give influence how you are portrayed. 










Improving Non-Verbal Communication
Now that you are familiar with the theory and definitions regarding non-verbal communication, it's time to put this knowledge to work. This chapter covers how to actually improve your non-verbal communication skills. 
 
One of the key points to remember is that you still need to be genuine and honest when influencing your body language. Use the knowledge you have compiled to develop self-awareness and understanding of the people around you. Utilizing this self-awareness, you can then selectively emphasize parts of your communication for greater effect. 
 
The point being made is that body language is not magical and will not be able to utterly transform how you are perceived. If you try to 'fake' your body language, it can cause yourself to feel stressed as well as produce inconsistent signals, which can counteract whatever effect you are attempting to produce, especially if you are not well practiced. 
 
Always start by being self-aware of your habits. Once you are familiar with your habits, slightly adjust them when appropriate. The better you become at recognizing and changing your body language, the more you can influence it. You should work your way up to the deep end, rather than jumping in straight away!
 
With this in mind, consider what you want to achieve whenever you are manipulating your body language. Theorists have argued non-verbal communication can lead to the following outcomes:
 
Repetition - Emphasizes and reinforces the message you are saying verbally
 
Contradiction - Undermines or counteract the message you are saying verbally
 
Substitution - Used in place of a verbal message (often for more effect)
Complementing - Also reinforces and emphasizes verbal communication, but in a slightly different manner to repetition. Complementing adds emotional impact.
 
Accenting - Reinforcement that changes how the message is perceived. Hitting the wall as you speak will give your message a much more aggressive implication, for example. 
 
Be aware of these roles and consider what area you may be looking to improve upon. If people do not seem to take well to you, you may have a habit of contradicting your verbal behaviors with non-verbal communication.
 
Failing to manage eye contact, or holding an uncomfortable body posture will almost always lead people to be uncomfortable in your presence, even if you are otherwise pleasant, interesting or funny. 
 
Conversely, a lack of accenting or repetition can mean that your speeches or goal based communications do not garner the impact they deserve. 
 
The general rule here is to be aware of inconsistencies between what you are saying and how your body language is portraying you.
 
When looking for these inconsistencies, however, it is important to look for trends. Body language is incredibly rich and nuanced; over-interpreting and analyzing every aspect will made your head spin. Instead, look for groups of signals and signs that are persistently and strongly presented. These tend to underlie stronger feelings. 
 
Likewise, be aware of you own potential to misread other people's body language. It's fine to pick up on the signals of other people and respond accordingly, but at the end of the day, every situation is ambiguous. It is often best to not to take most signals you perceive too much to heart, especially if they are infrequent. 
 
Next, rely upon your instinctual feelings. Humans are social animals and nearly all of us, by default, will have a strong understanding of body language, even if we are not explicitly aware of the fact. Our ability to control our body language, or be aware of it in the first place, is our main failing when it comes to communication. 
 
Additionally, you need to learn to deal with and manage stress. Our body language is often compromised due to the negative emotions that we encounter in social situations, such as stress or anxiety. These emotions are often about our own personal state of mind, rather than the world or the people around us. Nonetheless, they influence how other people perceive us and therefore how they interact with us. 
 
Ultimately, there is a self-fulfilling relationship between negative body language and negative interactions with other people. Our ability to control our body language is limited, so often it is more advantageous to manage the stress and anxiety that are causing the negative body language to begin with. In this sense, it is important to treat the cause, rather than the symptoms.
 
Furthermore, stress and anxiety also influence how we interpret the body language of other people. When we are feeling stressed or anxious, we are more likely to misinterpret the body language of other people, often in a negatively biased way. 
 
Simply put, stress and anxiety compromise our body language in a myriad of ways and must be dealt with before body language can be improved.
 
Additionally, one more way you can improve is to simply ask people who you are close to how you are perceived when you communicate. Sometimes you may perceive yourself as being portrayed worse than your body language actually implies.
 
Alternatively you may be ignorant of one persistent aspect or habit of your body language that is creating a huge amount of impact. Using close friends and family members to ask for feedback is a great way to compensate for a lack of self-awareness of your own body language. 
 
Moreover don't be afraid to occasionally clarify what you  think other people are attempting to communicate. We are often embarrassed or too shy to ask for a clarification in a social setting, yet it is often necessary. Furthermore asking for clarifications also helps develop your body language interpretation. 
 
Another pointer to consider is the context of a given situation. Humans have an almost psychic ability to infer how another person may be feeling, if we take the time to think through the situations they are in. Perhaps their body language is aggressive because they had a bad day at work and they are stressed, rather than any relationship concerns with you. 










The Infamous 'First Impression' 
You've probably heard the popular psychology claim that the first impression we make with a new person has huge implications for how that person will perceive us in the future.
 
Whilst the claims are highly exaggerated, the basis is true; first impressions are vital to how we are considered, especially for acquaintances. For example, a study performed by Malcom Gladwell, found that speed daters made up their mind on whether they were compatible for each other in the first 10 seconds of meeting. 
 
In this chapter learn how to nail the dreaded first impression to ensure that your relationships start in the right way. 
 
First impressions are largely based on factors which you have limited control over. Factors such as age, sex or attractiveness will be judged quickly, and unconsciously, often before you have even spoken. Therefore, if you truly want to maximize your first impression then you need to control the shallow factors first. 
 
This means that you are appropriately dressed for whatever occasion you are in, as well as appropriately groomed. Obviously the convention will be different in different situations, but the intensity of judgments may also vary. Arriving to an interview in casual dress is a significant failure in determining what to wear than going to a social situation slightly overdressed. 
 
Once you have these factors arranged to the best of your ability you can then consider the other psychological factors that you may be able to influence. Current research suggests there are two 'domains' in which we are judged during our first impressions. These domains are continuum's in which we are placed and this rough value will be used to interpret our later behavior. 
 
The first domain is trustworthiness. This factor appears to largely depend on signals and signs that suggest we are happy or angry (which the latter suggesting we are less trustworthy). 
 
This follows conventional advice to introduce yourself with a smile and be pleasant and warm to people when you first talk to them. This gives the impression of happiness, which bizarrely, may be important more important than trustworthiness itself when being judged on trustworthiness. 
 
The second domain is dominance. Dominance, at least on first glance, is largely based upon facial maturity and masculine features.  
 
Dominance is a tricky factor to consider because it is more ambiguous than trustworthiness. We all desire to be perceived as trustworthy, but we may desire to be perceived as dominant or non-dominant depending on the situation. At the very least, we do not want to appear submissive.
 
If we are judged to be highly dominant, our later behavior can be judged as aggressive rather than merely confident. 
 
Obviously your facial profile and bodily maturity cannot be influenced. However, factors such as body posture and the gestures you may can influence judgments of dominance. Open and relaxed posturing is more likely to be perceived as dominant than hunched or closed postures. Likewise, leaning forward or handing a firm (but not bone-breaking) handshake are all factors that dictate dominance. These details will be covered in more depth in Chapter 6. 










Cultural Differences 
Some aspects of our body language and non-verbal communication are universal, such as our expressions. Other aspects, in particular gestures or emblems are very culturally-sensitive. This can lead to huge misunderstandings between people of different cultures. In this chapter learn how some common western gestures may be interpreted differently in other regions of the world. 
 
For example, in the West it is common to use a beckoning gesture to draw people towards you from a distance. This gesture usually involves raising an arm out in front of the body and curling one or more fingers to the palm, signalling that another person should come to your presence. 
 
However, in many Asian cultures, this gesture is highly offensive, as this gesture is related to beckoning dogs. Therefore the usage of that particular gesture is tantamount to calling the other person a dog or hound, which is also a highly sensitive insult in many Asian regions. 
 
Similarly, pointing, which is simply used to direct attention in most Western cultures can be considered offensive in many Asian regions. Instead, raising a hand vertically towards what you want to draw attention to is considered more appropriate. 
 
Winking is a facial movement that highly varies between cultures, and even individuals. Winking is often used playfully in the West, or to communicate an underlying shared knowledge is a social setting. In Latin American, winking is a more sexualized, and is used almost exclusively in that sense. Conversely, in China, winking is often seen as rude altogether.
 
The 'ok' emblem is also interpreted differently in different regions of the world. In Japan, the gesture looks similar to a Japanese coin, and therefore the emblem typically refers to money. In Southern Europe, the Mediterranean and Northern Africa, the same emblem means zero or nothing. 
 
In many middle eastern and Latin American cultures, it is considered more appropriate to stand closer to one another, even in regards to strangers and lesser known acquaintances. Muslim cultures, in general, are much more sensitive with proximity between men and women, however. 
 
Eye contact also varies dramatically between cultures. In some Asian cultures, it is often a sign of disrespect to make eye contact before being familiar with the other person. Especially when a younger person attempts to make eye contact with an older person. 
 
On the same vein, sitting with poor posture is often considered to be disrespectful in many places - signifying a lack of interest or attention.
 
Ultimately, you cannot learn every custom or cultural twist on a gesture or an emblem. However, being aware if the potential differences between cultural gestures can help you avoid an embarrassing mistake. Rely upon verbal communication whenever you can and be forthcoming with your expression (which are more universally understood). 










Interpreting Individual Signals 
As of yet we have most talked about interpreting signals you are probably already aware of. Most of us do not need to be old that slouching implies a lack of confidence, or that shouting implies aggressiveness. Yet there are ranges of smaller signals that are less well understood. This chapter will help you better understand these micro signals. 
 









The Head
The head is one of the key features of body language. We often focus on the face but fail to recognize the overall position of the head. Biology and evolution have taught us to guard our heads, above and beyond all of the other organs of our body. Therefore, if we feel threatened, unsafe or otherwise uneasy, we have a tendency to pull and lift our heads backwards. 
 
It is only when we feel safe and engaged that we will push our heads forward, or if we are looking to fight with another person.  
 
Therefore, you should interpret a forwardness of the head as action taking or aggressive, whilst a lean back of the head is defensive or passive. 
 
This can have implications that you might not anticipate. Leaning your head backwards when your being told a story for example, doesn't just imply that your not engaged, it also implies that you don't believe the story itself (or believe it is exaggerated). 
 
Tilting the head to the side can be a general display of interest or empathy, but this particular habit varies dramatically between people. 
 









Head Nodding
We all know that nodding the head implies agreement. However, depending on the frequency and style of nodding, this agreement can be genuine, false or something else entirely.
 
Nodding is an example of a mirrored behavior - it is a common behavior that people employ to feel accepted or similar to each other. When a person nods during conversation it increases the likelihood that the other people in the conversation will also nod. 
 
What this also means, is that nodding often becomes a unconscious or sub-conscious action that actually has little value on whether a person agrees or not with your topic of conversation. 
 
However, it does almost always imply a sense of good will and connection to the other person. If you start nodding during a conversation but the other person doesn't, this often implies that they don't understand, that they don't agree or simply they don't like you or your topic of conversation. 
 
Test this on your friends or family. Try gently nodding during your conversation and see whether the other person reciprocates. There is a high chance that those you like will start nodding, unconsciously, in return. Of course, do not read too much into this - it may be the case that the other person is highly conscientious of their own actions and doesn't have a tendency to nod. Likewise, if a person is used to appearing agreeable, such as those who work in customer service, they may also tend to defer to nodding in general. 
 
Yet you also have to pay attention on the speed and the overall rhythm of the nod. A gentle, slow nod often is often associated with strong agreement, but also with a genuine interest in the conversation. This nod means that the person is enjoying the conversation and is happy for it to progress as it's a natural pace.
 
Conversely, a fast rapid nod, especially if combined with adaptors or any kind of fidgeting is often a signal that the other person is impatient. They may simply be waiting for their turn in the conversation or for you to stop beating around the bush and make your point. This nod may not actually imply agreement or engagement, but rather them attempting to placate you until they get their turn in conversation. 
 
In between these two nods is a more moderately based nod. This nod is often slightly more deliberate and focused. It tends to imply the other person is engaged and has a good will and attempting to bond or link with you. 
 
Furthermore, also consider whether people who are nodding are looking towards you or away from you. If they are looking away from you. If they are not looking towards you, it can imply distraction and reinforce that they are simply trying to placate you. Alternatively, it can mean that they are pondering your words. People don't maintain direct focus or eye contact all of the time, and they might need a small moment to digest what you are saying. 
 
Also consider, upwards head nods. Upwards nods can be used to signal recognition - they are often used when a person sees another person. They tend to appear more casual and less engaged, so they tend to be employed by people who wish to display a distant. 
 









Head Shake
A shake of the head from side to side generally signals 'no'. Yet there are small variants on how this should be interpreted. A quick, regular head shake implies strong and potent disagreement. This is used in circumstances when the person couldn't disagree more with what you are saying. 
 
A very slow but paced head shake often tends to imply disbelief. This is displayed in circumstances where the other person just outright cannot believe what has been said. It is often associated with denial of what has been said, though this is not always the case. 
 
A gentler, but unstable head nod is often associated with misunderstanding. Think of this as communicating, 'no I don't understand' rather than an outright disagreement or disbelief. 
 
The important point to raise about the head shake is that is often subtle. People attempt to avoid appearing like a caricature, which means they tend to downplay these body language signals. Therefore you need to be particularly attentive when recognizing these signals, especially if you are trying to convince the other person of something. 
 









Aversion
A head nod can imply agreement or a headshake can imply disagreement. Yet one of the most dramatic and strongest head movements is when the head is turned away from the conversation or the other person altogether. Think of how people may react when they are disgusted - they often hunch up and turn away from what disgusts them. This is a similar type of movement. 
 
A full turn-away is a very cold movement, but it still has its own stages. Turning the head away is understood to be less powerful than turning the entire shoulder away. Turning your entire back to someone is one of the coldest movements altogether. 
 
As with all body language movements, this can be misinterpreted for similar body language positions, which mean other things. It is not unusual for someone to look into the distance when they are thinking about a topic of conversation - this isn't the same thing as aversion. 
 
However, if this is accompanied by a lack of responsiveness in the conversation or an overall sign of impatience, then this implies an aversive response. 
 









Vulnerability & Dominance
Just with our head, our torso is also a vulnerable section of the body, which contains major organs, such as the heart and the lungs. The same evolutionary principles that apply to our head, therefore, also apply to our torso which influences our overall body language. When we feel comfortable, safe and confident we are happy to expose your torso and lean forward. Likewise, when we feel insecure or lack confidence we hide the torso or shield it with our arms.
 
You should recognize such displays from people in your life. Bosses and other people in management positions also typically adopt wide, open postures with their torso's unobstructed - a display of confidence and security, even in the workplace or stressful situations. 
 
Resting on your hands on your hips is another display of dominance. 
 
Conversely, it is common for those who are depressed or anxious to feel the need to cover up.  
 
This body language also however relates to we feel dominant and in control of our situation. By leaving your vulnerable sections of your body exposed, this has a strange level of power. It implies that although you are vulnerable, no-one will attack you - which generates even more confidence. 
 
It's stems from the assumption that if there were a conflict, you would win. Hence there is no need to shield the body and the vulnerable positions are also the most dominant. 
 
Although we live in a far more sophisticated environment than the one we evolved from, these simple dominance-related factors still apply. 
 
However, vulnerability doesn't always correlate with dominance. Sometimes vulnerable positions also imply intimacy and trust between the two individuals involved - that an attack or an exploitation of said vulnerability will not occur (therefore it is okay to be vulnerable). 
 









Sexual Body Language
Naturally, we alter our body language depending on who we are attracted to and what impression we want to give to the opposite sex. 
 
Opening or widening the legs often shows attraction, or confidence in a sexual display, which is frequent in young men. Conversely, crossing the legs or holding the palms over this area shows vulnerability, innocence and shyness. 
 
However, often how open our legs are is more a matter of comfort, especially on hot days!  Watch out for legs being opened and an overall display of the crotch region in conjunction with other signals of dominance and confidence, especially in men, if you want to interpret greater levels of meaning. 










Conclusion
Body language is fascinating. It provides a deep layer of communication between two people, displaying signals and signs that words cannot. 
 
We all want to manage how we are perceived at times and what other people think of us, yet we are susceptible to being 'read' through habits that we are not taught to control. Furthermore, we want to read other people better, both to improve our relationships but also, at times, for more self-serving purposes. Achieving the respect from your colleagues at work or nailing that sales pitch requires an intricate knowledge of body language and how to manipulate it. 
 
Yet, what is most interesting of all, is that most of us already have a strong in-built sense of body language. Everyday we respond and interpret this body language, even on a non-conscious level. When we nod our heads in agreement to what someone else is saying or feel uncomfortable around someone who is fidgeting, we are tuning into this body language and acting appropriately. 
 
This guide has aimed itself at helping you make this innate understanding of body language, explicit. By having this guide you should now be aware of the numerous ways in which we display tiny, but significant behaviors that demonstrate what we think or how we feel. Whether it is simply understanding the evolutionary perspective on dominance and vulnerability, recognizing how the different layers of head nods or understanding what gestures are aggressive, this guide has provided you with our modern understanding of body language. 
 
In the first chapter of this book, you learned about the fivefold categorization of body language; emblems, illustrators, adaptors, affect displays and regulators. You know what purpose each of these body language serves and  common examples of each of them.
 
In the second chapter you were informed about the different fields and disciplines within the topic of body language. You now know that haptics is the study of touch in communication or that chronemics is the study of time in communication.
 
The third chapter taught you a wealth of ways in which you can use to improve your non-verbal communication. These include, but are not limited to; being mindful of your body language and the language of other people around you, managing stress and anxiety, interpreting persistent & groups of signals and looking for body language -verbal communication inconsistencies. 
 
The fourth chapter give you some insight in how to develop a great first impression, teaching you about factors such as appearance and the trustworthiness dimension. 
 
The fifth chapter provided you with awareness of how body language varies between regions and cultures. You now know to be slightly wary when using gestures and emblems in different parts of the world, as well as appreciating the universalness of expressions. 
 
Finally, the sixth chapter delved deep into individual aspects of body language such as head nodding, shaking, vulnerability, dominance and much more. You should understand why these body language signals are displayed, the small variances between similar types of body language and what to watch out for when you are communicating with others. 
 
By having finished this guide, you should now be ready to bring a new level of awareness and mindfulness into your interactions with other people. Learn from the other people around you and sharpen your sense of interpreting what people are thinking and feeling.
 
Once you are familiar and skilled at this art, manipulating and refining your own body language will naturally flow. Before you know it, you will be a master of communication and impressions, reading people around you at ease and sending all the right signals.
 
Deep down, this is what many of us want to achieve, in our work place or unfamiliar social settings as well as our relationships that are not quite where we want them to be. It's now down to you to put your knowledge to the test. Good luck!

Introduction
Welcome to this book, Psychology: Conquer the battles of your mind with powerful techniques to overcome stress, anxiety & negative thinking. 
 
Mental health is rapidly becoming an acceptable topic to talk about. Previously, mental health issues were largely swept under the rug by society, due to their inconvenient nature. It can be hard for anyone who hasn't suffered from a mental illness to empathize with someone who has, as mental illness tends to be subtle and obscure.
 
If someone breaks a bone, demonstrates a high fever, or has a wound to display, it is readily apparent for all too see that they ill or injured. Yet if someone is depressed or anxious, it is unfortunately all too easy to disregard these problems. 
 
However, the climate of mental health issues is gradually and inevitably changing. The fear and stigmatization over mental health and mental health problems is slowly subsiding as people realize that they are too important to be ignored. 
 
It is starting to be appreciated that looking after your mental health is just as critical (if not more so) than bodily health. A keen interest in your mind and your thought patterns is not just sensible, but pro-active and very wise. Every single person on this planet can improve their mental health to be happier and more productive. Whether you have a mental health illness or not, there are bound to be psychological techniques and methods you can use to make yourself content and more fulfilled. 
 
This book aims to help you deal with three aspects of mental health; stress, anxiety and negative thinking. Each of these three harmful states of mind can range in intensity from a mild annoyance to severe condition. Likewise all have the potential to cause and contribute to other mental health problems, such as depression. 
 
This book will give you a thorough insight into how each of these terms should be understood and what you can do to improve them. If you experience stress, anxiety or negative thinking or suspect that someone you know does, there is no need to suffer in silence. Use the knowledge compiled and offered in this book to help yourself and those around you. 
 
There are three chapters in this book;
Managing Stress
Overcoming Anxiety
Conquering Negative Thinking
I hope they can aid you in your quest for happiness and peace of mind. 










Managing Stress
Stress is the sensation of being overwhelmed by responsibilities or pressure. As a psychological concept, stress was first introduced in the 1950's, with the term originally taken from physics, where it described the amount of tension placed upon an object. 
 
The important part of the stress definition is feeling overwhelmed. Many people have huge levels of responsibility but nonetheless thrive in difficult or taxing situations. Stress is the distinct feeling of being pushed or pulled too thin and it doesn't directly correlate to the level of responsibility that you may have, although responsibility and pressure are often factors. 
 
Stress has a huge range of symptoms. It is known that it can increase blood pressure and heart rate, affect sleeping patterns, produce a loss of appetite, destroy concentration and contribute to a wide range of mental illnesses, such as depression. 
 
When a person feels a sensation of stress, the body's hormonal system kicks into action. The nervous system releases a cocktail of hormones, most notably cortisol, which collectively trigger the 'flight or fight' response. 
 
To simplify, the flight or fight response is an evolution adaptation that prepares the body to either combat a threat ('fight') or run away ('flight'). Ultimately this causes the heart rate to increase, the breath to become faster as well as a redirection of blood flow towards the muscles. More severe effects include shaking, loss of peripheral vision and the constriction of blood vessels. All of these responses are intended to prime the body for dealing with threats or challenges. 
 
Whilst the fight or flight system is a fantastic adaptation that helped our ancestors cope with a harsh and dangerous world, it causes us a range of problems in modern society. 
 
The vast majority of us are not going to need to fight to the death or run away from an apex predator when we experience a stressor. Rather our challenges are commonplace but chronic; a lack of money, workplace issues, interpersonal relationship strains, other desires and aspirations, etc. 
 
The issue is that our flight and fight response can trigger in reaction to these mundane, but non-life threatening issues. If this response triggers too frequently, a high amount of flight & fight hormones are released, especially cortisol, into the body, producing the psychological sensation of stress.  
 
Once you begin to understand that stress is a response, the methods in which stress can be tackled start to become clear - recognize what is causing the stress response and manage that.
 
Anything that causes a stress response is called a stressor. The crucial part of stressors is that they can be divided into physiological stressors and psychological stressors. 
 
Physiological stressors are events that directly put pressure upon the body, such as injury or extreme environmental temperatures. 
 
Psychological stressors, however, are any events that are perceived as threatening or challenging. Depending upon the individual, this may include genuinely dangerous events (such as being mugged or attacked) to events that are actually harmless (such as an offhand comment interpreted negatively). 
 
Therefore to manage stress, you need to analyze both your proximity to stressors and your perception of them. It may be the case that you have too many stressors within your life, in which case you need to cut back on events that are causing you stress. 
 
However, it may be that you are interpreting too many manageable events as stressors, in which case you need to alter the ways you are perceiving these events.  
 
Additionally, stress can also be managed by adopting a healthier lifestyle, which can manage the physiological causes and symptoms of stress. Let us walk through each of these solutions to stress in turn.
 









Recognizing Stress
Regardless of whether your stress problem arises from the fact that you are experiencing too many stressors or that your perception of them is too negative, the first step is recognizing what stressors you have.
 
One of the best ways to achieve this is to keep a daily journal of each time during the day that you have felt under considerable stress. It is best if you keep this journal as detailed as possible, detailing not just the date, but also the exact time you were feeling stressed, the intensity of the stress sensation and relevant details such as the people you were with or what activities you were doing. 
 
If you manage to keep a journal persistently you will likely realize certain patterns of stress. It may be the case that interactions with a particular person you are finding especially stressful, for example. 
 
In addition to keeping a journal, engaging in mindfulness is a potent stress-reduction technique. Mindfulness is increasingly sought as an antidote to the sensation of stress itself, but it is also useful for increasing your recognition of stressors. The more mindful you are of your day-to-day life, the higher chance you intimately realize the circumstances where you feel stressed (and therefore have a better chance at interpreting/managing these circumstances). 
 
Mindfulness as a topic will be covered under the negative thinking chapter later in this book. Nonetheless be aware that the instructions and advice regarding mindfulness in that chapter can also be applied for stress reduction. 
 
On a similar vein, it is important to understand what habits you have that may be coping mechanisms for the stress you are experiencing. Not all coping mechanisms are classified as unhealthy, but many are. Common coping methods include smoking, drinking, drug usage or anger venting. Ensure that you don't trade one evil - stress - for another. Learn to recognize your reactions to situations to analyze whether your unhealthy tendencies are indeed a reaction to your stress. 
 









Changing Stressor Perception - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy (or CBT for short) is one of the predominant therapies for dealing with a myriad of cognitive problems and mental health issues, including stress, anxiety and negative thinking. Therefore when you read those later chapters, bear this section on CBT in mind. 
 
CBT is based upon the cognitive approach in psychology. To simplify, the cognitive approach is a framework that claims that thoughts ("cognitions") drive behavior. Therefore if you want to change your behavior, you must look at the underlying thought patterns that drive that behavior and change those. Hence, cognitive-behavioral therapy as the name for the application of this theory. 
 
CBT is usually done with a trained therapist who helps you systematically and logically identify your thought patterns and transform them into more productive and successful alternatives. 
 
Nonetheless, there are many resources and guides detailing the method and techniques CBT uses, which you can employ by yourself. Try reading an introductory book on the topic of CBT to see if you can change your perception of stressors, especially those which you cannot avoid or otherwise manage. 
 









Healthier Lifestyle
It is easy to think of a 'healthy' lifestyle as purely a physical term, but it includes our habits that may produce positive or negative states of mind. There are a myriad of ways you can improve your lifestyle, which can indirectly lower the feelings of stress you may be experiencing. 
 
The first and most common lifestyle habit is to exercise regularly. Exercise is defined as any type of activity that is exerting enough to produce an increase in heart rate and produce sweating. Therefore exercise isn't just limited to the gym or sports center but also ordinary activities, such as walking or housework, as long as these activities are of an appropriate intensity.  It is recommended by most health authorities to exercise for at least 150 minutes every week, yet most of us receive notably less levels of exercise than this.
 
Exercise releases endorphins, which are your body's pleasure chemicals. The positive sensation can psychologically counteract the negative sensation of stress, but the benefits of exercise on stress relief may be more subtle. Exercise improves cognitive function, makes it easier to sleep and increases alertness and mindfulness. It is likely that each of these factors also contribute to the decreased levels of stress frequent exercisers experience. 
 









Time Management Techniques
Another lifestyle technique is to manage your time more effectively. As stress is the result of feelings overburdened and overwhelmed by responsibilities and pressures, learning how to better organize your time can help you achieve more and thus reduce the level of pressure you experience. 
 
The initial step in learning how to improve your time management is to decide upon the goals with which you want to achieve. Start by making a list of advancements which you want to achieve - interpersonal goals, career goals, weight loss, a healthier lifestyle, hobby practice and so on. Prioritize each of these goals depending on how important they are to you. 
 
You may realize that you have been feeling stressed, or devoting a disproportionate amount of time towards goals that are, in fact, not as important to you as you originally perceived. If you have several goals, consider whether it would be best to short-list your goals and tackle the goals you consider most pertinent first. 
 
In addition to goal setting, list making is another common time management technique. All this involves is simply writing down a to-do list of all your current responsibilities. Poor time management is often the result of failing to organize, due to either forgetting about the existence of responsibilities or not prioritizing the most pressing responsibilities. Writing a list is often all that is needed to prevent either of these mishaps from occurring.
 
One prioritizing technique is to divide all your tasks into the four following types:
1) Urgent & Important
2) Not urgent but important
3) Urgent, but not important
3) Neither urgent or important
 
Naturally, once categorized as such, it becomes clear to focus on achieving urgent & important tasks first, than tasks that are either urgent or important, but not both simultaneously. Tasks that are neither urgent nor important can be left to last. 
 









Social Connections
In addition to proper time management, another stress reduction is social support and connection. Humans are social animals and as a general law, we are most successful and happiest when we feel connected and appreciated by those who are around us.
 
Often stress can make us feel like we should isolate ourselves from others; instead it is often wisest to counteract this urge and spend more time with people. Try to organize or capitalize on situations where you can spend time with close friends or family and tell them about what is making you feel stressed. 
 









Helping Others
Another stress reduction technique involves helping other people through charity, community work or even simple good-deeds to the people around you. People who regularly engage in helping behaviors tend to be happier as well as more resilient to stress. This is due to the fact that helping other people not only makes ourselves feel better, but it also makes us aware of the serious and taxing problems other people face. Whilst this isn't a cause for happiness in itself, it tends to make personal problems feel more tame and manageable. 
 
Likewise, setting some time aside for yourself is another way to reduce stress. It is easy to become obsessed with goal-setting and achievement, pushing ourselves to go further and do more, forgetting the fact that we all need a little 'me time' occasionally. 
 
The problem, as in most things, is achieving the correct balance. Part of the solution to allocating enough downtime is to use the time management techniques before mentioned. Similarly, another popular technique is deciding upon one or two days per week, which after work, are purely relaxation and enjoyment days. The power of strictly deciding one or two days per week where you allow yourself to relax is that you can enjoy that relaxation guilt-free. 
 
Conversely, many people who try to mix in relaxation time between the times allocated for goal-setting and achievement struggle to enjoy the former, without feeling that they should be doing something productive. Rest and relaxation is productive - in moderation! 










Overcoming Anxiety
Anxiety is a feeling of worry, trepidation or fear which ranges in intensity, from merely uncomfortable to emotionally crippling. Anxiety is a normal human emotion in response to events where the outcome is important, but unknown. However, many people suffer from the feeling of anxiety in response to everyday events that others would not consider anxiety-inducing, leading to disproportionate levels of anxiety. 
 
Anxiety is a symptom and cause of numerous other mental health problems, such as panic attacks, phobias and social anxiety. However, anxiety can be recognized as a condition on its own, which is termed generalized anxiety disorder. This chapter deals with recognizing the signs and symptoms of anxiety and managing them. 
 
The distinction between generalized anxiety disorder and regular anxiety is characterized by the rational basis of the anxiety felt, it's frequency as well as its impact on the everyday functioning of the person involved. For example, it is considered normal to feel anxious when sitting an important exam for college or waiting in a hospital for the results of an important medical exam.
 
However, feeling anxious about leaving the house or going to work are, in the majority of cases, unfounded and irrational anxiety responses. Furthermore, feeling anxious whenever you leave the house or go to work will impact the regular day-to-day activities of the individual with anxiety, therefore making a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder more appropriate.
 
Regardless of whether anxiety is experienced as a sensation or as a mental health problem, it can be tackled and reduced through various methods. 
 









Healthy Lifestyle
The first of these methods is to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Although there may be other factors involved, the physiological experience of anxiety may be triggered or influenced by a variety of physical and emotional factors related to how you live. 
 
Poor sleep hygiene and sleep deprivation can lead to a greater frequency of negative thoughts, which can develop into anxiety or worsen the condition. Various stimulants such as nicotine, sugar, alcohol and caffeine can also induce bodily stress and exertion, which too can make an individual more susceptible to anxiety and panic attacks. 
 
Similarly, the endorphins released during exercise can combat feelings of anxiety and reduce the physiological contributors. 
 









Breathing Techniques
During episodes of anxiety, or panic attacks, the breath can start to become shallow and fast. This is because in a similar manner to our stress response, anxiety can trigger our body's fight or flight response. In fact, panic attacks (commonly associated with anxiety) are interpreted as a strong fight or flight response unconsciously triggered, without an appropriate stimulus. 
 
What distinguishes a panic attack from a regular fight or flight response is that the person who experiences the response starts to panic, focusing their attention upon the bodily sensations, tensing the body and releasing adrenaline which intensifies the symptoms. 
 
Nonetheless, one of the fight or flight responses is to prepare the lungs for more activity - hence rapid, but shallow breaths. Owing to this, it is important to learn breathing techniques that allow yourself to breathe deeply and calmly, to counteract this effect. Furthermore, deep breathing techniques are a fantastic relaxation method, which can give you a calmer mind, helping you tackle your anxieties more directly. 
 
To practice deep breathing, find time during your day where you know you will not be interrupted. Ensure that you are wearing loose clothing so that your breathing rhythms will not be obstructed. Finally, also try to make the area as quiet as possible. This involves selecting a calm period of the day (such as early morning or late evening) where the sounds of the day have passed, but also reducing ambient noise by turning off electrical devices. 
 
Rest in a comfortable position. This may involve lying flat in a bed (or on the floor), sitting in a firm but comfortable chair or sitting cross legged. It is important that you are comfortable, but it is also necessary that you stay awake. If you suspect you might drift off, than it is best to sit in a chair as opposed to lying down. 
 
With this preparation finalized, you can now start to focus upon the breathing. The key to deep breathing is to breathe from the diaphragm (lower stomach) rather than the chest. When you are breathing deeply, you should be able to rest your hand on your navel and feel that area expand and contract as you inhale and exhale. 
 
Start by breathing in, slowly, through your nose, to your lungs maximum capacity - inhale, until you cannot breathe in any further. 
 
Then, gently, exhale, through your mouth, releasing all air until your lungs are empty. 
 
It is best if you breathe in and outwards in conjunction with a number count. As you breathe in, count 1...2...3 than count 1...2...3 as you exhale. 
 
Continue breathing until you start to feel relaxed. If you struggle from anxiety (or if you struggle to relax) you should practice this breathing technique daily, for at least five minutes.
 
Do not panic or worry if feelings of calmness and relaxation do not immediately arise. For people who are feeling stressed or anxious, the breath may 'catch' or struggle to flow gently. However, if you continue with focused, controlled breathing this tendency will gradually dissipate and the breathing should become pleasant. 
 
This manner of controlled relaxed breathing can also be used in situation where you are feeling anxious. Although it is unlikely that you can sit down and turn off all surrounding distractions, you can still take opportunistic 3-5 minute periods during your day to breathe and calm yourself. 
 









Muscle Relaxation Technique
A similar technique to the breathing technique, is the muscle relaxation technique which  is designed to help you relax. As you practice the technique over the course of days, weeks and months the prolonged relaxation you experience gradually helps you combat anxiety. 
 
The muscle relaxation technique takes longer than the breathing technique; you will need at least 15-20 minutes of solitude and quiet to practice. As with the breathing technique, make sure you have reduced any ambient noise so you can concentrate fully. 
 
Start by sitting or lying down comfortably and practicing a few moments of deep breathing to rouse your attention. Next, direct your attention towards your left foot. Stretch your foot by contracting and relaxing its muscles. Hold the muscle contraction for 3-5 seconds before release. Keep your awareness on the sensations that arise. Then relax the muscles in your foot and focus on the sensation for a small moment.
 
Move upwards onto your left calf and stretch and relax this muscle too. Continue working upwards to the thigh, abdomen, shoulder, neck and facial muscles, contracting and relaxing each of these muscles in turn.
 
When you have reached the crown of the head, work your way down the right side of your body, progressively contracting and releasing the muscles in your face all the way down to your right foot. Ensure that your attention remains focused on each muscle as it contracts and relaxes. 
 
After you have finished the progressive muscle relaxation, spend a few moments lying or sitting with your eyes closed, experiencing any sensations that arise within your body. Once you feel like it is appropriate to do so, gently rise and finish. 
 
It is important to note that it may require several periods of muscle relaxation before the sensation of deep relaxation arises. Therefore it is important to try and practice this technique at least 2-3 times a week (preferably every day). 
 









Redirecting Attention
Another anxiety reduction technique is to redirect your attention away from anxious thoughts. This sounds intuitive, but it is generally considered that anxiety suffers experience their symptoms partially due to an inability to redirect attention away from the anxiety/negative thinking patterns and towards other stimuli.
 
When you next feel anxiety, instead of focusing upon your thoughts and feelings as the anxiety occurs, try to focus on a stimulus in your surroundings. This could be potentially anything, although positively-associated stimuli are more successful. Try to direct more of your attention towards your work, or even a particularly strong, capturing image or sound (such as flower or music). 
 
Similarly, it is important not to over-analyze or interpret your anxiety too deeply. Many anxiety sufferers struggle from the fact that they interpret their anxiety as indicative of the situation at hand. To clarify with an example, if someone feels anxious about their performance at work or school, they may interpret that anxiety as a signal that they are failing or unable to cope with the situation. If they dwell on this interpretation of their anxiety, these people often become paralyzed or experience greater difficulty when encountering these situations in the future. 
 









Anxiety 'Period'
To people with generalized anxiety disorder, or chronic anxiety suffers in general, it can be hard to cope with the dissonance between what they feel and how much other people tell them to relax and redirect their focus. 
 
To solve this issue and provide a compromise between the need to worry and process anxiety and the need to function some anxiety sufferers have adopted the anxiety 'period'.
 
This period is a designated time during the day or week (depending on how often a sufferer feels they need it) where you allow yourself to be anxious. For one or two hours you simply allow your worries and fears to be present, without trying to push them away. During this time you consider and reflect upon your anxieties in whatever way you feel appropriate. The strength of the 'anxiety period' is that it allows you to be anxious without feeling any guilt or need to improve yourself. 
 
The anxiety period only works, however, if you postpone and delay all your anxious thoughts and feelings during the day. If an anxious thought occurs during the day, you must tell yourself that you will ponder and reflect on the thought during your anxiety period and then continue with whatever you were doing. 
 
It can be beneficial to write down your worries, as they occur, in a list. This way you can ensure you process and tackle all the anxieties that have manifested themselves during the day. 
 
Creating an anxiety period helps you deal with your life, moment-by-moment, without constantly being distracted by anxieties during the day.
 
Furthermore, by deliberating creating a space and time to ponder your anxieties, you can often approach them in a calmer, more systematic way than during the moment when they occur. Finally by developing the discipline and skill to postpone your anxieties to a later date, it also helps you discover that you actually have more control over your thoughts and feelings than you might at first have anticipated. 
 









Worst Result Contemplation
Anxiety often arise due to the fear or expectation that a negative outcome to an event or circumstance will arise. For example if you are anxious because you have to give a presentation, you are likely anxious because you are afraid you might stutter or embarrass yourself during the presentation (or some other mishap). 
 
Perhaps counter-intuitively some anxiety suffers can manage their anxiety by contemplating the worst possible outcome to the event or circumstance they may be anxious about. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the level of anxiety felt is disproportionate to the actual worse possible outcome that could occur. For example in the presentation scenario, even if you do embarrass yourself, this is hardly something to be genuinely concerned about. 
 
Most people in the audience will likely sympathize, having been or felt the same from their own experiences. Similarly, most people will forget or not be paying enough attention to the presentation for any embarrassment you feel to even be memorable. 
 
Even if the presentation affects your grades or workplace, you will likely have other opportunities and ways to achieve success, show competence and compensate for a poor presentation.
 
Ultimately, by following your anxiety to the worst feasible situation that can occur, you can actually calm yourself. By realizing that the worst possible situation is in fact, rather tame, you can approach whatever problem you are facing with a renewed vigor.
 









Exposure
Anxiety tends to promote avoidance behaviors. If we are anxious about something, it is typical to try and avoid the situation or event that causes this anxiety, unless we have to. For people who experience anxiety relatively infrequently, or people whose circumstances force themselves to tackle their anxieties, this doesn't necessarily pose a problem. 
 
However, for chronic anxiety suffers, you simply cannot flourish in life if you avoid and back down all circumstances and events that make you feel anxious. Rather, you need to slowly expose yourself to these situations and events to learn how to gradually deal with them.
 
There is no need to plunge yourself in the deep end however. If you have several anxieties, make a list of your anxieties and all the actions and events relating to them. Order the actions and events from what makes you feel least anxious to what makes you feel most anxious. 
 
By doing this, you have provided a repertoire of activities to perform, to acclimatize yourself to anxiety. Start by attempting or doing the activities that make you least anxious (which you are not currently doing). 
 
See if you can do 2-3 of these activities per week. Then, upon successful completion of these activities, you can work your way upon to the activities that make you feel more anxious. Week-by-week, one step at a time, you can climb all the way up to the activities that cause you to feel the most anxious. Over the course of completing these activities, you will grow in confidence and eventually come to terms with the anxieties you feel, causing them to tangibly dissolve. 
 
Even if your anxiety stems around just one particular action or event, see if you can gradually acclimatize yourself to this anxiety. Using the before mentioned example, perhaps you are aware that you are afraid of public speaking. Joining a public speaking group and taking it upon yourself to slowly find opportunities to speak publicly is one the best ways to directly tackle this fear, on your own terms. 
 









Accept Imperfection
Anxiety often arises due to unrealistic expectations that a person may hold themselves to. An anxious person often feels the need to not just succeed, but have an outstanding success. Similarly, any flaw or mishap is interpreted a severe failure.
 
Conversely, confident and successful people accommodate flaws and mistakes in their lives. Using the on-going pubic speaking example, the best public speakers know how to turn mistakes they make during their speech or presentation into assets, often by improvising around these mistakes or using them as an opportunity to introduce humor. 
 
Likewise, good orators don't allow these mistakes to get in the way of their overall presentation or message - they anticipate they may occur, and accept them when they do. No-one is perfect, so allow yourself your own mistakes and mishaps. If you endorse a realistic standard, you will not get hung up over mistakes that will inevitably happen in your life.










Conquering Negative Thinking
Negative thinking is an umbrella term for an array of cognitive behaviors that can be interpreted as non-beneficial. Negative thinking is often colloquially interpreted as thoughts that are negative, such as focusing upon failures, short-comings or negative emotions. 
 
However the term can also include other types of thinking, such as intrusive thoughts (thoughts that occur without the desire to do so). Negative thinking is occasionally associated with the term 'cognitive distortions' which describes thinking patterns that inaccurately reflect reality (typically with a negative implication). 
 
This chapter will deal with types of negative thinking and solutions to manage them.
 









Recognizing Negative Thinking
The essence of negative thinking management is recognizing when negative thoughts are occurring and then counter-balancing negative thoughts with more realistic or positive thinking habits.
 
The problem with this solution is that people who have a negative thinking tendencies tend to be ignorant about their own thinking patterns. They may realize that they think negatively, but be unaware of how this negative thinking actually manifests (beyond a generalized pessimism). Even more extreme, many negative thinkers fail to recognize that they are in fact guilty of negative thinking to begin with. These individuals tend to interpret their negative thoughts as being accurate and may either think that their thought patterns are the same as everyone else's, or that everyone else is seeing the world through rose-colored glasses. 
 
Therefore, the following section will cover several types of cognitive distortions, with a focus on how these cognitive distortions interplay with negative thinking habits. The result of this exploration should allow you to recognize these patterns of negative thinking, should they occur in yourself or someone you know. 
 









All or Nothing Thinking
This is a tendency to think of things in absolutes. Situations or events must be entirely positive or entirely negative; there are no ambiguous or mixed cases. However, rarely in life are circumstances so dichotomous. 
 
As most situations or events have positive and negative aspects, all or nothing thinking tends to produce a disproportionate amount of events/situations that are interpreted as negative. 
 
All or nothing thinking therefore often worsens negative thinking patterns and may be a factor in developing depression. 
 
To overcome all or nothing thinking, consider your evaluations of the world around you with more nuance. For example if you commonly have thoughts such as 'I fail at everything I do' or 'everything around me is bad' then you may be guilty of all or nothing thinking. No-one fails at everything they do and nor do people experience situations where all things are bad. 
 
It is important to counterbalance all or nothing thoughts with a more realistic interpretation. For example, in the previous two circumstances, a more balanced thought pattern would involve reinforcing and remembering events where you succeed or the enjoyable aspects of life. 
 









Over-generalization
This negative thinking pattern is the tendency to develop a generalization from limited, and often faulty, evidence. A person who overgeneralizes might think a person is a bad person based on one meeting, or that they may never enjoy a new experience if the first time they try it, they don't enjoy it. 
Above and beyond the logical fallacy that over-generalization often entails, it also typically results in a greater level of negative interpretation, especially for people who are susceptible to anxiety or depression. 
 









Labeling
This tendency is similar to over-generalization. Labeling is the habit of applying labels to people, rather than interpreting events or actions as temporary or external. For example, if someone is not particularly talkative, a 'labeler' may interpret that person as boring or introverted rather than interpreting that they are not feeling well or that they are tired.
 
Labeling arises from interpreting evidence as permanent and external rather than temporary and external. Using the before mentioned example, being tired or not feeling well are both temporary, external factors. They are not related to the personality or character of the person in question ('external'), but rather a transient factor moderating their behavior ('temporary').
 
Labeling interacts with negative thinking, because negative thinkers often label themselves in negative ways. A negative thinker who fails a test may interpret themselves as stupid, rather than realizing that they were distracted during the test or that they didn't study enough.
 
The result is that problems or events that should be seen as changeable or small seem to be damming about their character. If you don't study hard enough for a test, for example, this can be improved by studying harder or more efficiently in the future. If you interpret yourself as stupid or dull however, this implies a problem that cannot necessarily be solved (hence leading to more negative states of mind and negative thinking patterns). 
 
Therefore whenever you label yourself or others in future, negative thinker or not, consider the temporary-permanent and internal-external dimensions of labeling. When consciously considered, it is likely you will see that many behaviors and attributes you perceive are in fact temporary and external, rather than permanent and internal.  
 









Filtering
Filtering is the term applied to thinking patterns where a person focuses purely on the negative aspects of the situation. People who filter their thoughts might focus excessively on the one negative aspect of an otherwise pleasant experience and always extinguish positive thoughts with a greater, negative thought. For example, a person who filters might dwell on the fact that they made a bad first impression with someone they hadn't met before, ignoring the fact that the rest of their day was fantastic. 
 









Emotional Reasoning
This thought pattern is the tendency to believe that negative emotions felt reflect the reality of a situation. For example if someone feels as if they are stupid in a situation, they will believe that other people will interpret them as stupid, regardless of their actual displays of intelligence and competence.
 









Mind Reading
This thought pattern refers to the tendency to presume that you know or understand what another person is thinking. In terms of negative thinking, this usually entails the presumption that other people are holding a negative perception of you or your actions. 
 
Often, this perception is faulty. People who are 'mind readers' have a habit of picking up on minor or ambiguous body cues and believing that these cues are relevant to them. So for example, a person with mind reading thought habits might perceive a yawn as a sign of disinterest in their topic of conversion (therefore reducing their self-confidence) when it is actually just an indicator that the other person is sleep deprived. 
 









Magnification/Minimization
Magnification and minimization is the thought habit of exaggerating negative thoughts and under emphasizing negative thoughts respectively. When a person magnifies, they may perceive a trivial problem or occurrence as a full blown tragedy and when they minimize they may discredit or ignore their own success or achievements. 
 
Depressed people have a tendency of showing an inverse pattern in regards to other people. To clarify, depressed people often magnify the success of other people and minimize their failures. The result is a comparatively skewed perception of themselves against other people, which likely both a cause and symptom of depression. 
 









Personalization
Personalization is the tendency to take blame and guilt for a circumstance or an event that is beyond control. For example if a conversation runs dry, as conversations occasionally do, a negative thinker might attribute this to themselves. This person might think that they are boring or have no social skills due to the conversation ending.
 
Similarly, if an accident happens at home and a family member injures themselves, a negative thinker who personalizes event might believe that the accident is their fault and that they could have prevented it, had they been there. 
 









Blaming 
Conversely, instead of taking the responsibility upon themselves, you might have a tendency to blame others for negative circumstances. Blaming others can generate ill-will towards the people around you, but it can also induce a sense of helplessness and lack of control. If someone else is the cause of negative things or feelings that happen to you, than your ability to manage these feelings or events is limited. However, accepting appropriate blame or responsibility empowers yourself to make a positive change, when appropriate.
 
Blaming is often attributed to how a person feels. To clarify, you might blame someone for the fact that you are angry or sad, rather than blaming someone for breaking a glass or such. Blaming often is associated with thinking that the emotional state you feel is either deliberately and intentionally caused by the people around you, or caused by some degree of negligence. You might interpret that others have a responsibility to ensure you feel a certain way, and that your negative emotional state is due to a lack of required attention.
 
Realize that interpersonal relationships are complicated. Many slights and mishaps between people are purely unintentional. Furthermore, as a person you need to accept a large degree of ownership of your own emotions. Others can influence how you feel, but ultimately, only you can actually control your response to an event. 
 









Mindfulness & Meditation 
Now that you are aware of some of the negative thinking patterns you might be displaying, the next step in combating these patterns is being mindful. Life is taxing and distracting and many of us fall into the trap of acting and thinking on 'autopilot'. 
 
We fail to consciously consider and interpret our actions or thoughts, which can lead to a variety of problems. In the case of negative thinkers, a lack of mindfulness means that their negative thoughts go unchallenged and therefore persist. Increasing your mindfulness allows you to apply the knowledge in the previous subsections when you recognize your thought patterns are negative. 
 
One popular method to increase mindfulness is mindfulness meditation. Although there are several potential objects of this meditation, the most commonly used is the breath. Unlike the deep breathing technique mentioned earlier, a breathing meditation relies on observing the breath, rather than controlling it. 
 
To start a breathing meditation, ensure that you have at least 15 minutes of time where you know you will not be interrupted. Likewise, reduce and eliminate ambient noise by turning off electrical devices and removing objects that produce noise. 
 
For meditation it is best if you either sit in a chair or sit in a half lotus position (a type of cross-legged position where one foot rests on the opposite thigh and the other foot rests on the floor). Lying down tends to promote a certain degree of sleepiness, counteracting the very purpose of mindfulness meditation.  
 
With all the preparations established, start to focus upon the breath. As before mentioned, you do not want to exhibit deliberate control of the breathing, rather you should attempt to focus upon the natural and unaided breathing pattern. 
 
If you become distracted by thoughts (which you almost certainly will) bring your attention back to your natural breathing pattern. When you first start to meditate, it is likely that you will realize just how busy and distracted your mind actually is; many people find that they can barely focus upon the breath at all before they become distracted by a thought that pops into their head.
 
This is normal. Do not be discouraged or disheartened if this happens to you. Rather, gently and calmly bring your attention back towards the breath. It is important to be non-judgmental and display equanimity; do not chide yourself or be angry with yourself when your mind wanders. Instead, just focus once more, without any kind of mental commentary. Over time, you will be able to focus upon the breath with a deeper focus and experience fewer interruptions from wayward thoughts. Congratulations - your mindfulness is developing! 
 
As a beginner to mindfulness meditation, there is no need to practice for more than 15 minutes a day. For most novices, anything more than this can feel rather overwhelming and it can be uncomfortable to sit for longer periods of time. 
 
However, as you continue to meditate, you may wish to gradually extend your meditation sessions. It is not unheard of for advanced meditation practitioners to meditate for hours at a time, but the majority of people find that a period of 30-45 minutes produces a noticeable change in mindfulness (as well as a greater amount of inner peace, relaxation and other mental benefits). 
 
When persistently practiced mindfulness meditation should help you be more alert and more aware during your day-to-day life. This in turn should help you recognize your current thought patterns, allowing you to shy away from negative thought patterns altogether. 
 
Mindfulness can also be cultivated by trying to be mindful during everyday tasks. It is easy to go into an autopilot mode during repetitive or dull activities we do every day - such as our work, cleaning, cooking, eating, walking, etc. 
 
Instead of allowing your mind to wander during these activities, try to engage with them on a more intimate level. Feel all the physical sensations of your muscles as you wash and clean and perform that activity to the best of your ability - focusing on all the grime and dirt you intend to remove. When you walk somewhere, be aware of the pace and feel of the walk as well as the sounds, scents and feelings of the world around you. 
 
This greater level of mindfulness has two benefits. Firstly, being mindful of everyday action gives your mind less space and opportunity to drift into negative thinking territories. Instead of dwelling on yesterday's problems or tomorrow's you simply focus on what is happening at this very moment in time. 
 
Likewise, being present in the current moment may have uplifting qualities of its own accord. Mindfulness is increasingly being sought as a method for eliminating depression and its positive effects are well documented. 










Conclusion
Mental health isn't something you should ignore. If you are feeling stressed, anxious or you are aware that your negative thought patterns are detrimental to your life, you need to take action. For most of us, it only takes a small amount of knowledge and discipline to apply a few techniques that can drastically improve our state of mind.
 
This book has provided you with an assortment of those techniques. In the first chapter you learned about stress and its definition as the sensation of being overwhelmed by pressure and responsibilities. You were taught about the fight or flight response and stressors, both physiological and psychological. Lastly you learned techniques to limit your exposure to stressors and change your perception of them.
 
In the second chapter, you were given a run-down of anxiety from a psychological perspective. You were told about the importance of a healthy lifestyle and given tutelage in various relaxation and anxiety management techniques, such as deep breathing and the anxiety period. 
 
Finally, in the third chapter you tackle negative thinking. You learned how negative thinking arises from cognitive distortions and the various types of these distortions, such as 'all or nothing thinking' and labeling. Finally, you were taught how to cultivate mindfulness and recognize patterns of negative thinking, in order to change them.

Welcome
Welcome to this eBook, Survival: A Beginners Prepping Guide to Survive a Disaster in the Wilderness. This guide aims to teach you the basic survival skills you would need to survive in the wilderness should a disaster occur. It also gives an overview into the world of being a prepper, such as learning the mindset should endorse the learning a little about the classification of disasters.  I hope you enjoy reading this eBook and finish it having gained valuable knowledge that may one day save your life. 










Introduction
Our continued survival is often taken for granted. When disaster strikes we are forced to take responsibility for our own survival - to find our own resources and keep ourselves alive. It would be a safe wager to bet that most individuals do not prepare for the worst, or teach themselves to deal with the adversity posed by potential hazards.
 
In most aspects and areas of our lives, it is considered sensible and adult to plan ahead. People carefully construct five-year financial plans. Couples consider when they would like to have children and save money towards their pensions. Even as a child and a teenager you must think about what subjects you might want to learn and what career you might want to pursue. Yet the most vital and basic of all future preparations - the skills and items that would ensure our survival if a disaster were to strike, are left woefully neglected by almost everybody. A prepper, however, doesn't think like the rest of the populace - they know that it is wise to learn these skills that other people won't either consider. It is not about surviving a zombie apocalypse, or creating a secret bunker, but recognizing the importance and fragility of your own life. We all want to survive disasters, but only a prepper takes the necessary steps to do so. 
 
By reading this eBook you take the first step from being helpless in a disaster to helpful. This eBook takes you into the world of the prepper, with a specific focus on how to survive in the wilderness. 
 
In the first chapter of this eBook, learn the basic psychology of survival, the mindsets and attitudes you need to develop if you were to even think about surviving the wild. In the second chapter, become acquainted with the various hazards that you may face and how they are classified. In the following chapter, be trained to prepare your very own survival kit, containing the best items to ensure your survival in any situation. Finally in the fifth chapter get to grips with your basic survival skills by learning how to live in the wilderness. Discover how to find water, how to forage for food, how to build a shelter, how to kindle a fire, how to navigate using natural signs and how to treat injuries and wounds.










Chapter 1 - Psychology of Survival
Staying Calm & Focused
All of us have seen people turn manageable problems into full overblown disasters by lacking the calm and clarity to deal with an issue gracefully. On occasion, everyone one of us has probably had a moment where we 'snapped', losing our cool and acting in ways that we regret. 
 
Whilst these incidents are looked down upon by our peers, in most circumstances, apart from wasting our time and irritating the people around us, these minor tantrums do us little long-term harm. 
 
However in a disaster situation where you are pressed to the very brink of survival, keeping your mind steady and focused is paramount to getting out of trouble alive. You simply can't lose your cool - you won't survive. There are no safety nets. 
 
Therefore to master survival skills, you need to master yourself. Instead of taking the attitude that your emotions are wild, uncontrollable phenomena that cause you to act in irrational ways you need to discipline yourself to effectively manage your emotions.
 
 This isn't the same as denying your feelings - when you are stressed, you are stressed. When you are angry, you are angry. Nonetheless, you can train yourself to act efficiently during anger or other unhelpful emotions and reach levels of inner focus that penetrate beyond your surface emotions. 
 
Ultimately, the first step to mastering your emotions is to embrace the perspective that maintaining a healthy state of mind is a skill you practice rather than the result of external factors. If you concede that external factors determine your state of mind than when the going gets rough, you will never succeed.
 
You might as well give up now - you don't have the grit to go on further. If you think that you are not a victim to your own emotions than you can start to practice emotional control. Recognize when you are feeling an unhelpful emotion and learn to soothe yourself by cultivating positive emotions and constructive habits to counteract that emotion. If you practice this skill at every opportunity in which emotional discontent arises, eventually you will learn to deal with your emotions skillfully. 
 
In addition to developing emotional calm, a prepper needs to overcome their inherent biases that 'everything will be alright', often called a normalcy bias. Life in modern western society is, for most western people, rather comfortable. Although some of us are unfortunate and suffer from personal tragedies and physical accidents, most pass through the majority of our lives, at least as of yet, with few genuinely life-threatening hazards thrown our way. 
 
The fact that we have reached this current period of time relatively unscathed often makes us ignorant and ill-prepared for the future. People become complacent and arrogant, assuming that because few ill-fortunes have occurred in the past, few or none will occur in the future. If we do face life threatening challenges, most people fail because they never took the time in their comfortable lives to learn how to deal with difficult situations. They do not take an interest in their own fitness, which is essential to any survival situation. They do not learn to manage natural and industrial disasters, even if they are living in geographically susceptible areas. 
 
A prepper however, is different. A prepper looks to the future with an unbiased eye and recognizes the possibility of misfortune. A prepper stockpiles and trains to whatever degree necessary to ensure they can survive when disaster strikes - all because they have the gift of foresight. Never assume everything is going to be alright. Prepare! 
 









Self-Sufficiency
Another key aspect of the prepare mindset is self-sufficiency. In everyday life, it is not always inherently bad to learn to ask for help and co-operate with your peers - it entirely depends on the situation and the people involved. 
 
However, in a disaster situation the normal flow of life becomes extremely distorted. The people you are used to relying on - spouses, siblings, friends, parents, authorities and emergency services might all be distanced from you or endangered themselves.
 
If you are alone in the wilderness, there is no guarantee that you will be able to contact anyone to help you. No police officer to protect you or no doctor to treat your wounds. You have to learn, whenever possible, to deal with your problems yourself. This doesn't mean, however, that you must become an island onto yourself.
 
Instead take the perspective that in everyday life, you try to fix your problems by yourself first. Stop relying on other people just because you are too lazy to find out the solution or because it is merely convenient. If you need help, get help. If you can feasibly and reasonably deal with a problem yourself, deal with that problem yourself, period. 
 
With that being said, a prepper also needs to develop strong interpersonal skills and a willingness to help other people. Following a disaster situation, the ideal scenario would be for the eventual re-establishment of society. If a disaster situation has occurred and you are in a position to help, do so. Don't endanger yourself, but nor be cold and unhelpful. 
 
Furthermore, take an active interest in prepper societies and organization. If genuine widespread disaster occurs, and if the government cannot provide assistance to its citizens, then these societies that have stockpiled resources, that have trained themselves to cope with hazards and maintained technologies that allow for disaster-survival will be one of the cornerstones of re-establishing society. So take an interest. 










Chapter 2- Types of Disasters
Five Classifications of Disasters
The majority of people probably list a few of the most Hollywood popularized hazards such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Yet fewer people are actually aware of the full-range of potential disaster situations. In this chapter become familiar with all the disaster situations you may need to prepare for, their characteristics and how disasters are classified by type. You may wish to research what hazards your country and region may be susceptible to. 
 
EM-DAT, the international disaster organization classifies disasters into five types. 
 
Geophysical - Events originating from the earth. Examples include volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and earthquakes.
 
Meteorological - Events caused by short-lived atmospheric processes. Examples include most types of storms and strong wind. 
 
Hydrological - Events caused by the alteration of the water cycle. Examples include floods and the hazards caused by them, such as landslides. 
 
Climatoligcal - Events caused by long-term or macro climate change. Examples include drought, heat wave and other long-term temperature associated hazards. 
 
Biological - Events caused by living organisms and toxic substances. Examples include bacterial and viral disease and infection, as well as types of infestation. 
 
In addition the various environmental hazards, you can also consider various man-made or anthropological hazards such as civil unrest, societal breakdown, nuclear and radiological hazards and biochemical warfare. 
 
Ultimately as a forward-looking prepper, there are many potential threats to be wary of. Research and learn what you may need to deal with, using these classifications as a basis for your study. 










Chapter 3 - Survival Kit Essentials
Prioritizing the Essentials
During a disaster that forces you and your family into the wilderness, your first priority should be to retrieve your prepared survival kit, which contains the most essential tools and resources to survive any disaster.
 
In this chapter learn how to prepare such a survival kit, the most crucial components of the survival kit and why such components are useful. You cannot carry everything you would ever need, so great survival kits prioritize the most important survival tools. 
 
To begin, all survival kits should contain a high-quality knife. A knife is the most useful and versatile tool for crafting all manner of instruments from the natural resources you might find - from shelter to weapons. Above and beyond crafting, knives also (obviously) allow you to cut materials that you wouldn't be able to cut otherwise - such as rope and tightly sealed packages that your supplies might be within. 
 
Additionally you should always keep a compass and a map which details the local area. Getting lost in a disaster situation, especially in the wilderness, is a huge survivability concern - this is one of the easiest factors to account for by always keeping a map at hand.
 
Your next key items should be a first aid kit. This will help you keep small wounds from becoming infected and treat certain fatal wounds. It is hard to overstate just how crucial first aid kits are in any survival situation. 
 
On top of this, you should keep enough food in your survival kit to last for at least three days. This amount of food will give you a small window to begin collecting your own food from nature and can help you survive long enough, for rescue to arrive (providing the disaster situation accommodates for rescue). Similarly, you will want a sizeable flask that can carry a reasonable amount of water, is re-usable and will not leak or break easily. 
 
You will also need to carry a method for starting a fire such as waterproof matches or a flint and steel. Being able to start a fire provides you with warmth, light, the ability to purify water by boiling it as well as the ability to cook. Fire is simply too essential in a survival situation to forget to keep a fire starting source in your survival kit.
 
On this note, you will also want portable light sources. Keeping a flashlight with several sets of spare batteries is often the most convenient choice. 
 
You will also need additional survival clothing such as gloves and waterproofs to protect you from the weather and the temperature, especially if your local area is prone to harsh conditions. 
 
The final pieces of your survival kit should be a sturdy plastic bag, in which other items can be carried in and kept waterproof, as well as ways to signal distress, such as a whistle and flares. You may also want to consider keeping a tarp, as it can help when building a shelter, keeping warm or collecting water.
 
To summarize the key components of your survival kit should be:
●        A high-quality knife
●        A compass and a map
●        A first-aid kit
●        3 days worth of food 
●        A large flash to carry water
●        Waterproof matches and/or a flint and steel
●        A portable light source (i.e a flashlight) and batteries/power
●        Survival clothing
●        Water proof carrier bag
●        Flares and a whistle
●        A tarp










Chapter 4 - Surviving in the Wilderness
Water Supply
To successfully survive in the wild you must learn how to address your basic needs - your need for food, for water and for shelter. Furthermore you must learn how to create a fire, how to navigate the land and how to deal injuries. In this chapter learn the basics of each of these skills in turn.
 
Your first priority when surviving in the wilderness should always be to find and maintain a water supply. Your body can last weeks without nutrition from food, but after just a few days without water you can die from dehydration. Furthermore if you do become dehydrated, you can become incapacitated and your cognitive faculties can notably become impaired (preventing you from maximizing your survival potential) long before dehydration becomes fatal. At the end of the day you must recognize the importance of finding water over immediate survival concerns in most wilderness survival circumstances. If you are stranded in the wilderness and need to survive for long periods of time, do not rest or focus on anything else other than finding water - keep looking. 
 
Providing advice on how to find water is inherently difficult because it largely depends on the geological nature of the landscape as well as what type of biome you are considering in your survival scenario. Exploring and providing information for all the environmental possibilities is way beyond the scope of this book, however there are some widespread water findings tricks and patterns that you may be able to employ if you find yourself desperate. 
 
However, there are a couple of preliminary pointers to make first. Whenever you drink water from the environment around you, it is always better to attempt to filter or purify it first. If you have the time and the resources, boiling water is a fantastic way to remove most of the bacteria and other harmful organisms that your water may be hiding. More realistically when your resources and time are limited, you may not be in a position to boil your water, but at the very least you should attempt to filter it to remove debris, insects and potential parasites. Numerous man-made survival items exist, for the purpose of filtering water, but more crude methods involve filtering water through fabric, or a dense bunch of leaves or bark can be viable too. 
 
Similarly, always prioritize flowing, freshwater such as rivers and gullies over lakes and ponds - flowing water is less likely to contain biological threats that can cause illness, as these bacteria are less likely to thrive in moving water. 
 
With this established, you can now appreciate methods on how to discover water. Your greatest potential ally when attempting to discover water are the flora and fauna around you. If an area is particularly dense with plants and greenery, chances are there a notable source of water in nearby. Similarly, insect swarms and birds will congregate around water sources. Observe the wildlife around you - where it collects, water is bound to be present. 
Also bear in mind that water will always flow downhill due to gravity. Search low-lying areas on the horizon for your sources of water. 
 
Water can also be found below the surface in many places, especially if the ground appears regularly wet or saturated. If you can, attempt to dig a hole a few feet down and wait a couple of minutes - water might begin to naturally pool in the space you've created. As a word of caution, if you do find water this way, take extra effort to filter it carefully. 
 
Other ways to find water include collecting it from rain, from dew as well as from snow or ice. For rainwater, lay out any containers you have when it is raining to collect water, making sure you maximize potential surface area. If you have a waterproof material, you can also cover a small hole or ditch with this material as a temporary method to collect water. 
 
You can obviously melt ice or snow to produce water too. However be aware that you should always ensure that you melt the ice or snow first - if the climate is cold enough to support ice or snow, you cannot risk lowering your body temperature by ingesting your water in a frozen form. Furthermore, a lower body temperature can actually lead to water loss through the skin. 
 
Finally, you can collect water from dew by using fabric to absorb the water from nearby plants and then straining that fabric. Naturally, the best time to collect dew is early in the morning when airborne water has condensed on the surrounding flora, but before the rising sun causes it to evaporate.
 









Foraging
Learning how to gather food from the wilderness faces similar troubles to learning how to gather water - the potential food sources available depend largely on the ecology of the local wilderness, other geographical factors as well as the time of year. Owing to this, an exhaustive guide on how to find food is beyond what can be taught within this eBook. If you want to learn how to forage and how to hunt in your local wilderness, it is best to study this in detail separately doing this can point you towards the edible plants and game in your area. Above and beyond location-specific advice however, there are a few trends that tend to be universal. 
 
In any survival situation, you need to learn to avoid potentially toxic plants if you want to forage. If you see a potential edible candidate, try to observe whether you can find any other animals in the area eating the plant. Generally speaking, if birds and other mammals can tolerate a fruit or berry, there are greater chances that you will able to.
 
In addition, if you are desperate, you can perform stages of the universal edibility test, a test designed to determine whether any plant can be eaten. In this test, the first instruction is to separate the chosen plant into all components; the roots, the fruit, the leaves, stalk and so on. You do this because certain parts of the plant may be edible whilst others are not. If you are to methodically determine what parts are poisonous or not, you need to test them individually. 
 
Next, you apply these parts to sensitive areas of the skin, such as the wrist or elbow and maintain contact for several moments (fifteen minutes is recommended). If your skin starts to develop a negative reaction, such as burning, swelling or stinging the plant probably isn't safe to eat and you should rinse the area that had contact with the plant.
 
After this, the following stage is to attempt to boil the plant components. Some toxic plants become edible once cooked, so boiling the plant decreases the chance you will become ill. Even if you do not have the resources or time to boil the plant, you can still perform the rest of the edibility tests anyway - boiling just makes ingestion of an unknown plant a little safer.
 
Next, rest the plant inside your mouth for several moments. In this stage you are testing for any adverse reaction, just like the previous stage where the plant was applied to the skin. The chemical breakdown of food actually begins with enzymes in your saliva, which can release poisonous compounds from the plant if they are not immediately present upon touch. 
 
Moving on, if the plant seems safe within your mouth, you can now chew it. Do not swallow - simply chew the plant until it is almost liquidated in your mouth and wait again for several moments. If any adverse reaction occurs, spit out the plant and cleanse your mouth with water. 
 
Finally, you can now swallow. You may still become sick, but the following stages have reduced the likelihood notably. In the circumstance where it becomes apparent that you have been poisoned, you must force yourself to vomit and then rehydrate yourself with water. 
 
Whenever you test a plant this way, it is also recommended to control a few other variables. Your stomach shouldn't have eaten for multiple hours beforehand, and you shouldn't eat anything else during or after the test for several hours (to ensure any side effects are due to consumption of the plant).
 
Overall, just be cautious. As formerly mentioned, the body can survive without food for several weeks. In a survival situation it is best to take your time and slowly and scientifically discover what you can and cannot eat, than to poison yourself by eating multiple plants at once - reducing your chance of survival, and not providing you with any new knowledge. 
 









Shelter
In regards to building a shelter, effective shelter building progresses through several stages. First you must survey the land around you and find an appropriate area to build upon. This area must be large and wide enough to suit the needs of a human, whilst not being too exposed to the elements, such as plain sparse areas. Exposing your shelter to strong winds or powerful rains will often damage the shelter, or lead it to not provide sufficient protection. The ideal location is somewhere like a low-hanging canopy or underbrush that which guard you from the weather, but where the forest floor is still wide enough to easily pass through and keep supplies. 
 
In addition to this, having a source of water nearby is always preferable. However, on the same vein you must also build your shelter a suitable distance away from water sources - you do not want your shelter to flood or be damp should a water source flood or spread. Always attempt to build your shelter several dozen meters away from a large water source, or only build your shelter close to water if the terrain is formed in such a way that the risk of flooding appears insignificant. 
 
After having discovered a suitable location, you then need to find a natural structure, which you can use as a foundation for your shelter. This is for two reasons - firstly, attaching your shelter piece by piece to an existing object makes your shelter far easier to construct. However the main and most important reason is to give your shelter strength and fixedness. Any structure you build by hand, especially as a novice, will likely be rather less secure than you may wish it to be. By building your structure on a large nearby object, such a felled tree, a rocky overhang or firm tree low-hanging tree branches, your structure will have more strength than if it were to have no foundation.
 
It is however possible to make a shelter without additional external support, so do not despair if you are in a wilderness situation and there are no good potential supports in an otherwise promising shelter location. 
 
With this in mind, start the architecture of your structure, attempting to incorporate large, natural objects if possible. You will want to form your tepee structure with reasonably large sticks in a prism shape, using two large sticks of roughly the same size, tied at the top facing in opposite directions as your structure entrance. Then also attach third stick, longer than the previous two, tied to the original two in such a way that when the three sticks rest on the ground, they support each other and stay upright. Preferably you should fix these sticks together with rope or durable vine, but providing sufficient weight, gravity and angle you can do without. 
 
Next finding successively smaller pairs of sticks, attach these pairs of sticks across the longest stick from where the three sticks join to where it touches the ground. This completes the architecture of your shelter.
 
Finally, you will need to find small twigs and shrubbery to attach to your structure to provide a layer of protection from the elements over the foundational structure you have created. These pieces need to be positioned as such that they will not be blown away or simply fall out of place. It is recommended that you should make a dense-multilayered surface covering to give the best protection. 
 









Starting a Fire
In addition to learning how to make shelter, you must also learn how to kindle a fire. The art of producing campfires is not inherently difficult, but there are multiple pitfalls that the ignorant fire-starter can fall into. 
 
Before you can start a fire you need several materials. You need a way to ignite the fire, whether it be matches, or a flint & steel. Creating a spark or initial flame is possible with more rudimentary methods, such as friction between pieces of wood, but this is actually rather difficult and can take multiple hours of trials and error. Considering you should have an ignition source in your survival kit, it is best to learn to use more modern methods first.
 
In addition to the material required for ignition, you also need several large logs to use as your primary fuel source once the fire has established and needs to be maintained. Moreover you also need both tinder and kindling, which fortunately can also be found in abundance in every forest. Tinder refers to your initial burning material - it is what you ignite to begin with and use to ignite the larger, harder to burn materials. There are several man-made materials that are rather good tinder sources (such as paper, cloth and cotton). In a wilderness situation, your tinder will usually be dry foliage, grass, pine needles or very small twigs. 
 
As for kindling, kindling is the intermediary between your tinder and your persistent fuel source. It ignites more easily than a large log, but produces a stable and more persistent flame than your tinder. Furthermore it also provides structure for your fireplace, keeping the other materials firmly in pace. Your kindling will also be small sticks and twigs, but notably bigger than your tinder.
 
As a final note on collecting tinder and kindling, make sure the materials you collect are dry. Wetter twigs and sticks, which have more recently fallen from a tree, will be harder to ignite and produce more smoke when burning (which can irritate your eyes and lungs). Your twigs and sticks should snap rather than tear if you attempt to break them; they should be brittle and weigh less than the wetter branches.
 
The first stage when constructing a fire is to build a space for the fire to occupy. There are two ways this can be achieved. You can either dig a small pit to hold the fire, or collect a dozen or so moderate-size stones and form a ring around the intended location of the fire. Be aware when choosing your fire location that there no inflammable objects near the chosen fire area - including natural foliage. If a layer of dried leaves and small twigs occupy the forest floor where you reside, brush away an area of space, using your foot, of at least a couple of meters wide. This will ensure no haphazard sparks ignite the forest around you.
 
After making your fire pit, put a helping of tinder within it. Next form a tepee-like structure of sticks and twigs over the kindling. Ensure that this structure is relatively small, remains close to the tinder, but there is enough space so that you can access the tinder and the initial flame. So there will be able to get enough air supply to persist. Ignite the tinder, in multiple places if possible, and allow your fire-structure to begin burning. You may need to gently blow on the initial flame to boost its air supply, or alternatively shield it from stronger winds, which may extinguish the flame. Once the kindling has ignited and is starting to burn nicely, add your longer-term fuels such as logs and large pieces of wood to allow the fire to continue burning. 
 









Navigation
The next survival skill that you need to acquaint yourself with is navigation. Whenever you are trying to survive in the wilderness, you will need a method of understanding where you are located. Moving further into the wilderness when you mean to move out of it, losing your camp, or being unable to find society again are all significant survival threats. 
 
Ideally you will have a compass and a map of the local terrain in your survival kit, which you can use to navigate comfortably. Even if these tools are nowhere to be found, there are still more ancient techniques that can help you find your way.
 
Firstly, the tried and true adage that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west will never do you wrong. Another astronomical marker is the moon. Whenever the moon is in its crescent stages, visualize a straight line connecting the two tips of the crescent. If you are in the north hemisphere, this line will be facing south. Conversely if you are in the South hemisphere, this line will be facing north. 
 
You can also use the wind to navigate, to a certain extent. In windswept areas, observe the trees and see in what direction they have grown - whether the branches all face one way. If they do, you can determine that the predominant winds tend come from the opposite direction. As an atmospheric principle wind occurs when warm air moves towards colder blocks of air. The further north or south from the equator you go the colder the air is. Owing to this, if the branches or growth of the trees all face one way, if you are in the north hemisphere, chance area that direction is north. Conversely, for the southern hemisphere, if all tree growth or branches face one direction suggests the direction they point is south. This is a generalized principle that cannot always be relied upon, but does have some merit.
 
As always, if you wish to learn how to navigate your local area without equipment, investing in a local guide that can tell you the pointer specific to your region is wise.
 









First-aid 
The final essential survival skill you need is to learn how to manage your health in a disaster situation, by learning how to treat wounds and perform first aid to those in need. To genuinely learn how to perform first aid, it is best to join a society or organization that will teach you and refine your first-aid technique. Whenever dealing with an injured person there are a lot of contingencies to consider and if you deal with the situation poorly, you may endanger yourself or make injuries even worse. 
 
Owing to this, first-aid will only be covered in the briefest way, just to give you an outline of the process and promote further interest.
 
The first step in a first aid scenario is to check for potential hazards that could have injured who you are attempting to give first aid to. Deal with or mitigate these hazards before you progress to treat the injured person, otherwise you risk yourself and the injured person. 
 
Your initial step is to check for signs of consciousness when applying first aid. If consciousness is compromised this may be due to the vital systems failing - these need to be addressed immediately.
 
If the person is unconscious, check for signs of breathing. If they are not breathing you will need to attempt to open their airways by either attempting to remove debris from their throat, or placing them in a position where breathing is easier, such as with their back to the ground. 
 
Your next step is to check for a pulse, at the wrist or neck. If there is no pulse you will need to attempt to support the heartbeat by making compressions to the chest, periodically providing mouth-to-mouth breaths. You must attempt to do this until other help arrives, or a heartbeat initiates once more.
 
If a person's pulse and breathing are stable, check for less serious injuries. If a person is bleeding you must apply pressure to the wound to attempt to stop the blood flow whilst trying to avoid contact with the blood, or sanitizing your hands afterwards to avoid pathogen transfer.
 
Broken bones should next be managed by being supported with slings or splints - you can creatively use any materials around you to achieve this purpose, but the split needs to be strong and not break and should be attached tightly so it doesn't wobble. 
 
For burns, apply water and then cover with a damp cloth. Ointments or other seemingly beneficial treatments can actually make burns worse, so avoid the temptation to use them.
 
Finally you may also need to deal with emotional shock, which can be life threatening. Talk the person whilst you are applying first aid and ask them questions to see if they can recall personal information - the process of memory recall can help mitigate shock. 
 
This is the basics of the first aid, but there is much, much more to learn. As previously mentioned, even with good intentions you can make an injury worse, so please if you are interested in learning first aid, seek professional advice.
 
Lastly, you must also learn to dress wounds. In most circumstance people's immune systems are robust enough that minor injuries do not cause us much harm. However in a survival situation where you may be dehydrated, malnourished and exposed to more pathogens than usual, properly dealing with wounds is a life-saver. 
 
First when dressing a wound, you must cleanse the area with water and remove any debris or filth from the wound. Next sanitize the area with disinfectant, which should be in a first aid kit. Alternatively, strong alcohol is also a good substitute if suitable disinfectant is not available. Next, if any bleeding is occurring, apply pressure with a clean cloth or cotton bud to stem the bleeding. If this bleeding is occurring from a limb, raise the limb in the air to reduce blood flow to that area. Finally, firmly bandage the area and secure the bandage with tape, a bandage clip or a safety pin. 
 
With first aid and wound treatment tenuously covered, you are now in a better position to deal with potential threats to your health. With the previous advice on water, food, shelter and navigation, you are now equipped with your basic survival skills. 










Conclusion
Learning survival skills doesn't have to be a matter of life and death. Learning how to survive in the wild can be a challenging but rewarding hobby that can also boost your fitness and confidence. Even developing a survival mindset can be a benefit in regular society, as it cultivates your self-sufficiency, problem solving and lateral thinking. 
 
However, above and beyond the everyday benefits there is a huge pragmatic and obvious reason to learn survival skills - survival. There is no compelling reason to think that we may never be in a situation where our survival skills are truly put to test. This doesn't mean that as a prepper you commit to conspiracy theories about the collapse of government and biochemical warfare. Perhaps you simply recognize the possibility of certain environmental hazards and take the initiative to learn to manage those situations in advance. Alternatively, you may also realize than survival skills are important if you were to get lost. Regardless of the reason, you have come to understand that taking the time to learning survival skills is a smart choice.
 
This eBook started you on your survival journey. By now you should know how you need to think if you want to survive difficult situations, as well as what type of disasters can occur. You know how to prepare a survival kit and how you may use its various components to collect water and find food in the wilderness. Furthermore you know how to build a shelter, how to start a fire and how to navigate. This is only the beginning of learning how to survive in the wild, but it is a good foundation to build upon. Now it is up to you to progress even further and fully master learning to how to survive in this dangerous world

Introducción
La mayoría de la gente ha oído hablar de lenguaje corporal, pero menos hanoído hablar del término «kinésica. Kinésica es el término psicológico de lujo para el lenguaje corporal y técnicamente se define como el estudio de las expresiones faciales y gestos.
 
La base de la kinésica es simple; el movimiento, la expresión y el gesto son parte de la comunicación. Pueden transmitir el significado y la intención a fin de comprender mejor a los demás. Kinésica es todavía una ciencia naciente - no se convertirá de repente unlector de la mente maquiavélica mediante el estudio de la misma. Sin embargo, usted comenzará a, en ocasiones, leer e interpretar las personas a su alrededor con más éxito por ser consciente de pequeñas señales - tales como la postura del cuerpo - para entender lo que otras personas pueden estar sintiendo.
 
El encanto de kinésica está en su poder oculto. Nos gusta estar en control de nuestras propias acciones y cómo nospresentamos ante los demás. La idea de que nuestro propio lenguaje corporal puede traicionar lo que estamos diciendo, o que puede recoger en la duplicidad de otras personas es intoxicante.
 
Esto es especialmente cierto en el lugar de trabajo o entornos sociales no familiares. Todos queremos dar la impresión de la confianza, la tranquilidad y la competencia, pero a veces nuestro lenguaje corporal nos puede perjudicar. Si alguna vez se alejó de una entrevista preguntándose por qué no le dieron esetrabajo que querías, o por qué la gente no parecen tomar contacto contigo tan pronto como deberían, su falta puede ser debido a una mala comprensión de la kinésica. Este libro tiene como objetivo resolver eso!
 
Hay seis capítulos de estelibro. El primer capítulo se llevará a través de los fundamentos de la kinésica, que le informa sobre cómo se clasifica el lenguaje corporal.
El segundo capítulo se llevará a través de otras categorizaciones de lenguaje corporal que usted puede escuchar en alguna ocasión, como la háptica y paralenguaje.
 
El tercer capítulo le enseñará cómo mejorar su comunicación no verbal, por el manejo del estrés y ser consciente de cuerpo inconsistencias en idioma verbal y mucho más.
 
El cuarto capítulo le ayudará a conseguir a los apretones con la manera de hacer una buena primera impresión y los factores psicológicos que influyen en cómo se perciben en la primera aparición.
 
El quinto capítulo le dará una pequeña introducción a algunas de las diferencias culturales en el lenguaje corporal y la interpretación de los gestos.
 
Por último, el sexto capítulo voy a entrar en profundidad acerca de una serie de hábitos de lenguaje corporal que las personas muestran regularmente y cómo deben interpretarlos.
 
En el momento en que haya leído este libro usted debe tener un conocimiento profundo de la base del lenguaje corporal, para ayudar a mejorar y prosperar en sus relaciones con otras personas.












Los fundamentos de la kinésica
El lenguaje corporal, o kinésica, ya que se conoce técnicamente, se ha dividido en cinco categorías de los científicos sociales. En este capítulo aprenderá acerca de cada una de estas cinco categorías en turno.
 
Emblemas
Emblemas son señales que son "concreto" y que tienen unsignificado definido en una determinada cultura o contexto. Un pulgar hacia arriba gesto se entiende para comunicar que todo está "bien" o que algo ha ido bien.
 
Tenga en cuenta que los emblemas son culturalmente sensible y sin embargo que las diferentes regiones del mundo tienen diferentes significados para los mismos emblemas (cubiertos en más detalle en el capítulo 5).
Grupos específicos o subculturas pueden tener sus propios emblemas. No es raro que las pandillas o grupos para desarrollar sus propios emblemas comoun gesto de bienvenida o para demostrar que es un miembro del grupo en. Piense de nuevo a sus días de escuela - es probable que sea tenido uno de estos emblemas usted mismo o conocía a alguien que lo hizo.
 
Alternativamente las personas a desarrollar sus propias señales para comunicarse en situaciones sociales sin otras personas entender - como secreto "lenguaje de signos" o códigos que los niños pueden usar en la escuela durante las clases para no llamar la atención de los profesores.
 
Ilustradores
Ilustradores son gestos y movimientos que ayudan a transmitir y exagerar lo que una persona está diciendo. Las personas suelen utilizar ilustradores cuando están tratando de describir algo, moviendo sus manos para señalar la forma, tamaño o la dirección. Ilustradores también pueden incluir señalador.
Tenga en cuenta que los ilustradores son menos conscientemente controlados de emblemas. Sin embargo, esta naturaleza puede ser utilizado para ayudar a hacer inferencias acerca de otras personas. Si alguien está haciendo una gran pantalla con ilustradores esto a menudo significa que están muy interesados, pero no puede tener un enorme grado de conciencia acerca de sus acciones.
 
Por el contrario, si alguien no está mostrando ningún ilustradores pueden no estar involucrados en la conversación en absoluto o no estar disfrutando.
 
Ilustradores también a menudo pueden traicionar nuestras verdaderas intenciones. Si estamos tratando de decir una cosa, pero que en realidad pensamos o sentimos de manera diferente que los ilustradores son una de las formas principales de nuestro lenguaje corporal nos puede perjudicar, ya que pueden indicar algo diferente. Inconsistencia entre ilustradores y nuestra comunicación verbal, por lo menos da la impresión de falta de sinceridad.
Un ilustrador común es a menudo una chuleta de movimiento de karate en una palmaabierta. Esto demuestra la asertividad y contundencia. Si alguien muestra este ilustrador que a menudo fuerte creer lo que están diciendo, o tienen un sesgo ligeramente agresivo.
 
Del mismo modo, mostrar o tensar los nudillos menudo símbolos agresión o un deseo de ser agresivo.
 
No todos los ilustradores son agresivos sin embargo! Una palmalevantada y el dedo que menea por ejemplo, es a menudo muy condescendiente y de mal gusto. Se utiliza para indicar que alguien ha hecho unaccidente o hecho algo malo, pero de una manera infantil o humildes. Este ilustrador casi nunca se debe utilizar, ya que se convertirá de inmediato la gente lejos de ti.
 
Del mismo modo, la celebración de una palmade la mano sobre el corazón es otro ilustrador que usted debe considerar cuidadosamente antes de usar. Se puede interpretar en el sentido de que usted está siendo emocional y que lo que está diciendo o escuchando es sincero.
 
Sin embargo, también puede venir a través como muy sarcástico, especialmente cuando disculparse o decir algo que debe ser tomado como sincero.
 
Es importante reconocer cómo los ilustradores pueden interpretarse, en especial, ya que son no-consciente - usted puede estar convirtiendo a la gente lejos de usted o dar señales de que no tenía la intención de dar (aunque estos pueden mostrar sentimientos no conscientes).
 
Una lista completa de los ilustradores es probable que sea bastante más extensa entonces esta guía puede cubrir. Sin embargo, tratar de empezar a reconocerlos en su vida diaria y si con frecuencia mostrarlas (o si la gente alrededor de usted).
Afectar Muestra
En psicología, afecto es untérmino usado que significa la emoción. Por lo tanto, afectar pantallas son manifestaciones emocionales - los movimientos que le confieren un significado emocional.
 
Esto incluye expresiones, sino también otros aspectos de la kinésica. Tenemos la tendencia a interpretar la gente que está encorvado o se aferran a su propio cuerpo con sus brazoscomo falta de confianza o triste. Por el contrario, las personas que caminan con unresorte en su paso o que rebotan y son bastante corporales animados cuando hablan de ser feliz. Estos son dos ejemplos de afectar pantallas. Afectan muestra a menudo son bastante incontrolada y espontánea - en comparación con los emblemas, que se utilizan deliberadamente.
 
Uno común afectan pantalla está frotando las manos de unojuntos. Esto se interpreta generalmente comouna señal de excitación y anticipación. Este movimiento realmente sirve a un propósito sin embargo - que se calienta las manos juntas, que los prepara para la acción.
 
La intensidad de este movimiento por lo general se correlaciona con lo poderoso que se siente la emoción - con movimientos más rápido roce, la designación de los niveles más altos de la anticipación.
 
Otra afectar pantalla está rodando sus mangas. Esta es otra muestra que se prepara a sí mismo para la acción - en este caso, lo que garantiza que su ropa no se ensucian o en el camino de lo que usted está tratando de lograr.
 
Afectar pantallas son particularmente difíciles de manejar porque son uno de los tipos más espontáneas de acción. Sin embargo, también se puede aprender sobre la forma en que son retratados y cómo considerar que debe responder a ellos. Si usted hace un agresivo efecto pantalla, es posible que desee hacer pantallas más pasivos o abiertos que no dan a cabo tales impresiones agresivos.
 
Reguladores
Los reguladores son movimientos no verbales que ayudan a moderada lo que dice la gente y el flujo de la conversación. Asiente con la cabeza o sacudir la cabeza, por ejemplo, se comunica acuerdo o desacuerdo, que ayuda a los demás miembros de la conversación directa lo que quieren decir.Otros reguladores pueden incluir simplemente caminar lejos (o empezar a alejarse) o levantando un dedo (con gesto de silencio).
 
Reguladores tienden a pasar desapercibidas, aparte de los casos en los que no están siendo utilizados. Si hay una falta de reguladores, es dolorosamente obvio que no están presentes. Gente interrumpen unos a otros, o de una persona se apodera de la conversación y en general la conversación no fluye naturalmente.
 
Si usted encuentra que usted es una de esas personas que a menudo interrumpen otras personas entonces tal vez usted no está registrando los reguladores que otras personas están haciendo.
 
Cualquier señal de que las otras personas en una conversación son impacientes es una señal de que su probablemente su turno para dejar de hablar, esto puede incluir inquietud o arrastrando el cuerpo. Alternativamente, podría incluir el aprendizaje hacia adelante o sentado con la boca abierta (en preparación para hablar). Otras señales pueden incluir personas presentan ilustradores o emblemas, que también señales de que están listos para comunicarse y que puede que tenga que darles la oportunidad de hablar.
 
Del mismo modo, si la gente parece distraído o de otra manera desinteresada, talvez no les está dando suficiente oportunidad de expresar a sí mismos. En general, a veces es mejor simplemente pedirá otras personas y escuchar, en lugar de sentir la necesidad de hablar a ti mismo, sobre todo si usted sospecha que su podría inhibir la conversación a través de los reguladores no reconocen.
 
Adaptadores
Adaptadores son comportamientos que las personas emplean, a bajos niveles de conciencia de sí mismo, lo que puede indicar cómo se sienten. Para aclarar, que incluyen movimientos como jugueteando con su pelo, jugueteando con estacionaria, arañando pica, rebotando en las sillas, mordiéndose el labio (y así sucesivamente).
 
Normalmente estas acciones no se interpretan comodebido a un deseo consciente de realizar una acción específica, sino más bien como una respuesta habitual. Adaptadores son interesantes porque no tienen unsignificado pretendido, sino más bien pueden ser de disparo por la ansiedad o el estrés. Adaptadores se desarrollan a menudo en nuestros años más jóvenes y se pueden mostrar cada vez más ansioso que sentimos. Debido al hecho de que se desarrollan debido a las condiciones ambientales, adaptadores pueden variar mucho entre diferentes personas.
 
Adaptadores puede ser útil en el descubrimiento de la mentira y momentos de tensión. Si alguien no está diciendo la verdad - o está fabricando su historia o la cuenta de alguna manera (como exagero) que tienden a sentirse más ansiosos y estresados de lo normal. Por lo tanto, pueden empezar a mostrar los adaptadores y otros signos de estrés.
 
También pueden resaltar diferentes partes de la conversación que se induce estrés. Si usted ha mencionado un tema de conversación que hace otra gente incómoda por ejemplo, usted podría notar que empiecen a producir adaptadores.
 
Sin embargo, también pueden ser totalmente sin sentido. No todo el mundo se agita debido a la ansiedad - a veces las personas se sienten incómodos por razones de sentido común. Por otra parte, algunas personas tienen una tendencia a inquietarse o no moverse. Asegúrese de que usted no sobre-interpretar!












Académico Los campos de lenguaje corporal
Kinésica es el término académico para el lenguaje corporal, pero hay todo unespectro de la comunicación no verbal de cada uno de los cuales tiene su propio campo de estudio. En este capítulo aprenderá acerca de los otros tipos de comunicación no verbal.
 
Motorics
Motorics, comosu nombre lo indica, es el estudio del movimiento en lo que respecta a la comunicación. Esto incluye los sub-grupos de;
 
Imita - movimientos de la cara
Pantomimics - el movimiento / posición de todo el cuerpo
Gesto - movimientos de los brazos y las manos
Allí, el punto más importante aquí es que las expresiones (que caen bajo la categoría de imitadores) son universales.
 
No importa dónde usted está en el mundo y lo que la cultura que está hablando, toda la gente vaa interpretar una expresión de la misma manera. Esto proporciona una base útil para la comunicación entre personas de diferentes idiomas u orígenes - deje que sus expresiones parecen ser para usted!
 
Oculesics
Oculescis el estudio o el uso de los movimientos oculares en la comunicación no verbal.
 
Los seres humanos tienen una gran habilidad en la interpretación de los movimientos de los ojos de otros seres humanos. Podemos interpretar una mirada errante como un signo de distracción o falta de interés en la conversación actual.
 
El contacto visual directo puede causar una sensación de intimidad o confianza y una mirada evasiva puede implicar la inseguridad o la falta de confianza. Sin embargo, por el contrario, a veces, la mirada directa puede sentir inadecuada o torpe.
 
Movimiento de los ojos también puede influir en el flujo y el control de una conversación. Los cambios en el movimiento de los ojos se pueden usar para indicar un nuevo evento que requiere atención o para dirigir a la gente a donde estamos buscando.
 
Haptics
El estudio o el uso de contacto físico en la comunicación no verbal.
 
El usodel tacto en la comunicación no verbal es muy complicado y lleno de matices. Touch puede transmitir una amplia gama de emociones y las intenciones, de la alegría a la atracción sexual, al amor y la intimidad o incluso la amenaza y la violencia. Touch también puede ser parte de la convención y el ritual social, como un apretón de manos o cinco de alto.
 
El usodel tacto también varía considerablemente en todas las culturas y países. Incluso dentro de los países occidentales, el tacto agradable es más común y aceptada en la Europa continental, a diferencia de en el Reino Unido y EE.UU.
 
Touch también varía notablemente entre géneros. Los estudios sugieren que los hombres interpretan ser tocado tan diferente de la mujer y son más propensos a responder negativamente - posiblemente debido a las consecuencias de la dominación y la sumisión.
 
El punto para llevar a casa principal del tacto es que es unmétodo muy emocional de la comunicación, a menudo con un mayor nivel de intensidad que otros métodos. Si táctil se utiliza en conjunción con el lenguaje y la comunicación no verbal, se puede enfatizar y reforzar la impresión que usted hace.Esta es una espada de doble filo, sin embargo - si alguien se siente incómodo con su presencia, o usted percibe negativamente, tocarlos es probable que fortalecer esta percepción.
 
Proxémica
El estudio y el usode espacio en la comunicación no verbal. Interactúa proxémica e influencias hápticos - que tendrán que estar a una cierta distancia antes de tocar siquiera llega a ser apropiado.
 
Si alguien está de pie "demasiado cerca" esto puede ser interpretado comoincómoda o inapropiada por la otra persona en la conversación. El nivel apropiado de cercanía depende en gran medida de la relación entre las dos personas involucradas. Estudio de la proxémica ha distinguido cuatro regiones aproximadas de gente del espacio puede ocupar en relación con otro.
 
Íntimo Distancia - Menos de 1.5ft
Espacio Personal - 1.5ft a 4 pies
Espacio Social - 4 pies a 12 pies
Espacio Público - 12 pies - 25 pies
 
Espacio íntimo se utiliza para el contacto directo, abrazos o susurros. Naturalmente espacio íntimo transmite una relación fuerte y estrecha entre las dos personas involucradas, a menudo siendo amantes.
 
El espacio personal es típicamente para los amigos cercanos y la familia. Si otras personas menos conocidas entran en este espacio, se determina incómodo por la mayoría de la gente.
 
El espacio social es para citas y otras personas que no pertenecen a las categorías anteriores. Este espacio está lo suficientemente cerca para ser considerado razonablemente comprometido con la otra persona, pero no muestra ningún tipo de intimidad o cercanía.
 
El espacio público es de usofrecuente para las interacciones de habla o de grupo públicas. Este es el límite superior para cuando las conversaciones o la comunicación verbal tienen lugar entre las personas y grupos.
 
Chronemics
El estudio y el usodel tiempo en la comunicación no verbal. Un ritmo rápido de una conversación a menudo puede ser el resultado de la ira o la frustración, pero también puede ser el resultado de la participación y el entusiasmo. Tempo más lento puede ser el resultado de una falta de interés por ambas partes, pero también puede implicar que se sienten cómodos en presencia de otros. Tempo lento y pausas con frecuencia pueden implicar confianza.
 
Fuera de la conversación, el usodel tiempo también tiene varias connotaciones. En el mundo asiático oeste y al este, el uso del tiempo se llama 'monocrónico', que básicamente significa precisa o medido. Al llegar exactamente a tiempo a unevento que se considera; siendo cinco, diez o cualquier cantidad de tiempo después se interpreta como grosero (al menos sin razón).
 
Por el contrario, en otras regiones, comoAmérica Latina o África, el uso del tiempo es a menudo llamado 'policrónica'. Más amplias categorías de tiempo se utilizan para indicar eventos, como "mañana", "tarde", "atardecer" y hay más amplitud y la varianza para cuando una persona puede aparecer para eventos.
 
Paralenguaje
El estudio y el usode la voz en la comunicación no verbal. Esto puede sonar untanto contradictoria, pero paralenguaje en realidad es sumamente relevante. Psicología considera que unfactor importante en nuestra comunicación es no verbal (es decir, no el lenguaje base) aspectos de nuestro discurso. Esto incluye factores como el ritmo, la entonación, la forma de hablar y el estrés.
 
Piense en sus propias experiencias. Usted tiene más probabilidades de comprometerse con una persona que no está hablando en un tono monótono y del mismo modo, mayores oradores saben cómo alterar y controlar el ritmo y el énfasis de lo que están diciendo para un mayor impacto.
 
Del mismo modo, si de alguien de voz se está agrietando o shacking vamos a interpretar lo que están diciendo por ser más emocional que si su voz fuera la calma, incluso si están diciendo lo mismo mensaje exacto.
 
Para mejorar su paralenguaje, que tendrá que practicar. Altavoces normalmente entrenan al dar su discurso o presentación frente a unespejo de cuerpo entero para que puedan verse a sí mismos mientras habla. Del mismo modo, es común que los ponentes y oradores para grabar su propia voz para que puedan analizar mejor sus hábitos de habla.
 
Bipedics
El estudio y el usode los pies y de las piernas gestos en la comunicación no verbal. Bipedics es relativamente una nueva adición a las otras categorías, con mucha menos investigación sobre lo influyente que es. Sin embargo, ser conscientes de su existencia! Es posible que escuche de bipedics en el futuro!
 
Como se puede ver, hay una gran cantidad de categorías! Muchas de estas categorías se superponen o cubrir el mismo espacio conceptual - bipedics (movimiento de las piernas y pies), por ejemplo, se puede interpretar comoun sub-grupo de motirics (movimiento). Del mismo modo, las categorías mencionadas en el capítulo 1 también caben dentro de las categorías (emblemas por ejemplo, son un tipo de gesto).
 
No es crucial para apreciar las categorizaciones exactas, pero se le puede dar una gran ventaja para la investigación y así comola sorprendente variedad de señales de lenguaje corporal que la gente realmente consideren. Es probable que, antes de leer estecapítulo usted no era consciente de que bipedics - o el lenguaje corporal de las piernas y las caderas - era un campo científico por sí misma! Sin embargo, ahora ya sabes que incluso las piernas pueden dar influencia cómo se retratan.












Cómo mejorar la comunicación no verbal
Ahora que usted está familiarizado con la teoría y las definiciones con respecto a la comunicación no verbal, es el momento de poner este conocimiento a trabajar. Este capítulo trata sobre cómo mejorar realmente sus habilidades de comunicación no verbal.
 
Uno de los puntos clave a recordar es que usted todavía tiene que ser genuino y honesto cuando influir en su lenguaje corporal. Utilizar los conocimientos que hancompilado para desarrollar la auto-conciencia y la comprensión de las personas que te rodean. La utilización de esta conciencia de sí mismo, puede destacar selectivamente partes de su comunicación para mayor efecto.
 
El punto que se hizo es que el lenguaje corporal no es mágico y no será capaz de transformar completamente la forma en que son percibidos. Si trata de "falso" su lenguaje corporal, puede causar que usted se sienta estresado, así como producir señales inconsistentes, que pueden contrarrestar cualquier efecto que usted está tratando de producir, sobre todo si no están bien practicado.
 
Comience siempre por ser auto-consciente de sus hábitos. Una vez que esté familiarizado con sus hábitos, ajuste ligeramente cuando sea apropiado.Cuanto mejor usted se convierte en el reconocimiento y el cambio de su lenguaje corporal, cuantomás se puede influir en él. Usted debe trabajar su camino hasta la parte más profunda, en lugar de saltar de inmediato!
 
Con esto en mente, considere lo que usted quiere lograr cada vez que está manipulando su lenguaje corporal. Los teóricos han argumentado la comunicación no verbal puede dar lugar a los siguientes resultados:
 
Repetición - enfatiza y refuerza el mensaje de que usted está diciendo verbalmente
 
Contradicción - socava o contrarrestar el mensaje que usted está diciendo verbalmente
 
Sustitución - Se utiliza en lugar de un mensaje verbal (a menudo para más efecto)
 
Complementando - También refuerza y hace hincapié en la comunicación verbal, pero de una manera ligeramente diferente a la repetición. Como complemento añade impacto emocional.
 
Acentuando - Estrado que cambia la forma en que se percibe el mensaje. Golpear la pared como usted habla le dará a su mensaje de una implicación mucho más agresivo, por ejemplo.
 
Sea consciente de estos roles y considerar qué área usted puede estar buscando mejorar. Si las personas no parecen tener bien a usted, usted puede tener un hábito de contradecir sus conductas verbales con la comunicación no verbal.
 
El no poder manejar el contacto visual, o la celebración de una postura corporal incómoda casi siempre llevan a las personas a ser incómodo en su presencia, incluso si usted es de otro modo agradable, interesante o divertido.
 
Por el contrario, la falta de acentuación o la repetición puede significar que sus discursos o comunicaciones meta basada no recogen el impacto que merecen.
 
La regla general es que ser conscientes de las incoherencias entre lo que dices y cómo su lenguaje corporal que está retratando.
 
En la búsqueda de estas inconsistencias, sin embargo, es importante buscar tendencias. El lenguaje corporal es muy rico y lleno de matices; sobre-interpretar y analizar cada aspecto se hizo girar la cabeza. En su lugar, buscar grupos de señales y signos que se presentan de manera persistente y fuerte. Estos tienden a ser la base de los sentimientos más fuertes.
 
Del mismo modo, ser conscientes de que el propietario potencial de malinterpretar el lenguaje corporal de otras personas. Está bien para recoger en las señales de otras personas y actuar en consecuencia, pero al final del día, cada situación es ambigua. A menudo es mejor no tomar la mayoría de las señales que percibes demasiado a pecho, especialmente si son poco frecuentes.
 
A continuación, confiar en tus sentimientos instintivos. Los seres humanos son animales sociales y casi todos nosotros, por defecto, tendrán una sólida comprensión del lenguaje corporal, incluso si no estamos explícitamente conscientes del hecho. Nuestra capacidad de controlar nuestro lenguaje corporal, o ser consciente de ello, en primer lugar, es nuestro principal defecto cuando se trata de la comunicación.
 
Además, tiene que aprender a tratar y manejar el estrés. Nuestro lenguaje corporal es a menudo comprometida debido a las emociones negativas que nos encontramos en situaciones sociales, comoel estrés o la ansiedad. Estas emociones son a menudo acerca de nuestro propio estado de ánimo personal, más que al mundo nilas personas que nos rodean. Sin embargo, influyen en la forma en que otras personas nos perciben y por lo tanto la forma en que interactúan con nosotros.
 
En última instancia, hay una relación de auto-cumplida entre el lenguaje corporal negativo y las interacciones negativas con otras personas. Nuestra capacidad de controlar nuestro lenguaje corporal es limitado, por lo que a menudo es más ventajoso para gestionar el estrés y la ansiedad que están causando el lenguaje corporal negativo para empezar. En este sentido, es importante para el tratamiento de la causa, en lugar de los síntomas.
 
Además, el estrés y la ansiedad también influyen en cómo interpretamos el lenguaje corporal de otras personas. Cuando se siente estresado o ansioso, somos más propensos a malinterpretar el lenguaje corporal de otras personas, a menudo de una manera negativa parcial.
 
En pocas palabras, el estrés y la ansiedad comprometen nuestro lenguaje corporal en una miríada de formas y deben ser tratados antes de que el lenguaje corporal puede ser mejorado.
 
Además, de una manera más que puede mejorar es simplemente pedir a la gente quién eres cerca cómo son percibidos cuando se comunica. A veces puede percibir a sí mismo como ser retratado peor que su lenguaje corporal en realidad implica.
 
Alternativamente, usted puede ignorar unaspecto persistente o hábito de su lenguaje corporal que está creando una enorme cantidad de impacto. El uso de los amigos cercanos y miembros de la familia para pedirle su opinión es una gran manera de compensar la falta de conciencia de sí mismo de su propio lenguaje corporal.
 
Por otra parte no tenga miedo de aclarar vez en cuando lo que usted piensa que otras personas están tratando de comunicarse. Estamos a menudo avergonzado o demasiado tímido para pedir una aclaración en unentorno social, pero a menudo es necesario. Además pidiendo aclaraciones también ayuda a desarrollar su interpretación del lenguaje corporal.
 
Otra puntero a considerar es el contexto de una situación dada. Los seres humanos tienen una capacidad casi psíquica para inferir cómo otra persona puede ser sentimiento, si nos tomamos el tiempo para pensar en las situaciones que se encuentran. Tal vez su lenguaje corporal es agresivo porque tenían un mal día en el trabajo y que están estresados, en lugar de cualquier relación se refiere con usted.
 












La Historia de un crimen 'primera impresión'
Usted probablemente ha oído hablar de la psicología popular de reclamar que la primera impresión que hacemos con una nueva persona tiene enormes implicaciones para la forma en que esa persona nos va a percibir en el futuro.
 
Mientras que las demandas son muy exageradas, la base es cierto; las primeras impresiones son vitales para la forma en que somos considerados, sobre todo para los conocidos. Por ejemplo, un estudio realizado por Malcom Gladwell, encontró que personas que se citan velocidad componen su mente en si eran compatibles el uno al otro en los primeros 10 segundos de la reunión.
 
En este capítulo aprenderá a clavar la primera impresión terrible para asegurar que sus relaciones comienzan de la manera correcta.
 
Las primeras impresiones se basan en gran medida de factores que hanlimitado el control sobre. Factores comola edad, el sexo o el atractivo serán juzgados con rapidez, e inconscientemente, a menudo antes de que incluso han hablado. Por lo tanto, si usted realmente desea maximizar su primera impresión, entonces usted necesita para controlar los factores de poca profundidad primero.
 
Esto significa que usted está vestido apropiadamente para cualquier ocasión que se encuentra, así comopreparado adecuadamente. Obviamente la convención será diferente en diferentes situaciones, pero la intensidad de los juicios también puede variar. Al llegar a una entrevista en traje casual es un fracaso significativo en la determinación de qué ponerse de ir a una situación social poco overdressed.
 
Una vez que tenga estos factores dispuestas a lo mejor de su capacidad usted puede entonces considerar los otros factores psicológicos que usted puede ser capaz de influir. La investigación actual sugiere que hay dos "dominios" en el que son juzgados durante nuestras primeras impresiones.Estos dominios son de continuo en el que estamos colocados y este valor en bruto se utilizarán para interpretar nuestro comportamiento posterior.
 
El primer dominio es la honradez. Este factor parece depender en gran medida de las señales y signos que sugieren estamos contentos o enojados (que este último sugiriendo que son menos dignos de confianza).
 
Esto sigue el consejo convencional para presentarse con una sonrisa y ser agradable y cálido a la gente la primera vez que hablo con ellos. Esto da la impresión de la felicidad, que extrañamente, puede ser importante más importante que la confianza en sí al ser juzgado por confiabilidad.
 
El segundo dominio es dominio. Dominación, al menos a primera vista, se basa en gran medida de la madurez facial y rasgos masculinos.
 
La dominación es unfactor difícil de tener en cuenta, ya que es más ambigua que la honradez. Todos deseamos ser percibido comodigno de confianza, pero es posible que el deseo de ser percibido como dominante o no dominante en función de la situación. Por lo menos, no queremos que aparezcan sumiso.
Si se nos juzga a ser muy dominante, nuestro comportamiento más tarde puede ser juzgado como agresivos en lugar de simplemente confiado.
 
Obviamente su perfil facial y la madurez física no pueden ser influenciados. Sin embargo, factores comola postura corporal y los gestos que pueden pueden influir en los juicios de la dominación. Postura abierta y relajada es más probable que sea percibido comodominante que posturas encorvadas o cerrados. Del mismo modo, se inclina hacia adelante o la entrega de una empresa (pero no con hueso de ruptura) apretón de manos, son todos factores que determinan la dominación. Estos datos se tratarán con más detalle en el capítulo 6.












Diferencias culturales
Algunos aspectos de nuestro lenguaje corporal y la comunicación no verbal son universales, comonuestras expresiones. Otros aspectos, en los gestoso emblemas particulares son muy culturalmente sensibles. Esto puede conducir a enormes malentendidos entre personas de diferentes culturas. En este capítulo se aprenden algunos gestos occidentales comunes pueden ser interpretados de manera diferente en otras regiones del mundo.
 
Por ejemplo, en Occidente es común el usode un gesto señas para atraer a la gente hacia ti desde la distancia. Este gesto implica generalmente levantando un brazo por delante del cuerpo y se encrespa uno o varios dedos a la palma de la mano, señalando que otra persona debe venir a su presencia.
 
Sin embargo, en muchas culturas asiáticas, estegesto es muy ofensivo, ya que este gesto se relaciona con perros señas. Por lo tanto el uso de ese gesto particular es equivalente a llamar a la otra persona un perro o un perro, que también es un insulto muy sensible en muchas regiones de Asia.
 
Del mismo modo, el señalar, que se utiliza simplemente para dirigir la atención en la mayoría de las culturas occidentales puede considerarse ofensiva en muchas regiones de Asia. En su lugar, levantando una mano verticalmente hacia lo que usted quiere llamar la atención sobre que se considera más apropiada.
 
Guiño es unmovimiento facial que altamente varía entre culturas, e incluso individuos. Guiño se utiliza a menudo en broma en el oeste, o para comunicar unconocimiento compartido subyacente es un entorno social. En América Latina, es unguiño más sexualizada, y se utiliza casi exclusivamente en ese sentido. Por el contrario, en China, el guiño es a menudo visto como grosero por completo.
 
El emblema 'ok' también se interpreta de manera diferente en diferentes regiones del mundo. En Japón, el gesto es similar a una moneda japonesa, y por lo tanto el emblema típicamente se refiere a dinero. En el sur de Europa, el Mediterráneo y el norte de África, significa lo mismo emblema cero o nada.
 
En muchas culturas de Oriente Medio y América Latina, se considera más apropiado para soportar más cerca entre sí, incluso en lo que respecta a los extraños y conocidos menos conocidos. Culturas musulmanas, en general, son mucho más sensibles a la proximidad entre hombres y mujeres, sin embargo.
 
Contacto con los ojos también varía considerablemente entre las culturas. En algunas culturas asiáticas, a menudo es un signo de falta de respeto de hacer contacto visual antes de estar familiarizado con la otra persona. Especialmente cuando una persona más joven intenta hacer contacto visual con una persona mayor.
 
En el mismo sentido, se sienta con la mala postura es a menudo considerado como una falta de respeto en muchos lugares - que significa una falta de interés o la atención.
 
En última instancia, no se puede aprender cada costumbre o toque cultural en un gesto o un emblema. Sin embargo, ser conscientes de si las diferencias potenciales entre gestos culturales pueden ayudar a evitar un error vergonzoso. Confía en la comunicación verbal siempre que pueda y próximamente con su expresión (que se entiende más universal).












Interpretar las señales individuales
Hasta el momento hemos hablado de más señales de interpretación que usted probablemente ya sepa. La mayoría de nosotros no necesita ser viejo que encorvarse implica una falta de confianza, o que gritar implica agresividad. Sin embargo, hay rangos de señales más pequeñas que no están tan bien entendidas. Este capítulo le ayudará a entender mejor estas señales de micro.
 
La cabeza
La cabeza es una de las características clave de un lenguaje corporal. A menudo nos centramos en la cara, pero no reconocemos la posición global de la cabeza. Biología y evolución nos han enseñado a guardar nuestras cabezas, por encima y más allá de todos los otros órganos de nuestro cuerpo.Por lo tanto, si nos sentimos amenazados, inseguros o de otra manera incómoda, tenemos una tendencia a tirar y levantar la cabeza hacia atrás.
 
Es sólo cuando nos sentimos seguros y comprometidos que vamos a empujar la cabeza hacia adelante, o si estamos buscando para luchar con otra persona.
 
Por lo tanto, usted debe interpretar un atrevimiento de la cabeza como la acción toma o agresivo, mientras que una vuelta magra de la cabeza es la defensiva o pasiva.
 
Esto puede tener implicaciones que puede que no anticipar. Inclinada la cabeza hacia atrás cuando tu ser contó una historia, por ejemplo, no solo implica que tu no comprometidos, sino que también implica que usted no cree que la historia en sí (o creen que es exagerada).
 
La inclinación de la cabeza hacia un lado puede ser una pantalla general de interés o empatía, pero este hábito particular, varía considerablemente entre las personas.
Cabeceo
Todos sabemos que asintiendo la cabeza implica acuerdo. Sin embargo, dependiendo de la frecuencia y el estilo de asentir con la cabeza, este acuerdo puede ser verdadera, falsa o algo completamente distinto.
 
Asiente con la cabeza es un ejemplo de un comportamiento de espejo - es un comportamiento común que las personas emplean para sentirse aceptado o similares entre sí. Cuando una persona se asiente durante la conversación que aumenta la probabilidad de que las otras personas en la conversación también asentir.
 
Lo que esto significa también, es que asintiendo menudo se convierte en una acción inconsciente o subconsciente que en realidad tiene poco valor en si una persona está de acuerdo o no con su tema de conversación.
 
Sin embargo, esto casi siempre implica un sentido de la buena voluntad y la conexión con la otra persona. Si usted comienza asintiendo con la cabeza durante una conversación, pero la otra persona no, esto a menudo implica que ellos no entienden, que no están de acuerdo o simplemente no les gusta usted o su tema de conversación.
 
Pruebe esto en su familia o amigos. Trate suavemente asintiendo durante su conversación y ver si la otra persona se mueve alternativamente. Hay una alta probabilidad de que los te gusta comenzará asintiendo, inconscientemente, a cambio. Por supuesto, no leer demasiado en esto - puede darse el caso de que la otra persona es muy consciente de sus propias acciones y no tiene tendencia a asentir con la cabeza. Del mismo modo, si una persona se utiliza para aparecer agradables, como los que trabajan en el servicio al cliente, es posible que también tienden a diferir a asentir en general.
 
Sin embargo, también hay que prestar atención a la velocidad y el ritmo general de el visto bueno. A, lento asentimiento gentil menudo se asocia a menudo con un fuerte acuerdo, sino también con un interés genuino en la conversación. Este gesto significa que la persona está disfrutando de la conversación y es feliz para que progrese, ya que es un paso natural.
 
A la inversa, un guiño rápido rápido, especialmente si se combina con adaptadores o cualquier tipo de inquietud es a menudo una señal de que la otra persona es impaciente. Puede que simplemente estar esperando su turno en la conversación o para que deje de marear la perdiz y hacer su punto.Este gesto no puede en realidad implica un acuerdo o compromiso, sino que los de intentar aplacar a usted hasta que consiguen su turno en la conversación.
 
En medio de estos dos movimientos de cabeza es un gesto más basada moderadamente. Este gesto es a menudo un poco más deliberado y concentrado. Se tiende a suponer que la otra persona está comprometida y tiene una buena voluntad y tratar de unir o enlazar con usted.
 
Por otra parte, también consideran si la gente que está asintiendo están mirando hacia ti o lejos de ti. Si están buscando lejos de ti. Si ellos no están mirando hacia usted, puede implicar la distracción y reforzar que simplemente están tratando de aplacar a usted. Alternativamente, puede significar que están pensando sus palabras. Las personas no mantienen el enfoque directo o contacto visual todo el tiempo, y puede ser que necesite un pequeño momento para digerir lo que está diciendo.
 
Ten en cuenta también, hacia arriba movimientos de cabeza. Arriba asiente pueden utilizarse para señalar el reconocimiento - a menudo se utilizan cuando una persona ve a otra persona. Ellos tienden a aparecer más informal y menos comprometidos, por lo que tienden a ser empleado por personas que deseen mostrar un distante.
 
Jefe Shake
Una sacudida de la cabeza de lado a lado por lo general indica que no. Sin embargo, hay variantes pequeños sobre cómo debe interpretarse. Un batido de cabeza rápida y regular implica desacuerdo fuerte y potente. Esto se utiliza en circunstancias en las que la persona no podría estar más en desacuerdo con lo que está diciendo.
 
Una cabeza muy lento, pero de ritmo sacudir a menudo tiende a implicar incredulidad. Esto se muestra en circunstancias en que la otra persona simplemente pura y simple no puede creer lo que se ha dicho. A menudo se asocia con la negación de lo que se ha dicho, aunque esto no es siempre el caso.
 
Un guiño de cabeza suave, pero inestable se asocia a menudo con la incomprensión. Piense en esto como la comunicación, 'no, yo no lo entiendo "más que un desacuerdo absoluto o incredulidad.
 
El punto importante a recaudar unos temblar la cabeza es que a menudo es sutil. Las personas tratan de evitar aparecer como una caricatura, lo que significa que tienden a restar importancia a estas señales de lenguaje corporal. Por lo tanto, usted necesita estar particularmente atentos al reconocer estas señales, especialmente si usted está tratando de convencer a la otra persona de algo.
 
Aversión
Un guiño cabeza puede implicar acuerdo o movimiento de cabeza puede implicar desacuerdo. Sin embargo, uno de los movimientos más dramáticos y más fuertes de cabeza es cuando la cabeza se apartó de la conversación o la otra persona por completo. Piense en cómo las personas pueden reaccionar cuando están disgustados - que a menudo se encorvan y se alejan de lo que les disgusta. Este es un tipo similar de movimiento.
 
A su vez, lejos completo es un movimiento muy frío, pero todavía tiene sus propias etapas. Girando la cabeza se entiende que es menos potente de girar todo el hombro de distancia. En cuanto a su entera hacia atrás a una persona es uno de los movimientos más fríos en total.
 
Al igual que con todos los movimientos de la lengua de cuerpo, esto puede ser mal interpretada por posiciones lenguaje corporal similares, que significan otras cosas. No es raro que alguien mira en la distancia cuando se está pensando en un tema de conversación - esto no es lo mismo que la aversión.
 
Sin embargo, si esto va acompañado de una falta de capacidad de respuesta en la conversación o un signo general de impaciencia, entonces esto implica una respuesta aversiva.
 
Vulnerabilidad y Dominación
Sólo con la cabeza, torso nuestra también una sección vulnerable del cuerpo, que contiene los órganos principales, tales como el corazón y los pulmones. Los mismos principios evolutivos que se aplican a nuestra cabeza, por lo tanto, se aplican también a nuestra torso que influye en nuestra lengua general del cuerpo. Cuando nos sentimos cómodos, seguros y confiados estamos encantados de exponer su torso y se incline hacia adelante.Del mismo modo, cuando nos sentimos inseguros o falta confianza nos escondemos el torso o protegerlo con nuestras armas.
 
Usted debe reconocer tales exhibiciones de las personas en su vida. Los jefes y otras personas en puestos de dirección también suelen adoptar posturas muy abiertos con de su torso sin obstáculos - una muestra de la confianza y la seguridad, incluso en el lugar de trabajo o situaciones estresantes.
 
Descansando en las manos en la cadera es otra muestra de la dominación.
 
Por el contrario, es común que los que están deprimidos o ansiosos de sentir la necesidad de ocultar.
 
Este lenguaje corporal también sin embargo se refiere a que sentimos dominante y en control de nuestra situación. Al dejar sus sectores vulnerables de su cuerpo expuestas, esto tiene un nivel extraño del poder. Esto implica que, aunque son vulnerables, nadie te atacará - que genera más confianza.
 
Se deriva de la suposición de que si hubiera un conflicto, usted gana. Por lo tanto no hay necesidad de proteger el cuerpo y las posiciones vulnerables son también los más dominante.
 
Aunque vivimos en un entorno mucho más sofisticado que el que hemos evolucionado a partir, todavía se aplican estos factores relacionados con la dominancia-simples.
 
Sin embargo, la vulnerabilidad no siempre se correlaciona con la dominación. A veces posiciones vulnerables también implican la intimidad y la confianza entre los dos individuos involucrados - que un ataque o una explotación de dichos no se producirá la vulnerabilidad (por lo tanto, está bien ser vulnerable).
 
Cuerpo sexual Idioma
Naturalmente, alteramos nuestro lenguaje corporal dependiendo de quién nos atrae y qué impresión que queremos dar a la gente del sexo opuesto.
 
La apertura o ampliación de las piernas a menudo muestra la atracción, o la confianza en una exhibición sexual, que es frecuente en hombres jóvenes.Por el contrario, cruzar las piernas o la celebración de las palmas de las manos sobre esta área muestra la vulnerabilidad, la inocencia y timidez.
 
Sin embargo, a menudo la forma abierta nuestras piernas son es más una cuestión de comodidad, especialmente en los días calurosos! Cuidado con las piernas están abiertas y una pantalla general de la región de la entrepierna junto con otras señales de dominio y confianza, especialmente en los hombres, si se quiere interpretar mayores niveles de significado.












Conclusión
El lenguaje corporal es fascinante. Proporciona una capa profunda de la comunicación entre dos personas, mostrando señales y signos que las palabras no pueden.
 
Todos queremos gestionar cómo se nos percibe a veces y lo que otros piensan de nosotros, sin embargo, somos susceptibles de ser "leer" a través de hábitos que no se les enseña a controlar. Por otra parte, queremos leer otras personas mejor, tanto para mejorar nuestras relaciones, sino también, a veces, por más propósitos egoístas. Lograr el respeto de sus colegas en el trabajo o que clavar argumento de venta requiere un conocimiento complejo del lenguaje corporal y cómo manipularla.
 
Sin embargo, lo más interesante de todo, es que la mayoría de nosotros ya tienen un fuerte sentido construida en el lenguaje corporal.

Manejando el estrés
El estrés es la sensación de estar abrumado por las responsabilidades o presión. Como concepto psicológico, el estrés se introdujo por primera vez en la década de 1950, con el término originalmente tomado de la física, donde se describe la cantidad de tensión puesta sobre un objeto.
 
La parte importante de la definición de estrés se siente abrumado. Muchas personas tienen grandes niveles de responsabilidad, pero sin embargo prosperan en situaciones difíciles o fiscales. El estrés es la clara sensación de ser empujado o tirado demasiado delgada y no se correlaciona directamente con el nivel de responsabilidad que puede tener, aunque la responsabilidad y la presión son a menudo factores.
 
El estrés tiene una gran variedad de síntomas. Se sabe que se puede aumentar la presión arterial y la frecuencia cardiaca, afectan a los patrones de sueño, producir una pérdida de apetito, destruir concentración y contribuir a una amplia gama de enfermedades mentales, como la depresión.
 
Cuando una persona se siente una sensación de estrés, el sistema hormonal del cuerpo entra en acción. El sistema nervioso libera un cóctel de hormonas, en especial de cortisol, que en conjunto a desencadenar la respuesta de lucha o huida ".
 
Para simplificar, el vuelo o luchar respuesta es una adaptación evolución que prepara al cuerpo para combatir el sea una amenaza ("lucha") o huir («vuelo»). En última instancia esto hace que el ritmo cardíaco para aumentar, la respiración para ser más rápido, así como una redirección del flujo sanguíneo hacia los músculos.Efectos más graves incluyen temblores, pérdida de la visión periférica y la constricción de los vasos sanguíneos. Todas estas respuestas están destinados a preparar el cuerpo para hacer frente a las amenazas o desafíos.
 
Mientras que la lucha o huida sistema es una adaptación fantástica que ayudaron a nuestros antepasados a hacer frente a un mundo duro y peligroso, que nos causa una serie de problemas en la sociedad moderna.
 
La gran mayoría de nosotros no vamos a tener que luchar hasta la muerte o huir de un depredador cuando experimentamos un factor de estrés. Más bien nuestros desafíos son comunes, pero crónica; la falta de dinero, cuestiones laborales, las cepas de relaciones interpersonales, otros deseos y aspiraciones, etc.
 
El problema es que nuestro vuelo y luchar respuesta puede desencadenar una reacción a estos mundano, pero no amenaza la vida problemas. Si esta respuesta activa con demasiada frecuencia, una alta cantidad de vuelo y luchar contra las hormonas se liberan, especialmente cortisol, en el cuerpo, produciendo la sensación psicológica de estrés.
 
Una vez que empiezas a entender que el estrés es una respuesta, los métodos en los que el estrés puede ser abordado el principio hasta se aclaran - reconocen lo que está causando la respuesta al estrés y manejar eso.
 
Cualquier cosa que cause una respuesta de estrés se llama un factor de estrés. La parte crucial de los factores estresantes es que pueden ser divididos en fisiológicosfactores estresantes y psicológicos factores estresantes.
 
Estresores fisiológicos son eventos que directamente ejercen presión sobre el cuerpo, tales como lesiones o temperaturas ambientales extremas.
 
Estresores psicológicos, sin embargo, son los eventos que se percibe como amenazante o desafiante. Dependiendo de la persona, esto puede incluir eventos realmente peligrosos (como ser asaltado o atacado) a los eventos que en realidad son inofensivos (como un comentario casual interpretado negativamente).
Por lo tanto para manejar el estrés, es necesario analizar tanto su proximidad a los factores de estrés y su percepción de ellos. Puede ser el caso de que usted tiene demasiados factores de estrés en su vida, en el que caso de que necesite recortar los eventos que están causando estrés.
 
Sin embargo, puede ser que usted está interpretando demasiados eventos manejables como los factores de estrés, en cuyo caso usted necesita para alterar las formas en que están percibiendo estos eventos.
 
Además, el estrés también puede ser gestionado mediante la adopción de un estilo de vida más saludable, que puede manejar las causas y síntomas de estrés fisiológico. Caminemos a través de cada una de estas soluciones al estrés, a su vez.
 
Estrés Reconociendo
Independientemente de si su problema de estrés surge del hecho de que está experimentando demasiados factores de estrés o que su percepción de ellos es demasiado negativo, el primer paso es reconocer lo que los factores de estrés que tiene.
 
Una de las mejores maneras de lograr esto es mantener un diario de cada momento del día en que se ha sentido bajo una tensión considerable. Es mejor si se mantiene esta revista lo más detallada posible, detallando no sólo la fecha, sino también el tiempo exacto que estabas siente estresado, la intensidad de la sensación de estrés y detalles relevantes, como las personas que estaban con o qué actividades eras obra.
 
 
Si te las arreglas para mantener un diario persistente es probable que darse cuenta de ciertos patrones de estrés. Puede darse el caso de que las interacciones con una persona en particular que usted está encontrando especialmente estresante, por ejemplo.
 
Además de llevar un diario, la participación en la atención plena es una técnica de reducción del estrés potente. Mindfulness se busca cada vez más como un antídoto a la sensación de estrés en sí, pero también es útil para aumentar el reconocimiento de los factores de estrés. Cuanto más consciente eres de tu vida día a día, la oportunidad más alto se da cuenta íntimamente las circunstancias en las que se sienta estresado (y por lo tanto tienen una mejor oportunidad de interpretar / gestión de estas circunstancias).
 
Mindfulness como un tema se tratará en el capítulo pensamiento negativo más adelante en este libro. Sin embargo tenga en cuenta que las instrucciones y consejos en relación con la atención plena en ese capítulo también se pueden aplicar para reducir el estrés.
 
En la misma línea, es importante entender lo que usted tiene hábitos que pueden ser mecanismos de supervivencia para el estrés que está experimentando. No todos los mecanismos de supervivencia son clasificados como poco saludable, pero muchos son. Métodos de afrontamiento comunes incluyen fumar, beber, uso de drogas o la ira de ventilación. Asegúrese de que usted no negocia maligno - estrés - por otro. Aprenda a reconocer sus reacciones a situaciones para analizar si sus tendencias poco saludables son de hecho una reacción a su estrés.
 
Cambio de Percepción Stressor - Terapia Cognitiva Conductual
La terapia cognitivo conductual (TCC o, para abreviar) es una de las terapias predominantes para hacer frente a una miríada de problemas cognitivos y problemas de salud mental, como el estrés, la ansiedad y los pensamientos negativos. Por lo tanto, cuando usted lee los capítulos posteriores, soportar esta sección sobre la TCC en mente.
 
TCC se basa en lo cognitivo enfoque en psicología. Para simplificar, el enfoque cognitivo es un marco que afirma que los pensamientos ("cogniciones") en coche comportamiento. Por lo tanto, si usted quiere cambiar su comportamiento, debe mirar los patrones de pensamiento subyacentes que impulsan ese comportamiento y cambiar esos. Por lo tanto, cognitivo-conductual terapia como el nombre de la aplicación de esta teoría.
 
TCC se hace generalmente con un terapeuta capacitado que le ayuda a identificar sistemáticamente y lógicamente sus patrones de pensamiento y las transforman en alternativas más productivos y exitosos.
 
Sin embargo, hay muchos recursos y guías que detallan el método y las técnicas que utiliza la TCC, que se puede emplear por sí mismo. Trate de leer un libro introductorio sobre el tema de la TCC para ver si se puede cambiar su percepción de estrés, especialmente los que no se puede evitar o de otra manera manejar.
Estilo de vida saludable
Es fácil pensar en un estilo de vida "saludable" como un término puramente física, sino que incluye nuestros hábitos que pueden producir estados positivos o negativos de la mente. Hay una gran variedad de formas en que puede mejorar su estilo de vida, lo que puede reducir indirectamente los sentimientos de estrés que pueda estar experimentando.
 
La primera y más común estilo de vida hábito es hacer ejercicio con regularidad. El ejercicio se define como cualquier tipo de actividad que se ejerce suficiente para producir un aumento en la frecuencia cardíaca y producir la sudoración. Por lo tanto, el ejercicio no se limita sólo al centro de gimnasia o deporte, sino también las actividades ordinarias, como caminar o limpiar la casa, siempre y cuando estas actividades son de una intensidad adecuada. Es recomendado por la mayoría de las autoridades de salud de hacer ejercicio durante al menos 150 minutos a la semana, sin embargo, la mayoría de nosotros recibir notablemente menos niveles de ejercicio que esto.
 
El ejercicio libera endorfinas, que son sustancias químicas del placer de su cuerpo. La sensación positiva puede contrarrestar la sensación psicológicamente negativo del estrés, pero los beneficios del ejercicio sobre el alivio del estrés puede ser más sutil. El ejercicio mejora la función cognitiva, hace que sea más fácil dormir y aumenta el estado de alerta y la atención. Es probable que cada uno de estos factores también contribuyen a la disminución de los niveles de estrés frecuente experiencia de los deportistas.
 
Técnicas de Gestión del Tiempo
Otra técnica es el estilo de vida para administrar su tiempo de manera más eficaz. Ya que el estrés es el resultado de sentimientos sobrecargados y abrumados por las responsabilidades y presiones, el aprendizaje de cómo organizar mejor su tiempo puede ayudarle a lograr más y por lo tanto a reducir el nivel de presión que experimenta.
 
El primer paso en aprender cómo mejorar su gestión del tiempo es para decidir sobre los objetivos con los que desea lograr. Comience por hacer una lista de los avances que se desea alcanzar - metas interpersonales, metas profesionales, pérdida de peso, una vida más sana, práctica hobby y así sucesivamente. Dar prioridad a cada uno de estos objetivos en función de lo importante que son para usted.
 
Usted puede darse cuenta de que se ha sentido estresado, o dedicar una cantidad desproporcionada de tiempo para alcanzar los objetivos que son, de hecho, no es tan importante para usted como usted percibe inicialmente. Si tiene varios objetivos, considerar si sería mejor lista corta de sus metas y hacer frente a los objetivos que se considere más pertinente primera.
 
Además de la fijación de metas, la toma de lista es otra técnica común de gestión del tiempo. Todo esto implica es simplemente escribir una lista de todas sus responsabilidades actuales de tareas pendientes. La mala gestión del tiempo es a menudo el resultado de no organizar, ya sea debido a olvidarse de la existencia de responsabilidades o no priorizar las responsabilidades más urgentes. Escribir una lista es a menudo todo lo que se necesita para evitar que cualquiera de estos percances que se produzcan.
 
Una de las técnicas de priorización es dividir todas sus tareas en los cuatro siguientes tipos:
1) Urgente y Importante
2) No es urgente, pero importante,
3) Urgente, pero no es importante
3) Ni urgente o importante
 
Naturalmente, una vez clasificado como tal, se hace evidente para centrarse en el logro de tareas urgentes y importantes primero, de las tareas que son ya sea urgente o importante, pero no ambos simultáneamente. Las tareas que no son ni urgentes ni importantes se pueden dejar a la última.
 
Conexiones sociales
Además de la gestión del tiempo adecuado, otra reducción del estrés es el apoyo social y la conexión. Los seres humanos son animales sociales y como una ley general, son más exitosos y más feliz cuando se sienten conectados y apreciado por los que están a nuestro alrededor.
 
A menudo, el estrés puede hacernos sentir como debemos aislarnos de los demás; sino que a menudo es más sabio para contrarrestar este impulso y pasar más tiempo con la gente. Trate de organizar o sacar provecho de situaciones donde se puede pasar el tiempo con amigos cercanos o familiares y decirles acerca de lo que está haciendo que se sienta estresado.
 
Ayudando a otros
Otra técnica de reducción del estrés implica ayudar a otras personas a través de la caridad, trabajo comunitario o incluso simples de buenos actos a las personas que te rodean. Las personas que practican regularmente para ayudar a conductas tienden a ser más felices, así como más resistentes al estrés. Esto se debe al hecho de que ayudar a otras personas, no sólo a nosotros mismos hace sentir mejor, pero también nos hace conscientes de los graves problemas y fiscales se enfrentan a otras personas. Si bien esto no es un motivo de felicidad en sí mismo, tiende a hacer que los problemas personales se sienten más dócil y manejable.
 
Del mismo modo, el establecimiento de un tiempo de lado por sí mismo es otra manera de reducir el estrés. Es fácil obsesionarse con el establecimiento de metas y logros, empujando a nosotros mismos para ir más allá y hacer más, olvidando el hecho de que todos tenemos un "tiempo para mí" en ocasiones poco.
 
El problema, como en la mayoría de las cosas, es lograr el equilibrio correcto. Parte de la solución a la asignación de suficiente tiempo de inactividad es utilizar el tiempo las técnicas de gestión antes mencionados. Del mismo modo, otra técnica popular es decidir sobre uno o dos días por semana, que después del trabajo, son puramente día de relajación y disfrute. El poder de decidir estrictamente uno o dos días por semana en el que se permite que relajarse es que se puede disfrutar de que la relajación libre de culpa.
 
Por el contrario, muchas personas que tratan de mezclar en tiempo de relajación entre los tiempos asignados para el establecimiento de objetivos y la lucha de los logros de disfrutar de la primera, sin la sensación de que deben estar haciendo algo productivo. El descanso y la relajación es productivo - en la moderación!












Superar la ansiedad
La ansiedad es un sentimiento de preocupación, temor o miedo que varía en intensidad, desde simplemente incómodo emocionalmente agobiante. La ansiedad es una emoción humana normal en respuesta a eventos en los que el resultado es importante, pero desconocido. Sin embargo, muchas personas sufren de la sensación de ansiedad en respuesta a los acontecimientos cotidianos que los demás no considerarían la ansiedad-inducción, lo que lleva a niveles desproporcionados de ansiedad.
 
La ansiedad es un síntoma y causa de muchos otros problemas de salud mental, como los ataques de pánico, fobias y ansiedad social. Sin embargo, la ansiedad puede ser reconocido como una condición por sí mismo, que se denomina trastorno de ansiedad generalizada. Este capítulo trata de reconocer los signos y síntomas de la ansiedad y la gestión de los mismos.
 
La distinción entre el trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y ansiedad normal se caracteriza por la base racional de la ansiedad que sentía, su frecuencia, así como su impacto en el funcionamiento cotidiano de la persona involucrada. Por ejemplo, se considera normal sentirse ansioso cuando está sentado un examen importante para la universidad o la espera en un hospital por los resultados de un examen médico importante.
 
Sin embargo, la sensación de ansiedad por salir de la casa o ir a trabajar son, en la mayoría de los casos, sin fundamento y las respuestas de ansiedad irracionales.Además, sensación de ansiedad cada vez que salga de la casa o ir a trabajar afectará las actividades normales del día a día de la persona con la ansiedad, por lo tanto, hacer un diagnóstico de trastorno de ansiedad generalizada más apropiado.
 
Independientemente de si la ansiedad se experimenta como una sensación o como un problema de salud mental, que puede ser abordado y se reduce a través de diversos métodos.
 
Estilo de vida saludable
El primero de estos métodos es la adopción de un estilo de vida saludable. Aunque puede haber otros factores involucrados, la experiencia fisiológica de ansiedad puede ser activado o influenciada por una variedad de factores físicos y emocionales relacionados con la forma en que vives.
 
La falta de higiene del sueño y la falta de sueño puede conducir a una mayor frecuencia de pensamientos negativos, que puede convertirse en ansiedad o empeorar la condición. Varios estimulantes como la nicotina, el azúcar, el alcohol y la cafeína también pueden inducir el estrés y el esfuerzo físico, que también puede hacer que una persona sea más susceptible a los ataques de ansiedad y pánico.
 
Del mismo modo, las endorfinas liberadas durante el ejercicio pueden combatir los sentimientos de ansiedad y reducir los contribuyentes fisiológicas.
Técnicas de respiración
Durante los episodios de ansiedad o ataques de pánico, la respiración puede empezar a ser poco profunda y rápida. Esto se debe a que de una manera similar a nuestra respuesta al estrés, la ansiedad puede desencadenar lucha o huida respuesta de nuestro cuerpo. De hecho, los ataques de pánico (comúnmente asociada con la ansiedad) se interpretan como una pelea fuerte o respuesta de vuelo inconscientemente activado, sin un estímulo apropiado.
 
Lo que distingue a un ataque de pánico de una lucha o huida respuesta habitual es que la persona que experimenta la respuesta comienza a entrar en pánico, centrando su atención en las sensaciones corporales, tensando el cuerpo y la liberación de adrenalina que intensifica los síntomas.
 
No obstante, una de las respuestas de lucha o huida es preparar a los pulmones por más actividad - de ahí rápido, pero respiraciones superficiales. Debido a esto, es importante aprender técnicas de respiración que permítanse respirar profundamente y con calma, para contrarrestar este efecto. Además, las técnicas de respiración profunda son un método de relajación fantástico, que le puede dar una mente más tranquila, lo que ayuda a hacer frente a sus ansiedades más directamente.
 
Para practicar la respiración profunda, encontrar tiempo durante el día en que usted sabe que no será interrumpido. Asegúrese de que usted está usando ropa suelta para que no se obstruyan sus ritmos respiratorios. Por último, también tratar de hacer que el área lo más silencioso posible. Esto implica la selección de un período de calma del día (por ejemplo, por la mañana temprano o tarde en la noche), donde han pasado los sonidos del día, sino que también reduce el ruido ambiente apagando los aparatos eléctricos.
 
Descanse en una posición cómoda. Esto puede implicar acostado en una cama (o en el suelo), sentado en un firme pero cómoda silla o sentado con las piernas cruzadas. Es importante que usted se sienta cómodo, pero también es necesario que se quede despierto. Si usted sospecha que usted puede ser que la deriva, que lo mejor es sentarse en una silla en lugar de estar acostado.
 
Con esta preparación finalizado, ahora puede comenzar a centrarse en la respiración. La clave para la respiración profunda es respirar desde el diafragma (estómago inferior) en lugar del pecho. Cuando usted está respirando profundamente, usted debería ser capaz de descansar la mano sobre el ombligo y sentir esa zona se expanden y contraen mientras inhala y exhala.
 
Comience respirando, lentamente, a través de la nariz, los pulmones máxima capacidad - inhalar, hasta que no pueda respirar más.
 
Luego, suavemente, exhala, a través de la boca, liberando todo el aire hasta que sus pulmones están vacíos.
 
Es mejor si usted respira y hacia el exterior junto con un recuento de número. Al inspirar, cuenta 1 ... 2 ... 3 de contar 1 ... 2 ... 3 al exhalar.
 
Continuar la respiración hasta que empiece a sentirse relajado. Si usted lucha de ansiedad (o si usted lucha para relajarse) usted debe practicar esta técnica de respiración diaria, durante al menos cinco minutos.
 
No se asuste o se preocupe si no surgen de inmediato la sensación de calma y relajación. Para la gente que se siente estresado o ansioso, la respiración puede 'enganchar' o la lucha a fluir suavemente. Sin embargo, si continúa con la respiración enfocada, controlada esta tendencia se disipará gradualmente y la respiración debe convertirse agradable.
 
Esta forma de respiración relajada controlada también puede ser utilizado en la situación en la que se siente ansioso. Aunque es poco probable que usted puede sentarse y apague todas las distracciones que rodean, aún puede tomar períodos oportunistas 3-5 minutos durante el día para respirar y calmarse.
 
Muscle Técnica de Relajación
Una técnica similar a la técnica de respiración, es la técnica de relajación muscular que está diseñado para ayudarle a relajarse. Al practicar la técnica a lo largo de días, semanas y meses, la relajación prolongada experimenta gradualmente le ayuda a combatir la ansiedad.
 
La técnica de relajación muscular lleva más tiempo que la técnica de respiración; usted necesitará por lo menos 15-20 minutos de soledad y tranquilidad para practicar. Al igual que con la técnica de respiración, asegúrese de que ha reducido el ruido ambiente para que pueda concentrarse plenamente.
 
Comience por sentarse o acostarse cómodamente y la práctica de unos momentos de respiración profunda para despertar su atención. A continuación, dirigir su atención hacia su pie izquierdo. Estire el pie por contraer y relajar sus músculos. Mantenga la contracción muscular durante 3-5 segundos antes de la liberación.Mantén tu atención en las sensaciones que surgen. Luego relaje los músculos de su pie y se centran en la sensación de un pequeño momento.
 
Mover hacia arriba en su pantorrilla izquierda y estirar y relajar este músculo también. Continuar trabajando hacia arriba hasta el muslo, abdomen, hombros, el cuello y los músculos faciales, contraer y relajar cada uno de estos músculos a su vez.
 
Cuando haya llegado a la corona de la cabeza, su forma de trabajo por el lado derecho de su cuerpo, contrayendo progresivamente y la liberación de los músculos de su cara todo el camino hasta el pie derecho. Asegúrese de que su atención sigue centrada en cada músculo que se contrae y se relaja.
 
Después de haber terminado la relajación muscular progresiva, pasar unos momentos acostado o sentado con los ojos cerrados, experimentando las sensaciones que surgen dentro de su cuerpo. Una vez que te apetece es apropiado hacerlo, suavemente aumentando y acabado.
 
Es importante tener en cuenta que puede requerir varios períodos de relajación muscular antes de que la sensación de profunda relajación surge. Por lo tanto es importante tratar de practicar esta técnica por lo menos 2-3 veces a la semana (de preferencia todos los días).
 
Reorientación de Atención
Otra técnica de reducción de la ansiedad es redirigir su atención lejos de los pensamientos de ansiedad. Esto suena intuitivo, pero en general se considera que la ansiedad sufre experimentan sus síntomas en parte debido a una incapacidad para redirigir la atención de las / los patrones de pensamiento negativos de ansiedad y hacia otros estímulos.
 
La próxima vez que sientas ansiedad, en lugar de centrarse en sus pensamientos y sentimientos como ocurre la ansiedad, tratar de centrarse en un estímulo en su entorno. Esto podría ser potencialmente nada, a pesar de los estímulos asociados positivamente tienen más éxito. Trate de dirigir más de su atención hacia su trabajo, o incluso una imagen o sonido capturar particularmente fuerte (como la flor o la música).
 
Del mismo modo, es importante no sobre-analizar o interpretar su ansiedad demasiado profundamente. Muchas víctimas de la ansiedad luchan por el hecho de que ellos interpretan su ansiedad como indicativo de la situación en cuestión. Para aclarar con un ejemplo, si alguien se siente preocupado por su rendimiento en el trabajo o la escuela, pueden interpretar que la ansiedad como una señal de que están fallando o no pueden hacer frente a la situación. Si habitan en esta interpretación de su ansiedad, estas personas a menudo se paralizan o experimentan mayores dificultades cuando se enfrentan a estas situaciones en el futuro.
 
Ansiedad 'Período'
Para las personas con trastorno de ansiedad generalizada, o ansiedad crónica sufre en general, que puede ser difícil de hacer frente a la disonancia entre lo que sienten y lo mucho que otras personas les dicen que relajarse y reorientar su enfoque.
 
Para resolver este problema y ofrecer una solución de compromiso entre la necesidad de la preocupación y la ansiedad proceso y la necesidad de funcionar un poco de ansiedad que sufren han adoptado el "período" ansiedad.
 
Este período es un tiempo designado durante el día o la semana (dependiendo de la frecuencia de una víctima se siente lo necesitan), donde te permites ser ansioso.Para una o dos horas simplemente permite que sus preocupaciones y temores de estar presente, sin tratar de alejarlos. Durante este tiempo se tiene en cuenta y reflexionar sobre sus ansiedades en la forma que le parezca apropiada. La fuerza del "período de ansiedad 'es que permite que seas ansioso sin sentir culpabilidad o la necesidad de mejorar el mismo.
 
El período de ansiedad sólo funciona, sin embargo, si usted pospone y retrasar todos sus pensamientos de ansiedad y sentimientos durante el día. Si un pensamiento de ansiedad se produce durante el día, debe decirse a sí mismo que va a meditar y reflexionar sobre el pensamiento durante su período de ansiedad y luego continuar con lo que estaba haciendo.
 
Puede ser beneficioso para anotar sus preocupaciones, a medida que ocurren, en una lista. De esta manera usted puede asegurarse de procesar y hacer frente a todas las inquietudes que se han manifestado durante el día.
 
Creación de un período de ansiedad ayuda a lidiar con su vida, momento a momento, sin estar constantemente ser distraído por ansiedades durante el día.
 
Además, al deliberar la creación de un espacio y tiempo para reflexionar sobre sus inquietudes, a menudo puede acercarse a ellos de una manera más tranquila, más sistemática que en el momento en que se producen. Finalmente mediante el desarrollo de la disciplina y la habilidad de posponer sus ansiedades a una fecha posterior, también le ayuda a descubrir que en realidad tiene más control sobre sus pensamientos y sentimientos que usted puede ser que en un principio se esperaba.
 
Peor Contemplación Resultado
La ansiedad a menudo surgen debido al miedo o la esperanza de que surja un resultado negativo a un evento o circunstancia. Por ejemplo, si usted está ansioso porque usted tiene que dar una presentación, es probable ansiosa porque tienes miedo que te pueden tartamudear o avergonzar a sí mismo durante la presentación (o algún otro percance).
Tal vez contra-intuitivamente cierta ansiedad sufre puede manejar su ansiedad al contemplar el peor resultado posible para el evento o circunstancia que puedan estar preocupados por. En la inmensa mayoría de los casos, el nivel de ansiedad siente es desproporcionada en relación con el resultado posible peor real que podría ocurrir. Por ejemplo, en el escenario de la presentación, incluso si usted no avergonzar a ti mismo, esto no es algo de lo que realmente preocupa.
 
La mayoría de las personas en la audiencia es probable que simpatizan, habiendo sido o sentían lo mismo de sus propias experiencias. Del mismo modo, la mayoría de la gente se olvidará o no pueden prestar suficiente atención a la presentación de cualquier vergüenza que sientes incluso ser memorable.
 
Aunque la presentación afecta sus calificaciones o lugar de trabajo, es probable que tenga otras oportunidades y maneras de alcanzar el éxito, mostrar competencia y compensar una mala presentación.
 
En última instancia, siguiendo su ansiedad a la peor situación posible que puede ocurrir, en realidad se puede calmarse. Por darse cuenta de que la peor situación posible es, de hecho, más manso, usted puede acercarse a cualquier problema que se enfrentan con un vigor renovado.
 
Exposición
La ansiedad tiende a promover conductas de evitación. Si estamos preocupados por algo, es típico para tratar de evitar la situación o evento que hace que esta ansiedad, a menos que tenemos que hacerlo. Para las personas que sufren de ansiedad relativamente poca frecuencia, o personas cuyas circunstancias forzar a sí mismos para hacer frente a sus ansiedades, esto no supone necesariamente un problema.
 
Sin embargo, para la ansiedad crónica sufre, usted simplemente no puede florecer en la vida si se evita y volver a bajar todas las circunstancias y los acontecimientos que le hacen sentirse ansioso. Más bien, es necesario exponer lentamente a ti mismo a estas situaciones y eventos para aprender a lidiar con ellos poco a poco.
 
No hay necesidad de sumergirse a sí mismo en la parte profunda sin embargo. Si usted tiene varias inquietudes, hacer una lista de sus ansiedades y todas las acciones y eventos relacionados con ellos. Ordene las acciones y eventos de lo que te hace sentir menos ansiosos por lo que te hace sentir más ansioso.
 
Al hacer esto, usted ha proporcionado un repertorio de actividades para realizar, para aclimatarse a la ansiedad. Comience por intentar o hacer las actividades que le hacen menos ansiosa (la que no está haciendo).
 
A ver si puedes hacer 2-3 de estas actividades por semana. Luego, al término de estas actividades, usted puede trabajar su camino sobre las actividades que te hacen sentir más ansioso. Semana a semana, un paso a la vez, se puede subir todo el camino hasta las actividades que le hacen sentirse más ansioso. En el transcurso de completar estas actividades, que crecerá en la confianza y, finalmente, llegar a un acuerdo con las ansiedades que usted siente, haciendo que se disuelven de manera tangible.
 
Incluso si su ansiedad surge en torno a sólo una acción o evento en particular, ver si se puede aclimatarse poco a poco a ti mismo a esta ansiedad. Utilizando el ejemplo antes mencionado, tal vez usted es consciente de que usted tiene miedo de hablar en público. Unirse a un grupo de hablar en público y tomando sobre sí mismo para encontrar lentamente oportunidades de hablar en público es una de las mejores maneras de abordar directamente este miedo, en sus propios términos.
 
Acepte Imperfección
La ansiedad se presenta a menudo debido a las expectativas poco realistas que una persona puede mantener a sí mismos a. Una persona ansiosa a menudo se siente la necesidad de no sólo tener éxito, pero tienen un gran éxito. Del mismo modo, cualquier defecto o percance se interpreta un fallo grave.
Por el contrario, la gente confía y exitosos acomodar defectos y errores en sus vidas. Utilizando el ejemplo del pubis hablando en curso, los mejores oradores públicos saben cómo convertir errores que cometen durante su discurso o presentación en activos, a menudo mediante la improvisación en torno a estos errores o utilizarlos como una oportunidad para introducir el humor.
 
Del mismo modo, los buenos oradores no permiten estos errores para ponerse en el camino de su presentación general o mensaje - anticipan que pueden ocurrir, y los aceptan cuando lo hacen. Nadie es perfecto, así que permítase sus propios errores y contratiempos. Si endosa un estándar realista, usted no conseguirá colgado sobre los errores que inevitablemente sucederá en tu vida.












Conquistando el pensamiento negativo
El pensamiento negativo es un término general para una serie de comportamientos cognitivos que puede ser interpretada como no beneficioso. El pensamiento negativo es a menudo coloquialmente interpretarse como pensamientos que son negativos, como centrarse en las fallas, cortos idas o emociones negativas.
 
Sin embargo, el término también puede incluir otros tipos de pensamiento, tales como pensamientos intrusivos (pensamientos que se producen sin el deseo de hacerlo). El pensamiento negativo se asocia ocasionalmente con "distorsiones cognitivas", el término que describe los patrones que erróneamente reflejan la realidad de pensamiento (por lo general con una implicación negativa).
 
En este capítulo se ocupará de los tipos de pensamiento y soluciones para la gestión de los negativos.
 
Reconociendo Pensamiento Negativo
La esencia de la gestión de pensamiento negativo es reconocer cuando los pensamientos negativos se están produciendo y luego contra-balancear los pensamientos negativos con los hábitos de pensamiento más realistas o positivos.
 
El problema de esta solución es que las personas que tienen unas tendencias de pensamiento negativos tienden a ser ignorante acerca de sus propios patrones de pensamiento. Ellos se dan cuenta de que ellos piensan negativamente, pero ser conscientes de cómo este pensamiento negativo realidad manifiesta (más allá de un pesimismo generalizado). Aún más extrema, muchos pensadores negativos no reconocen que en realidad son culpables de pensamiento negativo, para empezar.Estos individuos tienden a interpretar sus pensamientos negativos como siendo exacto y pueden o bien piensan que sus patrones de pensamiento son los mismos que todos los demás, o que todo el mundo está viendo el mundo a través de lentes color de rosa.
 
Por lo tanto, la siguiente sección cubrirá varios tipos de distorsiones cognitivas, con un enfoque en cómo estas distorsiones cognitivas interaccionan con los hábitos de pensamiento negativo. El resultado de esta exploración debe permitir a reconocer estos patrones de pensamiento negativo, que debe ocurrir en sí mismo o alguien que usted conoce.
 
Todo o Nada Pensando
Esta es una tendencia a pensar en las cosas en absolutos. Situaciones o eventos deben ser enteramente positivo o totalmente negativa; no hay casos ambiguos o mixtos. Sin embargo, rara vez en la vida son las circunstancias así lo dicotómicos.
 
Como la mayoría de las situaciones o acontecimientos tienen aspectos positivos y negativos, todo o nada el pensamiento tiende a producir una cantidad desproporcionada de eventos / situaciones que se interpretan como negativo.
Todo o nada pensando lo tanto a menudo empeora los patrones de pensamiento negativo y puede ser un factor en el desarrollo de la depresión.
 
Para superar todo o nada pensar, considerar sus evaluaciones del mundo que te rodea con más matices. Por ejemplo, si normalmente tiene pensamientos tales como "fracaso en todo lo que hago" o "todo lo que me rodea es malo 'entonces puede ser culpable de todo o nada el pensamiento. Nadie falla en todo lo que hacen y tampoco las personas experimentan situaciones donde todas las cosas son malas.
 
Es importante para contrarrestar todo o nada pensamientos con una interpretación más realista. Por ejemplo, en los dos casos anteriores, un patrón de pensamiento más equilibrada implicaría reforzar y recordar eventos donde tienes éxito o los aspectos agradables de la vida.
 
El exceso de generalización
Este patrón de pensamiento negativo es la tendencia a desarrollar una generalización a partir limitado, y con frecuencia defectuoso, pruebas. Una persona que overgeneralizes podría pensar que una persona es una persona mala basado en una reunión, o que nunca se puede disfrutar de una nueva experiencia, si la primera vez que lo intentan, no lo disfruto.
 
Por encima y más allá de la falacia lógica que la sobre-generalización menudo conlleva, también típicamente resulta en un mayor nivel de interpretación negativa, especialmente para las personas que son susceptibles a la ansiedad o la depresión.
 
Etiquetado
Esta tendencia es similar a la sobre-generalización. El etiquetado es la costumbre de aplicar etiquetas a las personas, en lugar de interpretar los acontecimientos o acciones como temporal o externo. Por ejemplo, si alguien no es particularmente hablador, un "etiquetadora" puede interpretar esa persona como aburrido o introvertido en lugar de interpretar que no se sienten bien o que están cansados.
 
Etiquetado surge de la interpretación de la evidencia como permanentes y externa en lugar de temporal y externo. Utilizando el ejemplo antes mencionado, estar cansado o no se siente bien son dos factores temporales externos. Ellos no están relacionados con la personalidad o el carácter de la persona en cuestión ("externo"), sino más bien un factor transitorio moderar su comportamiento ("temporal").
 
Etiquetado interactúa con el pensamiento negativo, porque los pensadores negativos a menudo etiquetan a sí mismos de manera negativa. Un pensador negativo que falla una prueba de la interprete a sí mismos como estúpidos, en vez de darse cuenta de que estaban distraídos durante la prueba o que no estudiaron lo suficiente.
 
El resultado es que los problemas o eventos que deben ser vistos como cambiante o pequeños parecen estar represar acerca de su carácter. Si usted no estudia lo suficiente para una prueba, por ejemplo, esto se puede mejorar mediante el estudio más duro o más eficiente en el futuro. Si se interpreta a sí mismo como estúpidos o sin embargo aburrido, esto implica un problema que no puede necesariamente ser resuelto (por lo tanto conduce a estados más negativos de la mente y los patrones de pensamiento negativo).
 
Por lo tanto, cada vez que se etiquete a sí mismo oa los demás, en el futuro, pensador o no negativo, considere las dimensiones temporales y permanentes interno-externos de etiquetado. Cuando se considera conscientemente, es probable que usted verá que muchos comportamientos y atributos que percibir es, de hecho, temporal y externo, en lugar de permanente e interno.
 
Filtración
El filtrado es el término aplicado a los patrones de pensamiento en que una persona se centra exclusivamente en los aspectos negativos de la situación. Las personas que filtran sus pensamientos podrían centrarse excesivamente en el aspecto negativo uno de una experiencia de otro modo agradable y siempre extinguir pensamientos positivos con un mayor, el pensamiento negativo. Por ejemplo, una persona que filtra podría detenerse en el hecho de que se hizo una mala primera impresión de alguien que no habían visto antes, ignorando el hecho de que el resto de sus días fue fantástico.
 
Razonamiento emocional
Este patrón de pensamiento es la tendencia a creer que las emociones negativas se sintieron refleja la realidad de una situación. Por ejemplo, si alguien se siente como si fueran estúpidos en una situación, ellos creen que otras personas van a interpretarlos como estúpido, independientemente de sus pantallas reales de la inteligencia y la competencia.
 
Mind Reading
Este patrón de pensamiento se refiere a la tendencia a suponer que usted sabe o no entiende lo que otra persona está pensando. En términos de pensamiento negativo, esto por lo general implica la presunción de que otras personas están sosteniendo una percepción negativa de usted o sus acciones.
 
A menudo, esta percepción es errónea. Las personas que son 'lectores de la mente' tienen la costumbre de recoger en las señales corporales menores o ambiguas y creer que estas señales son relevantes para ellos. Así, por ejemplo, una persona con lectura de la mente pensaba hábitos podrían percibir un bostezo como un signo de falta de interés en su tema de la conversión (por lo tanto, reduciendo su confianza en sí mismo), cuando en realidad es sólo un indicador de que la otra persona es privado de sueño.
Ampliación / Reducción al mínimo
Ampliación y reducción al mínimo es el hábito del pensamiento de exagerar los pensamientos negativos y bajo enfatizando pensamientos negativos, respectivamente. Cuando una persona aumenta, pueden percibir un problema trivial o suceso como una tragedia completo soplado y cuando se minimizan pueden desacreditar o ignorar su propio éxito o logros.
 
Las personas deprimidas tienen una tendencia de mostrar un patrón inverso en lo que respecta a otras personas. Para aclarar, las personas deprimidas suelen magnificar el éxito de otras personas y minimizar sus fracasos. El resultado es una percepción relativamente sesgada de sí mismos en contra de otras personas, lo que probablemente tanto una causa como síntoma de depresión.
 
Personalización
La personalización es la tendencia a tomar la culpa y la culpa por una circunstancia o un evento que está fuera de control. Por ejemplo, si una conversación se seca, como las conversaciones de vez en cuando lo hacen, un pensador negativo podría atribuir esto a sí mismos. Esta persona podría pensar que son aburridos o no tienen las habilidades sociales debido a la conversación termina.
 
Del mismo modo, si un accidente ocurre en el país y un miembro de la familia daña a sí mismos, un pensador negativo que personaliza evento podría creer que el accidente es su culpa y que se podría haber evitado si hubieran estado allí.
 
Culpar
Por el contrario, en lugar de tomar la responsabilidad sobre sí mismos, es posible que tenga una tendencia a culpar a otros por las circunstancias negativas. Culpar a los demás pueden generar mala voluntad hacia las personas que te rodean, pero también pueden inducir una sensación de impotencia y falta de control. Si otra persona es la causa de las cosas negativas o sentimientos que te pasan, de su capacidad para manejar estos sentimientos o eventos es limitado. Sin embargo, la aceptación de la culpa o responsabilidad corresponda a ti mismo el poder para hacer un cambio positivo, en su caso.
 
Culpar a menudo se atribuye a cómo una persona se siente. Para aclarar, es posible culpar a alguien por el hecho de que usted está enojado o triste, en lugar de culpar a alguien por romper un cristal o tales. Culpar a menudo se asocia con el pensamiento de que el estado emocional que sientes es ya sea deliberada e intencionalmente causado por las personas que te rodean, o causado por un cierto grado de negligencia. Es posible interpretar que los demás tienen la responsabilidad de asegurar que sienta una cierta manera, y que su estado emocional negativo se debe a una falta de atención que requiere.
 
Darse cuenta de que las relaciones interpersonales se complican. Muchos desaires y contratiempos entre la gente es puramente accidental. Además, como una persona que necesita para aceptar un alto grado de propiedad de sus propias emociones. Otros pueden influir en cómo te sientes, pero en última instancia, sólo usted realmente puede controlar su respuesta a un evento.
 
Mindfulness y Meditación
Ahora que usted está enterado de algunos de los patrones de pensamiento negativos que podría estar visualizas, el siguiente paso en la lucha contra estos patrones es ser consciente. La vida es la imposición y de distracción y muchos de nosotros caer en la trampa de actuar y de pensar en 'piloto automático'.
 
No nos damos cuenta conscientemente e interpretar nuestras acciones o pensamientos, que pueden conducir a una variedad de problemas. En el caso de los pensadores negativos, la falta de atención plena significa que sus pensamientos negativos queden sin respuesta, por lo que persisten. El aumento de su atención le permite aplicar los conocimientos en los apartados anteriores cuando reconozca sus patrones de pensamiento son negativos.
 
Un método popular para aumentar la atención es la meditación consciente. Aunque hay varios objetos potenciales de esta meditación, el más utilizado es el aliento.A diferencia de la técnica de la respiración profunda se mencionó anteriormente, una meditación en la respiración se basa en la observación de la respiración, en lugar de controlarla.
 
Para iniciar una meditación en la respiración, asegúrese de que tiene al menos 15 minutos de tiempo en el que sabe que no será interrumpido. Del mismo modo, reducir y eliminar el ruido ambiente apagando los aparatos eléctricos y retirar los objetos que producen ruido.
 
Para la meditación es mejor si usted o sentarse en una silla o se sienta en una posición de medio loto (un tipo de posición de piernas cruzadas en un pie descansa sobre el muslo opuesto y el otro pie se apoya en el suelo). Acostarse tiende a promover un cierto grado de somnolencia, contrarrestando el propósito mismo de la atención plena meditación.
 
Con todos los preparativos establecidos, empezar a centrarse en la respiración. Como antes se ha mencionado, usted no quiere exhibir el control deliberado de la respiración, en lugar usted debe tratar de centrarse en el patrón de respiración natural y sin ayuda.
 
Si queda distraído por pensamientos (que es casi seguro que) traen su atención de nuevo a su patrón de respiración natural. Al empezar a meditar, es probable que se dará cuenta de cuán ocupado y distraído su mente en realidad es; muchas personas encuentran que apenas pueden concentrarse en la respiración en absoluto antes de que se distraen por un pensamiento que le viene a la cabeza.
 
Esto es normal. No se desanime o desalentado si esto le sucede a usted. Más bien, suavemente y con calma traer su atención de nuevo hacia la respiración. Es importante ser ecuanimidad sin prejuicios y la pantalla; no reprender a ti mismo o estar enojado con usted mismo cuando su mente divaga. En su lugar, sólo se centran, una vez más, sin ningún tipo de comentario mental. Con el tiempo, usted será capaz de concentrarse en la respiración con un enfoque más profundo y experimentar menos interrupciones de los pensamientos descarriados. Felicitaciones - su atención está desarrollando!
 
Como un principiante a la meditación consciente, no hay necesidad de practicar durante más de 15 minutos al día. Para la mayoría de los novatos, nada más que esto puede sentirse más abrumador y puede ser incómodo para sentarse por períodos más largos de tiempo.
 
Sin embargo, a medida que continúe a meditar, es posible que desee ampliar gradualmente sus sesiones de meditación. No es desconocida para los practicantes de meditación avanzada para meditar durante horas a la vez, pero la mayoría de la gente encuentra que un período de 30-45 minutos produce un cambio notable en la atención plena (así como una mayor cantidad de la paz interior, la relajación y otros beneficios mentales).
 
Cuando persistentemente practicado la meditación consciente debería ayudar a estar más alerta y más consciente durante su vida del día a día. Esto a su vez debería ayudarle a reconocer sus patrones de pensamiento actuales, lo que le permite a alejarse de los patrones de pensamiento negativo por completo.
 
La atención plena también puede ser cultivada por tratar de estar atentos durante las tareas cotidianas. Es fácil entrar en un modo de piloto automático durante las actividades repetitivas o aburridas que hacemos todos los días - como nuestro trabajo, limpiar, cocinar, comer, caminar, etc.
 
En lugar de permitir que su mente divague durante estas actividades, trate de participar con ellos en un nivel más íntimo. Sienta todas las sensaciones físicas de sus músculos mientras se lava y limpia y llevar a cabo esa actividad a la medida de su capacidad - se centra en toda la mugre y la suciedad que vaya a extraer. Cuando entras en algún lugar, ser conscientes de que el ritmo y la sensación del pie, así como los sonidos, olores y sensaciones del mundo que te rodea.
 
Este mayor nivel de atención tiene dos ventajas. En primer lugar, ser consciente de la acción cotidiana da tu mente menos espacio y oportunidad a la deriva en los territorios de pensamiento negativos. En lugar de insistir en los problemas de ayer o de mañana sólo tiene que concentrarse en lo que está sucediendo en este momento en el tiempo.
 
Del mismo modo, estando presente en el momento actual puede tener cualidades edificantes de su propio acuerdo. La atención se está buscando cada vez más como un método para eliminar la depresión y sus efectos positivos están bien documentados.












Conclusión
La salud mental no es algo que se debe pasar por alto. Si usted se siente estresado, ansioso o que son conscientes de que sus patrones de pensamiento negativos son perjudiciales para su vida, usted necesita tomar acción. Para la mayoría de nosotros, sólo se necesita una pequeña cantidad de conocimiento y la disciplina para aplicar algunas técnicas que pueden mejorar drásticamente nuestro estado de ánimo.
 
Este libro le ha proporcionado un surtido de esas técnicas. En el primer capítulo se enteró de estrés y su definición como la sensación de estar abrumado por la presión y responsabilidades. Se les enseñó acerca de la lucha o la huida de respuesta y los factores de estrés, tanto fisiológicas como psicológicas. Por último que aprendió técnicas para limitar su exposición a los factores de estrés y cambiar su percepción de ellos.
 
En el segundo capítulo, se les dio un deteriorado de la ansiedad desde una perspectiva psicológica. Se te dijo acerca de la importancia de un estilo de vida saludable y la tutela dada en diversas técnicas de relajación y manejo de la ansiedad, tales como la respiración profunda y el período de ansiedad.
 
Por último, en el tercer capítulo de hacer frente a los pensamientos negativos. Ha aprendido negativo pensamiento surge de distorsiones cognitivas y los diversos tipos de estas distorsiones, como 'todo o nada el pensamiento' y etiquetado. Por último, se les enseñó a cultivar la atención plena y reconocer patrones de pensamiento negativo, con el fin de cambiarlos.

Introducción
Nuestra supervivencia continuada a menudo se da por sentado. Cuando ocurre un desastre que se ven obligados a asumir la responsabilidad de nuestra propia supervivencia - para encontrar nuestros propios recursos y mantenernos con vida. Sería una apuesta segura a apostar que la mayoría de las personas no se preparan para lo peor, o enseñar a sí mismos para hacer frente a la adversidad que plantea peligros potenciales.
 
En la mayoría de los aspectos y ámbitos de nuestra vida, se considera sensible y adultos para planificar el futuro. Las personas construyen cuidadosamente los planes financieros de cinco años. Parejas considerar al que les gustaría tener hijos y ahorrar dinero para sus pensiones. Incluso como un niño y un adolescente debe pensar en lo que los sujetos es posible que desee aprender y qué carrera es posible que desee llevar a cabo. Sin embargo, el más importante y fundamental de todas las futuras preparaciones - las competencias y los artículos que garantizan nuestra supervivencia en caso de un desastre fueron a la huelga, se dejan lamentablemente descuidado por casi todo el mundo. Un Prepper, sin embargo, no piensa igual que el resto de la población - que saben que es sabio aprender estas habilidades que otras personas no tendrá en cuenta tampoco. No se trata de sobrevivir a un apocalipsis zombie, o la creación de un búnker secreto, pero reconociendo la importancia y la fragilidad de su propia vida. Todos queremos sobrevivir a los desastres, pero sólo un Prepper toma las medidas necesarias para hacerlo.
 
Mediante la lectura de este libro se toma el primer paso de ser indefenso en un desastre para útiles. Este libro que tiene en el mundo de la Prepper, con un enfoque específico sobre cómo sobrevivir en el desierto.
 
En el primer capítulo de este libro, aprender la psicología básica de la supervivencia, la mentalidad y las actitudes necesarias para desarrollar si tuviera que pensar siquiera en sobrevivir a la naturaleza. En el segundo capítulo, familiarizarse con los distintos peligros que pueden enfrentar y cómo se clasifican. En el siguiente capítulo, ser entrenado para preparar su propio kit de supervivencia, que contiene los mejores elementos para asegurar su supervivencia en cualquier situación. Finalmente, en el capítulo quinto poder familiarizarse con sus habilidades básicas de supervivencia por aprender a vivir en el desierto. Descubra cómo encontrar agua, cómo buscar comida, cómo construir un refugio, cómo encender fuego, cómo navegar usando signos naturales y la manera de tratar las lesiones y heridas.












Capítulo 1 - Psicología de la Supervivencia
Mantenerse tranquilo y enfocado
Todos hemos visto a la gente a su vez problemas manejables en desastres exageradas completos por carecer de la calma y la claridad para hacer frente a un problema con gracia. En la ocasión, todo el mundo uno de nosotros probablemente ha tenido un momento en el que "rompimos", perdiendo la calma y actuar de una manera que nos arrepentimos.
 
Mientras que estos incidentes son despreciados por nuestros compañeros, en la mayoría de las circunstancias, además de perder el tiempo e irritante a la gente que nos rodea, estas rabietas menores nos hacen poco daño a largo plazo.
 
Sin embargo, en una situación de desastre en el que está presionado hasta el mismo borde de la supervivencia, manteniendo la mente firme y concentrado es fundamental para salir de problemas con vida. Usted simplemente no puede perder la calma - no va a sobrevivir. No hay redes de seguridad.
 
Por lo tanto para dominar las habilidades de supervivencia, que necesita para dominar a ti mismo. En lugar de tomar la actitud de que sus emociones son fenómenos incontrolables salvajes que le hacen actuar de manera irracional que debe disciplinarse para gestionar con eficacia sus emociones.
 
Esto no es lo mismo que negar sus sentimientos - cuando se está estresado, usted está estresado. Cuando usted está enojado, usted está enojado.Sin embargo, usted puede entrenarse para actuar eficientemente durante la ira u otras emociones inútiles y alcanzar niveles de enfoque interno que penetran más allá de sus emociones superficiales.
 
En última instancia, el primer paso para dominar sus emociones es abrazar la perspectiva de que el mantenimiento de un estado saludable de la mente es una habilidad que la práctica más que el resultado de factores externos. Si reconocen que los factores externos determinan su estado de ánimo que cuando las cosas se ponen difíciles, nunca tendrá éxito.
 
Es lo mismo que renunciar ahora - usted no tiene las agallas para seguir adelante. Si usted piensa que usted no es una víctima de sus propias emociones que usted puede comenzar a practicar el control emocional. Reconozca cuando se siente una emoción inútil y aprender a calmar a ti mismo mediante el cultivo de las emociones positivas y hábitos constructivos para contrarrestar esa emoción. Si usted practica esta habilidad en cada oportunidad en la que surge el descontento emocional, con el tiempo va a aprender a lidiar con sus emociones con habilidad.
 
Además de desarrollar la calma emocional, una Prepper necesita superar sus prejuicios inherentes que "todo estará bien", a menudo llamado un sesgo normalidad. La vida en la sociedad occidental moderna es, para la mayoría de los occidentales, más cómodo. Aunque algunos de nosotros son lamentable y sufren de tragedias personales y accidentes físicos, la mayoría pasan a través de la mayor parte de nuestras vidas, por lo menos hasta el momento, con pocos peligros que amenazan la vida genuinamente tirado nuestro camino.
 
El hecho de que hemos llegado a este actual período de tiempo relativamente indemne a menudo nos hace ignorantes y mal preparados para el futuro.La gente se vuelve complaciente y arrogante, asumir que porque unos malos fortunas se han producido en el pasado, pocos o ninguno se producirá en el futuro. Si nosotros enfrentamos desafíos que amenazan la vida, la mayoría de las personas fracasan porque nunca se tomaron el tiempo de sus vidas cómodas para aprender cómo hacer frente a situaciones difíciles. No toman un interés en su propio estado físico, que es esencial para cualquier situación de supervivencia. Ellos no aprenden a manejar los desastres naturales e industriales, incluso si viven en zonas geográficamente susceptibles.
 
A Prepper sin embargo, es diferente. Un Prepper mira hacia el futuro con un ojo imparcial y reconoce la posibilidad de la desgracia. A arsenales prepper y trenes en el grado necesario para asegurarse de que pueden sobrevivir cuando ocurre un desastre - todo porque tienen el don de la previsión. Nunca asuma que todo va a estar bien. ¡Preparar!
 
Autosuficiencia
Otro aspecto clave de la mentalidad de prepararse es la autosuficiencia. En la vida cotidiana, no siempre es inherentemente malo que aprender a pedir ayuda y cooperar con sus compañeros - que depende por completo de la situación y las personas involucradas.
 
Sin embargo, en una situación de desastre el flujo normal de la vida se vuelve muy distorsionada. Las personas a las que está acostumbrado a confiar en - cónyuges, hermanos, amigos, padres, autoridades y servicios de emergencia podrían ser todos distanciaron de usted o ellos mismos en peligro de extinción.
Si usted está solo en el desierto, no hay garantía de que usted será capaz de ponerse en contacto con cualquier persona que le ayude. Ningún funcionario de la policía para proteger a usted o ningún médico que trata a sus heridas. Tienes que aprender, siempre que sea posible, para hacer frente a sus problemas por sí mismo. Esto no significa, sin embargo, que debe convertirse en una isla en sí mismo.
 
En su lugar tomar la perspectiva de que en la vida cotidiana, intenta arreglar sus problemas por sí mismo primero. Dejar de depender de otras personas sólo porque usted es demasiado perezoso para encontrar la solución o porque no es más que conveniente. Si usted necesita ayuda, pida ayuda. Si resulta factible y tratar razonablemente con un problema por sí mismo, hacer frente a ese problema por sí mismo, y punto.
 
Con eso se dice, un Prepper también necesita desarrollar fuertes habilidades interpersonales y la voluntad de ayudar a otras personas. A raíz de una situación de desastre, el escenario ideal sería que el eventual restablecimiento de la sociedad. Si se ha producido una situación de desastre y que están en condiciones de ayudar, que lo hagan. No ponga en peligro a sí mismo, pero tampoco ser frío y poco servicial.
 
Además, tomar un interés activo en las sociedades prepper y organización. Si se produce una verdadera catástrofe generalizada, y si el gobierno no puede proporcionar asistencia a sus ciudadanos, a continuación, estas sociedades que han almacenadas recursos, que ellos mismos se han entrenado para hacer frente a los peligros y las tecnologías de mantenimiento que permiten desastre supervivencia será una de las piedras angulares de la re -Establecimiento de la sociedad. Así que toma un interés.












Capítulo 2- Tipos de desastres
Cinco Clasificaciones de Desastres
La mayoría de la gente probablemente enumerar los peligros a algunos de los más Hollywood popularizó como los terremotos y las erupciones volcánicas. Sin embargo, pocas personas son realmente conscientes de la gama completa de posibles situaciones de desastre. En este capítulo se familiaricen con todas las situaciones de desastre que pueda necesitar para prepararse para, sus características y cómo los desastres se clasifican por tipo. Es posible que desee investigar qué peligros de su país y la región pueden ser susceptibles a.
 
EM-DAT, la organización internacional de desastres clasifica desastres en cinco tipos.
Geophysical - Eventos procedentes de la tierra. Los ejemplos incluyen erupciones volcánicas, tsunamis y terremotos.
 
Meteorológicos - Eventos causados por los procesos atmosféricos de corta duración. Los ejemplos incluyen la mayoría de los tipos de tormentas y fuertes vientos.
 
Hidrológicos - Eventos causados por la alteración del ciclo del agua. Los ejemplos incluyen las inundaciones y los peligros causados por ellos, tales como deslizamientos de tierra.
 
Climatoligcal - Eventos causados por largo plazo o el cambio climático macro. Los ejemplos incluyen la sequía, la ola de calor y otros peligros de temperatura asociado a largo plazo.
 
Biológicos - Eventos causados por organismos vivos y sustancias tóxicas. Los ejemplos incluyen la enfermedad y la infección bacteriana y viral, así como los tipos de infestación.
 
Además los diversos riesgos ambientales, también se puede considerar diversos peligros artificiales o antropológicos, como los disturbios civiles, descomposición de la sociedad, los riesgos nucleares y radiológicas y la guerra bioquímica.
 
En última instancia como un Prepper a futuro, hay muchas amenazas potenciales a ser cautos. Investigación y aprender lo que es posible que tenga que tratar, el uso de estas clasificaciones como base para su estudio.












Capítulo 3 - Kit de supervivencia Esencial
Dar prioridad a los Fundamentos
Durante un desastre que usted y su familia obliga al desierto, su primera prioridad debe ser recuperar su kit de supervivencia preparado, que contiene las herramientas y recursos más esenciales para sobrevivir a cualquier desastre.
 
En este capítulo aprenderá a preparar un kit de supervivencia tales, los componentes más cruciales del equipo de supervivencia y por qué tales componentes son útiles. No se puede llevar todo lo que se necesita, por lo que grandes equipos de supervivencia priorizan las herramientas de supervivencia más importantes.
 
Para empezar, todos los kits de supervivencia deben contener un cuchillo de alta calidad. Un cuchillo es la herramienta más útil y versátil para la elaboración de todo tipo de instrumentos a partir de los recursos naturales que puedes encontrar - de refugio a las armas. Por encima y más allá de hacer a mano, cuchillos también (obviamente) le permiten cortar materiales que usted no sería capaz de cortar por lo demás - como la cuerda y paquetes herméticamente cerrados que sus suministros podrían estar dentro.
 
Además siempre hay que mantener una brújula y un mapa que detalla el área local. Perderse en una situación de desastre, especialmente en el desierto, es una gran preocupación de supervivencia - este es uno de los factores más fáciles de explicar por siempre manteniendo un mapa en la mano.
 
Sus siguientes elementos clave deben ser un botiquín de primeros auxilios. Esto le ayudará a mantener pequeñas heridas se infecten y tratar ciertas heridas fatales. Es difícil exagerar cuán fundamental botiquines de primeros auxilios se encuentran en ninguna situación de supervivencia.
 
Además de esto, usted debe tener suficiente comida en su kit de supervivencia para durar al menos tres días. Esta cantidad de alimentos le dará una pequeña ventana para comenzar a recoger sus propios alimentos de la naturaleza y puede ayudarle a sobrevivir el tiempo suficiente, para el rescate en llegar (siempre que la situación de desastre tiene capacidad para el rescate). Del mismo modo, usted querrá un frasco considerable que puede llevar a una cantidad razonable de agua, es reutilizable y no tener fugas o romperse fácilmente.
 
Usted también tendrá que llevar a un método para iniciar un incendio, como fósforos impermeables o un pedernal y el acero. Ser capaz de iniciar un incendio le proporciona el calor, la luz, la capacidad de purificar el agua hirviéndola, así como la capacidad de cocinar. El fuego es simplemente demasiado esencial en una situación de supervivencia que se olvide de mantener una fuente de partida fuego en su kit de supervivencia.
 
En esta nota, también querrá fuentes de luz portátiles. Mantener una linterna con varios conjuntos de baterías de repuesto es a menudo la opción más conveniente.
 
Usted también necesitará ropa de supervivencia adicional, como guantes y chubasquero para protegerse de la intemperie y la temperatura, sobre todo si su área local es propenso a condiciones muy duras.
 
Las últimas piezas de su kit de supervivencia deben ser una bolsa de plástico resistente, en la que otros artículos pueden ser transportados en y se mantienen impermeables, así como formas de señal de socorro, como un silbato y bengalas. También es posible que desee considerar la posibilidad de mantenimiento de una lona, ya que puede ayudar en la construcción de un refugio, mantener el calor o la recolección de agua.
 
Para resumir los componentes clave de su kit de supervivencia debe ser:

                 Un cuchillo de alta calidad
                 Una brújula y un mapa
                 Un botiquín de primeros auxilios
                 3 días el valor de los alimentos
                 Una gran flash para llevar el agua
                 Partidos a prueba de agua y / o un pedernal y acero
                 Una fuente de luz portátil (es decir, una linterna) y las baterías / potencia
                 Ropa de Supervivencia
                 Bolsa de transporte a prueba de agua
                 Bengalas y un silbato
                 Una lona













Capítulo 4 - Sobrevivir en el desierto
Suministro de agua
Para sobrevivir con éxito en la naturaleza hay que aprender la forma de abordar sus necesidades básicas - su necesidad de comida, agua y refugio.Además usted debe aprender a crear un incendio, cómo navegar la tierra y cómo tratar las lesiones. En este capítulo aprenderá los conceptos básicos de cada una de estas habilidades en turno.
 
Su primera prioridad cuando sobrevivir en el desierto siempre debe ser encontrar y mantener un suministro de agua. Su cuerpo puede durar semanas sin la nutrición de los alimentos, pero después de unos pocos días sin agua puede morir a causa de la deshidratación. Además si lo hace deshidratarse, puede llegar a ser incapacitado y sus facultades cognitivas en particular puede llegar a ser alterada (que le impide maximizar su potencial de supervivencia) mucho antes de la deshidratación se vuelve mortal. Al final del día, usted debe reconocer la importancia de encontrar agua sobre las preocupaciones inmediatas de supervivencia en la mayoría de circunstancias supervivencia en la naturaleza. Si usted está varado en el desierto y la necesidad de sobrevivir durante largos períodos de tiempo, no descansar o concentrarse en otra cosa que no sea la búsqueda de agua - seguir buscando.
 
Proporcionar asesoramiento sobre cómo encontrar agua es de por sí difícil, ya que depende en gran medida de la naturaleza geológica del paisaje, así como qué tipo de bioma usted está considerando en su escenario de supervivencia. Explorar y suministro de información para todas las posibilidades del medio ambiente es mucho más allá del alcance de este libro, sin embargo hay algunos hallazgos de agua generalizadas trucos y patrones que usted puede ser capaz de emplear si usted se encuentra desesperada.
 
Sin embargo, hay un par de punteros preliminares para hacer primero. Cuando usted bebe el agua del ambiente que te rodea, siempre es mejor intentar filtrar o purificar primero. Si usted tiene el tiempo y los recursos, el agua hirviendo es una fantástica manera de eliminar la mayoría de las bacterias y otros organismos nocivos de que el agua puede estar escondido. Más realista cuando sus recursos y el tiempo son limitados, es posible que no estén en condiciones de hervir el agua, pero al menos debe tratar de filtrarlo para eliminar los residuos, insectos y parásitos potenciales.Existen numerosos artículos de supervivencia por el hombre, con el fin de filtrar el agua, pero los métodos más crudo implican la filtración de agua a través de la tela, o un montón densa de hojas o corteza pueden ser viable también.
 
Del mismo modo, siempre priorizar que fluye, de agua dulce tales como ríos y barrancos más de lagos y estanques - es menos probable que contenga amenazas biológicas que pueden causar enfermedades agua que fluye, ya que estas bacterias son menos propensos a prosperar en agua en movimiento.
 
Con esta establecido, ahora se puede apreciar métodos sobre cómo descubrir agua. Su mejor aliado potencial cuando se trata de descubrir el agua son la flora y la fauna a su alrededor. Si un área es particularmente densa con plantas y vegetación, es probable que exista una fuente notable de agua en las cercanías. Del mismo modo, los enjambres de insectos y aves se congregan en torno a las fuentes de agua. Observar la vida silvestre a su alrededor - donde se recoge el agua está obligado a estar presente.
 
También tener en cuenta que el agua siempre fluye cuesta abajo debido a la gravedad. Buscar zonas bajas en el horizonte para sus fuentes de agua.
 
El agua también se puede encontrar debajo de la superficie en muchos lugares, especialmente si el suelo aparece regularmente húmedo o saturado.Si puede, trate de cavar un agujero de unos pies hacia abajo y esperar un par de minutos - agua podría comenzar a poner en común de manera natural en el espacio que has creado. Como una palabra de advertencia, si usted encuentra el agua de esta manera, tener un esfuerzo extra para filtrar cuidadosamente.
 
Otras maneras de encontrar el agua incluyen la recogida de la lluvia, del rocío, así como de la nieve o el hielo. Para el agua de lluvia, diseñar cualquier contenedor que tiene cuando está lloviendo para recoger agua, asegurándose a maximizar superficie potencial. Si usted tiene un material resistente al agua, también puede cubrir un pequeño agujero o zanja con este material como un método temporal para recoger el agua.
 
Puede obviamente derretir el hielo o la nieve para producir agua también. Sin embargo tenga en cuenta que siempre debe asegurarse de que se derrite el hielo o la nieve primero - si el clima es bastante frío para apoyar hielo o nieve, que no pueden arriesgarse a bajar la temperatura de su cuerpo al ingerir el agua en una forma congelada. Además, una temperatura inferior del cuerpo puede conducir realmente a la pérdida de agua a través de la piel.
 
Por último, se puede recoger el agua de rocío utilizando tela para absorber el agua de las plantas cercanas y luego colar esa tela. Naturalmente, el mejor momento para recoger el rocío es temprano en la mañana cuando el agua en el aire se ha condensado en la flora de los alrededores, pero antes de la salida del sol hace que se evapore.
 
Forraje
Aprender a recoger comida desde el desierto se enfrenta a problemas similares a aprender cómo reunir el agua - las fuentes de alimentos potenciales disponibles dependen en gran medida de la ecología del desierto locales, otros factores geográficos, así como la época del año. Debido a esto, una guía exhaustiva sobre cómo encontrar comida es más allá de lo que se puede enseñar dentro de este eBook. Si quieres aprender a forraje y cómo cazar en el desierto locales, lo mejor es estudiar en detalle haciendo por separado esto usted puede apuntar hacia las plantas comestibles y caza en su área. Por encima y más allá de asesoramiento específico para los lugares sin embargo, hay algunas tendencias que tienden a ser universal.
 
En cualquier situación de supervivencia, tiene que aprender a evitar las plantas potencialmente tóxicas si quieres buscar alimento. Si usted ve un potencial candidato comestible, trate de observar si usted puede encontrar cualquier otro animal en la zona de comer la planta. En términos generales, si las aves y otros mamíferos pueden tolerar una fruta o baya, hay mayores posibilidades de que usted será capaz de hacerlo.
 
Además, si estás desesperado, puede realizar las etapas de la prueba de comestibilidad universal, una prueba diseñada para determinar si cualquier planta se puede comer. En esta prueba, la primera instrucción es para separar la planta elegida en todos los componentes; las raíces, los frutos, las hojas, tallo y así sucesivamente. Esto se hace debido a que ciertas partes de la planta pueden ser comestibles, mientras que otros no lo son. Si usted es determinar metódicamente qué partes son venenosas o no, tiene que probar de forma individual.
 
A continuación, se aplican estas partes a las zonas sensibles de la piel, como la muñeca o el codo y mantener el contacto durante varios minutos (se recomienda un cuarto de hora). Si su piel comienza a desarrollar una reacción negativa, tales como ardor, hinchazón o picazón de la planta probablemente no es seguro para comer y usted debe enjuagar el área que tenía contacto con la planta.
 
Después de esto, la siguiente etapa es tratar de hervir los componentes de la planta. Algunas plantas tóxicas se vuelven comestibles una vez cocidas, así hirviendo la planta disminuye la posibilidad de que usted se enferme. Incluso si usted no tiene los recursos ni tiempo para hervir la planta, aún puede realizar el resto de las pruebas comestibilidad de todos modos - ebullición sólo hace que la ingestión de una planta desconocida un poco más seguro.
 
A continuación, descansar la planta dentro de la boca durante varios minutos. En esta etapa se está probando para cualquier reacción adversa, al igual que la etapa anterior en la que se aplica a la planta a la piel. La descomposición química de los alimentos realmente comienza con enzimas en su saliva, que se liberan compuestos tóxicos de la planta si no están inmediatamente presentes al tacto.
 
Cambiando de tema, si la planta parece seguro dentro de su boca, ahora puede masticar. No trague - simplemente masticar la planta hasta que esté casi liquidada en la boca y esperar de nuevo por varios momentos. Si se produce alguna reacción adversa, escupir la planta y limpiar la boca con agua.
 
Por último, ahora se puede tragar. Usted todavía puede enfermarse, pero las siguientes etapas ha reducido la probabilidad notablemente. En la circunstancia en que resulte que ha sido envenenado, debe obligarse a vomitar y después rehidratar a sí mismo con agua.
 
Cada vez que se prueba una planta de esta manera, también se recomienda para el control de algunas otras variables. Su estómago no debería haber comido durante varias horas de antelación, y usted no debe comer nada más durante o después de la prueba durante varias horas (para asegurar los efectos secundarios se deben al consumo de la planta).
 
En general, sólo ser cauteloso. Como se mencionó anteriormente, el cuerpo puede sobrevivir sin comida por varias semanas. En una situación de supervivencia es mejor tomar su tiempo y poco a poco y científicamente descubrir lo que puede y no puede comer, que a envenenarse al comer varias plantas a la vez - la reducción de la probabilidad de supervivencia, y no le proporciona ningún nuevo conocimiento.
 
Abrigo
En lo que respecta a la construcción de una vivienda, construcción de refugios efectivos progresa a través de varias etapas. En primer lugar debe inspeccionar la tierra a su alrededor y encontrar un área adecuada para construir. Esta área debe ser grande y lo suficientemente amplia para satisfacer las necesidades de un ser humano, aunque no está demasiado expuesto a los elementos, tales como áreas dispersas de civil. La exposición de su refugio a los vientos fuertes o lluvias fuertes a menudo dañar el refugio, o dar lugar a no proporcionar una protección suficiente. La ubicación ideal es un lugar como un dosel o maleza bajo colgando aquello que guardará del tiempo, pero en el que el suelo del bosque es todavía lo suficientemente amplia como para pasar fácilmente a través y mantener los suministros.
 
Además de esto, tener una fuente de agua cercana es siempre preferible. Sin embargo, en el mismo sentido también debe construir su refugio una distancia adecuada de las fuentes de agua - usted no quiere que su refugio para inundar o ser húmedo debe una inundación o difundir fuente de agua.Siempre tratar de construir su vivienda varias docenas de metros de distancia de una fuente de agua grande, o sólo para construir su refugio cerca del agua si el terreno está formado de tal manera que el riesgo de inundaciones parece insignificante.
 
Después de haber descubierto un lugar adecuado, entonces usted necesita para encontrar una estructura natural, que se puede utilizar como base para su refugio. Esto es por dos razones - en primer lugar, adjuntando su pieza refugio a pieza a un objeto existente hace que su refugio mucho más fácil de construir. Sin embargo, la razón principal y más importante es darle a su fuerza refugio y fijeza. Cualquier estructura a construir a mano, especialmente como un novato, probablemente será bastante menos seguro que es posible que desee que sea. Con la construcción de la estructura de un objeto cercano grande, tal árbol talado, un saliente rocoso o árboles firma low-colgantes ramas de los árboles, su estructura tendrán más fuerza que si iban a tener ningún fundamento.
 
Sin embargo, es posible hacer un refugio sin apoyo externo adicional, por lo que no se desespere si usted está en una situación desierto y no hay buenos apoyos potenciales en un lugar refugio de otra manera prometedora.
 
Con esto en mente, empezar a la arquitectura de su estructura, tratando de incorporar objetos grandes, naturales, si es posible. Usted tendrá que formar su estructura tipi con razonablemente grandes palos en forma de prisma, con dos grandes palos de aproximadamente el mismo tamaño, atados en la parte superior mirando en direcciones opuestas como la entrada de su estructura. Entonces también adjunte tercer palo, ya que los dos anteriores, atada a los dos originales de tal manera que cuando los tres palos descansan en el suelo, se apoyan mutuamente y mantenerse en posición vertical. Preferiblemente debe solucionar estos palos juntos con soga o vid duradero, pero proporciona suficiente peso, la gravedad y el ángulo se puede prescindir.
 
Siguiente la búsqueda de parejas cada vez más pequeños de palos, adjunte estos pares de palos a través de la barra más larga desde donde los tres palos se unen a donde toca el suelo. Esto completa la arquitectura de su refugio.
 
Finalmente, usted tendrá que encontrar pequeñas ramas y arbustos adjuntar a su estructura para proporcionar una capa de protección de los elementos más de la estructura fundacional que ha creado. Estas piezas deben ser posicionado como tal que no serán arrastrados o simplemente caen fuera de lugar. Se recomienda que usted debe hacer una superficie densa de varias capas que cubre para dar la mejor protección.
 
Comenzar un fuego
Además de aprender cómo hacer que la vivienda, también debe aprender a encendéis fuego. El arte de las hogueras que producen no es de por sí difícil, pero hay varios escollos que los ignorantes fuego arrancador puede caer.
 
Antes de poder iniciar un incendio que necesita varios materiales. Usted necesita una manera de encender el fuego, ya se trate de partidos, o un pedernal y acero. Creación de una chispa o llama inicial es posible con métodos más rudimentarios, como la fricción entre piezas de madera, pero en realidad es bastante difícil y puede tomar varias horas de ensayos y errores. Teniendo en cuenta que usted debe tener una fuente de ignición en su kit de supervivencia, lo mejor es aprender a utilizar métodos más modernos primero.
 
Además del material necesario para la ignición, también necesita varios troncos grandes utilizar como su fuente primaria de combustible una vez que el fuego se ha establecido y que hay que mantener. Por otra parte también es necesario tanto la yesca y leña, que afortunadamente también se pueden encontrar en abundancia en todos los bosques. Yesca se refiere a su material de la quema inicial - es lo de encender para empezar, y se utiliza para encender el más grande, más difícil de quemar materiales. Hay varios materiales hechos por el hombre que son bastante buenas fuentes yesca (tales como papel, tela y algodón). En una situación de desierto, su yesca será generalmente follaje seco, hierba, hojas de pino o muy pequeñas ramitas.
 
En cuanto a la leña, leña es el intermediario entre la yesca y su fuente de combustible persistente. Se enciende más fácilmente que un tronco grande, pero produce una llama estable y más persistente que la yesca. Además, también proporciona la estructura para su chimenea, manteniendo firmemente los otros materiales en ritmo. Su leña también estará pequeños palos y ramas, pero notablemente más grande que su yesca.
 
Como nota final sobre la recogida de yesca y leña, asegúrese de que los materiales que recogen están secos. Ramas y palos Wetter, que han caído más recientemente de un árbol, serán más difíciles de encender y producir más humo cuando se quema (que puede irritar los ojos y los pulmones).Sus ramas y palos deben ajustar en lugar de lágrima si intenta romperlas; deben ser frágiles y pesar menos de las ramas húmedas.
 
La primera etapa en la construcción de un incendio es la construcción de un espacio para el fuego para ocupar. Hay dos maneras en que esto se puede lograr. Usted puede cavar ya sea un pequeño hoyo para mantener el fuego, o cobrar una docena de piedras de tamaño moderado y formar un anillo alrededor de la ubicación prevista del fuego. Tenga en cuenta al momento de elegir su ubicación fuego que allí no haya objetos inflamables cerca de la zona del incendio elegido - incluyendo el follaje natural. Si una capa de hojas secas y ramas pequeñas ocupan el suelo del bosque en el que reside, quitar un área del espacio, con el pie, de al menos un par de metros de ancho. Esto asegurará no hay chispas azar encienden el bosque a su alrededor.
 
Después de hacer su fogata, poner una porción de la yesca en su interior. Siguiente formar una estructura en forma de tipi como de palos y ramas sobre la leña. Asegúrese de que esta estructura es relativamente pequeño, se mantiene cerca de la yesca, pero hay suficiente espacio para que pueda acceder a la yesca y la llama inicial. Así que no será capaz de obtener el suministro de aire suficiente para persistir. Encender la yesca, en varios lugares, si es posible, y permitir que su estructura fuego para comenzar a grabar. Puede que tenga que soplar suavemente sobre la llama inicial para aumentar su suministro de aire, o, alternativamente, protegerlo de los vientos más fuertes, lo que puede apagar la llama. Una vez que la leña se ha encendido y está empezando a arder bien, añadir sus combustibles a largo plazo, tales como troncos y grandes trozos de madera para permitir que el fuego continúe ardiendo.
 
Navegación
La siguiente habilidad de supervivencia que usted necesita para familiarizarse con es la navegación. Cada vez que usted está tratando de sobrevivir en el desierto, se necesita un método de entendimiento en el que se encuentra. Pero avanzar más en el desierto cuando te refieres a salir de ella, la pérdida de su campamento, o ser incapaz de encontrar de nuevo la sociedad son todos amenazas de supervivencia significativos.
 
Lo ideal sería que usted tendrá una brújula y un mapa del terreno local en su kit de supervivencia, que se puede utilizar para navegar cómodamente.Incluso si estas herramientas están en ninguna parte ser encontrado, todavía hay más técnicas antiguas que pueden ayudarle a encontrar su camino.
 
En primer lugar, el adagio probado y verdadero que el sol sale por el este y se pone por el oeste nunca hacerte mal. Otro marcador astronómico es la luna. Cuando la Luna está en su fase de media luna, visualizar una línea recta que conecta las dos puntas de la media luna. Si usted está en el hemisferio norte, esta línea estará orientada al sur. Por el contrario, si usted está en el hemisferio sur, esta línea estará orientada al norte.
 
También puede utilizar el viento para navegar, hasta cierto punto. En las zonas azotadas por el viento, observar los árboles y ver en qué dirección han crecido - si las ramas todas enfrentan de una manera. Si lo hacen, se puede determinar que los vientos predominantes tienden vienen desde la dirección opuesta. Como se produce un viento atmosférico principio cuando el aire caliente se mueve hacia los bloques más frías de aire. Cuanto más al norte o al sur del ecuador que van más frío el aire es. Debido a esto, si las ramas o el crecimiento de los árboles todas dan una forma, si usted está en el hemisferio norte, área de la posibilidad de que la dirección es norte. Por el contrario, para el hemisferio sur, si todo el crecimiento del árbol o ramas se enfrentan a una dirección sugiere la dirección que señalan es el sur. Este es un principio generalizado de que no siempre se puede confiar en, pero tiene cierto mérito.
 
Como siempre, si usted desea aprender cómo navegar su área local sin equipo, la inversión en un guía local que le puede decir al puntero específicos de su región es sabio.
 
Primeros auxilios
La habilidad de supervivencia esencial último que necesita es aprender a manejar su salud en una situación de desastre, al aprender cómo tratar heridas y realizar los primeros auxilios a las personas necesitadas. Para saber realmente cómo realizar los primeros auxilios, lo mejor es unirse a una sociedad u organización que le enseñará y refinar su técnica de primeros auxilios. Siempre que se trata de una persona lesionada que hay un montón de contingencias a tener en cuenta y si usted se ocupa de la situación deficiente, puede poner en peligro a sí mismo o hacer que las lesiones aún peor.
 
Debido a esto, primeros auxilios sólo será cubierto de la forma más breve, sólo para darles un resumen del proceso y promover aún más el interés.
 
El primer paso en un escenario de primeros auxilios es para comprobar si hay peligros potenciales que podrían haber causado perjuicio que usted está intentando dar los primeros auxilios a. Lidiar con o mitigar estos riesgos antes de que avance para el tratamiento de la persona lesionada, de lo contrario se arriesga a sí mismo y la persona lesionada.
 
Su primer paso es comprobar si hay signos de conciencia al aplicar los primeros auxilios. Si la conciencia se ve comprometida esto puede ser debido a los sistemas vitales que fallan - éstos deben ser abordados inmediatamente.
 
Si la persona está inconsciente, si hay signos de respiración. Si ellos no están respirando tendrá que intente abrir sus vías respiratorias, ya sea tratando de eliminar los restos de su garganta, o colocándolos en una posición donde la respiración es más fácil, por ejemplo, con la espalda contra el suelo.
 
Su próximo paso es comprobar el pulso, en la muñeca o el cuello. Si no hay pulso tendrá que tratar de apoyar a los latidos del corazón al hacer las compresiones en el pecho, que proporciona periódicamente respiraciones boca a boca. Usted debe tratar de hacer esto hasta otra que llegue la ayuda, o un latido del corazón se inicia una vez más.
 
Si el pulso y la respiración de una persona son estables, la verificación de lesiones menos graves. Si una persona está sangrando debe aplicar presión a la herida para tratar de detener el flujo de sangre al mismo tiempo tratando de evitar el contacto con la sangre o desinfectar las manos después de evitar la transferencia de patógenos.
 
Huesos rotos próximo deben gestionarse al ser apoyado con hondas o férulas - se puede usar creativamente cualquier material a su alrededor para lograr este propósito, pero la división tiene que ser fuerte y no romper y debe fijarse firmemente para que no se tambalee.
 
Para las quemaduras, aplique agua y luego cubra con un paño húmedo. Los ungüentos u otros tratamientos aparentemente beneficiosos en realidad puede empeorar las quemaduras, por lo que evitar la tentación de usarlos.
 
Finalmente es posible que tenga que lidiar con el shock emocional, que puede ser potencialmente mortal. Hable a la persona, mientras que usted está solicitando de primeros auxilios y hacerles preguntas para ver si pueden recordar información personal - el proceso de recuperación de la memoria puede ayudar a mitigar el impacto.
 
Se trata de los conceptos básicos de los primeros auxilios, pero hay mucho, mucho más que aprender. Como se mencionó anteriormente, incluso con buenas intenciones que pueda tomar una lesión peor, así que por favor si usted está interesado en aprender primeros auxilios, buscar asesoramiento profesional.
 
Por último, también debe aprender a vestirse heridas. En la mayoría de las circunstancias el sistema inmunológico de las personas son lo suficientemente robusto que lesiones menores no nos causan mucho daño. Sin embargo, en una situación de supervivencia en el que puede estar deshidratado, desnutrido y expuesto a más patógenos que de costumbre, tratar correctamente con heridas es un salvavidas.
 
Primera hora de vestir una herida, debe limpiar el área con agua y eliminar cualquier residuo o suciedad de la herida. Siguiente desinfectar el área con desinfectante, que debe estar en un botiquín de primeros auxilios. Alternativamente, el alcohol fuerte es también un buen sustituto si desinfectante adecuado no está disponible. A continuación, si el sangrado ocurre, aplique presión con un paño o algodón brote limpio para detener la hemorragia. Si este sangrado se produce a partir de una extremidad, elevar la extremidad en el aire para reducir el flujo de sangre a esa zona. Por último, con firmeza vendar la zona y asegurar el vendaje con cinta adhesiva, un clip de vendaje o un imperdible.
 
Con los primeros auxilios y tratamiento de heridas tenuemente cubierto, se encuentra ahora en una mejor posición para hacer frente a las posibles amenazas a su salud. Con el asesoramiento previo sobre agua, alimentos, refugio y la navegación, que ahora está equipado con sus habilidades básicas de supervivencia.
