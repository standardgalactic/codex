Introduction I am delighted to introduce the 17-Day Slim Down, one of the most effective ways to lose weight - and keep it off for good. During our busy modern lives, many of us slide into bad eating habits. It is hardly surprising - we are a time-poor society, always rushing around and grabbing fatty, snacks on the go, or quickly cooking high-calorie, over-processed ready meals.  This can become a way of life and then... well, it is no wonder that so many of us pile on the weight. So how do we tackle our weight problems?  All too often we turn to weird and wonderful 'solutions', the sort of faddy diets that involve us eating nothing but cabbage soup, for example.  Most of these crazy, unsustainable diets fail - we may lose a little weight if we manage to stick to their unrealistic rules, but we will actually wind up malnourished and cranky.  So cranky, in fact that we reach straight for the cookie jar again... Time to choose a healthier path.  The 17-Day Slim Down is just that - a diet that is based on sensible eating principles, to give you everything you need in terms of protein, fiber, carbohydrates and a little healthy fat, whilst cutting out all of the junk.  It is a totally healthy way to eat, so much so that you could happily continue to eat along these lines for the rest of your life! That's part one.  The other key part of the 17-Day Slim Down is the exercise factor.  Those busy lives of us also, somehow, keep many of us spending more sedentary time that ever before. Strangely, although we have little free time, we appear to mostly be busy driving everywhere, fiddling with our smartphones or sending emails... everything you can do sitting down. So our waists get thicker, our legs heavier and our behinds get out of shape - hardly surprising when you think about it.  Yet despite all this, most of us want trim, toned, healthy and attractive bodies. So, during the 17 days you will also do that vital part of any weight loss program - moving around!  This weight loss program includes some clearly defined daily exercises, which really will make a difference to the appearance of your body.  Are you getting excited?  You should be - the next 17 days will involve you eating some of the best, healthiest foods of your life, plus exercising your way to a great new shape.  You will feel brighter, tighter and much lighter... so what are you waiting for? 







Chapter 1: Transform Your Body in 17 Days  Welcome to the start of a 17-day phase that will transform your body, improve your health and potentially kick-start a whole new slim and fit episode of your life. Many of us try hard to find the perfect weight loss program. Modern busy lives do not always allow for the preparation of complex dishes and yet few of us have a private chef to balance out the calories and nutrients in our diet!  As for exercise, few of us have the free time to indulge in a 3-hour workout, but we still long for a toned, slender physique... The answer?   A slimming plan that offers a variety of easy-to-prepare meals and a manageable, enjoyable and effective exercise regime - the 17-Day Slim Down! What is the 17-Day Slim Down? The 17-Day Slim Down is an easy-to-follow weight loss program that really works. It incorporates a super-healthy diet and optimum levels of exercise, meaning that if you follow it to the letter you WILL see a fantastic difference - after just 17 days. When you follow the 17-Day Slim Down you will not only enjoy seeing the pounds melt away, you will also be able to tone up your body so that it looks better than ever. Why Does it Work? This weight loss program works brilliantly because it focuses on filling you up with low-calorie, high-fiber, nutritious food and working your body in all the right places, resulting in you losing the pounds and getting closer to that great-looking body you have always wanted. It is not a crash diet; it is not based on any weird dietary principles.  It is a foolproof way to shed excess weight and tone up, based on what the best nutritionists and personal trainers tell us - eat less, move more.  Do this for 17 days and you will not fail to see fabulous improvements, both on the scales and in the mirror.  You will feel great too! During the 17-Day Slim Down you will: Eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack every day, chosen from the 17 options for each meal. Drink a lot of water and/or unsweetened herbal tea. Exercise regularly in 17-minute workouts, enjoying both cardio and toning exercises that will work wonders for your abs, butt and legs. How does the 17-Day Slim Down work? The 17-Day Slim Down works along the lines of a few simple but highly effective principles: Low-calorie, high-fiber food - All of the recipes in the book contain plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, healthy lean meats, fish and other protein, plenty of whole grains and minimally processed ingredients.  As they fill you up, help your digestion work at its best and provide lots of essential nutrients for very few calories, they really are a recipe for total success!
Avoiding bloating foods - Certain foods want work against your digestive system and irritate it or make it sluggish, often causing bloating.  The 17-Day Slim Down recipes eliminate foods that are known to commonly cause bloating, so that you feel comfortable and so your internal engine continues to run at the optimum speed for burning those calories. Daily cardio - Rev up that engine and burn even more calories - it's that simple. Many people avoid daily exercise because they do not have the time energy or inclination to jump around for an hour or two.  Just the thought of so much exercise can be intimidating and off-putting. But how about 17 minutes of exercise?   This is a much more manageable slice of time and something that anyone can manage, which is why this program is so successful. Effective, targeted toning exercise - On top of the cardio, this weight loss plan incorporates 17 minutes of great exercises that will help you lose weight, flatten your belly, tone up your legs and beautifully firm your butt - perfect!â€ƒAfter the slim down, we will lead you forward into maintaining a much healthier new lifestyle that you can sustain, all clearly outlined in Chapter 14.  For now, let's just focus on getting ready to lose weight and discover a slimmer new you at last. 







Chapter 2: Get Ready for the 17-Day Slim Down Okay, time to prepare to change your life! There are a few simple and fun steps that you should take before embarking on the 17-Day Slim Down. Do not be tempted to skip these steps as they will encourage you and make the whole process far more enjoyable plus they will help you measure the success of the program. If you follow through all of these steps then you are going to guarantee your best chances of success on this diet.  Don't worry, there are only 3 steps for preparation. Step 1 - Get in the Right Mindset
A little mental preparation at this stage can make all the difference. Time think positive and quash any residual doubts.  How?  Get a pen and paper and write down your own answers to these questions: Why am I going on this 17-Day Slim Down? What are the potential pitfalls that I must avoid? What is my number one aim through doing this program? Answer these questions and clarify for yourself why you are going to follow the program.  As a final tip, check-off some of the many benefits of losing weight: Look better than you have done in years - younger, fitter and more attractive. Drastically cut your risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and other potentially fatal diseases. Enjoy fitting into your favorite smaller-size clothes again, or treating yourself to new ones - it is a real ego boost!  Feel more energetic and able to enjoy more activities. Eliminate toxins from your system with a high-fiber, high-water diet. Enjoy glowing skin and improve your complexion. Benefit from improved digestion - you may find that any internal issues you have been having simply melt away. Step 2 - Doing the 'Before' Body Prep Thinking about your body shape and vital statistics before you begin will provide inspiration throughout the 17 days: Measure Up Fun time! Take some measurements of your body before you begin. Then keep a record of them and see how you measure up after the 17 days. Simply take a tape measure and record the size of various areas of your body - you can keep a record of them here: BEFORE: Waist _______________________  Hips ________________________  Thighs _______________________  Calves _______________________  Upper arms____________________  AFTER: Waist _______________________  Hips ________________________  Thighs _______________________  Calves _______________________  Upper arms____________________  Take a Before and After Selfie Stay motivated throughout the program by taking a photograph of yourself at the start of the program.  Be honest (ditch the make-up and make sure it shows you in its full natural glory, when you may be looking and feeling and bit overweight, pasty and blurred around the edges).  Then, simply look forward taking another photo after the 17-Day Slim Down. You may be amazed at the difference in your appearance - a slimmer profile and a wonderful glow. Dig Out those 'Skinny Jeans' It is vital to keep your aims at the forefront of your mind when you are losing weight.  Open your wardrobe and unearth a piece of clothing that you want to be able to get into and hang it on the wardrobe door for a moment.  Wouldn't you look great - if you could just get into it?  Stay on track and soon you'll be wearing it! Step 3 - Get Ready to Shop! Nutrition is the most essential part of weight loss, period. This book provides you with a wide range of recipes that will have you feeling slim, happy and healthy in 17 days. The recipes are simple and you can stock up as you go along - there
is even a comprehensive shopping list and store-cupboard check-list.  Just choose your recipes, or opt to try every single one over 17 days if you prefer. Then, turn to Chapter 15, select the ingredients that you need and go shop! 







Chapter 3: Let's Begin! Great - it is time to get started! To keep things really simple, here's a clear breakdown of what you need to do over the next 17 days. Choose your meals. There are 17 meals for breakfast, 17 lunches, 17 dinners and 17 once-a-day snack options.  Simply pick a different one each day and work through all of them, or select your favorites and stick to those - whatever you find easiest. Of course, if you find that one or more of the dishes are not to your taste, don't worry at all.  Simply eat another one of the recipes or even substitute it for one of your own favorites. You just have to remember to keep it low in calories and high in fiber with a focus on fresh foods and wholegrains. Exercise is a very important part of the 17-Day Slim Down. Not everyone feels that they are well suited to exercise, but it is amazing how you can enjoy and benefit from just a few minutes every day.  In every area of the 17-Day Slim Down, 17 is the magic number!  In order to maximize your weight loss, you will therefore do 17 minutes of exercise, every morning and every evening, for 17 days.  Embrace it - you will feel great! This means that every morning, you will do 17 minutes of cardio.  In the next chapter we will look into the benefits that regularcardio offers and the various types of cardio that you can enjoy.  Every evening, you will carry out the body transformation toning exercises.
 These will give you a flatter stomach with more defined abs, better, more slender legs and a firmer, more toned butt.  Again, each set of exercise that you do will only take 17 minutes. You will rotate the toning exercises so that each part of your body - abs, legs, or butt - only gets exercised once every three days.  These rotations are crucial as they will ensure that the correct muscles are rested enough and can ultimately perform better, helping you to slim down. To find out more about the exercises that will get you into shape over the next 17 days - read on...







Chapter 4: Shed Those Pounds  Time to start moving more and getting rid of those excess pounds.  Carrying extra weight can make us look and feel less than our best, plus it is very bad for our health. Some leading doctors have claimed that if we could see how the unwanted fat was hampering our vital organs, we would act much more urgently.  Do you want to wait until you are ill?   Of course not.  Let's make a change, starting now. Exercise is a key part of that change and this program has a simple regime to follow.  First comes the cardio, which you will carry out every morning. But what exactly will it do for you? What is Cardio? Cardio is short for cardiovascular, which indicates that it is good for getting your heart going.  Also known as aerobic exercise, cardio really gets you moving about and really gets you out of breath as it is designed to get more oxygen into your blood. Sound worrying?   Not at all!  When you start to puff, your body will also be sending a load of feel-good hormones called endorphins around your body and serotonin will be creating a sweet natural buzz in your brain. This is genuinely exercise as pleasure, not pain.  In any case, it only last 17 minutes! Which Exercise to Choose There are endless cardio exercises to choose from. It does not have to be just running (although if you love it, do it), it can be any number of fun activities.  The only rule is - if it gets you moving, and healthily out of breath, then go for it! Here are some cardio exercise ideas, which are great fun, will get you moving, and which you can do in the morning for a burst of 17 minutes: Adult gymnastics to music Aerobics workout, medium to high energy Aqua aerobics, medium to fast-paced Capoeira Cycling Disco dancing, vigorous Flamenco dancing Hiking at a good pace in the great outdoors Hula hooping Ice skating, medium to fast Jazz dancing Just Dance computer game Kick-boxing home workout Nordic Walking, vigorous Off-road mountain biking Rollerblading Running Salsa
Skipping Swimming Tap-dancing, energetic Tango Trampolining Ultimate Frisbee Urban dance Walking, at least 3 mph Wii Tennis, Wii Fit etc Zumba So - just how much can you get done in only 17 minutes?   The answer is... plenty! You don't need hours to make an impact on your body. Make life easy for yourself, get your smartphone and set the time to exactly 17 minutes and then just get going...  Take a look at these sample cardio workouts based on the exercise options above and you will see how easily the 17 minutes can just fly by! Example 1 - Interval Training... in Just 17 Minutes This is easier when done to music, so turn up your besttunes loud - you might feel less inhibited if no one else is around!  Warm up by marching on the spot, lifting the legs high for one minute. Follow up with 10 jumping jacks, then drop and do a plank for 30 seconds. Repeat x2. Lift your right knee and bring your left elbow down to meet it, then swap sides - do this 20 times. Reach up to the sky and lift your knees as if you are climbing a rope for 30 seconds. Then drop and do a plank for 30 seconds. Repeat x3. Touch one foot with the opposite hand 20 times. Repeat x3. Do the box-step. Step left foot, then right foot forward, raising the corresponding arm. Then put your left foot and right foot back and lower the matching arm. Do this vigorously 15 times over. Go for a brisk walk, even if it is just around your own house. Swing your arms and take enthusiastic strides - if you have stairs to go up and down, this is even better. Do this for 5 minutes - make sure you keep moving. Return to your original spot and do 10 more jumping jacks. Now do the Grapevine. Stride sideways, crossing your steps and your arms as you scissor - 5 steps left then 5 steps right. Touch your toes, reach to the sky and then repeat x4. Stretch up to the ceiling as high as you can, then slowly bend from the waist to touch your toes. Uncurl your spine very slowly until you are upright again, then stop.  You're done! Example 2: Simple Swimming... for 17 minutes! These exercises are based on a 25-meter length pool, as not everyone is lucky enough to live within a short distance of an Olympic-sized pool of 50 meters.  Get into the water at the shallow end and start doing the front crawl. Do 5 laps. Now it's time to do some water-running. Stand on the floor of the pool and run as fast as you can towards the other end. The water resistance will slow you right down, but keep going.  When you are starting to get out of your depth, turn around and run back in the other direction. Keep water-running for a full 5 minutes, ending up back at the shallow end. Now do the back crawl for 5 laps; next do a final front crawl for 5 laps. If you are super-fast and have a minute or two left to spare, do some gentle stretching exercise against the wall.  Then - your time is up! Example 3 - Disco Dancing... for 17 Minutes!  This cardio is the easiest of the lot, as it will inevitably be done in your own inimitable style.  The instructions are very simple.  Put on your favorite pop music, nice and loud. Then - dance!   Wave those arms, move those feet and shake that booty without stopping for 17 minutes... and that's it!  Do any of these exercise and you will feel refreshed, younger, fitter and healthily worn out, which means you have burnt some serious calories.  Not a bad pay-off for just 17 minutes of exercise. 







Chapter 5: Get YOUR Flat Abs Super-trim and flat abs are many dieters' dream - but how do you achieve them? The answer is simple.  In conjunction with the foolproof weight loss food plan, you need to do some toning exercises to transform your body.  Remember to do these in the evening for 17 minutes, once every three days (between your thigh and butt workouts). Here's how to flatten those abs: Super Eights Grab a towel and sit tall in a chair with a hard-back.  Place your right arm straight down on the chair behind you and hold one end of the towel with your left hand. Lean forward and with your left hand, make a figure 8 over your head and down your left side. Do 8 to 10 reps, and then switch sides. Abdominal Hold Now sit tall on the edge of the chair with your hands on the edge of the seat and your fingers pointing to your knees. Tighten your abs and bring your toes 2 to 4 inches off the floor and lift your body off of the chair. Hold for as long as you can, shoot for 5 to 10 seconds. Lower yourself down and repeat. Continue this exercise for 1 minute. Beginners can keep one foot on the ground for additional support. Navel Pull-In Kneel on the floor in front of a chair with your knees hip-width apart. Bend forward at your waist and place your elbows on the chair. Breathe in and exhale, slowly contracting your navel in toward your spine. Pull your navel in and hold for 5 to 10 seconds. Do as many reps as you can each time, building up to 10 reps. Superman Raises Get on all fours, aligning your knees under your hips and hands under your shoulders. Lift your right arm to shoulder height and your left leg to hip height, hold for two counts. Reach forward with your fingers and back with your heel. Repeat this exercise on the opposite side. Do 20 reps, alternating sides. To burn a few more calories, touch your opposite elbow to your knee as you pull your arm and leg in. Leg Lifts Sit up with your back straight on the floor, with your legs stretched out and your toes pointing towards the ceiling. Slowly raise each leg as high as you can, pulling in your abdominal muscles, then lower it. Raise and lower the alternate leg. Repeat the set of raises 20 times.  Rest for 20 seconds... then repeat all of the exercises until the 17 minutes is up. Next Steps Don't forget, you will not do these exercises again for two days, because you will be working on your legs and butt, so put plenty of energy into it. There are also a few little tips you can use to help perfect your abs faster and more effectively, so read on... 5 Secrets to Flatter Abs!  The exercise that you will do, both cardio and toning, will take care of giving you a much better body. The food will certain help you shed the pounds. But what about those little tips that go beyond diet and exercise?  Here are few extra secrets for flatter abs: Don't eat late at night - This doesn't just mean takeaway pizza, don't eat any meals, however healthy, after 8pm.  This is because the body will find the late-night calories much harder to burn off and is more likely to hold onto the excess energy in the form of fat.  Guess where?   That's right, all around your waist.  Don't risk more belly fat, only eat before 8pm and try to drink just water and herbal tea after this time too. Keep on drinking lots of water - Most people suffer from dehydration on a daily basis, but have no idea why they feel sluggish and find the excess weight hard to shift.  Remember, we are 60% water. We need to keep ourselves constantly topped up in order to be able to enjoy peak health and lose maximum weight. Don't skip your snack - Always eat a light healthy snack in the afternoon. There is a great reason for this and it revolves around insulin.  A healthy snack boosts your metabolism and balances out your blood sugar. When you keep your blood sugar lower you keep your insulin levels lower.  Insulin needs to be kept low, because it is what tells your body to store fat around your waist. If you eat every 3 or 4 hours, you avoid the great peaks and troughs in your blood sugar levels, which are detrimental to your health. Chew well - Digestion begins long before you swallow. Chew your food properly, until it is ground into a paste in your mouth.  That way all the right enzymes can work on the food and start to break it down. If you do not chew your food properly, you are likely to suffer from indigestion and bloating, which work against you when you are trying to lose weight. Laugh a lot! - This is the most fun tip ever. The diet really will take care of the food side of shifting the weight for you, but this is one of the enjoyable little lifestyle changes that can really help.  Laughing - deep, spontaneous 'belly laughs' - are just that; they work your belly muscles.  You don't have to spend all day rolling around laughing at jokes (as if you had the time). However, being happy will actually help you to lose weight and studies have shown that feeling down causes people to eat more and exercise less effectively - so keep on laughing! That's your abs sorted, if you just stick to the plan. Now it is time to take a look at your butt... 







Chapter 6: Firm Up Your Butt Generally moving around more and doing your cardio every morning should seriously help to help tighten you up in this area.  However, these exercises are number one when it comes to toning and firming. Remember, you only do them for 17 minutes at a time. The following evening, you will do the leg exercises in the next chapter, then back to your abs after that and then these exercises again, three days later.  This constant rotation will keep you in ever-improving shape. Here's the fast route to a better butt: Single Glute Leg Lift Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Extend one leg, squeeze your glutes hard and pushing your hips up toward the ceiling as high as possible.  Pause, then lower your leg nearly to the floor (but not touching it), and then repeat x10. Doggy Kicks Kneel on all fours with your knees hip-width apart.  Lift your left knee back toward the ceiling, then extend the left foot straight out to the side. Wait a moment and then bend your knee again, and bring your leg back to starting position.  Repeat for one minute on the left side, and then switch to the right. Curtsy Kicks Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands on your hips.  Do a shallow curtsy, crossing your right leg behind you and stepping backward in a small dip.  Pause, and then extend your right leg into a side kick. Repeat for 1 full minute before you switch legs. Sumo Tippy Toes Start with your feet wide apart, toes pointed slightly outward, keeping your knees above your ankles and abs drawn in tight.  Push your knees back as far as you can and lower your hips toward the floor until your thighs are parallel with the ground.  Raise both heels off the ground in a slow and controlled way.  Pause, then slowly lower your heels. Repeat 10 times. Now stand and stretch your arms up high, then slowly touch your toes and hold the stretch.  Now repeat the whole butt routine 2 more times, or until the 17 minutes is up.  Treat your Behind Stay enthusiastic and reward your butt for its improved shape by taking good care of it.  Here are a few top-tips to ensure your butt is well-loved and primed to tighten and shrink: Try dry brushing Use a special soft bristle bath brush or natural loofah to brush the skin over your bottom.  This will not only exfoliate, ridding your of dead skin cells, it will also stimulate your circulation, which will help rid your body toxins, stored in fat.  Do some dry brushing every day and you will notice a difference, particularly in terms of softer, smoother skin. It's a Wrap A natural detoxifying wrap treatment can literally take inches off your behind and help to both break down cellulite and shift toxins.  A treatment that is available at most spas, it involves being covered in the treatment lotion or gel and wrapped tightly to let it penetrate the skin.  This would make a great treat to enjoy when you have completed all 17 days of your slim down - it's a truly relaxing, indulgent and healthy reward. 







Chapter 7: Want Lean Legs? Now for some great exercises to get those legs into fantastic shape. So many of us dislike our legs. We think they are too short, or too heavy, or showing signs of cellulite...  But have you ever thought that rather than hate them, you actually just under-use them? Legs are amazing, carrying us about everywhere and normally only tiring after the most strenuous activity.  We need to look after them.  Legs love to work hard - the more we give them to do, they are able to do.  The 17-Day Slim Down will help you to rediscover your wonderful legs and they will thank you by slimming down and improving their shape. Remember, on top of your daily cardio you only do the following leg exercises for 17 minutes, every three days. You simply rotate, working down the body - abs, butt, legs, abs, butt, legs and so on for 17 days. The leg exercises here are straightforward but highly effective. The trick is to do them as thoroughly as you can... and enjoy! Leg Lift Stand facing a chair and raise your right leg, knee facing up, foot flexed and place your heel on the seat. Do not lock your standing knee. Lift your right foot off the chair and straighten it out until you feel your quadriceps working hard.  Keep your lifted leg in the air, then bend the leg on the floor slightly and straighten it again. Repeat 15 times then switch sides and repeat for 1 full set. Do 3 sets. Jump Squat This move is great for quads and hamstrings. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and arms at your sides. Lower the body into a squat, going two-thirds of the way down.  Immediately jump straight up with your arms pointed up toward the ceiling. As soon as you land, start over with the next rep. Do 20 reps to make one set then rest for 15 seconds. Do 3 sets in total Split-Squat You will need small dumbbells - hold a 5lb dumbbell in each hand and keep your arms at your sides.  Stand with your left foot far forward and right foot far back. Bend both knees keeping the left knee over your ankle; lower the right knee nearly to the floor. Return to standing. Do 8 reps on each side. Side-Lift and Kick This is a harder move, but worth it. Lie on your right side, leaning your weigh onto your right elbow and tricep.  Bend your knees and lift the top bent leg, keeping it level, and then lower it. Straighten both legs and let one leg fall lower than the other.  Lower the bottom leg to about 1-2 inches from the floor with knees facing forward. Return to starting position to complete one rep. Do 30 reps, and then switch sides. Do all of these exercises to the max to enjoy the full benefits. When you have completed them all, take a rest for 30 seconds, then start over until 17 minutes are up. 5 Top Tips for Leaner Legs Here are a few extra tips to get your gets in slimmer shape - keep them in mind even after the 17 days are up. Take the stairs: We have evolved from being able to hunt animals for miles or to walk to find sources of water.  Elevators and escalators obviously came much, much later!   For fitter, leaner legs, always take the stairs when you can. You'll be amazed at how quickly your body gets used to it. Leave the car at home: It is not always possible, but when you have the option of driving and parking, or strolling to your destination, take the latter option. It will take longer, but the health benefits are worth it. Walk faster: When you are trying to get from A to B, even if it is just walking across a supermarket car park, try to pick up the pace.  This will work your legs harder and more often, which ultimately leads to slimmer legs. Use a standing desk: A modern solution to the problem that millions of us who are stuck at a desk all day face.  Essentially, this higher-level desk is designed to be used while standing, which keeps you more active, toned and burning more calories as well. Get some fresh air: Don't feel tied to your desk all day (even if it's a standing one).  Rediscover your local park and go for a brisk, 30-minute, leg-stretching walk every day before you eat your healthy Slim Down lunch. You won't believe the extra energy you feel and your body will think it's Christmas.  







Chapter 8: The VITAL Ingredient to Weight Loss Now we come to the most VITAL factor in your weight loss. VITAL as in Vitamins, Interesting ingredients, Tasty, Amino acid-packed, Life-giving goodness...  That's right - the all-important food! The 17-Day Slim Down is an easy-to-follow guide to a slimmer, happier, healthier you, which you can achieve by following a simple, nutritious and satisfying diet, based on sound, proven principles. Many people worry that going on a slimming program will leave them hungry and feeling cranky.  More than that, we have a deep-rooted fear of hunger - it's a primitive response to a lack of food and completely essential for our survival as species.  Any successful diet therefore needs not to trigger our survival instincts by underfeeding us.  The 17-Day Slim Down provides all the nutrition you need to feel great and lose weight, without the hunger pangs. The food plan offers plenty of choice and a real variety of healthy foods. Here's the lowdown on the main principles of the diet. Your 17-Day Food Plan This remarkably effective weight-loss plan is based on eating mainly whole, fresh foods. That means no processed foods, no high-salt foods, or food with added sugars.  It is a weight-loss plan that is designed to work with your system, not against it. This means avoid any foods that will aggravate your digestion or cause adverse reactions. For example, to minimize the risk of bloating, the 17-Day Slim Down largely excludes foods that typically form gas, which means no beans, cabbage, onions, peppers, cauliflower, brussel sprouts or dried fruit.  Some people also experience a bloating reaction when they eat apples, watermelon and chewing gum containing sorbitol, so avoid these at your discretion if this applies to you. Throughout the 17-day period, you also need avoid all alcohol and caffeine, so don't drink regular coffee or tea (herbal infusions and rooibos are fine) and make sure that you avoid all energy drinks. This might sound like quite a few things to avoid. The reality, though, is that you will have a great deal of freedom when it comes to choosing your meals during the 17-Day Slim Down.  Remember, as discussed earlier, you can select the meals you want from our wide selection for breakfast, lunch and dinner, plus you can enjoy a daily snack. You can eat the snack whenever you like, or even add it to one of your three meals if you prefer.  This much you already know. But you are in for a nice surprise when you see the food on offer. The meals in this plan are not designed to starve you skinny.  That would only backfire badly when, being totally ravenous, you start to each again and your body immediately stores fat. We have not evolved to waste away, our metabolic survival mechanisms can unfortunately work against us so that our bodies hold tightly onto every last calorie... This slimming plan is different. It is low in fat, high in fiber, both soluble and insoluble.  The insoluble fiber aspect is extremely important because this fiber is not digested in the stomach and small intestine, so it passes on into the colon, sweeping through it like a natural brush. Insoluble fiber soaks up water to form a soft bulky mass, which moves easily along the digestive tract.  Having a high-fiber diet, like this one which recommends whole foods, aids your digestion and also helps you to fill fuller for longer and for fewer calories, all of which greatly helps with weight loss. By only recommending whole foods healthy amounts and cutting out the empty calories in sugary, fatty or processed foods, not only will you not starve, but also you will receive all the best nutrients and plenty of fiber.  Your digestion will function properly and your metabolic rate, aided by the exercise you are doing, will increase. Ultimately, your body will respond favorably by dropping the pounds.  The Water Factor Drink a lot of water throughout the 17-Day Slim Down. Begin your day with a refreshing, rehydrating, cleansing glass of water and lemon, end the day with water, perhaps in the form of an herbal tea like chamomile and drink plenty of water all day long.  Water has countless benefits for the body.  First, it keeps you fully hydrated, which is essential for your body to function properly. It also flushes out toxins more effectively, plus it keeps your metabolism and digestion all fired up, which is the best news for anyone who is trying to lose weight.  Water fills you up so you are less tempted to snack, it quenches your thirst and best of all it contains zero calories. Make it your best friend through the whole of the next 17 days and beyond. Try to drink 6-8 large glasses each day. So now, back to the food. What is the best way to approach mealtimes during your 17-Day Slim Down so that it remains totally effective and enjoyable? Planning Your Meals This is a really easy and enjoyable part of the diet. You can browse through the all the various delicious recipes and meal ideas, simply selecting one breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack per day.  As there are plenty to choose from - 17 in each section - you can tailor the eating plan to your own tastes. If you have wide-ranging tastes, simply have a different breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack every day, or have the same few several times over - it's your call.  In any case, if you stick to the plan you will get the right nutritional balance to lose weight and a nice variety of foods to enjoy. To make planning your meals even easier, we have provided a full Shopping List, which contains everything you can possibly need for ALL the meals.  Buy it all and make every single meal over the course 17 days, or pick and choose depending on the particular meals you have selected - again, your call.  We have not specified strict amounts as that will depend on the choices you make and we do not want you to over-buy unnecessarily.  To make things easier still, at times in the meal plan, we will specify that you need to eat 1 portion of fruit. We do not dictate which fruit this must be as everyone has their own particular favorites.  Instead, we also provide some Fruit Portions, which lists some suggestions as to which fruits you might like to snack on, along with the recommended portion size.  This is not an exhaustive list, but it can be helpful when you want to know, for example, how many grapes you would be advised to eat as your fruit portion.  To keep things really simple, of course all of these fruits are also included in the main shopping list, for ease of reference. One additional point about your shopping. Do try to go for the best quality fresh ingredients that you can afford. This does not necessarily have to mean the most expensive, although if you choose to go organic this normally comes with a higher price tag. If you can afford go organic, do. There has been some debate about whether eating organic produce is any different to eating regular fruit and vegetables. In truth, most of the time it really is different.  Organic fruit and vegetables have been grown without the farmer using any chemicals - no artificial fertilizers or pesticides - and in accordance with very strict guidelines.  This results in virtually unadulterated organic fruit and veg which has been proven to be much higher in antioxidants and much lower in its levels of toxins, metals and pesticides. In a brief summary of some of the findings of the Organic Trade Association, they have found that growing organically really does make a measurable difference to the composition of the produce when compared to conventionally grown fruit and vegetables.  In a famous study, the significantly higher levels antioxidants in organic crops included: 19% higher levels of phenolic acids 69% higher levels of flavanones 28% higher levels of stilbenes 26% higher levels of flavones 50% higher levels of flavonols 51% higher levels of anthocyanins These antioxidants have been shown to lower the risk of heart disease, brain diseases and certain cancers. If you switch to eating only organic fruit and vegetables, you will enjoy a 20-40% increase in the antioxidants you consume, without upping your calorie intake.  This phenomenal antioxidant pay-off (in addition to on average 48% less of carcinogenic metal cadmium) is a pretty good reason to consider going organic when you set off with the Shopping List in Chapter 15!   Fruit Portions As outlined earlier in the book, this list gives you a selection of roughly equivalent fruit portions, for when '1 portion fruit' is specified in your meal plan. Choose your favorites, but try to keep your choices varied if possible. 1 apple 4 apricots 1 banana 1 cup mixed berries 1 cup blueberries 2 figs 1Â½ cups fresh fruit salad Â½ grapefruit 12 grapes 1 guava 1 kiwi fruit Â½ mango 1 cup melon 1 orange 4 passion fruit 1 cup pawpaw 1 peach 1 pear 4 rings pineapple 2 plums 3 prunes 2 satsumas 1Â½ cups strawberries 1 slice watermelon

Squashed Chicken  This recipe is not named after flattened poultry, but because it contains both butternut squash and gem squash. Both vegetables are a friend to anyone who is trying to lose weight.  Butternut squash boasts a lot of antioxidants and vitamins for very few calories. Gem squash is also low in calories and has a high water content so is great for when you are slimming down. It is also packed with carotene, ideal for warding off a wide range of diseases including heart disease.  4 skinless chicken breasts 2 butternut squashes, halved and de-seeded 2 gem squashes halved and de-seeded 4 medium tomatoes, halved 2 tbsp olive oil A pinch of cinnamon  A large handful of torn fresh cilantro Method: Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Sprinkle the butternut squash with a little cinnamon. Place them, along with the gem squashes, on baking trays and drizzle all with half the oil. Leave them in the oven to roast. After 20 minutes drizzle the chicken breasts with the remaining oil and place on another baking tray, along with the tomatoes, for at least 25 minutes. When the chicken is done, remove everything from the oven. Take chunky scoops of butternut and gem squash with a spoon, pile them on each plate with the tomatoes and chicken and scatter plenty of fresh coriander over the dishes, then serve.  







Whole-wheat Crab Cakes This is as healthy a version of crab cakes as you will ever find. Crab is a delicious seafood which is bursting with protein and full of omega-3 fatty acids. Better still, it is only 82 calories per 3 ounces and it tastes absolutely wonderful! This recipe ups the fiber content by using whole-wheat breadcrumbs and serving a fresh salad on the side. Don't skip the squeeze of lime as it brings out the crab flavor beautifully and adds a welcome dash of vitamin C. To Make 6 Crab Cakes: 1lb crabmeat 1 egg, lightly beaten Â½ cup whole-wheat panko-style breadcrumbs Â½ cup extra-light mayo 2 tbsp chives, finely chopped 1 tbsp Dijon mustard 1 tbsp lemon juice 1 tsp celery seed Â¼ tsp freshly ground pepper 4 dashes hot sauce, such as 2 tablespoon canola olive oil To serve: 1 cucumber 2 handfuls of lettuce leaves 4 medium tomatoes 2 limes Method: Mix the crab, egg, breadcrumbs, mayonnaise, chives, mustard, lemon juice, celery seed, pepper and hot sauce in a large bowl. Form the mixture into 6 patties. Heat the canola oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook the patties until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. While they are cooking, take a vegetable peeler and peel down the whole length of the cucumber to make thin ribbons. Pile onto the plate with torn lettuce leaves and wedges of the tomato.  Serve the crab cakes as soon as they are ready, with the side salad and Â½ a lime to squeeze over your food. 







Japanese Steak Stir Fry Choose the leanest cut of skirt steak that you can find for this enticing oriental recipe, which will fill you up with fresh flavors. Don't forget to add the cashews at the end - they are high in anti-oxidants and far lower in fat than many other types of nut. Â½ lb skirt steak 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 2 tbsp lime juice 1 tsp olive oil 2 Â½ cups diagonally cut asparagus 1 tbsp fresh ginger peeled and grated 1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce 2 tsp sesame oil 1 tbsp lime juice 2 cups cooked brown rice Â½ cup chopped fresh cilantro 2 tbsp chopped cashews Method: Cut steak crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick strips. Toss together with garlic, and 2 tablespoons lime juice; marinate the steak for 15 minutes.  Heat 1/2 teaspoon olive oil in a wok or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook the steak with the marinade, stirring constantly, for 2-3 minutes or until medium-rare; transfer with slotted spoon to a large bowl, and set aside.  Add 1/2 teaspoon olive oil and asparagus to wok; cook, stirring, for about 4 minutes or until tender. Put steak back into the wok. Add the ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon lime juice to wok and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes or until heated through. Add cooked brown rice to the wok and heat for 2 minutes. Divide the stir-fry among 4 plates, and scatter chopped cilantro and chopped cashews on top then serve.  







Seasoned Pork with Kale Pork tenderloin is typically wonderful in flavor and very lean. These seasonings blend together to make a terrific rub, which delivers a whole heap of vibrant added taste without piling on lots of unwanted calories. The meat goes perfectly with some freshly steamed kale and wholegrain rice. Serves 4 1 1/4 pounds pork tenderloin 1 tsp garlic powder 1 tsp dried oregano 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp dried thyme 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp minced garlic A large pinch of salt To serve: 12 large kale leaves, chopped 2 cups wholegrain rice Method:  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. In separate bowl mix dry ingredients such as garlic powder, oregano, cumin, coriander, thyme and salt. Stir the mixture with a fork until all the ingredients are well combined and they form a seasoning.  Put a pan of water on another ring and bring it to the boil. Sprinkle the seasoning rub over the tenderloin with a dry hand, then rub the pork with the seasoning over both sides of the meat, pressing gently so the seasoning sticks well to the surface of the tenderloin. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and heat.  Add the minced garlic and sautÃ©, stirring, for 1 minute.  Add the tenderloin in the pan and brown it to seal in the juices for about 10 minutes, searing each side and carefully using tongs to turn the meat.  When the water is boiling, put in the cups of wholegrain rice and leave to cook for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, transfer the meat to a roasting pan and bake for 20 minutes.   While the pork is cooking, steam the kale for 4 minutes. When the tenderloin is ready, slice it into thick medallions and serve with the kale and rice.   







Chapter 12: Snacking Options You main meals will feel you up and give you the perfect balance of nutrition. However, you still need to enjoy a daily snack to keep your metabolism running at its best.  Another reason why this weight loss plan is so great - the delicious, nutritious daily snacks! Pick one of these 17 snacks each day and ideally enjoy it between lunch and dinner: 3 wholegrain crackers, lightly spread with a mixture of smoked mackerel, mashed with fat-free plain yoghurt and seasoned with pepper. Half a small whole-meal roll, toasted and topped with low-fat cottage cheese. 1 piece of fruit from the Fruit Portions list. 150ml fat-free plain yoghurt. CruditÃ©s - raw cucumber, carrot, celery and radish, as much as you like - with a tablespoon of reduced fat hummus as a dip. A nice hot bowl of organic miso soup - the packets are available from good health stores and supermarkets. A rye crispbread topped with a sliced tomato and a tablespoonful of low-fat cottage cheese. 5 spears of asparagus, drizzled with a very little olive oil, then roasted in a 350Â°F oven for a few minutes until just tender. Sprinkle with a little salt and eat as a great hot snack. Enjoy a bowl of quick vegetable broth. Boil a two bowlfuls of water. Toss in an organic chicken stock cube. Chop 1 large carrot, some broccoli florets, a few mushrooms and two celery stalks and them to the stock and simmer until tender and the stock has reduced a little. Season with pepper and any fresh herbs you have to hand, then serve.  Have a roast cauliflower treat. Take 5-7 florets of cauliflower         and drizzle them with light olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch         of salt and pepper. Place in a roasting dish in an oven pre-          heated to 350Â°F for 15-20 minutes or until they are lightly         golden brown and tender. Eat immediately (mind your         tongue)! Enjoy a super-healthy green smoothie. Blend a handful of kale, a few leaves of baby spinach, a cup of unsweetened coconut water, 1 green apple and a few cubes of ice. When it is blitzed and smooth, drink cold.  Eat a large handful of super-antioxidant blueberries, topped with a tablespoon of thick, fat-free Greek yoghurt. Baked mushrooms - Take 2 large mushrooms, stuff them with cherry tomatoes, drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook in a hot oven for 15-20 minutes until tender and the tomatoes are oozing juice, then eat. Try 2/3 of a tablespoon of mixed seeds that includes pumpkin, sesame, sunflower seeds and more for some delicious healthy fats. If you fancy a delicious sweet treat, try a vanilla and banana smoothie. Blend half a banana with Â¼ cup on fat-free vanilla yogurt and a few cubes of ice for a gorgeous drink. Stuffed figs: take two small dried figs and stuff them with 1 tablespoon reduced-fat ricotta. Sprinkle with a little cinnamon and eat. Make some apple chips, with no added sugar. Preheat the oven to 200 F. Thinly slice two apples crosswise about 1/8-inch (2 mm) thick with a mandolin or sharp knife. Arrange apple slices in a single layer on baking sheets. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of cinnamon evenly over apple slices. Bake for 2 hours or until apples are dry and crisp, then eat. They can also be made in larger batched and stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days.       







Chapter 13: Accelerate the Weight Loss So, you have everything you need to lose weight over the next 17 days... but maybe you still want more?   As with any weight loss program, you can take the 17-Day Weight Loss plan to the max by taking note of a few little tips that will help to accelerate the weight loss: Keep the carbs to a minimum This is by no means a carb-free diet as we believe in the proven power of high-fiber wholegrains. However, you do not need to have too much of these filling starches.  If you would like to lose weight more quickly, then cut the portion size of the starchy carbs like wholegrain rice etc in half. You won't go hungry - just top up your plate with the lower-calorie green carbs like kale and spinach. Keep your metabolism running
well Certain small daily changes to your routine can add up to a far more active metabolism. Do try to stay on the move, don't sit all day - get up stretch and walk around. Check that you are taking 10,000 steps This is the recommended number of steps that any person is supposed to take per day to remain fit and active. It is a great way of measuring whether you are moving around enough generally, in addition to your 17-minute exercises.  If you fit in 10,000 steps as well, the weight will just drop off! To see whether you are on track you can... Use an activity tracker
 You must have seen these - at first glance they look like a watch but they are in fact a great bit of wearable tech.  Activity trackers, like Garmin Vivofit, Microsoft Band or the FitBit can monitor all kinds of areas directly related to your health including the amount of exercise you take, the calories you burn, the speed you walk, the quality of your sleep... and yes, the amount of steps that you take every day. Use this kind of gadget when you find it hard to keep tabs on just how much you are moving around. Also, think of the extra motivation that you will gain from learning how many calories you are burning.  You can sync these devices with apps like My Fitness Pal or similar, so that you can input what you eat - but that is not required for this 17-Day Slim Down. Simply use it to check you have hit the golden 10,000 steps and make it a healthy no-brainer.  Swap your Fruit Portions for Veg Fruit is a natural miracle and we love it. Eaten as part of a healthy diet, it will fill you with vitamins and fiber, refresh you and help you lose weight.  However, there is no denying that fruit does contain natural sugars, in the form of fructose. This is a sugar that the body copes with well, but it means that gram for gram, a fruit is likely to be higher in calories than a green vegetable. You will lose weight on the 17-Day Slim Down just as it is, and you will also enjoy the range of flavors. But if you want to take a slightly stricter approach which may help you shed a few more pounds, then try replacing some of the fruit portions with salad vegetables - celery sticks, for example, or an undressed watercress and cucumber salad, or a few radishes.  These have a high water content, lots of fiber and a very low calorie count. So tuck in!  







Chapter 14: After the 17 Days... So, you have successfully completed the 17-Day Slim Down.  Congratulations! You will be looking and feeling much fitter, slimmer and healthier all round.  Don't believe us?  Well not only can you hop on the scales to check how many pounds you have lost, but we advise that you also take a celebratory 'After' selfie.  Remember the photo that you took at the start of the 17 days. Take one right now and compare and contrast. Do you look different, perhaps a little less blurry around the edges? Leaner, meaner and more prepared for an active demanding life? Great! But one still question remains... what happens now that the 17 days are up? The answer is, that's up to you!   You can stop the plan, although ideally you will carry on enjoying all the great benefits of this program by maintaining the key elements of the diet and exercise. As long as you continue to keep the calories low and the fiber and exercise levels high, you will not regain weight. Better still, why not continue with the principles of the 17-Day Slim Down and, if you need to, continue to lose weight?    This is a diet that really does delivery the double-whammy - you can use it as a quick-fix to drop some unwanted pounds in the healthiest way possible, or you can adapt it into a longer-term plan.  To make sure that the weight stay off, remember the keep principles of the plan and stick with them - high fiber, high water, low calorie, low fat. Eat minimal processed food and get moving too. Stick with these key ideas and your body will keep on thanking you in return. As your body continues to slim down after the 17 days, you may find you need even fewer carbs and can reduce the wholegrain rice, noodles or other carbohydrates by a third or even by half.  You may also wish to gradually reintroduce some of the eliminated foodstuffs, like onions, beans or cabbage, if you like them and they do not give you an adverse reaction. You may want to change up the cardio exercises so that you get maximum variety - keep on burning more calories than you eat and you will continue to be in even more fabulous shape.  No need to stop doing the body transformation exercises either. If you want to stay in shape, keep on toning your abs, legs and butt with the suggested workouts, or add in new ones. Even if you need to slash the 17 minutes to 10, just do it! Apart from that, just keep going!  When you reach your ideal weight, don't go back to your 'old' ways, just slightly increase portion sizes and allow yourself a bit more flexibility and the occasional 'off-menu' treat - but do keep up the exercise.
