ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Ann Everett writes mysteries, new adult romance, and
romantic comedy with a dose of Texas twang and Southern sass. She lives in
Northeast Texas, where she drinks too many Diet Dr. Peppers, and bakes tons of
sweets.
 
Five things Ann's bio doesn't mention:
 
1. She's been married to the same man since dirt.
2. She loves to shop at thrift stores.
3. She hates talking on the phone.
4. A really sharp pencil makes her happy.
5. She's thankful wrinkles aren't painful.

INTRODUCTION
Verb,n.Grammar.
 
The key word in most sentences that reveals what is
happening. It can declare something...She looked, or ask a question...Did
she look?
Good definition, but why say She looked, if she can
gawk, spy, or examine? The familiar choice offers vague action, where the
stronger selection gives action and expression. Let's consider other examples.
In place of...He felt, use caressed, groped, fumbled.
Why write Mary took when fetched, scooped, or heaved
are better descriptions?
The detective pushed doesn't show as much as the
detective rammed, elbowed, or propelled.
If we didn't have verbs, where would a story go? Nowhere.
Characters, animals, and nature can't be or do anything without a
verb. Characters can't laugh, animals can't attack, and trees can't sway in the
breeze. Verbs provide excitement, drive the narrative and paint a vivid picture
in the readers' mind.
Verbs also determine when something happens, in the present,
in the past, or in the future. They set the tense of your tale. Here are some
examples:
Present tense — I/you/we/they drink — he/she/it
drinks
Past tense — I/you/he/she/it/we/they drank
Future tense — I/you/he/she/it/we/they will drink
Present perfect tense — I/you/he/she/it/we/they have
drunk
Past perfect tense — I/you/he/she/it/we/they had
drunk
Future perfect tense — I/you/he/she/it/we/they will
have drunk
Using Strong Verbs, Strong Voice, authors can quickly
replace dull, and over used verbs, giving their stories more punch and verve.
Remember, you can add an s/es/ing/ed OR remove "ed" depending on the tense
you're using.
In rough/first drafts, I use common verbs. Once I'm done
with my manuscript, I take chapter by chapter, and do a word search replacing
them with stronger choices.
ONE LAST THING
For years, I gave part of this list as a hand-out when I
spoke to writers' groups. I've received many emails stating how the
substitutions proved helpful to recipients. This book is meant as a starting
point for using more colorful and active verbs. I hope STRONG VERBS; STRONG
VOICE will become one of your favorite resources.

LIE/LAY
 
Do you get confused about when to use lie or lay? You're not
alone! I like to simplify by saying if it's a person reclining, it's always lie,
but if you're placing something, it's lay. Most of the time that
simplification will work...but it really has to do with having an object or not.
For instance, in my definition, you'd think Now I lay me down to sleep
is wrong and should be Now I lie me down to sleep because "I" is
reclining...BUT in this example "ME" is the object, so lay is correct.
Remember in order to use lie and lay correctly, lie is a "to
be" verb without an object and means to recline or rest. Lay means to place,
put, or set something down (an object) like a book, cup, or eye glasses, etc.
You can solve the dilemma by choosing a stronger verb!
Of course in dialogue, your characters can use lie and lay
incorrectly unless they are supposed to be smart enough to know the rule!

SAID/ASKED
 
Don't misunderstand. There is nothing wrong with using said
or asked in your tag/attribution. As a matter of fact, many think
it's better to use those instead of other synonyms. But, sometimes a different
word choice conveys more. If your character is southern, you may want her to
drawl. If they're drunk, they may need to slur or lisp.
