Much of the world today still depends on 10 fingers, 2 hands touch typing for keyboarding speed and accuracy.

Keyboarding Typing Questions & Answers



A
 . Am I hunt and pecking or touch typing
 ?
Hunt peck typing is a lousy, much slower pace form of locating keys whereby keys have to be located by sight before pressing the keys. Hunt peck typing is also using the same two fingers to locate keys visually in order to type. Touch-typing
 means you look at the screen and not your fingers as you type with speed and accuracy.











B. Why should I practice on a paper computer keyboard?


Printable paper computer keyboards give you a practice head start on learning correct hands and fingers placement for touch typing. This makes it a lot easier when you do get in front of a computer screen to learn to touch type.
C. People type anywhere and in many different environments nowadays, so why is typing posture important?
Whether standing to type or sitting to type, good typing posture and correct hands and fingers placement maximizes speed and accuracy plus prevents strain and injury.

D. What is so important about home row keys?


The home row is the middle row of keys on the keyboard that you use as important guide keys. The home row keys are a s d f j k l ;
 and there is usually a ridge on the f and j home row keys to let you know where your fingers are. Placing your hands and fingers correctly over the home row keys is what typing teachers call "home row position. It is of upmost importance to get to know the home row keys locations so well that you do not need to look at your fingers on the keyboard.

 . Good Typing Tip - Napkin or Coin

B
. Make Capital Letters - Shift Keys


C
. Shift Keys Practice









Did You Know?

Masses of people work on a digital keyboard throughout a standard 8-hour workday.  By using keyboard shortcut keys, there are 8 entire workdays that can be saved every year.



Type Smarter
 : Shortcut keys help provide an easier and quicker 
 method of navigating and executing computer software commands. For example, the caps lock shortcut key is pressed to type a group of alphabets in all capital letters all at the same time, like HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

















Sess
 ion 3                                   


Shift Keys - How To Type A Capital Letter

Now that you know how to correctly touch type the home row—asdf jkl, it is time to move on and learn how to make a capital letter. There is a shift key on the right and one on the left that are used to make a capital letter. Hold down the shift key and then press the desired alphabet key.

Important
 : The shift key to press with the right or left little pinky finger depends on what alphabet you are typing. Use the right shift key to make a capital for alphabets controlled by the left hand. For keys controlled by the right hand, use the left shift key.

Example
 : To make the letter A capital, press down the right shift key and then type the letter A.

Note
 : Shift keys are also used to make a symbol located on top of the number keys. Example: To make the sign at @ used in an email address, press the right shift key, then type the number 2 key. To better understand how to correctly use the two shift keys, view a couple of very short videos on YouTube like these.

Keyboarding Typing Terminology To Know


1. F and J Ridge Lines
The ridges located at the bottom of the F and J computer keys are there to help users find the correct keys without looking down. The reason why only the F and J keys have ridges is to help users place their hands and fingers in the correct typing position.

2. Caps Lock Key
 - a toggle key that if pressed by mistake will cause letters to appear in all capital letters. To turn off the letters appearing in all capitals, toggle or press the caps lock key again.


3. Text Wrapping
-
no need to press the ENTER key--text automatically goes to the next line as when taking a typing timed writing test

Did You Know?


 A school that uses this typing book is called Tech Academy. The academy specializes in motivating and training absolute beginners, the tech resistant, and populations that grew up without using computers.
With their new touch-typing skills, the academy's reformed hunt and peckers are no longer ashamed to type in front of paying customers. Learners benefit by typing their own school papers and preparing their own personal use documents. Individuals who used to be digitally disadvantaged or ashamed of their typing are now able to happily Internet connect with businesses, entertainment sites, and their family and friend groups whenever they want to--without bothering others or having to pay for typing help.


















Website Lesson Completion Guide            Session 4


Enter online keyboarding practice website.

Go to www.typing.com.
Look for the LOG IN tab.
Enter your email address and the password.


Suggestion 1
-
LESSON COMPLETION
 : Complete all the lines in each lesson. If a few lines or half a lesson is completed, the software will not save it as a completed lesson. It may take 15 to 18 minutes for an absolute beginner to complete a lesson.


Suggestion 2 - REPEAT OR GO TO NEXT LESSON
: Yes, a lesson can be repeated several times. If you are backspacing a lot to correct errors, this is a good indication that a lesson needs to be rekeyed before going on to the next lesson.

Tips for avoiding software malfunction

Tip 1 - CAPS LOCK KEY
:
 If the keyboarding classroom software locks up while you are typing, press the CAPS LOCK key to unlock the software. On some computers, a light shows up next to the caps lock key when it is on. If you press the caps Lock key again, this will start things back working. The caps lock key is a TOGGLE key, which means press it to turn it on and press it again to turn it off.

Tip 2 -
RED LINE
 : This means the keyboard letter needs to be typed in order to move on.

Tip 3
- END OF LINE:
 Press the ENTER key to go to a new line.

Session 9



How to Type Faster and




Master the Keyboard


The best 17 tips and techniques to select from that can help enhance your typing skills: Choose 9 that can work for you.

 
Slow -
 What really helped me improve my typing speed is slowing down and getting a feel for the keys. First get good at knowing where the keys are then speed up and it will be like riding a bike!

 
Your Name -
 My tip to improve your typing speed is to type your name over and over. After that type any word that comes to your mind over and over. If you keep it up you will know a lot of words and suddenly you will find your typing speed shot up.

Music -
 My tip to improve your typing speed is to just find 
 some music that is fast paced, to your liking, and FUN! After you have found a catchy and fast tune you can start. You'll find your hands vibrating with restlessness. Next thing you know you'll be hitting high speeds and maybe high accuracy with it.










Breathe -
 My tip is to breathe. If I hold my breath while typing my accuracy decreases, not to mention my WPM. Breathe in and out deeply before beginning the test and be sure to breathe throughout the test. Increasing oxygen to the brain makes the whole body function more accurately...including the fingers!



Pinky Fingers -
 Everyone says it, but going slow seems to help. I'm working on correcting some bad habits I've developed over 20+ years of typing, and using this site - even for the short time that I have - has been extremely helpful. I'm just going to have to be patient with myself and focus on getting these pinky fingers in the game!



F and J -
 What helped is I kept on doing the same one until I got the keys down. So, I started on the f and j keys and went forward from there. That is what helped me and I'm only 16 and now I can type at 60 WPM.

15 Minutes -
 My tip to improve your typing speed is to...practice daily for at least 15 minutes. It has been around 50 days I have started practicing touch typing. It took me at around 15 - 20 days to memorize the keys and then I was able to type without actually looking at the keyboard. My speed was around 5 WPM at that time, and I was constantly practicing daily for
about 1 hour, and I gradually increased my typing speed to 9 WPM... 13 WPM... 18 WPM...25 WPM... 31 Wpm. And then actually I started practicing for 15 - 20 minutes daily and today I made it to 32.33 WPM.



It's OK -
 What really helped me improve my typing speed is... I 
 make sure that I take my time and not to be too hard on myself when I mess up. I learned that self-doubt is your worst enemy and that messing up is okay!




Accuracy First -
 My tip to improve your typing speed is to concentrate more on accuracy than speed.... It helps much more than increasing your speed.... I've increased my speed by 15 WPM in just 7-10 days in this method.



TV Tray -
 What really helped me improve my typing speed is typing at a lower table, so that my arms are more level. I put my keyboard on a TV tray whenever possible.

Weakest Key Help -
 Type out a few paragraphs... note the letters that you are slow writing or often make mistakes with, and DRILL those letters. When speaking of teams, the saying goes ¨We are only as strong as our weakest link¨. Well, I am here to tell you the same concept applies to typing. You are only as fast as your slowest letter.


Common Words -
 My tip to improve your typing speed is to practice common words. For example, there are many words that have "ing" endings. There are usually common words like and, to, and the. Get into the flow of being able to type common words and endings like these quickly without error.




Mistake Patterns Correction-
 My tip to improve your typing speed is to... fine the patterns of mistakes that you often make, and improve on those. For me, for whatever reason, it's the word "practice". I always want to make the p, a capital p, even if it's 
 the middle of the sentence. It took a while but the sensation to do so is slowly going away.



Your Activities of Daily Living Fulfillment -
 My tip to improve your typing speed is to...hey! hi everyone here is the first suggestion I've posted after reading so many! First, I want to say that before I move on which I will, it is important to attend to the details of daily living, fulfilling the roles we've taken on.

Visualize -
 My tip to improve your typing speed is to...visualize the keyboard in your head to prevent you from looking down at it too often as this slows you down.








Kindergarten -
 Teach your kids to type at a young age, I learned when I was in kindergarten and they hid the actually placement of the keys so I learned where each letter was by memory.

Touch Type -
 My tip to improve your typing speed is to learn proper 10-finger touch typing form. The hunt-and-peck method can only go so far, whereas 10 fingers can blaze through text at any speed.







THE AUTHOR
I have taught thousands of people how to type fast and accurate.  Karen, who works in a dream career,  saw me recently and came over with a big smile to say that  the skills and confidence acquired in  my digital keyboarding course helps tremendously everyday, especially  with her new work from home dream career.   Karen tells me that her brilliant son, Carlton,  completed my digital keyboarding class, too. Whether you are a student, parent, business owner, developer,  Internet user, or absolute beginner,  the goal is to have you to complete your own keyboarding activities faster, better, more accurately.
When off work as  president of the non-profit--1Byte Computer Literacy, Inc., I periodically publish Bible Friends and Vacation Bible School literature. My favorite hobbie involves serving as a chocolate chip cookie imagineer.
