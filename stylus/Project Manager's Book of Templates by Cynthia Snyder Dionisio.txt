Introduction


The project management profession is evolving rapidly. We have moved from methods that were purely predictive (aka waterfall development) or adaptive (Agile), to a more blended or hybrid approach. In fact, today more than 50% of projects are practicing formal or informal hybrid project management.
A Project Manager's Book of Templates provides templates that address project artifacts for predictive management, such as a schedule management plan and a lessons learned register; as well as templates for adaptive and Agile project management, such as a requirements backlog and release plan.
Another shift in the project management profession is that more and more often we are accountable for project and business results. To help you with that, you will find business templates for a business case, startup canvas, project proposal, and other templates to help you present business and strategy level information to senior level stakeholders.


AUDIENCE
This book is written for project managers in traditional fields, such as construction and system implementation, as well as project managers in the digital domain, such as software development, digital product management, and high‐tech. Because the book is tactical rather than theoretical, it can be used by novice and advanced practitioners, academia, test prep, and as an on‐demand reference.
Those new to project management can use the templates as a guide in collecting and organizing project information. Experienced project managers can use the forms as a template so that they collect a set of consistent data on all projects. In essence, these templates save reinventing the wheel for each project.
A secondary audience is the manager of project managers, a project management office, and program managers. Using the information in this book ensures a consistent approach to project documentation. Adopting these forms on an organizational level will enable a repeatable approach to project management.
This book does not teach project management concepts or describe how to apply project management techniques. Textbooks and classes can fulfill those needs. This book provides an easy way to apply good and consistent practices to projects.


ORGANIZATION
Content in this book is structured to align with the type of work we do on projects. For example, we do some planning, we track information with registers, and we have lots of project documents to help us stay organized. These are the sections in this book:

Starting the Project. Templates in this section are used to address business needs, provide high‐level information, and authorize the project. Examples include the project charter and a vision statement.
Project Plans. Templates in this section support developing plans that will be used to guide project delivery. You will find templates for a risk management plan, release plan, change management plan, and many others.
Project Documents. Project documents help us develop and organize information we need for the project. There are many document templates, including estimating worksheets, requirements traceability matrix, and user stories.
Logs and Registers. Logs and registers are updated throughout the project. They help us keep track of dynamic aspects of our projects. You will find templates such as a backlog, stakeholder register, and assumption log.
Reports and Audits. To help track and report on the project we can use various project reports and conduct audits on specific aspects of the project. In this section, you will find a procurement audit, quality report, and project closeout report, among others.

Each template includes a description of the elements included in the template and a sample form that shows how those elements may be arranged. Every template should be tailored and modified to meet your needs. The description and sample templates are here to provide you with ideas to help you collect and manage the information needed to make your project a success.
Most template descriptions follow this format:

A description of the template is presented along with a list of contents. For the planning forms, there is a description of where the information comes from and where it goes to.
A section that presents information you can consider for tailoring the templates to fit your needs.
An alignment section that presents related templates that you will want to make sure are aligned.
A description table that identifies each of the fields in the template along with a brief explanation.
A blank copy of the template.

I have also included an appendix that has some samples of combined templates. In the tailoring section, I have made some suggestions on how you can tailor a template by combining it with another. The appendix does not talk you through the details for the templates because the information is available where the templates are first discussed.
As I am sure you know, not all templates will be needed on all projects. Use the templates you need, to the degree that you need them. I hope you find value in the templates I have included in this book.











1Starting the Project


There is no doubt that starting a project off right is the first step in delivering a successful project. Because projects vary greatly in size, methodology, criticality, and stakeholders, there are several ways you can compile and document the initial project information.
The templates in this section document high‐level information that is later elaborated in project plans and project documents. Templates that are commonly used to document the initial project information include

Project proposal
Business case
Project startup canvas
Vision statement
Project charter
Project brief
Project roadmap

The project proposal, business case, and project startup canvas are usually developed prior to a project being formally approved. They have information that helps relevant stakeholders determine if the need for and benefits of the project justify the investment of time, budget, and resources. These templates may be developed by a project sponsor because the project has not yet been approved and a project manager has not been identified.
The vision statement, project charter, and project brief templates are typically completed once a project has been approved. They provide a high‐level view of the project. They may be developed by the project sponsor, the project manager, or by both of them working together.
A project roadmap takes information from the previous documents and creates a summary level graphic display of information. It is developed by the project manager.
Most projects are good with using two or three of these templates to get the project started. Much of the information in these templates is found in multiple templates. Therefore, you should determine the best template for your project and then tailor it to meet the needs of your project by editing, combining, or revising the template.
Project startup templates are usually developed once, before, or shortly after the project is authorized. They provide information on the business environment, justification for the project, financial expectations, and high‐level information about the project. If there is a significant change in the environment or the project, the need for the project may be revisited and these documents may be updated.


1.1 PROJECT PROPOSAL
The project proposal is a proposition that describes an opportunity, a solution to a problem, or an approach for undertaking a mandatory project. Ideally, it is no more than one or two pages. A project proposal provides information about the environment, why a project is needed, and presents the proposed response and approach for the project. It is used to provide high‐level information so decision makers can determine if the project should be undertaken.
Typical information includes

Executive summary
Project background
Solutions and approach
Financial information
Resource requirements
Conclusion

It may provide information to

Business plan
Project startup canvas
Project charter
Project brief
Project roadmap

It is developed once, and then only changed if there are significant changes in the market, the environment, or the need.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the project brief to meet your needs:

For new product development projects, you can combine the vision statement with the project proposal.
For smaller projects, the project proposal and business case may be combined.
If there is relevant research or studies, this information can be included in an appendix.

For hybrid projects, you may include information on methodologies that will be used to deliver effectively.


Alignment
The project brief should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Business case
Vision statement
Project startup canvas
Project charter
Project brief
Project roadmap

It is developed once, and then only changed if there are significant changes to the market, financial analysis, or project definition.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the business case to meet your needs:

For large projects, the alternatives analysis may be a separate document.
You can include information on project governance for large projects.
Projects that will use a hybrid approach may want to include a section on project approach to define which aspects of the project will use a predictive approach, which will use an adaptive approach, and how they will integrate.



Alignment
The business case should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

1.3 PROJECT STARTUP CANVAS
  The project startup canvas is a high‐level visual summary of a project. It is a framework that allows you to capture new project information quickly and succinctly. It is modeled after the business startup canvas and the lean startup canvas. Like those models, the project startup canvas is one page. However, the project startup canvas focuses on key project information rather than market, competitor, and distribution information. The project startup canvas can include information on

Problem or opportunity
Solution or scope
Key deliverables
Value proposition
Stakeholders
Resources
Costs
Milestones
Threats and constraints

The project startup canvas can receive information from

Project proposal
Vision statement

It may provide information to

Project charter
Project brief
Work breakdown structure
Backlog
Resource requirements
Cost estimates
Schedule
Risk register

The project startup canvas is developed once and is not usually changed unless there is a significant change in the environment, scope, schedule, budget, or resources.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tip to help you tailor the project startup canvas to meet your needs:

If your project is for new product development, consider focusing on distribution channels, customer segments, and revenue streams rather than deliverables, resources, and milestones. While these elements are more business oriented, documenting that information at the start helps keep the project focused on the end users and the market.



Alignment
The project startup canvas should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project vision statement
Project scope statement
Work breakdown structure
Stakeholder register
Milestone schedule
Cost estimates
Risk register



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 1.3 to assist you in developing a project startup canvas.

1.4 PROJECT VISION STATEMENT
The project vision statement provides the future view of a product or service being developed. The project vision statement should be aspirational, yet achievable and realistic. It is developed at the very beginning of a project and is often an input to the business case.
The project vision includes at least

Target customers
Needs addressed
Product or service attributes
Key benefits

The project vision statement can receive information from

Project proposal
Project startup canvas

It may provide information to

Project charter
Project brief

The project vision statement is often used for projects that use an Agile methodology to develop digital products. It is developed once, at the beginning of the project.

Tailoring Tips
The following tips can help you tailor the project vision statement to meet your needs:

Document the business goals that the product is aligned to.
Identify key competitors and how this product will be better.
Describe what differentiates this product from similar products in the market.
You can combine all the information into a sentence or two, or you can follow a formula like the one shown in the sample template.

For hybrid projects, the vision statement can be combined with the project charter (see Section 1.5).


Alignment
The product vision should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Business proposal
Project startup canvas
Project charter
Project brief



Description
You can use the descriptions in Table 1.4 to assist you in developing the vision statement.

1.5 PROJECT CHARTER
  The project charter is a document that formally authorizes a project. The project charter defines the reason for the project and assigns a project manager and his or her authority level for the project. The contents of the charter describe the project in high‐level terms, such as

Project purpose
High‐level project description
Project boundaries
Key deliverables
High‐level requirements
Overall project risk
Project objectives and related success criteria
Summary milestone schedule
Project budget
Key stakeholders
Project exit criteria
Assigned project manager, responsibility, and authority level
Project sponsor or other person(s) authorizing the project

The project charter can receive information from

Project proposal
Project startup canvas
Business case

It provides information to

Stakeholder register
All elements of the project management plan
Requirements documentation
Requirements traceability matrix
Project scope statement
Stakeholder engagement plan

The project charter is developed once and is not usually changed unless there is a significant change in the environment, scope, schedule, resources, budget, or stakeholders.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help you tailor the project charter to meet your needs:

Combine the project charter with the project scope statement, especially if your project is small.
If you are doing the project under contract, you can use the statement of work as the project charter in some cases.
For hybrid projects, you can combine the project vision statement and the project charter.



Alignment
The project charter should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Business case
Project scope statement
Milestone schedule
Budget
Stakeholder register
Risk register



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 1.5 to assist you in developing a project charter.

2Project Plans


Once a project is authorized, the planning begins. Some projects with a well‐defined scope that is unlikely to change spend a great deal of time planning up front and seek to minimize changes to the plans. Other projects do moderate planning at the start and then progressively elaborate the plans as more information becomes available. Projects that use Agile methods expect to evolve the scope and do just enough planning to start working and then evolve the scope of the project based on feedback and work priorities.
The management plan templates in this section are used predominately for projects with a well‐defined scope that is not expected to change. The templates can be used to determine and document how various aspects of the project will be performed, such as communication management, risk management, and procurement management. There are 13 templates associated with planning the project:

Scope management plan
Requirements management plan
Schedule management plan
Release plan
Cost management plan
Quality management plan
Resource management plan
Communications plan
Risk management plan
Procurement management plan
Stakeholder engagement plan
Change management plan
Project management plan

Some templates in this section can be combined to meet the needs of the project, stakeholders, and organization, such as the scope management plan and the quality management plan, or the communication plan and the stakeholder engagement plan.
For small projects, you may not need all these plans; for example, if there are no procurements, you would not need a procurement management plan. A small team with few physical resources may not need a resource management plan.
Project plans are usually developed once prior to baselining the project. If there is a significant change in the environment or the project, project plans may need to revisited.


2.1 SCOPE MANAGEMENT PLAN
The scope management plan is part of the project management plan. It specifies how the project scope will be defined, organized, developed, tracked, and validated. Planning how to manage scope should, at least, include processes for

Decomposing the project into discrete deliverables
Organizing the scope
Determining what constitutes a scope change versus a revision How scope changes will be managed through the formal change control process
Maintaining the scope baseline
How deliverables will be accepted

In addition, the scope management plan may provide direction on the elements that should be contained in a work breakdown structure (WBS) dictionary and how the scope and requirements management plans interact.
The scope management plan can receive information from

Project proposal
Project charter
Project brief
Project management plan

It provides information to

Requirements documentation
Scope statement
WBS
WBS dictionary

It is developed once and does not usually change.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the scope management plan to meet your needs:

For smaller projects, you can combine the scope management plan with the requirements management plan.
For larger projects, consider a test and evaluation plan that defines how deliverables will be validated and accepted by the customer.
If your project involves business analysis, you may want to incorporate information on how business analysis activities and project management activities will interact.
If you are using a hybrid approach, you can tailor the scope management plan by having two sections, one for predictive deliverables and one for adaptive deliverables. For the section on adaptive deliverables, you can include the following information:
Document how predictive and adaptive work will integrate
Identify how the backlog will be prioritized and maintained
Describe the format for user stories



Alignment
The scope management plan should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Development approach
Life cycle description
Change management plan
Requirements management plan
Backlog
User stories



Description
You can use the descriptions in Table 2.1 to assist you in developing a scope management plan.


TABLE 2.1 Elements of the Scope Management Plan




Document Element
Description




Decomposing and organizing scope
If a WBS will be used to decompose and organize the scope, describe whether it will be arranged using phases, geography, major deliverables, or some other way. The guidelines for establishing control accounts and work packages can also be documented in this section.


WBS dictionary
If a WBS dictionary is used, identify the information that will be documented and the level of detail required.


Scope change
Describe what constitutes a scope change versus a scope revision. A change must follow the change control process, whereas a revision does not.


Scope baseline maintenance
Identify the types of scope changes that will need to go through the formal change control process and how the scope baseline will be maintained.


Deliverable acceptance
For each deliverable, identify how the deliverable will be validated for customer acceptance, including any tests or documentation needed for sign‐off.


Scope and requirements integration
Describe how project and product requirements will be addressed in the scope statement and WBS. Identify the integration points and how requirements and scope validation will occur.


Hybrid considerations
Describe how adaptive deliverables will be integrated with predictive deliverables.


Adaptive scope
Identify the type of backlog that will be used, e.g., requirements backlog, user story backlog, etc. Describe the criteria for prioritizing work in the backlog.


User stories
If working with user stories, identify the format the team should use.

Add information on the level of detail and timing for WBS decomposition based on rolling wave planning.
For projects that use earned value management, include information on rules for establishing percent complete and the earned value management (EVM) measurement techniques (fixed formula, percent complete, level or effort, etc.).
For hybrid projects add information for iteration duration, iteration planning, and release planning.



Alignment
The schedule management plan should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project charter
Cost management plan



Description
You can use the descriptions in Table 2.3 to assist you in developing a schedule management plan.


TABLE 2.3 Elements of the Schedule Management Plan




Document Element
Description




Schedule methodology
Identify the scheduling methodology that will be used for the project, whether it is critical path, Agile, or a combination of the two.


Scheduling tool(s)
Identify the scheduling tool(s) that will be used for the project. Tools can include scheduling software, reporting software, earned value software, etc.


Level of accuracy
Describe the level of accuracy needed for estimates. The level of accuracy may evolve over time as more information is known (progressive elaboration). If there are guidelines for rolling wave planning and the level of refinement that will be used for duration and effort estimates, indicate the levels of accuracy required as time progresses.


Units of measure
Indicate whether duration estimates will be in days, weeks, months, iterations, releases, or some other unit of measure.


Variance thresholds
Indicate the measures that determine whether an activity, work package, or the project as a whole is on time, requires preventive action, or is late and requires corrective action.

2.4 RELEASE PLAN
The release plan is similar to a roadmap. It functions as a high‐level schedule that indicates which release each requirement or user story will be assigned to. The elements in a particular release can be updated based on the relative priority of the requirements in the backlog and the availability of resources needed to work on the specific requirements.
The release plan includes at the least

Release goal
Release dates
User stories or requirements from the backlog

The release plan can be further elaborated into iterations. Each release has multiple iterations. Once an iteration starts, the requirements or user stories in the iteration cannot be changed.
The release plan can receive information from

Project startup canvas
Project charter
Project brief
Project roadmap
Project management plan

It provides information to

User stories
Backlog

A high‐level release plan may be developed after the product vision and backlog are started; however, it will remain somewhat dynamic throughout the project as priorities shift and new requirements are identified. The sequence and priorities of requirements or user stories may be updated after each iteration to reflect changing needs based on performance feedback or customer needs.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the release plan to meet your needs:

As information in the release plan gets more concrete, you may want to assign requirements or user stories to specific iterations in the release.
You can arrange the release plan in "swim lanes," with each lane assigned to a specific team or work stream.
If you show the release plan with a timeline, you can show the relationships between various user stories or features. This blends the information about the content of each release with the schedule information.
For hybrid projects, you can incorporate releases as milestones in an integrated master schedule. Iterations can be entered into a predictive schedule without the detail of the user stories. This allows the schedule to show the predictive work and the adaptive work on the same schedule, and the dependencies between predictive and adaptive work, while still keeping the flexibility inherent in adaptive work.



Alignment
The release plan should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Product vision
Roadmap
Backlog
Schedule management plan



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 2.4 to assist you in developing the release plan.


TABLE 2.4 Elements of a Release Plan




Document Element
Description




Release goal

Level of accuracy for cost estimates
Units of measure
Variance thresholds
Rules for performance measurement
Cost reporting information and format
Process for estimating costs
Process for developing a time‐phased budget
Process for monitoring and controlling costs

In addition, the cost management plan may include information on the level of authority associated with cost and budget allocation and commitment, funding limitations, and options and guidelines on how and when costs get recorded for the project.
The cost management plan can receive information from the

Project charter
Schedule management plan
Risk management plan

It provides information to

Cost estimates
Risk register

The cost management plan is developed once and does not usually change.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the cost management plan to meet your needs:

On smaller projects, often the project manager does not manage the budget. In those cases, you would not need this template.
Units of measure for each type of resource may be indicated in the cost management plan or the resource management plan.
For projects that use EVM, include information on rules for establishing percent complete, the EVM measurement techniques (fixed formula, percent complete, level or effort, etc.). For those that don't, delete this field.



Alignment
The cost management plan should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project charter
Schedule management plan



Description
You can use the descriptions in Table 2.5 to assist you in developing a cost management plan.


TABLE 2.5 Elements of a Cost Management Plan




Document Element
Description




Units of measure
Indicate how each type of resource will be measured. For example, labor units may be measured in staff hours, days, or weeks. Physical resources may be measured in gallons, meters, tons, or whatever is appropriate for the material. Some resources are based on a lump sum cost each time they are used.


Level of precision
Indicate whether cost estimates will be rounded to hundreds, thousands, or some other measurement.


Level of accuracy
Describe the level of accuracy needed for estimates. The level of accuracy may evolve over time as more information is known (progressive elaboration). If there are guidelines for rolling wave planning and the level of refinement that will be used for cost estimates, indicate the levels of accuracy required as time progresses.


Organizational procedure links
Cost estimating and reporting should follow the numbering structure of the WBS. It may also need to follow the organization's code of accounts or other accounting and reporting structures.


Control thresholds
Indicate the measures that determine whether an activity, work package, or the project as a whole is on budget, requires preventive action, or is over budget and requires corrective action. Usually indicated as a percent deviation from the baseline.


Rules of performance measurement
Identify the level in the WBS where progress and expenditures will be measured. For projects that use EVM, indicate whether costs will be reported at the work package or control account level. Describe the measurement method that will be used, such as weighted milestones, fixed‐formula, percent complete, etc. Document the equations that will be used to forecast estimates to complete (ETC) and estimates at completion (EAC).


Additional details
Describe variables associated with strategic funding choices, such as make or buy, buy or lease, borrowing funds versus using in‐house funding, etc.

The resource management plan is developed once and usually does not change.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the resource management plan to meet your needs:

If you need to bring in outside contractors for the project, you will need to include information on how to on‐board them to the project. You will also need to consider how to ensure they have all the information they need but no access to proprietary data. This may include a non‐disclosure agreement or similar forms.
For any team or physical resources that are acquired from outside the organization, you will need to work with procurement policies for the organization and the project.
Projects with large amounts of inventory, supplies, or material should either reference organizational policies regarding managing physical resources or provide sufficient detail to ensure appropriate control.
Projects that use Agile approaches will only use a resource management plan for physical resources. The team usually self‐manages, so they may use a team operating agreement to document how they will work together.



Alignment
The resource management plan should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

WBS
Requirements documentation
Quality management plan
Procurement management plan

Consider the following tips to help tailor the communication management plan to meet your needs:

When multiple organizations are working on a project, there will be additional information needed, such as
The person responsible for authorizing release of internal or confidential information
How different communication hardware, software, and technologies will be addressed to ensure information gets to everyone regardless of their communication infrastructure
If you have a multinational team, your plan will need to account for the business language, currency unit of measure, translation, and other factors required to ensure effective communication across multiple countries and cultures.
On a project that has a significant communication component, you will want to identify the resources allocated for communication activities, the time requirements, and the budget allocated.
For projects with complex communication needs, include a flowchart of the sequence of communication events.



Alignment
The communications management plan should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project schedule
Stakeholder register
Stakeholder engagement plan



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 2.8 to assist you in developing the communications management plan.

2.9 RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
The risk management plan is a component of the project management plan. It describes how risk management activities will be structured and performed for both threats and opportunities. Typical information includes

Methodology
Roles and responsibilities for risk management
Funding to identify, analyze, and respond to risk
Frequency and timing for risk management activities
Risk categories
Stakeholder risk appetite
Methods to track and audit risk management activities
Definitions of probability
Definitions of impact by objective
Probability and impact matrix template

The risk management plan can receive information from

Business case
Project charter
Project brief
Project management plan (any component)
Stakeholder register

It provides information to

Cost management plan
Quality management plan
Risk register
Stakeholder engagement plan

The risk management plan describes the approach for all risk management processes and provides key information needed to conduct those processes successfully.
The risk management plan is developed once and does not usually change.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the risk management plan to meet your needs:

For a small, simple, or short‐term project, you can use a simplified risk register with a 3 × 3 probability and impact matrix. You would also include risk information in the project status report rather than a separate risk report.
For larger, longer, and more complex projects, you will want to develop a robust risk management process, including a more granular probability and impact matrix, quantitative assessments for the schedule and budget baselines, risk audits, and risk reports.
Projects that are using an Agile approach address risk at the start of each iteration and during the retrospective.
Projects that are using an Agile approach may refer to risks as blockers or impediments.



Alignment
The risk management plan should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Scope management plan
Schedule management plan
Cost management plan
Quality management plan
Resource management plan
Procurement management plan
Stakeholder engagement plan



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 2.9 to assist you in developing the risk management plan.


TABLE 2.9 Elements of a Risk Management Plan




Document Element
Description




Methodology
Describe the methodology or approach to risk management. This includes any tools, approaches, or data sources that will be used.


Roles and responsibilities
Document the roles and responsibilities for various risk management activities.


Risk categories
Identify categorization groups used to sort and organize risks. These can be used to sort risks on the risk register or for a risk breakdown structure, if one is used.


Risk management funding
Document the funding needed to perform the various risk management activities, such as utilizing expert advice or transferring risks to a third party. Also establishes protocols for establishing, measuring, and allocating contingency and management reserves.


Frequency and timing
Determine the frequency of conducting formal risk management activities and the timing of any specific activities.


Stakeholder risk appetite
Identify the risk thresholds of the organization(s) and key stakeholders on the project with regard to each objective.


Risk tracking and audit
Document how risk activities will be recorded and how risk management processes will be audited.


Definitions of probability
Document how probability will be measured and defined. Include the scale used and the definition for each level in the probability scale. The probability definitions should reflect the stakeholder risk appetite. For example: Very high = there is an 80% probability or higher that the event will occur High = there is a 60-80% probability that the event will occur Medium = there is a 40-60% probability that the event will occur Low = there is a 20-40% probability that the event will occur Very low = there is a 1-20% probability that the event will occur


Definitions of impact by objective
Document how impact will be measured and defined for either the project as a whole or for each objective. The probability definitions should reflect the stakeholder risk appetite. Include the scale used and the definition for each level in the impact scale. For example: Cost Impacts

Very high = overrun of control account budget of >20%
High = overrun of control account budget between 15-20%
Medium = overrun of control account budget between 10-15%
Low = overrun of control account budget between 5-10%
Very low = overrun of control account budget of <5%



Probability and impact matrix
Describe the combinations of probability and impact that indicate a high risk, a medium risk, and a low risk and the scoring that will be used to prioritize risks. This can also include an assessment of proximity to indicate how soon the risk event is likely to occur.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the stakeholder engagement plan to meet your needs:

For small projects, you may not need a stakeholder engagement plan. You can combine the information with the communication management plan as appropriate.
Projects with multiple stakeholders with overlapping and intersecting relationships can benefit from having a stakeholder relationship map that shows the connections.
For many high‐risk projects, stakeholder engagement is critical to success. For projects with many stakeholders, complex interactions, and high‐risk stakeholders, you will need to have a robust stakeholder engagement plan.
For hybrid projects or projects that use Agile approaches, a lot of stakeholder engagement takes place in product demos. This information should be included in the stakeholder engagement plan.



Alignment
The stakeholder engagement plan should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Stakeholder register
Communications management plan
Project schedule



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 2.11 to assist you in developing the stakeholder engagement plan.

The change management plan is related to

Change log
Change request

It provides information to

Project management plan

The change management plan is a part of the project management plan and is developed once and is not usually changed.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the change management plan to meet your needs:

If you only have a few product components or project documents that require configuration management, you may be able to combine change management and configuration management into one plan. Otherwise, you may want to have a separate configuration management plan that describes how you will name, track, and audit configurable items.
The rigor and structure of your change management plan should reflect the product development approach. For predictive approaches, a rigorous change management approach is appropriate. For adaptive approaches, the change management plan should allow for evolving scope.
For hybrid projects that have some deliverables that will use a predictive development approach, and some that will use an adaptive development approach, identify those deliverables that will be subject to change control.



Alignment
The change management plan should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project roadmap
Scope management plan
Requirements management plan
Schedule management plan
Cost management plan
Quality management plan



Description
You can use the descriptions in Table 2.12 to assist you in developing a change management plan.

2.13 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
The project management plan describes how the team will perform, manage, and close the project. While it has some unique information, it is primarily comprised of all the subsidiary management plans and the baselines. The project management plan combines all this information into a cohesive and integrated approach to managing the project. Typical information includes

Selected project life cycle
Development approach for key deliverables
Variance thresholds
Baseline management
Timing and types of reviews

The project management plan contains plans for managing all specific aspects of the project that require special focus. These take the form of subsidiary management plans and can include

Change management plan
Scope management plan
Schedule management plan
Requirements management plan
Cost management plan
Quality management plan
Resource management plan
Communication plan
Risk management plan
Procurement management plan
Stakeholder engagement plan

The project management plan also contains baselines. Common baselines include:

Scope baseline
Schedule baseline
Cost baseline
Performance measurement baseline (an integrated baseline that includes scope, schedule, and cost)

In addition, any other relevant, project‐specific information that will be used to manage the project is recorded in the project management plan.
The project management plan can receive information from all the startup documents, subsidiary management plans, and baselines. Because it is the foundational document for managing the project, it also provides information to all subsidiary plans.
The project management plan is first created as the initial project planning is conducted. Once it is baselined, it is not usually changed unless there is a significant change in the charter, environment, or scope of the project.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the project management plan to meet your needs:

For large and complex projects, each subsidiary management plan will likely be a separate standalone plan. In this case, you may present your project management plan as a shell with just information on the life cycle, development approach, and key reviews, and then provide a link or reference to the more detailed subsidiary management plans.
For smaller projects, a project roadmap that summarizes the project phases, major deliverables, milestones, and key reviews may be sufficient.
You will likely have additional subsidiary management plans that are relevant to the nature of your project, such as a technology management plan, a logistics management plan, a safety management plan, and so forth.
For projects that have an Agile component, the project management plan should describe how the deliverables that are using an Agile development approach are integrated with the parts of the project that are using a predictive development approach.



Alignment
The project management plan should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project charter
Vision statement
Project brief
Project roadmap
All subsidiary management plans



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 2.13 to assist you in developing a project management plan.


TABLE 2.13 Elements of a Project Management Plan




Document Element
Description




Project life cycle
Describe the life cycle that will be used to accomplish the project. This may include the following:

Name of each phase
Key activities for the phase
Key deliverables for the phase
Entry criteria for the phase
Exit criteria for the phase
Key reviews for the phase



Development approaches
Document the specific approach you will take to create key deliverables. Common approaches include predictive approaches, where the scope is known and stable, and adaptive approaches, where the scope is evolving and subject to change. It may also include iterative, incremental, or hybrid development approaches.


Subsidiary management plans
List the subsidiary management plans that are part of the project management plan. This can be in the form of a "table of contents," links to electronic copies of the subsidiary plans, or a list of the other plans that should be considered part of the project management plan but are separate documents.


Scope variance threshold
Define acceptable scope variances, variances that indicate a warning, and variances that are unacceptable. Scope variance can be indicated by the features and functions that are present in the end product, or the performance metrics that are desired.


Scope baseline management
Describe how the scope baseline will be managed, including responses to acceptable, warning, and unacceptable variances. Define circumstances that would trigger preventive or corrective action and when the change control process would be enacted. Define the difference between a scope revision and a scope change. Generally, a revision does not require the same degree of approval that a change does. For example, changing the color of something is a revision; changing a function is a change.


Schedule variance threshold
Define acceptable schedule variances, variances that indicate a warning, and variances that are unacceptable. Schedule variances may indicate the percent of variance from the baseline or they may include the amount of float used or whether any schedule reserve has been used.


Schedule baseline management
Describe how the schedule baseline will be managed, including responses to acceptable, warning, and unacceptable variances. Define circumstances that would trigger preventive or corrective action and when the change control process would be enacted.


Cost variance threshold
Define acceptable cost variances, variances that indicate a warning, and variances that are unacceptable. Cost variances may indicate the percent of variance from the baseline, such as 0-5%, 5-10%, and greater than 10%.


Cost baseline management
Describe how the cost baseline will be managed, including responses to acceptable, warning, and unacceptable variances. Define circumstances that would trigger preventive or corrective action and when the change control process would be enacted.


Baselines
Attach all project baselines.

3Project Documents


There are a wide range of project documents. Many of them are used to support project planning, such as the scope statement, cost estimating worksheet, and stakeholder analysis. Other project documents are used as needed during the project, for example, a change request, procurement strategy, and source selection criteria.
Templates in this section are helpful for projects that use predictive approaches (e.g., waterfall methodology), as well as adaptive methods such as iterative and incremental development. There are 16 templates for project documents:

Change request
Requirements documentation
Requirements traceability matrix
Scope statement
Work breakdown structure (WBS) dictionary
Effort‐duration estimates
Effort‐duration worksheets
Cost estimates
Cost estimating worksheet
Responsibility assignment matrix
Team charter
Probability and impact assessment
Risk data sheet
Procurement strategy
Source selection criteria
Stakeholder analysis

Some of the templates in this section can be combined with other templates in this book. For example, in some projects it makes sense to combine the scope statement with the project charter, or the responsibility assignment matrix with the resource management plan. Other documents may not be used at all. Smaller projects won't need a WBS dictionary, and projects without procurements won't need a procurement strategy or source selection criteria.
Some project documents are unlikely to change, such as the responsibility assignment matrix; others are dynamic in nature, such as the risk data sheet, which is updated as more information about a risk is uncovered.


3.1 CHANGE REQUEST
A change request is used to change any aspect of the project. It can pertain to product components, documents, cost, schedule, or any other aspect of the project. Typical information includes

Requestor
Category
Description of the proposed change
Justification
Impacts of the proposed change on

Scope
Quality
Requirements
Cost
Schedule
Project documents


Comments

A change request can come from almost anyone. Upon completion, it is submitted to the change control board for review.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the change request to meet your needs:

For smaller projects, you can simplify the template by having a summary description of the impacts without including impacts for each subcategory (scope, quality, requirements, etc.).
You can add a check box that indicates whether the change is mandatory (such as a legal requirement) or discretionary.
A field can be added that describes the implications of not making the change.



Alignment
The change request should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Change management plan
Change log



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 3.1 to assist you in developing the change request.

3.2 REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION
Project success is directly influenced by the discovery and decomposition of stakeholders' needs into requirements and by the care taken in determining, documenting, and managing the requirements of the product, service, or result of the project.
These requirements need to be documented in enough detail to be included in the scope baseline and be measured and validated. Requirements documentation assists the project manager in making tradeoff decisions among requirements and in managing stakeholder expectations. Requirements will be progressively elaborated as more information about the project becomes available.
When documenting requirements, it is useful to group them by category. Some common categories include

Business requirements
Stakeholder requirements
Solution requirements
Transition and readiness requirements
Project requirements
Quality requirements

Requirements documentation should include at least

Identifier
Requirement
Stakeholder
Category
Priority
Acceptance criteria
Test or verification method
Release or phase

Requirements documentation can receive information from

Project proposal
Project charter
Project brief
Assumption log
Stakeholder register
Scope management plan
Requirements management plan

It provides information to

Stakeholder register
Scope baseline
Quality management plan
Resource management plan
Communications management plan
Risk register
Procurement management plan
Project closeout report

Requirements documentation begins at a high level and may be elaborated as the project progresses. For projects that have a well‐defined scope, the high‐level requirements are not likely to change, merely be elaborated. For projects that are adaptive, the requirements documentation can evolve and change throughout the project.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the requirements documentation to meet your needs:

If you are using an Agile or adaptive development approach, you may want to incorporate information on the release or iteration for each requirement.
For a project with a lot of requirements, you may want to indicate the relationships between requirements using a requirements traceability matrix or other tool.
For projects with many requirements, or complex requirements, it may be better to automate the requirements management process.
You can add information about assumptions or constraints associated with requirements.
For small and quick adaptive or Agile projects, the requirements documentation and backlog can be combined.



Alignment
The requirements documentation should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Requirements management plan
Quality management plan
Requirements traceability matrix
Release plan



Description
You can use the descriptions in Table 3.2 to assist you in developing requirements documentation.

3.3 REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY MATRIX
A requirements traceability matrix is used to track the various attributes of requirements throughout the project life cycle. It uses information from the requirements documentation and traces how those requirements are addressed through other aspects of the project. The following template shows how requirements would be traced to project objectives, WBS deliverables, and how they will be validated.
Another way to use the matrix is to trace the relationship between categories of requirements. For example,

Business objectives and technical requirements
Functional requirements and technical requirements
Requirements and verification method
Technical requirements and WBS deliverables

An inter‐requirements traceability matrix can be used to record this information. A sample template is included after the requirements traceability matrix.
The requirements traceability matrix can receive information from

Project charter
Assumption log
Stakeholder register
Scope management plan
Requirements management plan
Stakeholder engagement plan
Lessons learned register

It provides information to

Quality management plan
Procurement statement of work
Change requests

The requirements traceability matrix is usually created once, and then updated if and when requirements are added or modified.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the requirements traceability matrix to meet your needs:

For complex projects, you may need to invest in requirements management software to help manage and track requirements. Using a paper form is usually only helpful for small projects or when tracking requirements at a high level.
For projects with one or more vendors, you may want to add a field indicating which organization is accountable for meeting each requirement.
Consider an outline format with the business requirement at a parent level and technical requirement and specifications subordinate to the business requirement.
For projects that use adaptive processes or releases, you can include a column that indicates which release the requirement will be part of.
For projects that use a backlog, the priority indicator should align with the sequence of items on the backlog.



Alignment
The requirements traceability matrix should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Development approach
Requirements management plan
Requirements documentation
Release and iteration plan
Requirements or user story backlog



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Tables 3.3A and 3.3B to assist you in developing a requirements traceability matrix and an inter‐requirements traceability matrix. The matrix shown uses an example of business and technical requirements.

3.4 PROJECT SCOPE STATEMENT
The project scope statement assists in defining and developing the project and product scope. It is used to provide a narrative description of the project and each of the key deliverables. The description provides more context than the WBS and requirements documentation and more detail than the project charter. The project scope statement should contain at least this information:

Project scope description
Project deliverables
Product acceptance criteria
Project exclusions

The project scope statement can receive information from

Project proposal
Project charter
Project brief
Project startup canvas
Scope management plan
Requirements documentation

It provides information to

WBS

The project scope statement is developed once and is not usually updated unless there is a significant change in scope.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the project scope statement to meet your needs:

For smaller projects, you can combine the project scope statement with the project charter.
For Agile projects, you can combine the information with the release and iteration plan.



Alignment
The project scope statement should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project charter
Project proposal
Project charter
Project brief
Project startup canvas
Work breakdown structure
Requirements documentation



Description

3.5 WBS DICTIONARY
The WBS dictionary supports the work breakdown structure (WBS). The work breakdown structure (WBS) is used to decompose all the work of the project. It begins at the project level and is successively broken down into finer levels of detail. The WBS can be shown as a chart or an outline. The lowest level is called a work package. Above the work package level are control accounts that are used for reporting progress. Because the WBS depends on the nature of the work, there are no templates included in this book.
The WBS dictionary supports the WBS by providing details about the control accounts and work packages it contains. The dictionary can provide detailed information about each work package or summary information at the control account level. Information in the WBS dictionary can include

Work package name
Description of work
Schedule milestones
Associated schedule activities
Resources required
Cost estimates
Quality requirements
Acceptance criteria
Technical information or references
Contract information

The WBS dictionary is progressively elaborated as the planning processes progress. Once the WBS is developed, the statement of work for a particular work package may be defined, but the necessary activities, cost estimates, and resource requirements may not be known. Thus, the inputs for the WBS dictionary are more detailed than for the WBS.
Use the information from your project to tailor the template to best meet your needs.
The WBS dictionary can receive information from

Requirements documentation
Project scope statement
WBS
Cost estimates
Quality metrics
Contracts

The WBS dictionary provides information to

Risk register
Procurement management plan

The WBS dictionary is progressively elaborated throughout the project.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the WBS dictionary to meet your needs:

For smaller projects, you may not need a WBS dictionary.
For projects that do use a WBS dictionary, you can tailor the information to be as detailed or as high level as you need. You may just want to list a description of work, the cost estimate, key delivery dates, and assigned resources.
For projects that have deliverables outsourced, you can consider the WBS dictionary as a mini‐statement of work for the outsourced deliverables.
Projects that use WBS dictionaries can reference other documents and the relevant sections for technical, quality, or agreement information rather than recording the information in the dictionary.



Alignment
The WBS dictionary should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

WBS
Project scope statement
Duration estimates
Project schedule
Cost estimates
Project budget
Quality management plan
Resource management plan
Procurement management plan

3.6 EFFORT/DURATION ESTIMATES
Effort estimates reflect the amount of work it takes to complete an activity. Duration estimates reflect the amount of time it takes to complete an activity. For those activity durations driven by human resources, as opposed to material or equipment, the duration estimates will generally convert the estimate of effort hours into days or weeks. To convert effort hours into days, take the total number of hours and divide by 8. To convert to weeks, take the total number of hours and divide by 40.
You can develop effort and duration estimates for each activity, work package, or control account. Duration estimates include at least

ID
Activity description
Duration estimate
Effort hours (Optional)

Duration estimates can receive information from

Assumption log
Schedule management plan
Lessons learned register

It provides information to

Project schedule

Duration estimates are developed throughout the project as schedule and activity details are refined.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the duration estimates to meet your needs:

At a control account level or phase level, duration estimates may include contingency reserve to account for risks related to uncertainty in the duration estimates, ambiguity in the scope, or resource availability.
Develop duration estimates at the level of accuracy that suits your project needs. Rolling wave planning is often used for duration estimating; as more information is known about the project activities, duration estimates are refined and updated.
For projects that are using an agile development approach, set time boxes are used rather than duration estimates. Additionally, different estimating methods are used.



Alignment
The duration estimates should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

3.7 EFFORT—DURATION ESTIMATING WORKSHEET
An effort or duration estimating worksheet can help to develop estimates when quantitative methods are used. Quantitative methods include

Parametric estimates
Analogous estimates
Multi‐point estimates

Parametric estimates are derived by determining the effort hours needed to complete the work. The effort hours are then calculated by

Dividing the estimated hours by resource quantity (i.e., number of people assigned to the task)
Dividing the estimated hours by the percent of time the resource(s) are available (i.e., 100% of the time, 75% of the time, or 50% of the time)
Multiplying the estimated hours by a performance factor. Experts in a field generally complete work faster than people with an average skill level or novices. Therefore, a factor to account for the productivity is developed.

These estimates can be made even more accurate by considering that most people are productive on project work only about 75% of the time.
Analogous estimates are derived by comparing current work to previous similar work. The size of the previous work and the duration are compared to the expected size of the current work compared to the previous work. Then the ratio of the size of the current work is multiplied by the previous duration to determine an estimate. Various factors, such as complexity, can be factored in to make the estimate more accurate. This type of estimate is generally used to get a high‐level estimate when detailed information is not available.
A multi‐point estimate can be used to account for uncertainty in the duration estimate. Stakeholders provide estimates for optimistic (O), most likely (M), and pessimistic (P) scenarios. These estimates are put into an equation to determine an expected duration. The needs of the project determine the appropriate equation, but a common equation is the beta distribution:

In formulas, duration is often represented by "t" for "time."
The duration estimating worksheet can receive information from

Assumption log
Scope and requirements information
Schedule management plan
Risk register
Lessons learned register

Duration estimates are developed throughout the project as schedule and activity details are refined.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the duration estimates to meet your needs:

You can tailor the multi‐point estimate to meet the needs of your project. For example, you can weight the pessimistic option more heavily if the team has not done this type of work before, or if there are risks associated with the work. For example, you may use an equation like this one:




Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 3.7 to assist you in estimating durations with the worksheet.


TABLE 3.7 Elements of an Activity Duration Estimating Worksheet




Document Element
Description




ID
Unique identifier


Parametric estimates


Effort hours
Enter amount of labor it will take to accomplish the work. Usually shown in hours, but may also be shown in days. Example: 150 hours


Resource quantity
Document the number of resources available. Example: 2 people


Percent available
Enter amount of time the resources are available. Usually shown as the percent of time available per day or per week. Example: 75% of the time


Performance factor
Estimate a performance factor if appropriate. Generally, effort hours are estimated based on the amount of effort it would take the average resource to complete the work. This can be modified if you have a highly skilled resource or someone who has very little experience. The more skilled the resource, the lower the performance factor. For example, an average resource would have a 1.0 performance factor. A highly skilled resource could get the work done faster, so you multiply the effort hours times a performance factor of .8. A less‐skilled resource will take longer to get the work done, so you would multiply the effort hours times 1.2.


Duration estimate
Divide the effort hours by the resource quantity times the percent available times the performance factor to determine the length of time it will take to accomplish the work. The equation is Effort/(quantity × percent available × performance factor) = duration 150 hours of effort with 2 people assigned, that are available 75% of the time and are very experienced would be calculated like this: 150/(2 × .75 × .8) = 125 hours of duration


Analogous estimates


Previous activity
Enter a description of the previous activity. Example: Build a 160 square foot deck.


Previous duration
Document the duration of the previous activity. Example: 10 days


Current activity
Describe how the current activity is different. Example: Build a 200 square foot deck.


Multiplier
Divide the current activity by the previous activity to get a multiplier. Example: 200/160 = 1.25


Duration estimate
Multiply the duration for the previous activity by the multiplier to calculate the duration estimate for the current activity. Example: 10 days × 1.25 = 12.5 days


Multi‐point estimate (Beta distribution)


Optimistic duration
Determine an optimistic duration estimate. Optimistic estimates assume everything will go well and there won't be any delays in material, and that all resources are available and will perform as expected. Example: 20 days


Most likely duration
Determine a most likely duration estimate. Most likely estimates assume that there will be some delays but nothing out of the ordinary. Example: 25 days


Pessimistic duration
Determine a pessimistic duration estimate. Pessimistic estimates assume there are significant risks that will materialize and cause delays. Example: 36 days


Weighting equation
Weight the three estimates and divide. The most common method of weighting is the beta distribution: tE = (tO + 4tM + tP)/6 Example: (20 + 4(25) + 36)/6


Expected duration
Enter the expected duration based on the beta distribution calculation. Example: 26 days

3.8 COST ESTIMATES
Cost estimates provide information on the cost of resources necessary to complete project work, including labor, equipment, supplies, services, facilities, and material. Estimates can be determined by developing an approximation for each work package using expert judgment or by using a quantitative method, such as

Parametric estimates
Analogous estimates
Multi‐point estimates

Cost estimates should include at least

ID
Labor costs
Physical resource costs
Reserve

Method
Assumptions
Range
Confidence level

Cost estimates can receive information from

Cost management plan
Quality management plan
Risk register
Lessons learned register

They provide information to

Project budget

Cost estimates are developed and then refined periodically as needed.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the cost estimates to meet your needs:

Cost estimates may include contingency reserve to account for risks related to uncertainty in the estimates or ambiguity in the scope or resource availability.
If considerations for the cost of quality, cost of financing, or indirect costs were included, add that information to your cost estimate.
Estimate costs at the level of accuracy and precision that suits your project needs. Rolling wave planning is often used for cost estimating; as more information is known about the scope and resources, cost estimates are refined and updated.
If using vendors, indicate the estimated cost and indicate the type of contract being used to account for possible fees and awards.



Alignment
The cost estimates should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

3.9 COST ESTIMATING WORKSHEET
A cost estimating worksheet can help to develop cost estimates when quantitative methods or a bottom‐up estimate are developed. Quantitative methods include:

Parametric estimates
Analogous estimates
Multi‐point estimates

Parametric estimates are derived by determining the cost variable that will be used and the cost per unit. The number of units is multiplied by the cost per unit to derive a cost estimate.
Analogous estimates are derived by comparing current work to previous similar work. The size of the previous work and the cost are compared to the expected size of the current work. Then the ratio of the size of the current work compared to the previous work is multiplied by the previous cost to determine an estimate. Various factors, such as complexity and price increases, can be factored in to make the estimate more accurate. This type of estimate is generally used to get a high‐level estimate when detailed information is not available.
A multi‐point estimate can be used to account for uncertainty in the cost estimate.
Stakeholders provide estimates for optimistic (O), most likely (M), and pessimistic (P) scenarios. These estimates are put into an equation to determine an expected duration. The needs of the project determine the appropriate equation, but a common equation is the beta distribution:

In formulas, duration is often represented by "c" for "cost."
Bottom‐up estimates are detailed estimates done at the work package level. Detailed information on the work package, such as technical requirements, engineering drawings, labor duration, and other direct and indirect costs, are used to determine the most accurate estimate possible.
The cost estimating worksheet can receive information from

Cost management plan
Scope and requirements information
Project schedule
Quality management plan
Risk register
Lessons learned register

Cost estimating worksheets are developed and then refined as periodically as needed.

3.10 RESPONSIBILITY ASSIGNMENT MATRIX
The responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) shows the intersection of work packages and team members. RAMs can indicate different types of participation depending on the needs of the project. Some common types include

Accountable
Responsible
Consulted
Resource
Informed
Sign‐off

The RAM always should include a key that explains what each of the levels of participation entails. An example follows using a RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted and informed) chart. The needs of your project should determine the fields for the RAM you use. Note that with a RACI chart, that each work package should have an accountable party, and only one accountable party. For a RACI chart, accountability is not shared.
The responsibility assignment matrix can receive information from

Scope information
Requirements documentation
Resource management plan
Stakeholder register

It is developed during planning and is progressively elaborated as more information about the scope and the resource requirements is known.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the RAM to meet your needs:

Tailor the types of participation appropriate for your project. Some projects require "sign‐off" of specific deliverables, whereas others use the term "approve."
Determine the appropriate level to record information on the RAM. Large projects with multiple vendors and large deliverables often use the RAM as the intersection of the WBS and the OBS (organizational breakdown structure). Small projects may use it at the deliverable or activity level to help enter schedule information.



Alignment
The RAM should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Scope information
Requirements documentation
Procurement documents (RFP, RFQ, etc.)

3.11 TEAM CHARTER
The team charter (also known as a team operating agreement) is used to establish ground rules and guidelines for the team. It is particularly useful on virtual teams and teams that are composed of members from different organizations. Using a team charter can help establish expectations and agreements on working effectively together. The contents of the team charter typically include

Team values and principles
Meeting guidelines
Communication guidelines
Decision‐making process
Conflict resolution process
Team agreements

The team charter is generally developed once and changes if there is substantial team member turnover. The team should periodically revisit the team charter and reaffirm or update it accordingly.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the team charter to meet your needs:

If you bring in contractors for key roles in the project, you should include them in developing the team charter.
If your organization has organizational values, make sure your team charter is aligned with the organizational values.
International teams may need to spend more time developing this document, as different cultures have different ways of
making decisions and resolving conflicts.
Teams that use an Agile approach may call this document team norms or team working agreements. For Agile teams, this document focuses on how the team will self‐organize and work together.



Alignment
The team charter should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Resource management plan



Description

3.12 PROBABILITY AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT
There are three aspects of a probability and impact (PxI) assessment. The first entails the definitions for probability and impact. These are likely defined in the risk management plan, but if your project doesn't have a risk management plan, you can develop a PxI assessment to record definitions for the likelihood of events occurring (probability) and the impact on the various project objectives if they do occur.
The second aspect is a table that is used to plot each risk after performing a PxI assessment. The PxI assessment determines the probability and impact of the risk. The matrix provides a helpful way to view the various risks on the project and prioritize them for responses. It may be constructed for threats and opportunities. Information from this matrix will be transferred to the risk register.
Another benefit of the PxI matrix is that it provides an overview of the amount of risk on the project. The project team can get an idea of the overall project risk by seeing the number of risks in each square of the matrix. A project with many risks in the red zone will need more contingency to absorb the risk and likely more time and budget to develop and implement risk responses.
The third aspect of the assessment is determining which risks are considered low, medium, and high based on the combination of probability and impact.
The probability and impact assessment can receive information from

Risk management plan
Risk register

It provides information to the risk register.
The probability and impact assessment is developed once and does not usually change.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the PxI matrix to meet your needs:

On smaller projects, the impacts may be grouped together without distinguishing impact by objective.
The matrix can be 3 × 3 for a small project, 5 × 5 for a medium project, and 10 × 10 for a complex or large project.
To indicate the relative criticality of various objectives (usually scope, schedule, cost, and quality), you can include a tighter range of thresholds between levels. For example, if cost is a critical factor, consider a very low impact as a 2% variance, a low variance as a 4% impact, a medium variance as a 6% variance, a high variance as 8%, and a very high variance as a 10% variance. If the cost is more relaxed, you might have a loose range, such as very low impact as a 5% variance, a low variance as a 10% impact, a medium variance as a 15% variance, a high variance as 20%, and a very high variance as a 25% variance.
The numbering structure of the probability and impact matrix can be tailored to emphasize the high risks by creating a nonlinear numbering structure. For example, impact scores can be set up to double every increment. For example: Very Low = .5, Low = 1, Medium = 2, High = 4, and Very High = 8.
If there are other objectives that are important to the project, such as stakeholder satisfaction, you can incorporate them. Some organizations combine scope and quality into one objective called "technical" or "performance."
You can make the assessment more robust by including urgency information to indicate how soon you need to implement the response for it to be effective.
The combination of probability and impact that indicates a risk is high, medium, or low can be tailored to reflect the organization's risk appetite. An organization with a low risk appetite may rank events that fall in the medium or high range for both impact and probability as high risk. An organization with a higher risk threshold may only rank risk with a very high probability and impact as high risk.



Alignment
The probability and impact assessment should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Risk management plan
Risk register



Description

The risk data sheet can receive information from the

Risk register
Probability and impact risk assessment

A risk data sheet is started as needed, and is continuously updated and elaborated throughout the life of the risk.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the risk data sheet to meet your needs:

Not all projects require risk data sheets. Where they are used, they are considered an extension of the risk register.
For projects that use risk data sheets, not all risks require them. A risk data sheet is usually reserved for complex risks, high risks, or where there is a lot of information surrounding the risk that needs to be documented.
You can add or delete any fields you feel necessary.



Alignment
The risk data sheet should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Risk register
Probability and impact assessment
Risk report

3.14 PROCUREMENT STRATEGY
The procurement strategy is a project document that describes information about specific procurements. Typical information includes

Delivery methods
Contract types
Procurement phases

The procurement strategy can receive information from

Project charter
Stakeholder register
Project roadmap
Requirements documentation
Requirements traceability matrix
Scope baseline
Project schedule
Resource management plan

It provides information to

Project schedule
Project budget
Risk register

The procurement strategy is developed once for each procurement when needed.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the procurement strategy to meet your needs:

For a project that will be done using internal resources only, you do not need a procurement strategy.
For projects with few procurements, consider combining this template with the procurement management plan.
For simple purchases, or for purchases where you have worked with a vendor successfully for a length of time, you may not need a formal procurement strategy; rather, you would record the information in a statement of work that would be part of the contract.
Work with the contracting or legal department to ensure compliance with organizational purchasing policies.



Alignment
The procurement strategy should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project charter
Project roadmap
Requirements documentation
Requirements traceability matrix
Schedule management plan
Cost management plan
Resource management plan
Procurement management plan



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 3.14 to assist you in developing the procurement strategy.

3.15 SOURCE SELECTION CRITERIA
Source selection criteria is a set of attributes desired by the buyer that a seller must meet or exceed to be selected for a contract. The source selection criteria template is an aid in determining and rating the criteria that will be used to evaluate bid proposals. This is a multistep process.

The criteria to evaluate bid responses are determined.
A weight is assigned to each criterion. The sum of all the criteria must equal 100%.
The range of ratings for each criterion is determined, such as 1-5 or 1-10.
The performance necessary for each rating is defined.
Each proposal is evaluated against the criteria and is rated accordingly.
The weight is multiplied by the rate, and a score for each criterion is derived.
The scores are totaled, and the highest total score is the winner of the bid.

Evaluation criteria commonly include such items as

Capability and capacity
Product cost and life cycle cost
Delivery dates
Technical expertise
Prior experience
Proposed approach and work plan
Key staff qualifications, availability, and competence
Financial stability
Management experience
Training and knowledge transfer

The source selection criteria are established for each major procurement.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the source selection criteria to meet your needs:

For a small procurement that is not complex, you likely won't need to develop a weighted source selection criteria template.
For international procurements you may also want to include familiarity with local laws and regulations, as well as experience and relationships in the locations involved.
For construction projects, or projects with many logistical concerns, you could include logistics handling as a selection criterion.



Alignment
The source selection criteria should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Requirements documentation
Scope baseline
Project schedule
Resource management plan
Procurement management plan
Procurement strategy



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 3.15 to assist you in developing the source selection criteria.

3.16 STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS
A stakeholder analysis is used to classify stakeholders. It can be used to help fill in the stakeholder register. Analyzing stakeholders can also help in planning stakeholder engagement for groups of stakeholders.
The following example is used to assess the relative power (high or low), the relative interest (high or low), and the attitude (friend or foe). There are many other ways to categorize stakeholders. Some examples include

Influence/impact
Power/urgency/legitimacy

Stakeholder analysis receives information from

Project charter
Procurement documents

A stakeholder analysis is started at the beginning of a project and updated as stakeholders come and go, and as more information about stakeholders is learned.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help you tailor the stakeholder analysis to meet your needs:

For projects with relatively homogenous stakeholders, you can use a 2 × 2 grid that only considers two variables, such as interest and influence.
For larger projects consider using a 3 × 3 stakeholder cube. Tailor the categories to reflect the importance of various stakeholder variables.
For smaller projects you can combine the stakeholder analysis with the stakeholder register.



Alignment
The stakeholder analysis should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Stakeholder register
Stakeholder engagement plan



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 3.16 to assist you in developing a stakeholder analysis.


TABLE 3.16 Stakeholder Analysis

3.17 USER STORY
A user story is a brief description of a desired outcome, documented from a stakeholder's perspective. User stories keep stakeholder needs visible throughout the development process.
A user story contains the following information:

Stakeholder
Need/want
Benefit

User stories generally follow this format:
As a (stakeholder), I want (want or need) so I can (benefit).
User stories may be kept on a backlog and prioritized for development by the product owner.
User stories can receive information from

Vision statement
Startup canvas
Requirements documentation
Stakeholder register

They provide information to

Backlog

User stories are developed at the start of the project updated throughout the project as stakeholder needs and wants are clarified and evolve.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the user stories to meet your needs:

User stories can be documented on index cards, or in a software specifically designed for Agile projects.
You can add space for story point estimates, the iteration the user story is assigned to, the responsible party, and completion criteria (AKA definition of done).



Alignment
User stories should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Requirements documentation
Scope information



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 3.17 to assist you in developing the retrospective.

USER STORY





3.18 RETROSPECTIVE
A retrospective is an activity that is performed at the end of every iteration (sprint). It is a safe environment to explore things that worked in the previous iteration, and things that can be improved. Retrospectives keep the team aligned with continuous improvement.
Information is usually recorded on sticky notes or recorded in software for remote teams. There are several common retrospective approaches. The starfish retrospective collects the following information:

Start
Stop
Keep
More
Less

Another common retrospective is the 4 Ls where team members document the following information:

Liked
Learned
Lacked
Longed for

There are many retrospective approaches, but regardless of the approach, the intent of a retrospective is to engage the team in improving their performance so they become more efficient in each subsequent iteration.

Alignment
The retrospective should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Lessons learned summary
Project closeout

4Logs and Registers


Logs and registers are very helpful in keeping track of changing information. They are dynamic documents that are started at the beginning of the project and are kept up to date throughout the project.
Most of the templates in this chapter are useful for waterfall as well as adaptive projects. Examples include an assumption log, decision log, and issue log - though the issue log may be known as an impediment log in projects that use an Agile methodology. A backlog is used primarily for Agile projects, and a change log is used primarily for predictive projects. There are eight log/register templates:

Assumption log
Backlog
Change log
Decision log
Issue log
Stakeholder register
Risk register
Lessons learned register

Several of the templates in this section can be combined into one document, especially if you create the templates in a spreadsheet, with each worksheet containing information for one log. For example, a RAID log contains:

Risk log
Assumption log
Issue log
Decision log

You may find that several of the logs interact, for example, an assumption that is not validated may become a risk. A risk that occurs may be considered an issue. In these cases, it is best to close the item in one log with a notation that it has moved to a different log. In the notes section of the new log it is useful to note if the item came from a different log or register.


4.1 ASSUMPTION LOG
Assumptions are factors that are considered to be true but without proof. Constraints are also documented in this log. Constraints are limiting factors that affect the execution of the project. Typical constraints include a predetermined budget or fixed milestones for deliverables. Information in the assumption log includes

Identifier
Category
Assumption or constraint
Responsible party
Due date
Actions
Status
Comments

Assumptions can come from any document in the project. They can also be determined by the project team. Constraints may be documented in the project charter and are determined by the customer, sponsor, or regulatory agencies.
The assumption log provides information to

Requirements documentation
Project scope statement
Duration estimates
Project schedule
Quality management plan
Resource estimates
Risk register
Stakeholder engagement plan

The assumption log is a dynamic document that is updated throughout the project. Assumptions are progressively elaborated throughout the project, and when they are eventually validated, they are no longer assumptions.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help you tailor the assumption log to meet your needs:

Combine the assumption log with the issue register and the decision log to create an AID Log (A = assumption, I = issue, D = decision). You can create them in a spreadsheet with each sheet dedicated to either assumptions, issues, or decisions.
If you have a very large project, you may want to keep the constraints in a separate log from the assumptions.



Alignment
The assumption log should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project charter
Project brief
Issue log
Risk register



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 4.1 to assist you in developing the assumption log.

4.2 BACKLOG
A backlog is used when a project uses an adaptive approach, such as Agile. It is used to prioritize work. A backlog is developed at the very beginning of a project, often in conjunction with the product vision statement. The backlog is used to enter all requirements so they can be prioritized.
The product backlog includes at least

ID
Summary description
Priority
Status

The backlog is developed at the start of the project and is updated throughout the project.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the product backlog to meet your needs:

Rather than using requirements, you can have user stories in the backlog. Alternatively, you can use the backlog for requirements and have a column that indicates the user story each requirement is associated with.
To provide more detail, you can indicate which iteration or release a requirement will be incorporated into.
You may want to indicate the user type that will benefit from the requirement, such as customer, administrator, manager, etc.
For large projects, it helps to categorize requirements, so having a column that indicates the category can be useful.



Alignment
The backlog should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Product vision
Roadmap
Release plan



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 4.2 to assist you in developing the product backlog.


TABLE 4.2 Elements of a Product Backlog

You can include additional summary information from the change request in the log, such as cost or schedule impact.
You can add a check box that indicates whether the change is mandatory (such as a legal requirement) or discretionary.
The change log can also record information to track configuration management, such as which configurable items are impacted.
Some IT projects include a field that indicates if a change is a bug fix.



Alignment
The change log should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

4.4 DECISION LOG
Frequently, there are alternatives in developing a product or managing a project. Using a decision log can help keep track of the decisions that were made, who made them, and when they were made. A decision log can include

Identifier
Category
Decision
Responsible party
Date
Comments

The decision log can be very helpful in managing the day‐to‐day activities of the project. It is a dynamic document that is created at the start of the project and is maintained throughout the project.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the decision log to meet your needs:

For projects that are large, complicated, or complex, you can add fields to identify the impacts of the decision on deliverables or project objectives.
You could add a field that documents which stakeholders are impacted by the decision, should be involved with making the decision, or should be informed of the decision.



Alignment
The decision log should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project scope statement
Responsibility assignment matrix
Communications management plan

Name
Position in the organization
Role in the project
Contact information
List of stakeholder's major requirements
List of stakeholder's expectations
Classification of each stakeholder

Initially, you will not have enough information to complete the stakeholder register. As the project gets under way, you will gain additional information and understanding about each stakeholder's requirements, expectations, and classification and the stakeholder register will become more robust.
The stakeholder register receives information from

Project charter
Project startup canvas
Procurement documents

It is related to stakeholder analysis.
It provides information to

Requirements documentation
Quality management plan
Communications management plan

5Reports and Audits


All projects need to report project status; however, projects that use predictive approaches are more likely to use reports to communicate the status of their project. For smaller projects, team progress reports and project status reports are sufficient. Larger projects might use an earned value report and a risk report.
Not all projects are subject to audits. Those that are, tend to be larger projects. Audits may be conducted at the project level, or they may be done by the project management office (PMO) or at a program or portfolio level.
There are 12 templates associated with reports and audits:

Team progress report
Project status report
Variance analysis report
Earned value report
Risk report
Contractor status report
Contract closeout report
Lessons learned report
Project closeout report
Quality audit
Risk audit
Procurement audit

Progress and status reports follow a set cadence, such as monthly. Closeout and lessons learned reports are used as needed. It is unlikely that you will need to change format of the reports and audits during the project.


5.1 TEAM MEMBER PROGRESS REPORT
The team member progress report is filled out by team members and submitted to the project manager on a regular basis. It tracks schedule, quality, and cost status for the current reporting period and provides planned information for the next reporting period. Progress reports also identify new risks and issues that have arisen in the current reporting period. Typical information includes

Activities planned for the current reporting period
Activities accomplished in the current reporting period
Activities planned but not accomplished in the current reporting period
Root causes of activities variances
Funds spent in the current reporting period
Funds planned to be spent for the current reporting period
Root causes of funds variances
Quality variances identified in the current reporting period
Planned corrective or preventive action
Activities planned for the next reporting period
Costs planned for the next reporting period
New risks identified
New issues identified
Comments

This information is generally compiled by the project manager into a project status report. The team member progress report is submitted at predefined intervals throughout the project.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to tailor the team member progress report to meet your needs:

You can add a field for escalations to identify those areas that need to be escalated to the sponsor, program manager, or other appropriate individual.
Some reports include a field to record decisions made. These would be transferred to the project decision log.
If your organization has a robust knowledge management process, you might consider adding fields for knowledge transfer or lessons learned. These can then be transferred to the organization's knowledge repository or lessons learned register.



Alignment
The team member progress report should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project schedule
Cost estimates
Project budget
Issue log
Risk register
Project status report
Variance analysis
Earned value status report

5.2 PROJECT STATUS REPORT
The project status report (sometimes known as a performance report or progress report) is filled out by the project manager and submitted on a regular basis to the sponsor, project portfolio management group, PMO, or other project oversight person or group. The information is compiled from the team member progress reports and includes overall project performance. It contains summary‐level information, such as accomplishments, rather than detailed activity‐level information. The project status report tracks schedule and cost status for the current reporting period and provides planned information for the next reporting period. It indicates impacts to milestones and cost reserves as well as identifying new risks and issues that have arisen in the current reporting period. Typical information includes

Accomplishments for the current period
Accomplishments planned but not completed in the current period
Root causes of accomplishment variances
Impact to upcoming milestones or project due date
Planned corrective or preventive action

A variance analysis can be provided as a standalone report, as part of the project status report, or as backup to an earned value status report.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the variance analysis to meet your needs:

Technical variance can be decomposed into scope and quality variance.
The variance analysis can be done at an activity, resource, work package, control account, or project level depending on your needs.
You can add a check box to indicate if the information needs to be escalated to the sponsor, program manager, or other appropriate individuals.
You may want to add a field that indicates the implications of continued variance. This can include a forecast based on a trend analysis or based on identified responses.
In addition to tailoring the content of the variance analysis, you can tailor the presentation. Many PMOs have reporting software that transforms the data into dashboards, heat reports, stop light charts, or other representations.



Alignment
The variance analysis should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Team member progress reports
Project status report
Project schedule
Cost estimates
Project budget
Issue log

5.4 EARNED VALUE ANALYSIS
Earned value analysis shows specific mathematical metrics that are designed to reflect the health of the project by integrating technical, schedule, and cost information. Information can be reported for the current reporting period and on a cumulative basis. Earned value analysis can also be used to forecast the total cost of the project at completion or the efficiency required to complete the project for the baseline budget. Information that is generally collected includes

Budget at completion (BAC)
Planned value (PV)
Earned value (EV)
Actual cost (AC)
Schedule variance (SV)
Cost variance (CV)
Schedule performance index (SPI)
Cost performance index (CPI)
Percent planned
Percent earned
Percent spent
Estimates at completion (EAC)
To complete performance index (TCPI)

Earned value analysis information can be provided as a standalone report or as part of the project status report. Earned value analysis is conducted at pre‐defined intervals throughout the project.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the earned value analysis to meet your needs:

The earned value analysis can be done at the control account and/or project level, depending on your needs.
You may want to add a field that indicates the implications of continued variance. This can include a forecast based on a trend analysis or based on identified responses.
Several different equations can be used to calculate the EAC, depending on whether the remaining work will be completed at the budgeted rate or at the current rate. Two options are presented on this template.
There are options to calculate a TCPI. Use the information from your project to determine the best approach for reporting.
You may want to add information that indicates the implications of continued schedule variance. This can include a schedule forecast using SPI as the basis for a trend analysis or based on analyzing the critical path.
Some organizations are starting to embrace earned schedule metrics. You can update this form to include various earned schedule calculations in addition to a critical path analysis.
In addition to tailoring the content of the earned value analysis, you can tailor the presentation. Many PMOs have reporting software that transforms the data into dashboards, control charts, S‐curves, or other representations.



Alignment
Earned value analysis should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project status report
Project schedule
Project budget
Variance analysis report
Contractor status report



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 5.4 to assist you in developing an earned value analysis.


TABLE 5.4 Elements of Earned Value Analysis




Document Element
Description




Planned value
Enter the value of the work planned to be accomplished.


Earned value
Enter the value of the work actually accomplished.


Actual cost
Enter the cost for the work accomplished.


Schedule variance
Calculate the schedule variance by subtracting the planned value from the earned value. SV = EV - PV


Cost variance
Calculate the cost variance by subtracting the actual cost from the earned value. CV = EV - AC


Schedule performance index
Calculate the schedule performance index by dividing earned value by the planned value. SPI = EV/PV


Cost performance index
Calculate the cost performance index by dividing the earned value by the actual cost. CPI = EV/AC


Root cause of schedule variance
Identify the root cause of the schedule variance.


Schedule impact
Describe the impact on deliverables, milestones, or critical path.


Root cause of cost variance
Identify the root cause of the cost variance.


Budget impact
Describe the impact on the project budget, contingency funds and reserves, and any intended actions to address the variance.


Percent planned
Indicate the cumulative percent of the work planned to be accomplished. PV/BAC


Percent earned
Indicate the cumulative percent of work that has been accomplished. EV/BAC


Percent spent
Indicate the total costs spent to accomplish the work. AC/BAC


Estimates at completion
Determine an appropriate method to forecast the total expenditures at the project completion. Calculate the forecast and justify the reason for selecting the particular estimate at completion. For example:



If the CPI is expected to remain the same for the remainder of the project: EAC = BAC/CPI



If both the CPI and SPI will influence the remaining work: EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV)/(CPI × SPI)]


To complete performance index
Calculate the work remaining divided by the funds remaining.


TCPI = (BAC - EV)/(BAC - AC) to complete on plan, or



TCPI = (BAC - EV)/(EAC - AC) to complete the current EAC.

5.5 RISK REPORT
The risk report presents information on overall project risk and summarizes information on individual project risks. It provides information for identifying and analyzing risks. It also covers risk response planning, implementation, and monitoring. Typical information includes

Executive summary
Description of overall project risk
Description of individual project risks
Quantitative analysis
Reserve status
Risk audit results (if applicable)

The risk report can receive information from anywhere in the project environment. Some documents that should be specifically reviewed for input include

Assumption log
Issue log
Lessons learned register
Risk management plan
Project performance reports
Variance analysis
Earned value status
Risk audit
Contractor status reports

The risk report provides information to

Lessons learned register
Project closeout report

The risk report is developed at the start of the project and is updated throughout the project.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the risk report to meet your needs:

For a small, simple, or short‐term project, you can summarize this information in the regular project status report rather than create a separate risk report.
Many projects do not include a quantitative risk analysis; if yours does not, omit this information from the report.
For larger, longer, and more complex projects, you can tailor the quantitative risk analysis techniques used to those most appropriate to your project.
For more robust risk reports, include appendices that may include the full risk register and quantitative risk model input (probabilistic distributions, branch correlation groups, etc.).



Alignment
The risk report should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

5.6 CONTRACTOR STATUS REPORT
The contractor status report is filled out by the contractor and submitted on a regular basis to the project manager. It tracks status for the current reporting period and provides forecasts for future reporting periods. The report also gathers information on new risks, disputes, and issues. Information can include

Scope performance
Quality performance
Schedule performance
Cost performance
Forecasted performance
Claims or disputes
Risks
Issues
Preventive or corrective actions

This information is generally included in the project status report compiled by the project manager. The contractor status report is submitted at predefined intervals throughout the project.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the contractor status report to meet your needs:

You can combine scope and quality performance into one category of technical performance.
You can add a field for escalations to identify those areas that need to be escalated to the sponsor, program manager, contracting officer, or other appropriate individuals.
If there were any contract change requests that were submitted during the reporting period, summary information should be described in the contractor status report.
In addition to tailoring the content of the contractor status report, you can tailor the presentation. Many PMOs have reporting software that transforms the data into dashboards, heat reports, stop light charts, or other representations.



Alignment
The contractor status report should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

5.7 CONTRACT CLOSEOUT REPORT
Contract closeout involves documenting the vendor performance so that the information can be used to evaluate the vendor for future work. Contract closure helps ensure contractual agreements are completed or terminated. Before a contract can be fully closed or terminated, all disputes must be resolved, the product or result must be accepted, and the final payments must be made. Information recorded as part of closing out a contract includes

Vendor performance analysis

Scope
Quality
Schedule
Cost
Other information, such as how easy the vendor was to work with


Record of contract changes

Change ID

This information is saved, along with the lessons learned register, in a lessons learned repository. Repositories can be as simple as a lessons learned binder, they can be a searchable database, or anything in between. The purpose is to improve performance on the current project (if done during the project) and future projects. Use the information from your project to tailor the form to best meet your needs. The lessons learned summary is developed at the close of a phase for long projects and at the close of the project for shorter projects.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the lessons learned summary to meet your needs:

Add, combine, or eliminate rows as needed to capture the important aspects of your project.
Consider including a section on change management, as that can sometimes be a challenging aspect of projects to manage.
You may want to include a section on phase management if you are doing the summary at the end of the project.
If your project used a new development approach, such as a blended predictive and adaptive (agile) approach, consider adding some relevant lessons learned.



Alignment
The lessons learned summary should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Issue register
Risk register
Decision log
Lessons learned register
Retrospectives



Description
You can use the element descriptions in Table 5.8 to assist you in developing the lessons learned summary.

5.9 PROJECT CLOSEOUT REPORT
Project closeout involves documenting the final project performance as compared to the project objectives. The objectives from the project charter are reviewed and evidence of meeting them is documented. If an objective was not met, or if there is a variance, that is documented as well. In addition, information from the procurement closeout is documented. Information documented includes

Project description
Project objectives
Completion criteria
How met
Cost and schedule variances
Benefits management
Business needs
Summary of risks and issues

Use the information from your project to determine the best approach.

Tailoring Tips
Consider the following tips to help tailor the project or phase closeout to meet your needs:

For longer projects, consider a phase closeout rather than waiting until the end of the project. At the end of the project, you can compile all the phase closeout information.
When working with an incremental life cycle or Agile development method, the delivery of a major end item, service, or capability may benefit from a formal phase closeout report.
For projects that are part of a program, you should tailor the content to meet the needs of the program.



Alignment
The project closeout should be aligned and consistent with the following documents:

Project management plan (all components)
Lessons learned summary

The project closeout form is developed at the end of a project or phase.

Appendix: Combination Templates


Throughout the book, I have mentioned that you can combine certain templates if your project warrants it. This appendix provides an example of five combined templates:

Vision statement + project proposal
Charter + scope statement
Scope management plan + quality management plan
Communications management plan + stakeholder engagement plan
Procurement strategy + source selection

Because all the content in these templates is discussed in the book, I will not repeat it here. However, the table below gives a brief summary of how I tailored the templates when I combined them.



Documents
Tailoring Description




Vision statement Project proposal
This is simply a combination of the two templates. All content from each template is included.


Charter Scope statement
This is an abbreviated charter with scope statement information integrated into it. Information that is eliminated from the charter includes high‐level requirements, overall project risk, stakeholders, project exit criteria, and project manager authority levels. Information from the scope statement that is part of the abbreviated charter includes exclusions and deliverable acceptance criteria.


Scope management plan Quality management plan
This template takes an abbreviated version of each template and combines them. The template contains information about decomposing and organizing scope, which can refer to waterfall or Agile methods. The quality objectives are identified by listing a deliverable, metric, measure, and acceptance criteria. There is a place to describe which deliverables and processes are subject to quality review and a place to describe how scope change management should take place.


communications management plan Stakeholder engagement plan
This template takes an abbreviated version of each template and combines them. Information on the sender, assumptions, constraints, and glossary of terms is eliminated from the communications management plan. Information on the current and desired level of engagement, pending stakeholder changes, and stakeholder relationships is eliminated from the stakeholder engagement plan. There are two new fields that were added, one for influence and one for attitude. Influence refers to the degree to which a stakeholder can influence the project direction or decisions. Attitude refers to whether a stakeholder feels favorably or unfavorably about the project.


Procurement strategy Source selection
This is simply a combination of the two templates. All content from each template is included.



These template examples are merely a few options for combining and tailoring the templates in this book. Perhaps looking at how these templates are modified and combined will give you some ideas on how to tailor templates for your use
