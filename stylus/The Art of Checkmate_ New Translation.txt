Translator's Foreword
The Art of Checkmate has been a best selling chess book, praised for its instructional value, ever since it was first published in Monaco in 1947.
However, when the first French to English translation appeared in the 1950s it was severely criticised by the highly respected chess writer and teacher, Cecil Purdy, who wrote in the Australian magazine Chess World:
"The Art of Checkmate by Georges Renaud. and Victor Kahn, former champions of France, is yet another demonstration of how very suited the French literary tradition is to chess exposition. The close attention to the order and neatness of presentation makes study of most of the French chess writers a pleasure. In this case, a clumsy translation has succeeded in making merely delightful what could have been made super-delightful. It is a magnificent exposition of that vital department of chess skill, the mating combination.
The original was L'Art de Faire Mat, of which my copy - I don't know if a nicer edition was printed - is on poor paper and very unattractive to the eye. Bell's have produced an English edition in their usual style - well-nigh impossible to better as far as the appearance goes.
The excellence of the presentation is still there, too - the order, the neatness, and the pleasing system of classification according to names, which makes everything so easily remembered, e.g., Légal's Pseudo-Sacrifice, Greco's Mate, Anastasia's Mate, Boden's Mate, Blackburne's Mate, Anderssen's Mate, Pillsbury's Mate, Damiano's Mate, Morphy's Mate, the Arabian Mate, and so on. All these mates - the student discovers - are typical mates that occur daily. They are not ephemeral flights of genius recalled only in print, but part of the stock in trade of every expert player; but a book like this that codifies them so elegantly and interestingly gives even an expert a far better grip of them, so that his chances of scoring a vital extra point in a tournament are appreciably increased. Over and over again, the authors quote instances of forced mates missed by masters in the heat of battle. And for the average player, from now on we list this as a must book.
I am strongly opposed to the view that skill in chess can be attained only by hard work. I once studied a book on the differential calculus that was written quite flippantly, and yet gave a newcomer to the calculus a much better idea of its mysteries than the ponderous school texts I was supposed to be using. A chess book that is interesting and entertaining and yet has the subject all sewn up - that's the ideal, and Renaud and Kahn have hit the jackpot.
They could, however, institute a lawsuit against the translator. I really must comment on this aspect in the hope that chess publishers may exercise more care in the selection of people for this work. Previously, I railed at some faults in translations of books by Botvinnik - faults that were obvious without knowing Russian. But the translation of Renaud's and Kahn's work reaches what I sincerely hope is an all-time low. I am no French scholar, but any fourth-former could fault this stuff.
In almost every page one finds sentences that are not translations at all, or even paraphrases. They contain as much of the original as the pathetic skull of Yorick contained of the soul of that lively jester, and the bones are padded out not with the thoughts of Renaud and Kahn but, rather, thoughts of the translator's own which he seems - for no valid reason - to prefer ..."
Cecil Purdy then goes on to give illustrative examples to support his criticisms.
Thus it is to rectify these serious shortcomings and do full justice to the original work of Georges Renaud and Victor Kahn, that we have endeavoured to produce a fresh and accurate translation of L'Art de Faire Mat, whilst at the same time converting the old descriptive notation used in the English version to modern figurine algebraic and making various analytical observations, which are given in italic type.
We hope this new edition of a timeless classic will continue to benefit and be enjoyed by players of all strengths for many more years to come.







Introduction
Nothing is more annoying for a player, after he has racked his brains over a position and then selected and made what he thought to be the best move, than to hear a voice in the gallery exclaim in an ironic tone:
"Everyone to their own taste ... but in your place I would have preferred to announce mate in two moves."
And he is astonished to discover that there really was a mate in two moves and that his premature exchange of pieces has destroyed the opportunity for ever. He curses himself for not having seen it.

Here is a typical example. In the diagram position it was Black to move in a club tournament. The player of the Black pieces thought for a short moment, then he picked up his Queen, held it for a moment in the air and placed it triumphantly on d3. Indeed, he threatened ... ♕c2 mate.
White sacrificed the exchange by ♖xf5 and having two pawns more, exchanged Queens a few moves later and easily won the game.
When it was all over, the loser said:
"There was nothing I could do. I had sacrificed two pawns and the exchange for an attack that didn't come off."
Replacing the pieces in the diagram position, we showed him that there was a forced mate in two moves. The player thought for a few minutes and finally exclaimed:
"Well, I never ..."
At last, albeit a little late, he saw the mate:
1 ... ♕c3+! 2 bxc3 ♗a3 mate.
However this is a classic mate which, ever since the distant day in 1857 that Boden played it for the first time, has been reproduced a considerable number of times. Perhaps the same player had seen it in a chess book or magazine. But as no one had drawn his attention to the mechanism of this mate, the position was as new to him.
The first thing the student must do is to learn how to spot the mates. One will never be a good player if one cannot detect these mates and if one does not know how to carry them out.
If an amateur, with some practical experience, is shown a position and told: "There is a mate in five moves, find it!," he will discover it more or less easily, perhaps after a period of reflection but he will always discover it.
But let this amateur encounter the same position in a game and eighty per cent of the time, if not more, he will be blind to the mate.
Even very great masters have not escaped such misfortunes. Here are two examples that are particularly instructive:
Chigorin, in a match against Schiffers, played in Russia in 1897, reached the following position with Black:

He played ... b6 and the game was drawn, whereas he could have announced mate in five moves.

At the tournament in Hastings in 1937/1938, the winner S. Reshevsky, having the Black pieces against W. Fairhurst, thought a long while in the position shown in the diagram and finally played 1 ... h6? However, he could have carried out a classic mate:

7


♔ any


♕ mates.



One could multiply examples of this sort. Magazines and chess columns have created a topic: 'Blunders of the Masters'. Such a title is encouraging for the amateur.
But there is a lesson to be drawn from these blunders. For if great masters such as Chigorin and Reshevsky did not see - accidentally and no doubt pressed for time - such mates in a given number of moves, how many will always be overlooked by amateurs?
Yet mates in a given number of moves are the simplest of all the combinations, since more often than not they consist of a series of checks with forced replies. In addition, the majority of these mates can be reduced to a few standard types whose characteristics are easy to remember.
It is necessary to know these typical mating positions:
1) In order to apply them automatically and without loss of time when coming across them in games;
2) In order to try to obtain them when one has the attack;
3) In order to carefully avoid becoming a victim oneself.
When you are playing, there is no guardian angel to grab your arm as you are about to make a mistaken move and whisper in your ear, when the moment has come:
"Take care, my friend. There is a mate in four moves here, absolutely forced. Find it and do not miss the opportunity."
And the following lines are designed to accompany you, dear reader, in the role of this good and useful guardian angel.
The majority of manuals reproduce a famous game, at rook odds, which was played move by move, blow by blow, by Walker, Morphy and Steinitz, against amateurs. Let's examine it too and try to understand the way these three great players were able to deliver mate in the same manner against an inexperienced opponent.

Of course he should not take the Queen. But in the 19th century, amateurs always allowed themselves to be tempted by their opponent's gifts. Anyway this has hardly changed. It is a common misconception with some players that they imagine they are playing against a novice who has thoughtlessly left his Queen en prise.
White announces mate in six moves:

mate.



Can we teach the technique of such a mate? We do not think so. There is no recipe. The King was collected at its initial square and dragged gradually to the other side of the board, right up to a4, where it was mated.
An experienced player feels instinctively that positions, such as the one in the diagram, are rich in possibilities and so he searches. As here all the moves are forced and as there are no variations, it is relatively easy, with a little practice, to calculate the consequences of the Queen sacrifice and to see that seven moves later the King will be mated. And even if he is not able to see this exactly, the discerning player will 'feel' that the enemy King is about to embark on a journey from which it will not return.
We can also mention another no less famous game which appears in all the text books.

This mate seems amazing to the novice. However, since all the moves of the Black King are forced, it can be calculated precisely without the need for considerable mental effort.
But, here again, even if we gather together a hundred examples of King walks across the chess board, it is not possible to lay down rules.
The idea is to sacrifice material in order to draw out the King from its seemingly safe position, then, by a series of checks, corner it on the fatal mating square.
It is a question of rapid judgment, imagination and practice.
In 1940 and 1941, once a week, the authors voluntarily held a public chess course for some students. It included theoretical training on a demonstration board, practical exercises and simultaneous games. On these occasions they learned a lot themselves and this book was prompted by their training lessons.
To be able to deliver mate in a given position, two things are necessary:
1) To recognize that there is the possibility of a mate.
2) To know how to carry out this mate.
We have therefore endeavoured to classify methodically the typical mating positions. For each of these we have established a scheme. For each scheme we have explained the mechanism of the mate.
We then give examples drawn from practice. These examples are of three types.
The first includes games which end with the typical mate.
The second includes games which end with a variation, a modification of the typical mate.
The third is more complex. In fact, between experienced players of good playing strength, one will have difficulty in carrying out a typical mate. But one threatens to carry it out. And to avoid this threat, the opponent will often be compelled to make a defensive move, which weakens his position or loses material.
In ninety-five percent of games the two opponents castle. In ninety percent of the games where the opponents castle, one or the other castle on the King's side. So, in practice, nine times out of ten, it is against King's side castling that one mounts an attack. It is therefore a castled position on the King's side which above all we will come to attack.
In all the examples which follow, we assume - unless otherwise specified - that the castled position to attack is the short side castling of the Black King. It goes without saying that everything we say about short side castling of the Black King applies to short side castling of the White King.
To attack the enemy king a certain number of preliminary conditions have to be fulfilled:
1) The castled position must have a weakness.
There are two kinds of weaknesses:
a) Lasting and irrevocable weaknesses.
These are the advance of one or several of the Pawns defending the castled position, namely the f, g and h-Pawns.
b) Momentary and other similar weaknesses.
These are the removal or the absence of Pieces which defend the castled position, namely the King's Knight, generally placed on f6, and the Piece defending the King's Knight, be it the ♗e7, ♘d7 or ♕d8.
2) White must be able to attack these weaknesses.
To attack the weaknesses, it is necessary:
a) To have open lines (files, ranks or diagonals) against the castled position;
b) To have Pieces on these open lines.
c) To have more Pieces for the attack than the opponent has for the defence.
It is immaterial whether the defender has more Pieces than the attacker. What is essential is that he does not have the possibility of bringing them in time and to the desired place for the defence.
Time and again it is necessary to apply these principles. Indeed these principles are equally applicable for attack and position play. They govern the conduct of the game.
In this way our study, though limited in its objective - typical mating positions - by the same token will introduce the reader, gradually and effortlessly, to handy methods of conducting a game well.
Isn't the best way to learn the major principles of play by getting to know them through their application in the most brutal and most dramatic positions arising on the chess board: those which offer mates announced in a given number of moves.
And this will serve as the best introduction to a further book we are preparing, which will deal with the conduct of the game.
Finally, a remark to end this introduction. The typical mates we are going to examine are often encountered in practical play. But often does not mean always. On the contrary, between players of the same strength, it is extremely rare that a game ends in an announced mate. One of the opponents resigns because he has lost a Piece, or simply a Pawn, because he sees that after the exchange of material he will be left with a hopeless endgame.
We must not therefore imagine that in all his games a player will have the opportunity to deliver a typical mate and that in order to achieve this he must embark on reckless sacrifices. Each of these mates, in order to be carried out, requires that a certain number of conditions are met. If one is missing then the sacrifice will be in vain. The player will just be left one or two pieces down and his game will be lost.
Let us be bold, certainly ... it is the only way to win. But let us have good judgement as well.







Part One:
PICTURESQUE MATES
In the first section, we are going to study Légal's Pseudo-Sacrifice and show that it is a mechanism applicable to many positions; the power of the double check, because the double check is one of the fundamental elements of a mating attack; the Smothered Mate, which belongs in a mating category of its own; the Epaulettes and Guèridon Mates, which are in fact simply a curiosity, and finally the Calabrian Sacrifice.
These diverse mates are heterogeneous. They could be classified differently. They are not, in the sense of the term as we understand it, typical mates, apart from the Calabrian Mate. We have grouped them under the arbitrary title of 'Picturesque Mates.'







CHAPTER 1:
Légal's Pseudo-Sacrifice
We have not called this chapter 'Légal's Mate,' but 'Légal's Pseudo-Sacrifice.' Indeed it is not so much a mate that we are proposing to study as an attacking manoeuvre.
In certain cases this manoeuvre leads to a mate. In other cases it leads to a decisive gain of material.

This move violates a general principle of open games, enunciated for the first time by Emanuel Lasker (1896). In an open game, that is to say where, on the part of the other player, the e-Pawn has been advanced two squares, it is not always advisable to pin the opponent's King's Knight before he has castled.
There are three reasons for this.
First of all because this bishop can be chased away with gain of time by h2-h3 (or ... h7-h6 if it was White who played ♗g5) or be induced to exchange ... ♗g4xf3, which speeds up White's development and gets into play the Queen after it recaptures the Bishop.
Then because the Knight, which at the start of the game can only reasonably come out on two or three well defined squares (f6, c6, d7), should preferably be developed before the Bishop, which has the choice of several moves according to the formation adopted by the opponent.
Finally, because the pin on a Knight, which is absolute when the King is behind, is only relative when it is the Queen. The Knight can move, be it with check or with a mating threat, and the Bishop, if it is unprotected or insufficiently protected on g4, 'hanging' as they say, will be en prise.

This brilliant move, devised by Légal, leaves the Queen en prise. That does not matter because it introduces a threat of mate in two moves, that is to say if it were White's move now he would mate by 6 ♗xf7+ ♔e7 7 ♘d5 mate.



5


...


♗xd1??



A major blunder. Black has not seen the threat and thoughtlessly rushes to take the Queen, without considering that the opponent is neither foolish nor forgetful, and that he is perfectly aware that he has left the Queen en prise.
The lesser evil is the reply 5 ... dxe5. But after 6 ♕xg4, White has recaptured the piece and remains with the advantage of a Pawn and a decisive lead in development.
White announces mate in two moves.

The Typical Légal Mate
What good, you may think, is it to spend such a long time on this mate? It is over two hundred years old. It is famous. It is quoted as an example in all the chess books. All amateurs know it. There is no chance whatsoever of pulling it off again.
Not at all. First and foremost we ask you not to learn it by heart but to grasp the precise mechanism, to understand that the Bishop on g4 is 'hanging', that is to say exposed to capture if the Knight moves to threaten mate. But this mechanism appears in many positions as a latent threat and the opponent, if he pins your King's Knight, is obliged to take this into account.
Finally, do not assume that because a mate is famous and more than two centuries old no one will fall for it. All strong players know that in a simultaneous exhibition it is rare that one is unable to make use of it. The victims are well aware of Légal's mate. But not having recognised the position - perhaps because some detail is different from that which they have seen and indeed learned by heart, but without properly understanding the mechanics of it - they get caught out like novices. There are even games played by correspondence where it had been possible to make Légal's sacrifice.
Here, by way of example, are a few instructive games.

A remarkable blindfold player, he was in his day the holder of the world record with twenty-three simultaneous games. He gave his name to a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined, commonly known as the Cambridge Springs Defence, and also an attacking formation in the same gambit. He was Champion of the United States from 1897 until his death.

He was the author of the Traité Complet d'Echecs (Brussels 1927), which was rightly regarded as one of the best chess manuals of the time. André Cheron specialized at first in didactic studies and systematized the rules of the various endgames featuring rook and pawn against rook.
He was also a well-known and successful problem composer whose specialty was the strategical problem, pioneered in France by G. Renaud, and in Les Echecs Artistiques his presentation of the theory of this type of problem is a model of logic.

The Second Form of the Légal Mate
If the e7 square (or e2 if it is White who is under attack) is already either obstructed or guarded (usually by a Bishop), there is no longer the need for a Knight to give mate and the Légal sacrifice is possible and effective without the intervention of the Queen's Knight.
Let's start with a didactic example composed for demonstration purposes.

The Légal sacrifice. White accepts it and falls headlong into the trap.
And don't suppose that B. Horwitz was a duffer. This strong Mecklenburg player (1807-1885) was resident in London, where he collaborated with J.Kling on a collection of studies and endgames, Chess Studies, 1851, which is justly famous.
His conqueror, Ludwig Bledow, a good German player, was the inventor of a counter-gambit which bears his name. Only we are in 1837. The Légal sacrifice was only a century old...

The King's Knight is essential both for the defence of the Kingside castled position and also the protection of the King if it still remains on its initial square.
Its departure, be it by exchange or redeployment, allows the Légal sacrifice with this time an active intervention of the attacking Queen's Bishop

When the attacking King's Bishop is able to give check
The Légal sacrifice does not always lead to mate in three or four moves. Whether accepted or declined, it may simply give a decisive advantage to the attacker.
Here is a game that has been played a number of times. It has been published in many anthologies and attributed to J. Préti as well as to J. Mieses. Probably it is even older.
The attacking player, after losing his Queen, regains it with profit, thanks to a discovered check.

CHAPTER 2:
The Power of the Double Check
A check may be parried either by moving the King, by capturing the checking Piece, or by covering it, provided the check is given by a straight line piece. But a double check can only be parried by moving the King. So each of the two Pieces giving the double check may even be en prise without reducing the force of the attack.
All players know that the consequences of a double check may prove fatal and understand why novices are advised to be wary of them.
But what is less known is the fact that the double check, by compelling the enemy King to move, may soon draw it into a mating net, even sometimes in the very opening of the game
Here is an elementary example, but very typical in that the King is mated on its initial square in the opening of the game.

This offer of a pawn in the first moves of the opening is called a gambit (from the Italian 'dare il gambetto': to trip up with your leg). The object of the gambit of the f-pawn is twofold:
1) To open the f-file;
2) To exploit the time Black spends on defending the won Pawn by developing some Pieces.

In going to f6, the Knight strikes the e8 and d7 squares. The Queen strikes the e7 and e8 squares. The King is attacked from two sides and, blocked by his own Pieces, cannot escape. It is mate. Even though the two mating Pieces are each en prise.
It needed a serious blunder to be mated so quickly. And in practice it is rare that a double check can be utilized other than as a threat.
Here, in a theoretical variation, is one of the usual ways of employing a double check.

The Preparatory Sacrifice
We now come to the capital exploitation of the double check to drag the King to a fatal position. In order to place the attacked King in a situation where it will be subject to a double check with decisive consequences (a rapid mate or gain of material), one should not hesitate to sacrifice a piece, even the Queen!
In the example which follows, it is a Bishop which will be sacrificed.

Vienna Game
Strasbourg, 1924
F. Lazard - R. Crepeaux
Fred Lazard (1883-1948), born in Paris, was the most versatile of all French players. Indeed, not only was he an excellent practical player, but he joined those fine problem composers who won many awards. Finally and most importantly he was an excellent composer of studies and endgames, of world renown. There are very few people who have emulated Fred Lazard, a name appreciated in the three domains of chess: the game, the problem and the study.
Robert Crepeaux, born in Grasse in 1900, Champion of France three times, in 1924, 1925 and 1941, was, with Andre Muffang, the most brilliant of all the players who were authentically French. He excelled in combinative play, and the game he won against von Holzhausen in a correspondence match, France - Germany, 1930, appeared in chess magazines over the whole world. Crepeaux, a former student of the L'Ecole Polytechnique, worked as an engineer with the SNCF.

A Famous Game
All the text books published since 1914 have quoted a casual game played in Vienna in 1910 betweeen the two masters, Réti and Tartakower, as an example of the fatal double check.
GAME NO. 24
Caro-Kann Defence
Vienna, 1910
R. Réti - S. Tartakower
Richard Réti (1889-1929) was a Hungarian Grandmaster, who died prematurely and gave his name to an opening, 1 ♘f3. His best successes were in tournaments held after the First World War: Kassa, Budapest, Gothenburg, Teplitz-Schonau. He composed some studies which are little masterpieces and wrote several books. The best known is Modern Ideas in Chess, in which he developed the ideas of the hypermodern school, of which, together with his fellow countryman, Gyula Breyer and Aron Nimzowitsch, he must be considered the founder. He was one of the greatest talents of his generation.
Savielly Tartakower, born in Rostov-on-Don (Russia) in 1887 of Austro-Polish parents, took part in numerous tournaments with success. His best results were: London 1927, Vienna 1923, and Hastings 1946. He wrote innumerable articles in the chess press and many books, of which the main one is Die Hypermoderne Schachpartie (The Hypermodern Game of Chess). The liveliness of his notes and comments makes for enjoyable reading. He died in Paris in 1956.

Black falls right into it. First of all, it is clear that if 8 ... ♕xe4?, 9 ♖e1 wins the Queen (for Rook and Knight). Black only sees as a response to the text capture, 9 ♖e1, which would have eventually won back the Piece.

10

♔c7

11

And so, after the double check, which can only be countered by a move of the Black King, there is a mate by the Rook or the Bishop, according to the flight square chosen by the hounded King.
As Tartakower wrote himself, in his Breviary of Chess: 'Better than any spoken word, this game illustrates the power of the double check.'
This game, with its spectacular Queen sacrifice to set up a double check leading to mate, has been reproduced so often that we would not have given it again if it did not have instructional value.
"Nothing New..."
When the game was over, Réti, who was a very modest man, did not pretend to have been struck by sudden enlightenment and divine inspiration. He had had a recollection. For in Chess, as in any other sphere, it is only by drawing on the experience of others and on the acquired knowledge of past generations that one is able to progress and create.
This Queen sacrifice indeed had a number of precedents. Here is a snapshot.
Let's start with the one that seems to be the oldest:

GAME NO.27
Scotch Game
Paris, 1864
Maczuski - I. Kolisch
Baron Ignatius von Kolisch (1837-1889), born in Pressburg (Bratislava), was a Grandmaster with unfortunately too brief a career. He started to play at the Café de la Régence in Paris. He took 7th place at the Bristol Congress, 1861, and 1st at the Emperor's tournament, Paris, 1867. He made a success of business and banking, and turned away from chess other than taking up the role of a patron.
At the time this game was played, Maczuski was a young Polish player regarded by amateurs at the Régence as a great hope for the future.

These five games are of unequal merit. If Réti's is more elegant, precise and short, it is totally lacking in originality. The position resembles that of Awet. The mechanism goes back to Horwitz and Falkbeer.
The latter brought about a position. Maczuski, Awet and especially Réti merely exploited a situation created by their opponents.
The Réti - Tartakower game has by no means closed the series, as the following game will show:

Caro-Kann Defence
Played at Antwerp, 1931, in a simultaneous blindfold display
G. Koltanowski - X
G. Koltanowski (1903-2000), originally from Poland, lived in Belgium, of which he was Champion several times. He never achieved the very top class, but specialized in massive simultaneous exhibitions, and above all in blindfold play.
On May 30, 1931, at Antwerp, he played thirty simultaneous blindfold games (twenty wins and ten draws). And in October, 1937, he beat the world record at Edinburgh with thirty-four completed games in twelve hours (twenty-four wins and ten draws without a single loss). 'Kolty' later became an American citizen and lived in San Francisco, where he claimed another record of conducting the world's longest running daily newspaper chess column - for over 50 years.

The Evergreen
The present survey of the double check would be incomplete if it did not include the famous 'Evergreen' of which the French master Alphonse Goetz wrote in the Cinéma des Echecs that every good amateur should know it by heart.
In German Chess literature this game between Anderssen and Dufresne is known as the Immergrün. It has figured in practically every anthology since Anderssen's death and is described poetically by Steinitz as 'The Evergreen in the Laurel Crown' of the master.
GAME NO. 30
Evans Gambit
Berlin, 1854
A. Anderssen - J. Dufresne
Adolf Anderssen (1818-1879), of Breslau, a professor of mathematics, was a German Grandmaster of the very top rank. He won first prizes in the London tournaments of 1851 and 1862, and in the Baden tournament of 1870, and beat Harrwitz, Kolisch, Lowenthal and Zukertort in matches. He was considered as having been World Champion from 1851 until 1858, the date when Morphy beat him. His combinations were marked by genius.
Jean Dufresne, of Berlin (1829-1893), was a strong German player and author of various books and collections of master games, from which several generations have learned the game of Chess.

This move, characterizing the Evans Gambit, was thought up by the British naval captain W. D. Evans (1790-1872), and for a long time was considered 'a gift of the Gods' to prove their interest in Chess. The object of the Pawn sacrifice is to gain time to form a centre, which is White's ambition in the Italian Game. For many years the accepted gambit had produced games where White obtained a strong attack as compensation for the Pawn. The Evans Gambit has disappeared from tournament play ever since Emanuel Lasker demonstrated that by giving back the gambit Pawn Black could obtain the better endgame.

Chess is sometimes a difficult game.

We are now able to understand the idea of 19 ♖ad1. This is, by means of a Queen sacrifice, to place the enemy King in a situation where it will be subject to a fatal double check. The combination is at the same time precise and complicated and that is why, despite being more than a century old, it is still admired.

CHAPTER 3:
The Smothered Mate
A mate delivered by a Knight, where all the squares (or the majority of squares) surrounding the mated King are occupied by the King's own pieces, is called a Smothered Mate.

The Smothered Mate can take place directly if the King is already blocked in by its own Pieces.
It can take place indirectly when a preliminary manoeuvre by the attacker forces the defensive party to obstruct the flight squares of its King.

The Smothered Mate of Damiano
In practice, the Smothered Mate is obtained just as frequently against a castled King. The trick is to drive the King into a corner of the board and, by means of a sacrifice, to force the obstruction of the squares surrounding it.
Here is a simple position (P. Damiano, 1512), in which the first move consists simply of a sacrifice both to deflect the Black Queen from its protection of the f7 square and its pin on the Knight.
GAME ENDING NO. 5

The first two moves serve to create Damiano's position. One cannot announce mate in four moves because the Black Queen is not forced to capture the Rook on the first move.
The Mate of Lucena
We now come to a classic position where the attacker forces a suffocation of the enemy King by a Queen sacrifice. The oldest known example is from Lucena (1497). It is usually one of the first things shown to beginners and it evokes a cry of admiration. Indeed many amateurs have been introduced to the beauties of Chess by means of this elementary combination.
GAME ENDING No. 7
Lucena, 1497
Luis Ramirez de Lucena, a Spaniard, was famous for a work which he published in 1497 and for the Manuscripts of Gottingen and Paris, which are a revision of the former.

2


♘f7+


♔g8



These two preparatory checks have placed the attacked King in a position where it will receive a double check. It is this double check that will allow the attacker to have two pieces, the Queen and the Knight, striking the g8 square.

[3 ♘d8+ ♔h8 4 ♕e8+ ♕f8 5 ♕xf8 or 3 ... ♔f8 4 ♕f7 also mates.]

And now that this g8 square is attacked twice, White sacrifices his Queen. Black, obliged to take, can only do this with a Piece other than the King.



4


♕g8+!


♖xg8



The Black King is completely blocked in by its own Pieces. Hence:



5


♘f7 mate.


 



In the 18th century the authors of 'desperate positions' have contrived to present this mate in various ways. They precede the characteristic manoeuvre with a few appetizers. Later we will publish a few of them in the form of Exercises.
Lucena's mate is constantly met in casual games. In simultaneous displays, masters obtain it almost as often as the Légal mate, which is saying something.
First of all, here is a very old example given by Greco (1612) in his manuscript Treatise of the Noble and Military Game of Chess, Containing Many Beautiful Moves and the True Science of the Game, by Gioachino the Calabrian.

It additionally shows how Lucena's mate does not apply only to the corner, but also to a King in the middle of the board.

A mistake against which novices should be on their guard. White has the Queen and two Knights in play. Black has only the Queen.

They are typical positions, but ones which cannot be presented theoretically because they happen accidentally, not as a consequence of a systematic weakening of the castled position or a central attack on the King.

When the two squares at an angle behind the King are obstructed by Pieces of its own colour and when the hostile Queen controls the six others adjacent to the King, the position is called the Guéridon mate because the pieces are configured, if you like, in a kind of Guéridon, a small round table on a single central leg, as shown in the scheme above. This mate, for which one cannot clearly establish a technique because it can arise from many positions, is sometimes forced in the first moves of the game, following a serious mistake in the opening by the opponent. Here is an amusing example:

Black's last move is a serious mistake. Why? Because:
1) It blocks the Queen and Queen's Bishop.
2) In blocking the Queen's Bishop, it takes away one of the defenders of the e6 square.
If somehow we force the advance of Black's f7-Pawn (or remove it), which covers the e6 square, the move ♘e6 wins the Queen, which is blocked in.

The Epaulettes Mate
Supposing that the attacked King is Black, the Epaulettes are the two Black Pieces flanking it on its right and left on a rank or file, and preventing it from taking flight.
The three schemes that follow, A, B, C show better than any long explanation what is an Epaulettes Mate.

Scheme A is classical. The Queen mates a King on the edge, blocked in by its own Rooks
Scheme B shows a central position of the same mate.
Scheme C presents the Epaulettes Mate being delivered by a Knight
The game which follows belongs to scheme A. The final position is in all the text books.

Paul Charles Morphy was born in 1837 in New Orleans, where he died in 1884. A veritable genius, as he revealed by winning the New York tournament in 1857. Coming soon after to Europe, he defeated in match play all the strong players whom he met and notably Anderssen. After having shone like a meteor for two years he gave up chess.

It is hardly necessary to emphasize the fact that Black has played very badly. But it was the ingenious Calabrian, Greco - or perhaps one of his contemporaries: one hardly cared about anteriorities at the beginning of of the seventeenth century - who is credited with discovering the combination which, in this position, immediately decides in White's favour: the sacrifice ♗xh7+.
This attack has been the object of numerous systematic studies over the last hundred years. The first time the necessary and sufficient conditions of the sacrifice were laid down in print was in 1911, by the erudite Swiss master Ervin Voellmy ('Vom Rochade-Angriff,' Revue Suisse d'Echecs). But the majority of those who have written on this subject have omitted to cite it.
Greco's analysis is very perfunctory. Here it is more detailed and complete.

If Black refuses to take the bishop, White can withdraw this Piece and be content with the win of a Pawn. But it is stronger to continue the attack by 8 ♘g5 as suggested by Greco.

Black has now three lines of play:
1) The retreat of the King to g8.
2) The capture of the Knight on g5.
3) The sortie of the King to g6 or h6.
We are going to examine each of them in turn.

As the mate can be delayed but not avoided.
We would not have published this mediocre game but for the opportunity it gave us to analyze Greco's suggestion of 8 ♘g5.

This first scheme, where only White material essential for the attack and Black material liable to cooperate in the defence (or obstruct it) is shown, is more general than the position in the Greco game, since the g5 square is only defended by the Bishop on c1 and there is no Pawn on h4 to provide an essential opening of the h-file. Finally the d7 and e7 squares are neither protected nor obstructed.
We are going to see what are the consequences of the acceptance of the Bishop sacrifice by the side of the attacked King, if the King then retreats to g8.

♗xh7+


♔xh7




2


♘g5+


♔g8



If 2 ... ♕xg5 White has won Queen and Pawn for Bishop and Knight.



3


♕h5


♖e8



The only defence.

In this position White announces a forced mate because:
1) The e8 and d8 squares are obstructed.
2) The d6 and f6 squares are inaccessible to the Black King because they are guarded by the Pawn on e5.



4


♕xf7+


 



It is necessary to eliminate this Pawn so that at the moment of mate, the White Queen has command of the whole of the seventh rank.

If Black has a little more material, particularly a Bishop on e7, White also needs to bring one more Piece into action.

In this second scheme, there is an h-Pawn supported by a Rook on h1.



1


♗xh7+


♔xh7




2


♘g5+


♔g8




3


♕h5


 



There is nothing to be served by playing 3 ... ♖e8 since the e7 square is obstructed: 3 ... ♖e8 4 ♕h7+ ♔f8 5 ♕h8 mate.
As a consequence Black must play:



3


...


♗xg5



And we fall back into the lines of play already seen when studying the prototype game of Greco's.
When the conditions of one of the two schemes is fulfilled, the retreat of the King to g8 (or h8) enables White to mate or to win the Queen for two minor Pieces.
It is beyond the scope of this book to study the consequences of the sortie of the King to g6. Let us only say that when this sacrifice is correct it leads either to a mate or sooner or later to a recapture of material and an attack which largely compensates for the Bishop that was initially sacrificed. The more general manoeuvre after the King is on g6 consists of 1) bringing the Queen to g4 (or g3) with the threat of a discovered check: playing ♘g5, attacking the Queen; 2) bringing the Queen's Knight to the King's wing via c3 and e2.







CHAPTER 6:
Exercises
It is not everything to read the explanations, however detailed they are, that we give on each mating position. It is necessary to train oneself to recognise them, however disguised they may be, and then solve them. This is why, throughout this book, are to be found practical exercises for which the solutions are given separately, a long way from the diagram, at the end of the volume.
How should one proceed to make a productive search for the solution? That depends on the strength of the reader. If the player is experienced, he should not at any price place the Pieces on the chess board. The position must be analysed and solved mentally, by looking at the diagram, irrespective of the number of moves of an announced mate. If the player is inexperienced, he should place the pieces on the chess board and force himself to find the solution, while imagining that he is playing against an opponent and, consequently, without touching the pieces, without hovering his hands over the board. It is with the head that one must play chess and not with the fingers.
But, once the solution has been found mentally, it is on the other hand good to check it carefully by moving the pieces. Our long experience has indeed proved that the act of moving the pieces facilitates the memorisation of the variations that one has studied, at least for a number of players.
It goes without saying, above all for the first exercises, the task of the solver would be too easy if all the mates to be discovered were to relate strictly to the chapters that preceded it. So we thought it fair enough to mix them with other announced mates and some that are easier to solve.
Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary, the positions that we submit to the sagacity of our readers are not composed. These are not artificial works, unrelated to practical play. They are mates which were actually delivered in the course of a game or could have been delivered if the player had been able to discover them to his advantage.
Whenever it was possible, we have indicated the date of a game and place where it was played. Unfortunately the majority of compilers of brilliant games and announced mates have been very negligent on this point. So a certain number of our examples do not have any references.























Part 2:
TYPICAL MATES
In this second part, the most original section of the book, we are going to study the principal mating positions that can be obtained against a castled King.
The classification which we have established for these mates is based more on convenience than on theoretical considerations.
Wherever possible we have given the mate, besides its number in the order, a name. Where this exists (e.g., Anastasia's Mate, Arabian Mate), we have kept it. Where it didn't have one, we tried to give it the name of the first famous player who used it.
We would be grateful to erudite readers who can supply us with further particulars on the original authors of these mates.







CHAPTER 1:
The Corridor Mate
(MATE NO. 1)
The simplest of all mate schemes is that of the Corridor Mate.

The Black King is confined to the corridor, hemmed in by the edge of the board and the three pawns of the castled position. It can only move sideways.
The e8 square, on the eighth rank, is weak. It is only defended by the Rook on d8. It is attacked twice: by the Queen on e2 and by the Rook on e1. The mating procedure is both simple and spectacular:



1


♕e8+


♖xe8




2


♖xe8 mate.


 



This is the characteristic final position of the Corridor Mate.

It is obviously the weakness of the last rank that enables such a mate to take place. If the Black Queen were somewhere on the eighth rank, on a8 for example, there would be no mate. There would no longer be a mate if the Queen were placed somewhere on the a3-f8 diagonal, and controlling the f8 square. She would be able to cover the first or second check.
In practice the King frequently defends the mating square.

The mate is only delayed. A check on the seventh rank dislodges the King and the position is like the previous example.

♕e7+


♔g8




2


♕e8+

GAME ENDING NO. 12
In the position in the diagram, Black has to avoid a trap. White cannot mate, and given the equal material and the symmetry of the Pawns, the draw is certain.

White tries his luck and plays:



1


♕b8+


 



Whatever his desire to take the Queen, he must resist it and play 1 ... ♕f8! If he should yield to the temptation, he would lose the game, i.e.



1


...


♖xb8?




2


♖xb8+


♕f8



Now White indeed resists taking the Queen. He doubles the Rooks, threatening mate.



3


♖1c8


 



Black cannot reply 3 ... ♕xc8 because there follows 4 ♖xc8 mate. He is forced to make an escape square, 3 ... h5, for example, and after 4 ♖xf8+, White is a Rook up.

Looking for counterplay on the Queen's side. But the attack on the King's flank unfolds irresistibly.

You don't have to be an expert to see that White stands better:
1) His three minor Pieces and his Queen are in action.
2) His Rooks are in communication and ready to intervene.
3) He has an evident gain in space.
On the other hand, Black, with the exception of his King's Bishop, has all his Pieces on the edge and reduced to a strictly defensive role.
But what requires a little more than talent is to know how to transform this advantage in position into a concrete advantage. This is where the combination plays its part.



17


♗c7!


 



"Perfectly well played" we read in an annotation of the time. This is a model of a superficial and useless note. What should be explained is the reason for this sacrifice.
First, it is clear that Black cannot accept it. Indeed, if 17 ... ♕xc7 White wins the Queen! There follows 18 ♘xf6+ ♔h8 19 ♘xe8, threatening mate by 20 ♕xg7 mate as well as the capture of the Queen by 20 ♘xc7. The two threats cannot be parried at the same time, after 19 ... g6 20 ♘xc7 White is left with a Queen and a Rook more.
On the other hand, if 17 ... ♖xe4, counterattacking the Queen, there follows 18 ♕xe4 ♕xc7 19 ♕xa8 with the win of the exchange and Black remains in an uncomfortable position.
This was nevertheless the best defence.

"A very fine move," assures a contemporary commentator. It seems to us that 24 ♕xf3 would have been at least as strong, and on 24 ... ♕xe5, would have allowed the same combination as we see in the game and in a more effective and accurate manner.



24


...


♕g6




25

The player of the Black Pieces is blind. He does not see the Corridor Mate which is threatened. He should play 25 ... h5, providing an emergency exit!




26


♕xa8


♖xa8



Of course, by playing 26 ... f6 Black could have delayed the end but not have saved the game.



27


♖d8+


♖xd8




28


♖xd8 mate.


 



This is strictly Corridor Mate No. 1.
The reader will notice in the games we publish with the application of the typical mates, that often the mate is obtained by a somewhat different procedure from that which is employed in our scheme.
Thus, in this game, the Queen is not sacrificed while giving check as in the scheme. She captures a rook on the first move, without check. But in doing so:
1) She threatens mate by ♕xe8.
2) She weakens the eighth rank through removing one of the two Black Rooks which command the d8 square, attacked by the two White Rooks.
All the elements of scheme No.1 are very much in evidence in the final position of the Anderssen - Wyvill game. But they are featured in a different order.
The recipes we are giving to carry out a mate are good. But they require a little attention so that they are applied appropriately.
Here is the theoretical scheme showing that the eighth rank can be doubly defended.

A preliminary sacrifice of the Queen will eliminate one of the guards:



1


♕xc8+


♖xc8




2


♖e8+


♖xe8




3


♖xe8 mate


 



Finally, one of the walls of the corridor may not necessarily be formed of Black Pawns. A White Pawn or Piece could guard the squares which block the pawns in our scheme.

The threat of a Corridor Mate could force the player to resign.

Suppose first of all that the White Bishop that is on h5 is on c8. White would play 1 ♗e6+ ♔h8 3 ♕xf8+ ♖xf8 4 ♖xf8 mate.
But the Bishop is not on c8. It is on h5. This did not prevent Réti from forcing the win. He played:



1


♗f7+!


♔h8



If 1 ...♕xf7 2 ♕xf7+ and mate in two moves.



2


♗e8!


Resigns.



Indeed, the threat of a Corridor Mate can be parried only at heavy material cost, in a position without any counterchances. Bogoljubow therefore judiciously resigned.
Thus, and we come across many other examples of it, the threat of a typical mate is sufficient to win the game, even if there is an effective defence, as this may cost the opponent material.







CHAPTER 2:
Variation of the Corridor Mate
(MATE NO. 2)
As we have seen, the Corridor Mate is based on a single element, the weakness of the eighth rank. With Mate No. 2, a second element is going to enter into the game: the weakness of a given square.

This position is very often met in practice.
Black's f-Pawn is only defended twice: by the King and by the Rook. However it is attacked three times: by the Queen and each of the two Rooks.
The eighth rank is weak. Only the Black Rook controls it.
The coming together of these elements allows White to mate simply by sacrificing the Queen. It is this sacrifice that is not noticed by inexperienced players.



1


♕xf7+


♖xf7



It is clear that if 1 ... ♔h8 2 ♕xf8 mate (Mate No.1).



2


♖c8+


♖f8



The rook must cover. But the opening of the f-file by a sacrifice allows the Rook on f1 to strike the f8 square. Hence:



3


♖(any)xf8 mate.


 



Thus the insufficient protection of the Pawn on f7 and the weakness of the eighth rank allowed the mate. The final scheme is that of the Corridor Mate.

The intervention of the pin allows the same mate to be carried out in only two moves.



1


♕xf7+


♖xf7



It is clear that if 1...♔h8 2 ♕xf8 mate (Mate No.1).



2


♖d8 mate.


 



The Rook on f7, pinned, cannot cover the mate.
This scheme is identical with the preceding one. The same causes have made the mate possible. The pin of the Rook on f7 simply accelerated it.
The first thought of the student who is about to learn this way of delivering mate is he will never come across this possibility in serious practical play, unless the opponent makes a grave oversight,
This is partly true and it is also false. Sometimes it is an oversight which allows a player to deliver mate. But sometimes a position arises, ineluctably, and as a consequence of a series of weak previous moves.
Here are three examples:
GAME NO. 45
Queen's Pawn Opening
Tournament of Nations, Hamburg, 1930
Sir G. Thomas - F. J. Marshall
Sir George Thomas (1881-1972), though below top international class, was champion of Great Britain several times and represented his country very honourably in numerous tournaments.
Frank J. Marshall (1877-1944), an attacking player with a brilliant style, was for a number of years the undisputed champion of the United States. He came first at the tournaments in Cambridge Springs, 1904, and Scheveningen, 1905.
This game was played in a Tournament of Nations, that is to say a tournament where each nation is represented by a team of four players. Each team meets the other teams, round by round. These competitions are not endowed with cash prizes as are international tournaments, and sometimes the professional masters do not play with the same bite and the same seriousness as in an individual international tournament. On the other hand, a tight schedule often requires two rounds to be played on the same day, and after several days, the older players or those with delicate health get run down and the quality of the games suffers.

In Chess congresses, particularly in England, at the same time as the principal tournament (or major tournament) reserved for masters, subsidiary tournaments are held for less strong players. The game which we see here was played between amateurs of the second rank. But they were amateurs of some erudition for, as we are about to see, White's first sixteen moves are all 'book.'

This game further shows how futile it is to learn by heart fifteen moves of a classical variation or well known analysis, when, as soon as one is left to one's own resources, one blunders on the sixteenth and is unable to see the most elementary mate in two moves!
Now, here we have a world champion, forced to resign on account of the threat of Mate No. 2.
GAME NO. 47
Ruy Lopez
Margate Tournament, 1937
P. Keres - A. Alekhine
Alexander Alekhine, born in Moscow in 1892, became a French citizen in 1929, and died at Lisbon in 1946. He was a Chess master at the age of fifteen, a Grandmaster at the age of twenty, and World Champion after defeating Capablanca at Buenos Aires in 1927. He is considered the greatest Chess genius of the first half of the twentieth century, and his games are regarded as priceless and imperishable gems. It is impossible to describe his particular style in a few lines.
Paul Keres, born in Narva (Estonia) in 1916, started to play at a very young age in international correspondence tournaments, where he conducted up to 150 games at the same time. Since 1937 he was publicly acknowledged as a Grandmaster. In 1938 he shared first prize with R. Fine at the 'Avro' Tournament, at that time the strongest ever held. In 1940, he beat Euwe in a match. After the Second World War he finished runner up in four World Championship Candidates Tournaments and was considered one of the strongest players never to have become World Champion. He died in 1975.

This defence goes back to a game Lange-Schultz, 1863.

It was particularly recommended by Steinitz and has achieved much success over a long period.

But this move, tried for the first time by Duras against Vidmar and Janowski (Carlsbad, 1907) in a similar position (5 d3 ♘f6 6 c4) places in doubt the system adopted by Black. Indeed, all the recent games we know have been won by White. In the radio match USSR - USA, September 1945, I. Boleslavsky, champion of Ukraine, defeated R. Fine on the second board. The Pawn on c4 has two functions. It prevents Black from driving away the Bishop on a4 by ... b5, and it allows White domination of the central d5 square.

23

It's Corridor Mate No. 2.







CHAPTER 3:
Greco's Mate
(MATE NO. 3)

In the position of scheme No. 3, Black's Kingside castled position is gravely weakened:
1) The defensive King's Knight has gone.
2) The a2-g8 diagonal has been opened (by the so often mistaken advance of the f-pawn) and a White Piece controls it.
If there were no Black h-Pawn, White would mate in one move by ♖h1. This comment suggests the solution.
The winning manoeuvre therefore consists of forcing the opening of the mating file.



1


♘g6+


hxg6




2


♖h1 mate.


 



The final mating pattern of No.3 is as follows.

Note that he King might also be placed on h7.
This mating device goes way back to a variation given by Gioachino Greco, the Calabrian, in his treatise of 1619. Let's recall it briefly.

If the Black Queen were now on a square from where it could reach h6, on g6 for example, this would be the position of the scheme and it would be mate in two moves: 11 ... ♘g3+ 12 hxg3 ♕h6 mate. Black does not have the time to prepare this mate, since if he plays, for example, 11 ... ♕g5, White, by 12 ♕f3, would defend the g3 square. So, in order to avoid this defence, he will sacrifice the Knight immediately; the Queen and the Rook on h8 will then threaten mate on the h-file. For eleven moves White fights desperately to delay the fatal outcome. But only delay it, as the mate is ineluctable.

CHAPTER 4:
Mate No. 4
Here is a mate which ends with the same pattern as Greco's Mate No. 3, but in which the mechanism of the attack is different.

Black's King's side castled position is weakened.
1) Because the King's Knight has disappeared.
2) Because the a2-g8 diagonal (opened by the advance of the f-Pawn) is controlled by a White Piece.
If there were no Black Pawn on h7, White would have mated in one move by ♕h1.
The manoeuvre will consist of forcing the opening of the mating file.
Instead of forcing this opening by a brutal sacrifice of a Piece giving check, we will force it by creating a threat which can only be parried by opening the file.

Between good players, this manoeuvre cannot be realized. But it can be used as a threat, or as a variation in a combination.
In the famous game Rotlewi - Rubinstein (Lodz 1907) the following position was reached:

Black has just played 21 ... ♕h4, threatening mate on h2. In the game, White defended by 22 g3, which allowed Rotlewi to carry out a magnificent combination commencing with ... ♖xc3. But he must have envisaged the less aggressive defence 22 h3. In this eventuality, the continuation would have been:

There are many sub-variations. We have only considered the line which ends in Mate No. 4.







CHAPTER 5:
Anastasia's Mate
(MATE NO. 5)
Let's consider the scheme in the following diagram. Black's castled position is intact. The pawns have not advanced, His only weaknesses are the disappearance of the King's Knight and the absence of protection of the e7 square. This is sufficient to allow White a decisive attack. But how? This is not as easy to see in advance as in the elementary schemes of the preceding mates.




1


♘e7+


♔h8




2


♕xh7+!!


♔xh7




3


♖h1 mate.


 



On the first move, White forces Black to move his King and takes control of two squares in the field where it will be finally mated (g8 and g6). On the second move, the king is again forcibly dragged out and a mating file opened by a sacrifice. On the third move, comes the mate.
In Germany the mate is called the epigrammatic mate and, in France, Anastasia's mate, after a novel by Wilhelm Heinse, Anastasia und das Schachspiel, Briefe aus Italien, published in 1803. The two schemes below show two possible aspects of the final position of the mate, the first against a King that had castled, the second against a King in the middle of the play. These schemes show that this mate, spectacular as it may be, does not essentially differ from mates 3 and 4.


Here is a theoretical variation, pointed out by Emanuel Lasker in his Common Sense in Chess in 1895, which shows Anastasia's mate.
GAME NO. 54
Ruy Lopez
Instructional game, composed in 1894
Emanuel Lasker
Emanuel Lasker (1868-1941), Doctor of Philosophy, was World Champion from 1894 to 1921. His clear and precise style made him well-nigh invincible. Even after he lost his title, he finished first in international tournaments. He was the greatest Chess personality of his day.

And White remains at least a Piece up.
The only correct move is 7 ... ♗e7!, by which Black makes himself immune to the discovered checks and at the same time pursues his development.
Let's return to the text move.



8


♖xe5+


♗e7



White is going to exploit the pin of the Bishop and make it the basis of a mating combination.




9

Instead of recapturing the Piece, White attacks the pinned Bishop for a second time.

If White now continues 11 ♖xb5, Black would obtain equality by 11 ... ♕xe7. But there is no question of this.



11

A move which is both simple and powerful and which wins the game at once.
First, let's suppose that Black does not see the threat and plays ... d6 or ... ♘d4.

The following game shows the role that thinking time plays in serious combat. In tournaments this time is limited and controlled by special clocks. Schedules vary but nowadays each player usually has a couple of hours to make the first 40 moves, after which the time is checked at a rate of 20 moves per hour. A good player should regulate his time in a way that he has some in reserve to consider a difficult move. In fact, when a position is complicated, it often happens that the two opponents get short of time. And as the time control approaches they may find themselves having to play five or six moves in a few seconds

Queen's Pawn Opening
Carlsbad Tournament, 1929

Milan Vidmar (1885-1962), an engineer and professor in Yugoslavia, was a master of the first rank. Indeed if he had played the openings with more care when he competed in tournaments, his results would have been even better.
Max Euwe, born in Holland in 1901, professor of mathematics and an international Grandmaster, combined his great talent for tactics with profound theoretical knowledge. He defeated Alekhine in a match for the world title, which he retained for two years. He died in 1981.

CHAPTER 6:
Boden's Mate
(MATE NO. 6)
Mate No. 6
In this position, it is the Queen's side position that he must attack.

Black's castled position is weakened by the advance of the c-Pawn, which has opened the h2-b8 diagonal. A White Piece controls it.
If Black's b-Pawn were not there, White could mate in one move by ♗a6.
The manoeuvre will therefore consist of forcing open the mating diagonal.

There was no need for Black to castle on the 'side of the cemetery', the more so that his c-Pawn has already advanced.
White has castled on the King's side, you may object, in spite of the fact that his h-Pawn has advanced one square. Yes. But this weakness cannot immediately be attacked, since the Black Queen's Bishop has been exchanged, while ...

GAME FRAGMENT NO. 1
In a game between Nimzowitsch and Alekhine, played when the future world champion was nineteen years old, this position was reached:

White has just played 15 0-0-0!, setting Black a very pretty trap. Why indeed not be tempted to take a Pawn in the centre? Alekhine discovered his opponent's subtle plan in time and with 15 ... ♗d6 all the danger passed. What was this hidden danger?

♘d7



It is clear that if 18 ... ♖d7 19 ♗xd7+ and Black cannot recapture 19 ... ♘xd7 because of 20 ♕e8 mate. But covering with the Knight has led to a position where there is a typical mate (our Mate No. 6).



19


♕c6+


bxc6




20


♗a6 mate.


 



And so the latent threat of Mate No. 6 prevented Black from winning White's d-Pawn.
Boden's mate is not characterized by its final pattern where two Bishops just finish off the King, but by its mechanism: a Piece sacrifice with check to open a line on which to mate.
The mate can instead be delivered in a position other than on the Queen's side, as shown by the following example:

The King may even be mated on its initial square.




1


♕xe6+!


fxe6



Of 1 ... ♕e7 2 ♕xe7 mate.



2


♗g6 mate.


 



Rather than increase the action of a mating piece, the sacrifice can allow passage for it. But the piece itself mates.
In this last example it is a Rook which mates. The pattern of the mate is quite different. But the mechanism remains the same.

CHAPTER 7:
Blackburne's Mate
(MATE NO. 7)
A castled King may be mated by a Bishop on h7, supported by a Knight on g5, provided the long dark diagonal is controlled by a Bishop as shown in the next diagram:

The Black King may also be in the corner which would give us this pattern:

Of course, some variations are possible, for instance:

To force this position, the attacker must not hesitate to sacrifice Pieces, even if it be the Queen. Here is a typical schematic position.

h5

♕xh5!

♗h7 mate.


 



The first move of the Queen forced the advance of the h-pawn, the following sacrifice opened a mating diagonal for the Bishop. As with Boden's mate, the essential mechanism consists of opening a decisive diagonal.
This mate, with or without the sacrifice of the Queen, is not a rarity, and numerous examples of it are known.
The object of the Queen sacrifice is, as in the Boden mate, to force the opening of the mating diagonal.
Here is the oldest one we know:

GAME FRAGMENT NO. 2
Mate sometimes crops up as a threat during a variation. This was the case in a game Colle - Grünfeld.

In the diagram position, Colle played 16 ♘g5! and on 16 ... g6? he sacrificed the Knight on f7 with an irresistible attack. The game received a prize for beauty.
But in playing 16 ♘g5 Colle must have taken into consideration this piquant continuation:

Exercises



















CHAPTER 9:
Mate No. 8 and Lolli's Mate
The scheme which follows shows the irresistible strength of a simple f-Pawn when it reaches and establishes itself on the f6 square. This Pawn, more valuable than a Piece, controls the g7 square, and if the Queen goes to h6, the mate on g7 is often unstoppable. In the schematic position, Black's castled formation is still intact, But the White attack will force the fatal advance ... g7-g6.

Mate No. 8A
Lolli's mates
Sometimes Black has time to move the King to h8, as a way of allowing his Rook to come to the defence of g7. If White has the necessary material, this defence will not be sufficient.

Black, threatened by ♕h6 followed by ♕g7 mate, tries a defence.

CHAPTER 10:
Mate No. 9
When the Black g-Pawn has been advanced, a Bishop installed on f6 (or sometimes anywhere on the long dark diagonal) is even stronger than the Pawn was in the previous schemes. In fact the Bishop strikes not only the g7 square, but also the h8 square.
If the h-file were open, a Rook or a Queen would mate on h8.

If, in the schematic position, there was no Black h-Pawn - or in other words the h-file was open - White (with or without the move) would mate at once by ♖h8.
It is therefore necessary to open this file.
One easily arrives at the sacrifice.

mate.



The presence of a Black Bishop being able to occupy the g7 square and defend h8 does not stop the attack

Let us consider the scheme 9A, If there were no Pawn on h7, the mate would be delivered immediately by ♖h8 mate.
It is therefore necessary to open the h- file.



1


♖xh7


♗g7



And now it is the Bishop on g7 that is the trouble. It is necessary to eliminate it.
This is achieved by a sacrifice.



2


♖h8+!


♗xh8



Now we come back to the previous scheme.



3


♖xh8 mate.


 



The position can be met with the Bishop already on g7. If the h-file is open and strongly controlled by White, then mate follows. Let us consider scheme 9B.

♖h8+


♗xh8




2


♖xh8 mate.


 



Mayet's Mate
If, in addition, Black's f-Pawn is pinned, White can open the h-file even more rapidly. Here is a typical scheme.




1


♕xg6+


hxg6




2


♖h8 mate.


 



Lolli (1763) has demonstrated that even a Black Queen, though stronger than a Bishop, cannot prevent the mate. Here is a position of his where the mechanism holds good for both scheme 8A and scheme 9.
G. Lolli 1763
Giambattista Lolli (1698-1769) was born in Modena, Italy. He was a first-rate player and the author, in 1763, of a justly famous book.

♕f8

4


♖xh6+


♔xh6



If 4 ... ♔g8 5 ♖h8 mate.



5


♖h1 mate.


 



There is a mate because the Bishop on f6 controls not only g7 and h8, but also g5.
And here is the pattern of Mate No. 9:

It does not matter if Black's g-Pawn is missing. The Bishop might be anywhere on the long diagonal (except on g7 or h8).
Mates 8 and 9, but more particularly mate No. 9, count among those which are most frequently met in practice. And we are spoiled for choice in finding examples.

16


...


♗d6




17


♖h1


♘f8



Black, compelled to defend his h-Pawn, plays his Knight to f8 rather than to f6, since on f6 it equally defends the g6 square.



18


♖h3


 




The regrouping of the White forces, with a view to an assault against the castled position, continues without loss of time. This move, preparing ♖eh1, practically forces Black to weaken his castled position by advancing one of the Pawns which protects it.



18


...


g6




This is a characteristic position. The advance ... g7-g6 has created the usual weaknesses on h6 and f6. Having control of the h-file, White is in a position to conduct a decisive attack. Black, demoralized by the failure of his attempts to force a draw, is about to play several weak moves. But even if he had found the strongest moves, White's attack would have been carried out in the end. Two Bishops, two Rooks and a Queen, in joint action against a weakened castled position, must triumph.
But, thinks the attentive reader, White's castled position is more than weak: it is entirely demolished. Why doesn't Black also mount an assault against him? Because:
1) Black is primarily occupied with defence;
2) Whereas all the White pieces are converging their action on the north east of the chess board, there is only Black's Queen and Bishop directed towards the White King;
3) Black has no open file against the White castled position.

Black thought he would save everything with this move. On f4 not only does the Knight give check but furthermore it defends the h5 square.

GAME ENDING NO. 18
Monte Carlo Tournament, 1903
H. N. Pillsbury - H. Wolf
After some bold play, the following position arose in the game, which clearly arises from a strictly Orthodox Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined.

This game had developed according to the classical scheme of the famous Pillsbury - Tarrasch game from Hastings 1895. Black is trying to reach an endgame, when he will be able to exploit his majority of Pawns on the Queen's side. White will launch an attack on the castled position.
Here Pillsbury was able, without resistance from Wolf, to build up what is known as the 'Pillsbury formation,' characterized by a Knight on e5, supported by a Pawn on f4. Then, if possible, by playing ♖f1-f3-h3 he will use all his pieces for an assault on the castled position.
In the diagram position, White has just played 15 ♖f3-h3.



15


...


g6



The first result - Black has weakened his castled position, until now intact, by pushing the g-Pawn.



16


♗b1


♘xe5



In such positions, truly difficult to hold, many players lose their self-control and end up by making this exchange to relieve the pressure of the troublesome Knight. The result: the f4 Pawn arrives menacingly on e5, and the f-file is opened against his castled position. The remedy is worse than the disease.
16 ... ♘f8, was suggested here, in order to defend h7.
But 16 ... ♗f8, pointed out by Monsieur F. Le Lionnais in his book Les Prix de Beauté aux Echecs, is incorrect, since after this move White wins a Piece by 17 ♘xd7.



17


fxe5


♘d7



Here 17 ... ♘e4 was necessary. But Black underrates the strength of the White offensive and is continually thinking about a counterattack on the Queen's side.

After this double exchange, it seems that Black will have some respite. There is still nothing in it.



19


♕f3


♘f8

♖f1


♕d7




21


♕f6




The Queen is on a square which is usually occupied by a Bishop or a Pawn. Black must drive it away.



21


...


b4?



A serious mistake. First of all, in principle, because before thinking about winning a Pawn endgame on the Queen's side, he should be wondering if a mate is not being prepared in the other corner of the chessboard. Secondly, tactically, because the Pawn move voluntarily opens a way for the Queen's Knight to enter into play. After this mistake the attack gathers pace.



22


♘a4!


♕c7



And not 22 ... ♖e6 with the naive thought of capturing the Knight once the attacked Queen retreats, since White would play 23 ♕f2 and if 23 ... ♕xa4 24 ♕xf7+ with a winning attack.



23

25

Bringing up the last semi-inactive White Piece to be able to control the h-file.



25


...


♖b8



With the idea of dislodging the White Queen on f6 by ... ♖b6. But it is a little late.

There is an absolutely winning move here. If you have memorized the typical mating positions that we have already studied, you will be able to find for yourself this move, which, in 1903, was raved over by the gallery (which was however made up, quite frankly, only of J.Arnous de Rivière, the veteran Frenchman who directed the tournament, Prince Dadian de Mingrelia, an arrogant brute who published brilliant games he claimed to have played but which in fact were fabricated for him by starving players, Tinsley who represented The Times, and other members of the press.



26


♗xg6!


 



What is the sense of this move?
1) It exploits the weakness of the eighth rank (abandoned by the Queen and King's Rook and denied protection by the Queen's Rook, intercepted by the Queen's Bishop) if 26 ... fxg6 27 ♕xf8 mate.
2) It threatens a mate in four moves if Black makes an indifferent reply. For example:

He played a move which also wins, but not as quickly and which we are going to look at as a sub-variation.

In Antwerp all the European participants got on board a Belgian ship Piriapolis which the Argentine Chess Federation had placed at their disposal. During the long journey and while a storm roared over Europe, they played bridge and chess. They analysed the latest variations and particularly those of the Vienna Defence which resulted from the game Kotov - Yudovich, which had just been played in Moscow. The game which we see here is one of the innumerable rapid games which were played during the journey. Was it really played? Was it analysis? And who were the authors? It doesn't matter. It is a splendid illustration of Mate No. 9, and ends with a series of 'problem moves'.

An innovation, credited to the Russian player Kotov (in his game against Yudovich). Previously, 7 e5 was played (Fine - Grünfeld, Amsterdam, 1936; Fine - Euwe, A.V.R.O., 1938). It was of particular interest to the players on board the Piriapolis as it was not included in the 6th edition of Modern Chess Openings, revised by Fine, which had just been published and which everyone had with them on board.

An extraordinary position and one which after the Tournament of Nations in Buenos Aires was made the object of deep analyses. These seemed to prove that the only defence for Black is 12 ... ♘d7 13 ♖c1 ♕a6 14 ♗xg7 ♖g8 15 ♗h6 with a position in which only practice can determine if one of the sides stands better than the other.

Resigns.



Because now that the Queen is pinned, the new threat of Mate No. 8, 22 ♕xg7 mate, can be parried only be retreating the Rook, which allows the other mate, 22 ♕xh7 mate.
'How splendid!' said V. Kahn on showing this game on his return from Buenos Aires.
'I have already seen something like that!' replied G. Renaud.
And he placed on the chessboard the following problem, probably not known by all the travellers on the Piriapolis.

And here is the solution:



1


♕h6


♖g8




2


♘e4


♕f8




3

Up to here it is exactly the final theme of the Piriapolis game. But the continuation is different because the White material is not the same.

The problem is amusing and in the style of the epoch. But how much more we prefer the game.
These attacks against the King which we have examined are equally valid when they are moved over by one or several files.

In the position seen here, Black has just played ... ♖g4? This move gives White the opportunity to sacrifice the Queen, as while Black is busy capturing it, he will manage to double the Rooks on the d-file and threaten mate on d8 (Mate No. 9).



23

26

A courteous player would have resigned after the 24th move but in chess there are always some misguided individuals who, in a dead lost position. vainly cling on in the hope that their opponent will suddenly die of apoplexy. The best tactic against these discourteous opponents is not to get impatient but to mate them without pity ... then refuse to play with them again.

13


b5


 



An attacking player, Spielmann - who had already got the measure of his young opponent: this was the eighth game of a match of ten games won by Spielmann (+5 -2 =3) - does not hesitate to weaken his position on the Queen's side in order to obtain a game full of promise on the King's side. The Knight has hardly any choice. On a5 it will be out of play but on b8, in order then to go to d7, it would allow ♗e5!



13


...


♘a5




14


♘e5


♗b7




15


♘g4!


♕d8



Black now recognizes that his twelfth move was incorrect. The Queen returns to her initial square in order to avoid ♘xf6+ gxf6, with a destruction of the castled position. Naturally 15 ... ♘xg4 did not come into consideration. On the other hand 15 ... ♕f4 could be contemplated. White would have played 16 ♗xf6 ♗xf6 17 ♘h5 ♕g5 18 ♘hxf6+ gxf6 19 f4, with an attack.



16


♘e3


♘d5?




A second error. Black, in taking away his King's Knight, deprives his castled position of an essential Piece for its defence. With two Bishops, two Knights and one Queen directed at the Black King, White wants to launch an assault, methodically. Above all, he wants to force the advance of one of the pawns of the enemy castled position.



17


♕h5


 







17


...


g6



Black is absolutely without any resources. It is necessary for him to parry the threat of mate in one move: 18 ♕xh7.
Let us digress first: 17 ... ♘f6, which loses a Piece by 18 ♗xf6 g6 19 ♗xe7, etc.
Other than the text move, 17 ... g6, there remains to consider the other Pawn advances.
If 17 ... f5, the four White minor pieces and the Queen will concentrate their action on the castled position and all sacrifices become possible. Spielmann himself pointed out the continuation which he had envisaged:



17


...


f5




18


♘exf5


exf5



If 18 ... g6 19 ♘h6 mate.



19


♘xf5


 



He must now parry the threat of mate in four moves: 20 ♘xe7+ ♕ or ♘xe7 21 ♗xh7+ ♔h8 22 ♗g6+ ♔g8 23 ♕h7 mate.
We let the student verify that neither 19 ... ♘f6 nor 19 ... ♖f6 constitute a sufficient defence. Mate cannot be avoided, even at the cost of heavy sacrifices.
If 17 ... h6, another sacrifice immediately becomes possible:



17


...


h6







18


♗xg7!


♔xg7



Insufficient would be 18 ... ♗g5, since White would continue, not by taking the Rook (which in itself is enough to win the game), but with 19 ♗xh6.



19


♘ef5+


exf5




20


♘xf5+


♔f6




21


♕xh6+


♔e5




22


f4+


 



... with an irresistible attack.
[But quicker is 22 ♖ae1+ ♘e3 23 ♕xe3+ ♗e4 24 ♕xe4+ ♔f6 25 ♕h4+ ♔g6 26 ♕h6 mate.]
However, thinks the reader, did Spielmann, in playing 17 ♕h5, foresee all these triumphant sacrifices? Certainly not. It is principles which serve for this. It is not possible that five Pieces will not finally invade the beleaguered castled position. Any player with a little experience senses that in such a position he will find a decisive sacrifice which will upset the equilibrium and lead either to mate or such gain of material that the opponent will have to resign.
The text move brings about another weakening of the castled position, and allows Spielmann a brilliant continuation.



18


♘g4!


 







18


...


♗f6



It is clear that if 18 ... gxh5 19 ♘h6 mate. This is the typical Mate No. 9B.
The defence 18 ... ♘f6 is no better. White would continue 19 ♕e5, and the Knight, attacked three times (Bishop, Queen and Knight), cannot withdraw on account of mate on g7 or h8. Black loses at least a Piece. For example: 18 ... ♘f6 19 ♕e5 ♔g7 20 ♘h5+! gxh5 21 ♕g5+ ♔h8 22 ♘xf6, and wins. [Even better is 22 ♗xf6+ ♗xf6 23 ♕h6 ♗e4 24♗xe4 and 25♕xh7 mate.] 19 ... ♕d5 (instead of ... ♔g7) 20 ♕xd5 ♗xd5 (if 20 ... ♘xd5 21 ♘h6 mate) leaves White a piece up after 21 ♘xf6+.
Finally, on 18 ... f6, a new weakening of the castled position only occurs if White exploits it at once by the sacrifice 19 ♗xg6! hxg6 20 ♕xg6+ ♔h8 21 ♘h5, and wins. The text move, therefore, seems the best defence, though still not sufficient.



19


♘xf6+


♘xf6



If 19 ... ♕xf6 20 ♗xf6 gxh5 21 ♘xh5, and Black is left a Pawn down in a lost endgame without a shadow of a counter-chance.



20


♕h6


♖c8



On 20 ... ♕d5, 21 ♗e4! would win.



21


♖ad1


♕e7




22


♖fe1


♘e8



The only square for the knight which must, in retreating, protect g7 against Mate No. 8. The six White Pieces are in action. The moment of decision has arrived. Black's defensive position has to crumble.




23


♘f5!


♕c5



What else can Black do in this unpleasant position?
If 23 ... gxf5 24 ♗xf5 (threatening an immediate mate) 24 ... f6 25 ♗xe6+ ♔h8, and White forces the decision either by 26 ♗xc8 or by 26 ♖d7.
If 23 ... ♕c7 24. ♗f6!, and it is necessary to give up the Queen to parry 25 ♘e7+, since if 24 ... gxf5 25 ♕g5+ and mate next move, and if 24 ... exf5; 25 ♖xe8!



24


♖e5


♗d5




Here Spielmann announced mate in four moves, as follows.



25


♘e7+


 



The sacrifice of the knight has no other object than to unmask the Bishop on d3.

26


♕xh7+!


 



The classic Queen sacrifice to open the h-file.



26


...


♔xh7




27


♖h5+


 



Exploitation of the pin of the Knight on g6.



27

♔g8




28


♖h8 mate.


 



The pattern of Mate No. 8B has been followed by Mate No. 9.







CHAPTER 11:
Anderssen's Mate
(CONTINUATION OF MATE NO. 9)
The advance of the g-Pawn by one square weakens the castled position. It goes without saying that the advance by two squares of the same Pawn (or its disappearance, or its doubling on a neighbouring file) produces a greater weakening. Indeed the b1-h7 diagonal also finds itself open to action by a Bishop.
In all the positions of the No. 9 schemes, where the g-Pawn is missing, advanced two squares or transferred to a neighbouring file, the sacrifice of this Bishop on h7 gives us a means of brutally opening the h-file and administering the mate on h8.




1


♗xh7+


♔xh7




2


♕h5+


♔g8




3


♕h8 mate.


 



The next scheme, where the g-Pawn is missing, shows the same mate. 1 ♕g2+ does not lead to the goal because Black is able to cover the vertical check either by ... ♗g4 or by ... ♘g6.




1


♗xh7+


♔xh7




2


♕h5+


♔g8




3


♕h8 mate.


 



What characterises the No. 9 schemes, is a Bishop on f6 (or elsewhere on the long diagonal) commanding the squares g7 (Mate No. 7) and h8 (Mate No. 9). The opening of the h-file by a sacrifice of a Rook (Mate No. 9), a Bishop (Mates Nos. 9D and E) or even a Queen (Mates Nos. 9C and F) allows a Piece on the long sidewalk (Queen or Rook) to mate on h8.
It goes without saying that if we substitute the Bishop placed on f6 (or on the diagonal) with a Pawn installed on g7, we would no longer have the possibility of a mate in this case (Mate No. 7), but we do retain all the possibilities of a mate at h8 (Mate No. 9).

Here are a few practical examples of Anderssen's mate:

In this game, around the 8th move, Black had sacrificed two Pawns and obtained the initiative, reaching the position in the diagram. White has just played 23 ♖ce1, attacking the Rook on e8 for a second time. Instead of defending the Rook, Schallopp leaves it en prise and plays a move which obliges Gunsberg to resign. Which move? Before going further, find it by bearing in mind scheme 9D.

An error which is immediately fatal. Before castling, Black should have obtained control of the f6 square by ... ♘d7.

Black's game is hopelessly lost and there is no remedy. Why?
Because:
1) Four White Pieces, two Bishops, the Queen's Knight and the Queen are already in action or have the possibility of operating against the Black King.
2) On e7 the King's Knight does not defend the h7 square, which is its essential mission after castling has taken place.
3) On e7 the King's Knight interrupts the action of the Queen on f6.



7


♘f6+!!


 



A sacrifice of a piece which has as its objective:
1) To unmask the Bishop on d3;
2) To demolish the castled position if it is accepted;
3) To attack the h7 square twice if it is refused.

...


♔xh7




30


f6+



To obstruct the action of the Black Queen on the sixth rank.



30


...


♔g8




31


♗h7+


 



The Black King would benefit from an intermediate move so that it could take flight. A second sacrifice on h7 brings it back to a position to be mated, without Black being able to breathe and especially without allowing it any air by a move of the Rook on f7.



31


...


♔xh7




32


♖h3+


♔g8




33


♖h8 mate.


 



If on the second move Black plays 30 ... ♕xd3, then 31 ♖h3+ and 32 ♖h8 mate.
This combination of Anderssen's is found in all the text books. It makes an impression on novices, who have the tendency to judge the value of a combination by the quantity of sacrificed pieces. And it has taught them nothing because until the present work it had never been attached, as we are doing here, to a group of typical mating combinations.







CHAPTER 12:
Mate No. 10 and Pillsbury's Mate
The power of the double check, which we have studied in a general way in two other chapters, equally comes into play in several typical mates and especially in the mate of Rook and Bishop, as for the No. 9 mates.
The next diagram shows a position which is quite often met in practice, but which is usually very badly handled by novices

The first move is obvious.



1


♖xg7+


♔h8



But it is here that one should not be derailed. Any horizontal check by the Rook allows the King to return to g8 and a vertical check allows the saving push ... f7-f6.



2


♖g8+


 



This double check enables White to force mate.



3


...


♔xg8




3


♖g1 mate.


 




There is no shortage of practical examples. Here are two of them.




1


♖xg7+


♔h8




2


♖g8+


♔xg8




3


♖g1+


♕g5




4


♖xg5 mate.


 



The next position is more complicated, and the typical mate is concealed. But all will be revealed.




1


♗xf6!


♖xh4



If 1 ... ♗xf6 2 ♕xf6 g6 3 ♘c3 and White is a Knight up.

3

♔xg8




4


♖g1+

5


♖xg4+

6


♖xg5 mate.



Pillsbury's Mate Mate No. 10B
Here again there is an elementary application of the power of the double check.
When a beginner comes across a position conforming to scheme No.10B, without stopping to think for a moment, he hurries to greedily take the Rook, as a way of winning the exchange. The experienced player prefers to announce mate in three moves, as follows:




1


♖g1+


♔h8




2


♗g7+


♔g8




3


♗xf6 mate.



The pattern of the mate is the same as Mate No. 10.
The following game illustrates Mate No. 10 in an amusing way.

This move, which is never very good in the Orthodox Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined, is an absolute mistake before castling. It was Pillsbury who found the brilliant refutation of it.

The moment that Black had shown by his previous move that he planned to install his bishop in a 'fianchetto' on b7, White hurries to deny the opponent the opportunity to open the long diagonal by ... d5xc4.

The recapture with the Knight does not allow Black to keep the long diagonal open. After 7 ... ♘xd5 8 ♘xd5 Black in fact is forced to take with the Pawn since if he plays 8 ... ♗xg5 White would win a Pawn by 9 ♘xc7+.

The mistake. It is excusable, since the combination which follows can pass unnoticed by any player unfamiliar with the typical mating positions.

Black's move regains the lost Pawn and attacks an unprotected Rook. It seems excellent.
[Pillsbury now won the game after 17 ♔d2 ♕xf2+ 18 ♔c1 ♔h8 19 ♖g1 ♘e5 20 dxe5 and not by the following pretty move attributed to him by the authors. However we suspect Pillsbury had opportunities to make this Queen sacrifice on later occasions.]

White has a magnificent position. By shifting the Knight, he can dominate the long dark diagonal. He can also occupy the open g-file against the enemy King by playing ♖g1.



15


♘xd5!


 



It is obvious that if 15 ... ♘xd5 16 ♕xg7 mate.
Black has three plausible continuations: 15 ... exd5 and 15 ... ♘e8, which, as we shall see, lead to mate, and 15 ... e5 which after 16 ♘xf6+, leaves White with a material advantage.

CHAPTER 14:
Damiano's Mates
(MATES NOS. 11, 12 AND 13)
The study of Mate No. 8 has led us to this conclusion that a Pawn thrust into f6 like a wedge in the enemy position and controlling g7, acquires considerable power and allows the attacker several kinds of mate.
This conclusion holds good for other Pawns and that leads us to examine other types of mate.
In the position in the diagram where the Pawn is on g6, White mates in three moves.




1


♕h5


♖ any




2


♕h7+


♔f8




3


♕h8 mate


 



One notices that the mate is only possible because the e7 square is obstructed.
In 1512, Damiano published the amusing position that follows. In order to get his Queen into action White must first get rid of his cumbersome Rooks. He does this by sacrifices.

♖h8+


♔xh8




2


♖h1+


♔g8




3


♖h8+


♔xh8




4


♕h1+


♔g8




5


♕h7 mate.



If one imagines that there is no Rook on f8 but a Black Queen on e7, Black would play 5 ... ♔f8 and White 6 ♕h8 mate.
The pattern of the mate is clearly that of mate No. 8.
When there is no Black Pawn in front of the King, White might deliver another type of mate if he can check on his first move.




1


♕h5+


♔g8




2


♕h7+


♔f8




3


♕f7 mate.



A common stratagem, similar to that of Damiano, which was its inspiration, consists of removing a Black Piece placed in front of the Pawn, as in the scheme which we see here, and which prevents the passage of the Queen from h7 to f7.




1


♖h8+


♗xh8




2


♕h7+


♔f8




3


♕f7 mate.


 



This device holds good for any file, as shown by the similar mate carried out by the French master Betbeder against the Romanian player Tyroler.




1


♖f8+


♗xf8




2


♕f7+


♔d8




3


♕d7 mate


 




Both sides have the same number of Pieces, but Black has a Pawn more and his two magnificent Passed Pawns on the Queen's side appear to promise a great future.
If by a miracle, all the Pieces were removed, White, with or without the move, would just resign.
As the Pieces stand at present, one does not see, at first sight, an advantage for White. The Queen and the Rook on g1 command a file that is well and truly closed. The Knight does not attack anything much. Only the Rook on c7 and the Pawn on g6 are primed for attack.
The White Pawn, wedged into g6 and firmly supported, sends a message to the experienced player. It is this which we have called Damiano's Pawn. It is the Pawn which allows the mate on h7 when the Queen is able to gain access.
But how to gain access for the Queen on h7? The answer lies in the question. Blackburne does not hesitate.

♔xg7



Very clearly, he must take; the retreat to h8 allows an easy win:

Here the Queen and the Rook on the g-file enter the play. Black is lost. If 3 ... ♔xh7 4 g8(♕)+ ♖xg8 5 ♕xg8 mate. If 3 ... ♖8f6 4 ♖h8+ ♔f7 5 g8(♕)+ and mate in two moves. If 3 ... ♖d8 4 ♕g6! and 5 ♖h8 mate. If 3 ... ♔f7 4 gxf8(♕)+ ♔xf8 5 ♕g8 mate.

The move has no other object than to abruptly open (since it is check) the h2-b8 diagonal for the White Queen.

Damiano's Bishop (Mate No. 12A)
It is obvious that, if the attacker has a Bishop instead of a Pawn, all the No. 11 positions examined with a Pawn are equally valid.
But the mobility of this Bishop allows some other attacks, absolutely classical and which it is even more important to know as they are met every day in practical play.

The pattern of the mate is that of Mate No. 8 where a Bishop replaces the Pawn.

A practical remark. In the course of the game, the attacker frequently has a position of the kind shown in the following scheme.

The novice has a tendency to play 1 ♕xh7+ and it is quite a surprise to see that the attacked King manages to take flight.
This position is not only an application of the previous schemes, there is a mate in four moves.

Mate No. 13
We have already met several types of mate in which a pin played an important part (2A, 8B, 8C, 9C). The simplest mate of all, Berger's mate, delivered by a Queen supported by a Bishop was presented by Damiano in 1512 with the help of a pin.

The position is quite elementary and we only give it as preparation for the following scheme.

CHAPTER 15:
Morphy's Mates
(MATES NOS. 14, 15 AND 16)
In a game against L. Paulsen, at the New York tournament in 1857, Morphy astonished the onlookers by sacrificing his Queen for a Knight to obtain a mating attack. This has become a classic sacrifice.




1


♕xf6


gxf6



The acceptance of the sacrifice (and here the acceptance is forced) opens two lines.
An attacking file.



2


♖g1+


♔h8



And a mating diagonal.



3


♗xf6 mate.


 



The pattern of the mate is very similar to that of Mate No. 10.

The only difference lies in the angular position of the King.
The same sacrifice takes place if the King has not castled, and if the Rook is on its initial square, provided that access to the e-file is prohibited to the Black King.




1


♕xf6


gxf6



The sacrifice opens two lines. An attacking diagonal.



2


♗h6+


♔g8




3


♖g1 mate.


 



And a mating file.
The pattern of the mate is comparable to that of Mate No. 10.

If the eighth rank is not defended (say, by a Rook on b8), there would be a second mate by 3 ♖e8 mate.

The pattern of the mate is then only a variation of the Corridor Mate.
In practice, it is very rare to obtain a position which allows one to deliver mate in a given number of moves immediately after a Queen sacrifice. Most often, Morphy's sacrifice allows a player a winning attack with a later mate and one in which counter sacrifices can only delay or salvage a draw by perpetual check.
Here however is an example of Mate No. 14 delivered in a given number of moves.

Mates Nos. 15 and 16
Before examining the famous Paulsen - Morphy game, let us study Mates Nos. 15 and 16.

If there were no Rook on f8, a White Rook or Queen would deliver mate on the eighth rank. The solution is easy. Get rid of the troublesome Rook by a sacrifice.



1


♕xf8+


♔xf8




2


♖e8 mate.



This is quite simply a variation of the Corridor Mate No. 1. It is necessary to eliminate by a sacrifice the heavy piece guarding the eighth rank.
The same kind of mate can occur without the doubling of the Rooks.




1


♕xf8+


♔xf8




2


♗c5+


♔g8




3


♖e8 mate.



On the first move the Rook is eliminated. On the second move the King is driven back in the corridor. On the third move comes the Corridor Mate.
We have not given these two mating schemes at the same time as although the final pattern is the same, the mechanism to force the mate is quite different. The proof of it is that the mechanism functions equally in a diagonal form.

In the schematic position, if there were no Rook on f8, there would be a mate in one move by 1 ♖e8 mate. Let's get rid of this Rook by sacrificing the Queen.



1


♕xf8+


♔xf8



Now substitute the Bishop for the Queen on the h6-f8 diagonal.

Black cannot immediately win back the Pawn that he has sacrificed, since on 8 ... ♘xe4 there follows:

The text move forces White to make a decision: to go back with the Bishop to b3, which would allow ... ♗g4, or abandon the diagonal where it strikes the f7 square. He chooses the latter.



9


♗e2


♘xe4







10

10 ♗f3 would have been bad, since Black would have forced the win immediately by 10 ... ♘xf2 11 ♖xf2 ♕d4 12 ♘e4 (and not 12 ♕f1 ♕xf2+ 13 ♕xf2 ♖e1 mate) 12 ... ♖xe4 13 ♗xe4♕xf2+ 14 ♔h1 ♗g4 15 ♗f3 ♖e8 and mates.

A major mistake. This Pawn advance, designed to prepare d2-d4, weakens the d3 square. Black will occupy it at once and in that way keep the whole file locked. After 12 d3 White would have at least an equal game, Black's lead in development does not compensate for his bad Pawns.

Perhaps anticipating the following mistake, here Morphy does not play the best move. 15 ... ♗b7 was necessary in order to maintain the protection of the a6 square and thereby prevent the White Queen from accessing it. The continuation might have been 16 ♖a2 ♖ae8 (threatening 17 ... ♕xf1+ followed by 18 ♔xf1 ♖e1 mate. Mate No. 15) 17 ♕d1 ♗a6! The text move allows White a defence.



16


♖a2?


 



The decisive mistake. Paulsen had no idea what his opponent had prepared for him and he expected to play ♗a3. 16 ♕a6 would free himself of all worry.



16


...


♖ae8



Threatening ... ♕xf1+, followed by ♖e1 mate (Mate No. 15).



17


♕a6


 




This Queen move parries the threat but allows Morphy to make a Queen sacrifice, even now worthy of admiration.
On 17 ♕d1 would have followed 17 ... c5 with the threat of playing 18...♗b5.



17


...


♕xf3!



This sacrifice is designed:
1) To open the g-file for the action of a Rook.
2) To open the f1-h3 diagonal for the action of the Bishop.
On account of the remoteness of the White Queen, and the almost total inactivity of the White Queen's Rook and Queen's Bishop, it is absolutely decisive. The procedure is the same as Mate No. 14.
It is said that the spectators in the tournament, who were very average strength players, did not understand the point of this sacrifice and thought that Morphy had suddenly gone mad.

And so, in this game as in the previous one, the sacrifice of the Queen does not lead to an immediate mate. But it enables a winning attack.

Marshall played Morphy's sacrifice several times during his career, notably in San Sebastian 1911, where it enabled him to force a draw in an unfavourable position, and in the third game of his match against Janowski.

Against the Petroff Defence, White has played the opening rather carelessly. As compensation for his forfeiture of castling he has a good centre and, upon a retreat of the Bishop, an attack on the Black King is about to commence by ♗xh7+. But there comes a surprise.

Of course, White cannot accept the sacrifice because of typical Mate No. 14B: 13 gxf3?? ♗h3+ 14 ♔g1 ♖e1+ 15 ♗f1 ♖xf1 mate.
The text move is not sufficient. Perhaps he should drive away the Queen by h2-h3. But White would have undoubtedly lost at least a Pawn.

Scorning danger - as was often the case with Janowski, a player with an aggressive style - White has won a Piece. But as the master Goetz observed in his Cours d'Echecs: 'A mere glance at the following diagram shows the price that has been paid for this Piece. The game is untenable. Marshall concludes the game in magnificent fashion.'

How will Black exploit his advantage? This advantage is twofold.
1) A positional advantage, since the White Rook is stalemated - if one can put it like that - and as a consequence potentially vulnerable.
2) A material advantage, since in fact the rook on h1 is absolutely out of play (Even more, by obstructing the h1 square it contributes to an immobilization of the King).
On reflection, there appear to be two ways of attack. One consists of arranging for one Rook to give check on the g-file. The other consists of doubling the Rooks on the e-file in order to deliver mate on e1.
There is no way at this moment to give check on g6 (covered by the Bishop on c2), nor on g5 (the Rook does not have access to e5 and the Bishop on b2 or the Pawn on f3 could come to defend g5).
On the other hand, a simple doubling of the Rooks would be ineffective since White would just guard e1 by ♗c3.
It is therefore necessary to combine the attacks, to carry out double attacks.



18


...


♖e2



The first double attack. The move threatens:
1) To win one of the two Bishops placed side by side on the second rank;
2) To double Rooks with the threat of mate on e1: ♖e1+; ♖xe1 ♖xe1 mate.

White's last two moves were forced. We have now arrived at a position so strong that, as E. A. Znosko-Borowsky wrote in 'How one becomes a brilliant chess player', "there are several solutions to achieving the win". [20 ♗e4 f5!]

All the commentators are ecstatic about the 'elegant' way Marshall has played. Personally, we prefer the logical solution which was not adopted. Get rid of the Bishop on c2 which prevents the manoeuvre ... ♖e8-e6-g6.

If Black accepts the sacrifice, 21 fxe3, there would have followed 21 ... ♖g2+ 22 ♔f1 ♖xc2+ 23 ♔ moves ♖xc1+ 24 ♔ moves ♖xh1, and Black will clearly win as he is a Rook up.
White could equally play 21 ♗e4. The continuation would have been 21 ... ♖xc3! 22 ♖d1 ♖a3, with the threat of 23 ... ♖axa2 attacking the f2 Pawn, is decisive.
All these variations are not as bad as a mate in four moves.

Because mate is inevitable.
The Paulsen - Morphy game has shown us the sacrifice in a primitive form, although Morphy did not deliver the quick mate which should have been the conclusion.
In the game McDonnell - Boden, we saw, a dozen years later, the idea presented in a more elaborate form where the final position calls to mind a problem.
The Kirdetzoff - Kahn and Janowski - Marshall games each simultaneously exploited the possibility of a vertical mate on the g-file and the weakness of the first rank, which allowed a horizontal mate.

CHAPTER 17:
Mates with Major Pieces
(MATES NO. 17 AND 18)
In 1512 P. Damiano published the following position which shows another typical sacrifice.
It is to open a Rook's file by a sacrifice of a Piece (Rook or Queen) in order to allow another piece (Rook or Queen) then to give mate along the same file.

The pattern of the mate is as follows:

25


♕xh7+


♔xh7




26


♖h3+

However, it is usually in a slightly different form that this mate is most often met with in practice:




1


♕g4+


♔h8




2


♖xh7+


♔xh7




3


♖h1 mate.



Let's open a parenthesis by noting that the association of Queen and Rook represents an enormous mating power.
The following scheme shows how a White Queen and Rook can relentlessly pursue the Black King to the mating square, despite the fact that Black still has all his pieces on the board.

To conclude, all sacrifices are permissible if they expose the attacked King to the crossfire of a suitably placed Queen and Rook.
Let us close the parenthesis and come to a typical mate often met in practice:




1


♖xh7+


 



A Rook sacrifice to force the characteristic position. The acceptance is forced, otherwise 2 ♕xf7 mate.



1


...


♔xh7




2


♕xf7+


♔h8 or h6



The second Rook enters the play. In many practical cases the attacking side must make a quiet move here in order to bring the second Rook into the game. For example 0-0-0 or ♔e2.

Such an exchange is not to be recommended, since it speeds up White's development without any compensation for Black.

8


♗g5


 




Preferable to 8 0-0. With this move, White has the possibility of castling on one or other side. But here there should be no hesitation. He should castle on the Queen's side because:
1) The d-file is semi-open as a consequence of the exchange of the d-Pawn.
2) The White Queen is already on d4.



8


...


h6



An absolutely useless precaution. Black intends to castle King's side and prepares in advance a flight square for his King, in case White arrives on the eighth rank to give check. This practice only serves to weaken in advance the King's side castled position and White will exploit this mistake without delay.



9


♗h4


♗e6




10


0-0-0


 



White has a marked advantage in position. With the exception of the King's Rook, all his Pieces are in action. On the other hand, because of his loss of time (the exchange on d4) and his passive development (Bishop on e7) Black already has no good continuation.



10


...


♗xc4



This exchange - destined to avoid ♗xe6 fxe6 with a weakening of the g6 square (a consequence of ... h7-h6?) - will allow White to immediately go over to the offensive.



11

The player with the advantage must at all costs open lines of attack. Here this opening comes free of charge, as the d6 Pawn is pinned.

14

The simplest. The isolated and weak d6 Pawn is indefensible. Black, instead of resigning himself to defeat, embarks on an adventure.



15


...


♘b6




16


♕xd6


 



And so the advantage in development, which was translated first into territorial gain, now assumes material form: White has won a Pawn. The most advisable for Black was to exchange Queens and force a transfer to a Rook endgame, Instead of that, he counterattacks.



16


...


♕g5+




17


f4


 



This push not only covers the check, but prepares an attack on the enemy Kingside castled position.



17


...


♕xg2?



Despair or presumption? It is pure folly to open a file himself that leads to his own King. Black has indeed restored material equilibrium ... but it is not only material that matters.



18


♖hg1


 




White takes immediate control of the file. Once the Queen withdraws, he will play ♕xh6 threatening mate.



18


...


♕f2



The capture of the h2 Pawn, to avoid the text continuation, would lead to another catastrophe which is at least as rapid. For example: 18 ... ♕xh2 19 ♕f6! (more energetic than 19 ♖h1 ♕f2 20 ♖dg1 threatening mate by 21 ♖xg7+ or if 20 ... g6, 21 ♖xg6+ since Black has one reply 20 ... ♕e3+ 21 ♔b1 ♕e6! and the attack is halted) 19 ... g6 (the only move) 20 ♖h1! and there is no longer any effective defence against the threat of 21 ♖xh6, followed by 22 ♖h8 mate, other than to lose a piece by 20 ... ♘d7 21 ♕d6 or d4! etc.



19


♕xh6


 



If Black had not played ... h6, the move 19 ♕f6 would have been less effective since, after 19 ... g6, the g6 Pawn would still be defended by the h-Pawn.



19

This is not a 'consolation check' but a manoeuvre destined to delay the push of the f-Pawn.

This delays the mate by one move.



26


♖xg2+


♔f6




27


♕e5+


♔f7




28


♖g7 mate.



It is to be noted that 21 ... ♕d4, keeping control of g1 and preventing the announced mate, would not save the game since after 22 f5 ♕g7 23 ♕g5! White threatens f6 and ♘c3-e4-f6, against which there is no adequate defence. 23 ... f6 leaves White two Pawns ahead and with a very strong position.
The power of a Queen and Rook also exerts itself just as well against a King in the centre as against a King having castled.
In the two examples we have just seen, a first Rook was sacrificed to disrupt the castled position and bring the attacked King within the field of action of the Queen and Rook.
In the famous Morphy game which follows, White sacrifices two Knights and a Rook to draw the Black King into the centre of the chess board and corner it with Queen and Rook on the edge, where it will be mated.

This move is faulty. And it is even one of the most curious things about the theory of the openings that an apparently harmless inexactitude entails the loss of the game

There is no satisfactory defence for Black. White threatens to continue by 8 ♘xf7 (attacking Queen and Rook) 8 ... ♔xf7 9 ♕f3+, etc.

This seems the most logical move. It attacks the Knight on g5, anticipates a check of the Rook on e1 and prepares King's side castling. However Morphy will demonstrate brilliantly its insufficiencies.

On any other move, White simply recaptures the sacrificed Knight on d5 with his Bishop and remains with the better position and the attack.

♖f8+


♔h7

♕h3+


♖h4




31


♕xh4 mate.


 



This is one of the typical mates No.17.
Mate No. 18
The two Rooks (or Rook and Queen), with the assistance of an advanced Pawn, can give a particular form of mate, provided the King's neighbouring files are open to the attacker's Rooks.




1


♖g8+


 



This sacrifice has no other object than to drag the enemy King into a basic mating net.



1


...


♔xg8




2


♖e8 mate.


 



As can easily be seen when looking at the mating pattern, we are once again in a variation of the Corridor Mate.

This mate, as in the case of the Corridor Mate, can take a slightly different form:




1


♕xf8+


♔xf8




2


♖c8+ ♕d8




3


♖xd8 mate


 



This is still the Corridor Mate. In short, the manoeuvre is that of Mate No. 15A and attached to Mate No. 18.
In practice this mate is forced when the attacker has been able to open the h-file occupied by a Rook and bring a pawn to g6 or g3. Here is an example:




11


...


♗xf2+




12


♖xf2

CHAPTER 18:
Mate with Minor Pieces
(MATE NO. 19)
A Bishop and a Knight can deliver mate in a corner position without the cooperation of another Piece, as long as the attacked King is blocked by its own Pieces, as shown by the two patterns below.


Of course, in these schemes the Knight could be on e7 instead of h6 and in 19B the Bishop could be anywhere on the diagonal and also be replaced by the Queen.
These mates can be forced by a prior Queen sacrifice as shown by the next example.




1


♕h6!


 



Threatening 2 ♕xg7 mate. This mate can only be parried in one way.



1


...


gxh6



But in going to h6, the g-Pawn has opened the long diagonal. The Bishop now controls the whole of it.



2


♘xh6 mate.


 



The next scheme shows how the threat of Mate No. 19B can gain time.

White to move plays



1


♘g4!


 



and Black cannot capture the Queen



1


...


gxh5??



because of



2


♘h6 mate.


 




This is a rather artificial example, but it is worth knowing since it results from a theoretical variation of the Spanish Game.



1


♖h5!


 



Threatening 2 ♕xh7 mate.



1


...


gxh5



But in capturing, the g-Pawn has granted the Queen access to the long diagonal.



2


♕f6 mate.


 



It's Mate No. 19A.
An example can be found in the instructional Game No. 54 of Emanuel Lasker which we published in Section 2, Chapter 5, in relation to Anastasia's Mate.
Now here is a series of examples which show that a Queen sacrifice, forcing one of the No. 19 Mates, has often been applied in practice.

In this game played at Rook odds in Paris, 1913, the master A. Aurbach had reached the present position However, he had still not regained his Piece and so set a trap:



1


♗e3


♕xb2?



The amateur took the Pawn without hesitation. This is the mistake which Aurbach was speculating on so that he could place his Bishop on d4 with gain of time.



2


♗d4


 



This move seems innocent. It does threaten ♗xg7 with the win of the exchange ... But there is a White Bishop en prise. The exchange does not matter, thinks our amateur, let's take the Piece. And he played:



2


...


♕xc2



Aurbach remarked to him that if, instead of this move, he had attacked the Queen by 2 ... ♘f4, he would have been mated by 3 ♘xe7+ ♖xe7 4 ♕xh7 mate. Then he replied:




3


♕h6!


 



The Queen cannot be captured since if 3 ... gxh6 4 ♘xh6 mate, which is Mate No. 19B.



3


...


♗f6




4


♗xf6


 



There is no defence against mate.
Here the quiet sacrifice does not institute a double attack, but a triple attack on Black's g-Pawn.
The two forms of Mate No. 19, forced by a Knight sacrifice, are curiously reunited in a theoretical variation of the Ruy Lopez:

A strange move, advocated by Steinitz who played it in his first match (New York 1894) against Lasker. It is not as good as the usual defence 5 ... ♘f6. It has the inconvenience of blocking in the King's Bishop and delays castling.




6


♗c4!


 



The best. The Bishop no longer has anything to do on b5. The threat is 7 ♘g5. Developing his Pieces quickly is an excellent principle. But before playing mechanically a move like 6 0-0 it is necessary to see if there is something better. Here, moving a Piece already in action immediately gives White an advantage.

7


♘xd4



Commenting on this variation in one of his lectures in 1895, Emanuel Lasker explained that the logical continuation of Black's previous moves would be ... g6, followed by ... ♗g7, exerting strong pressure on the dark diagonal. However, he added that in his match against Steinitz, the latter had never continued this way. Why? The reason will immediately become apparent.

Black thinks he can get away with taking the menacing Knight freely offered to him. But this move is immediately fatal. However, if 9 ... ♘xd4 10 ♗xe7 with the win of a Piece: 10 ... ♕c8 11 ♗f6! etc.




10


♕xd4


 



A Queen sacrifice, the object of which is to weaken the dark f6 and h6 squares, once protected by the Bishop. Independently of the greater threat 11 ♕xh8+ there is also the threat of mate by 11 ♘f6+ followed by 12 ♗h6 mate (Mate No. 19A)



10

CHAPTER 19:
Mate of the Two Bishops
(MATE NO. 20)
Just as Bishop and Knight are sufficient to mate the King in a corner square, two Bishops can achieve the same result.

In the diagram position, the Bishop on c4 commands the open a2-g8 diagonal. The Bishop on b2 controls the semi-open a1-h8 diagonal. All that needs to be done is to open it completely.

This mate is so obvious that in practice it usually appears only as a threat. However we have already met it in one of the variations of the didactic Game No. 79. It may also be brought about if the g8 square is obstructed by a Black Bishop or by a pinned Piece.

CHAPTER 20:
Mate of the Two Knights
(MATE NO. 21)
Here is a Knight mate which is not extremely common, but is nevertheless sometimes met in practice. One of the authors of this book had the opportunity of carrying it out in a correspondence game.

It is clear that the Knight on f5 would deliver mate on h6 if that square was free and the g7 square was either covered or obstructed. The Queen sacrifice allows him to achieve both these aims.

A quick glance at the diagram, dear reader. White has three unmoved Pieces on the Queen's side. His King's Bishop is pinned. His King's Rook is semi-pinned. The Queen is going to pick off a Pawn in the future. Black is a Rook down and has a stalemated Bishop. But his four remaining Pieces are converging on the enemy King. How can a mate not result from this?
Black announces mate in three moves.

CHAPTER 22:
Arabian Mate
(MATE NO. 23)
Before the reforms of the fifteenth century, the only Pieces, apart from the King, which had the same moves as in our day, were the Rook and the Knight. The Rook and the Knight could deliver a mate reaching back as far as the origins of chess and which for this reason is called the 'Arabian Mate'.

CHAPTER 23:
Pay Attention to the Ranks!
There is a Russian saying: 'A woodpusher overlooks the ranks.' This simply means that inexperienced players think of manoeuvres and threats on files much more easily than on the ranks.
A great number of typical mates entail a manoeuvre prior to the opening of a file or a diagonal, whether to free a passage for the mating Piece or to obtain custody of a square in the enemy King's field.
The opening of a rank occurs far more rarely. However this is no reason to neglect it.

In the diagram position, White moved the attacked Knight and played 1 ♘f4.
There was, however, a typical three-move mate. Why did Duras, a very strong Czech master, not see it? Because he wasn't thinking in terms of ranks.

CHAPTER 24:
Exercises



































CHAPTER 25:
In Search of a Typical Mate
Most of the time, even a remote possibility of catching the opponent in a typical mate is not enough to construct a logical plan of play. But, broadly speaking, in many cases this possibility can guide an attacking player and suggest useful manoeuvres to him. This will be particularly true whenever the attacker considers that there is a chance, without damage to his own camp, of smashing the opponent's castled position.
We will give a few examples. These examples, it is true to say, would be better placed in our next work La conduite de la partie d'échecs. But, being useful practical applications of the study of typical mates, they will provide the student with an overview of the methods which we recommend for learning how to conduct a game.
The first position - as any amateur with a little experience will recognize - arises from the Orthodox Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined.
An attacking player, Kornel Havasi, who died during deportation in the Second World War, is endeavouring to do something. And he starts with a move which will bring about the exchange of several minor Pieces.




16


♘e5


♘xe5




17


dxe5


♘d5



If the opponent always plays the right moves then, proceeding from an equal position, it is pretty obvious that all games would be drawn. But everyone is liable to make mistakes, and this is why games are won.
Here, in his legitimate desire to go for further exchanges in order to simplify the position, Black does not play the best move. Despite appearances 17 ... ♘d7 is not bad. For example:



17


...


♘d7




18


♖xd7


 



Otherwise the Knight will go calmly to f8, defending the castled position. [Of course after 18 ♗xe7 ♖xe7 Black covers the Knight on d7.]



18


...


♗xg5



Black has the two Bishops and an equal game. 19 ♕h5 is comfortably met by 19 ... ♗e7.
Let's return to the game:




18


♘xd5


♗xd5




19


♗xe7


♗xa2



Black, in order not to lose a Pawn after 19 ... ♖xe7 20 ♗xd5 exd5 21 ♖xd5, embarks on an adventure. It is all the more wrong that he is not wary, persuading himself that the Bishops of opposite colours will assure an easy draw and perhaps even believing that his majority on the Queen's side will provide him with a rather promising endgame.



20


♗h4


♕b7



Probably to deny the White Rook momentary access to the seventh rank, and to prevent an incursion such as ♖d1-d6, accompanied by an attack on the Queen.



21


♕g4


♔h8



To avoid the unpleasant move 22 ♗f6.



22


♖d6


 



White is obviously preparing the doubling of his Rooks on the d-file. But the deeper significance of this doubling escapes Black.



22


...


b4




23


♖cd1


bxa3?




After all of the preparatory manoeuvres we have just seen, White launches an attack against the Black King. It will be irresistible.
Have you grasped why White has doubled his Rooks without concerning himself with Black's activity on the Queen's side? If yes, you will without any doubt discover by yourself the move which, in this position, forced Sacconi to resign immediately.
Look for it before proceeding with the commentary on this game.



24


♗f6!!


Resigns



White indeed threatens 25 ♕xg7 mate, an elementary form of Mate No. 6.
There are only two possible defences: 24 ... gxf6 and 24 ... ♖g8. Let's examine them in succession.
First defence:



24


...


gxf6




25


exf6


 



The threat is repeated with a Pawn (Mate No. 8).



25


...


♖g8



The only move.



26


♖d8!


 



This is the reason for the doubling of the Rooks. The Rook on d8 pins the Rook on g8, the threat of mate remains. We have already met several times this decisive pinning of a Piece which defends against a mate.



26


...


♖cxd8




27


♖xd8



And after a desperate check, the mate on g7 can no longer be prevented.
Second defence:



24


...


♖g8







25


♕xg7+!!


♖xg7




26


♖d8+


♖xd8




27


♖xd8 mate.


 



This is in a form that is scarcely different from the Corridor Mate No. 1. The device of the pin removed one of the guards of the eighth rank.
The position is so strong anyway that, on this second defence, there is an additional continuation, less elegant and more lengthy, but leading nonetheless to mate.

♗xg7+


♖xg7




26


♖d8+

This is exactly the mechanism of Mate No. 2.
GAME ENDING NO. 46
Munich Tournament, 1926
R. Spielmann - U. Gebhardt
How was it possible, in such a position, to mount an attack against Black's castled position?

White is a little better placed than Black, but he has not recovered the Pawn which he sacrificed in the opening.
It is here that one sees the difference between talent which is acquired and genius which is a gift.
A good player could think over this position for several hours, trying to discover its strengths and weaknesses; if he has never seen the game before, it is doubtful whether he will find how the brilliant attacking player who is playing White forced his opponent to resign in only six moves.
Spielmann's plan is simple. It is to demolish the castled position. To demolish a castled position, first of all it is necessary to deprive it of the pieces which collaborate in its defence. Then, or at the same time, it is necessary to disrupt its Pawns.
All players know this. And on this overall scheme, Spielmann bases his work.



21


♘xd6!


 



The first surprise. He gives up his splendidly placed Knight on f5. But this is because, first of all, he wants to deprive Black of his Knight too, as it is possibly a valuable defender of the castled position



21


...


♕xd6




Now it is necessary:
1) To get rid of the Bishop on f6.
2) To get into action the Bishop on b2 which is languishing on a magnificent diagonal, but one which has never been opened.
This strategical plan is simple and every good player can devise it. But what purpose will it serve if he has not envisaged the tactical method of carrying it out?



22


♗a3!


 



The commencement of a manoeuvre designed to drive the Queen away from its protection of the f6 square.



22


...


♕c6



Of course not 22 ... ♕xa3, on account of 23 ♗xf7+, winning the Queen for two Bishops.



23


♗d5!


 



White is not interested in winning the exchange. It is the King that Spielmann wants. Black's Queen is now compelled to leave the sixth rank.



23


...


♕xc2




24


♖xf6!



The removal of the Queen justifies this sacrifice.



24


...


gxf6




Here is the realization of the plan which we spoke about at the beginning. The Knight and the Bishop have gone. The enemy castled position has been damaged. Now all that remains is to deliver mate. How?
But in attacking the f6 square we have, move by move, deprived it of:
1) the eventual support of the Knight on d6.
2) the support of the Bishop on f6 which occupies it.
3) the support of the Queen which has been driven away.
4) the support of the Pawn on g7.
Why occupy f6? Because on f6 (or f8) our Queen's Bishop will deliver mate. No desperate sacrifice of the Rook or the Queen will be able to prevent the mate.



25


♕g3+


♔h8




26


♗e7!


 




White threatens 27 ♗xf6 mate (Mate No. 14A).
The continuation might be:



26


...


♖c6




27


♗xc6


♕xc6




28


♗xf8


 



And White mates after 28 ... ♕c5+ 29 ♗xc5 h5 30 ♗f8 ♗g4 31 ♕e3 ♔g8 32 ♕h6 b5 33 ♕g7 mate.
Or else:



26


...


♕c6




27


♗xc6


♖g8



27 ... ♖xc6 28 ♗xf8 ♗g4 29 ♕xg4 any 30 ♕g7 mate.



28


♗xf6+


♖g7




29


♕xg7 mate.


 



It's Mate No. 8.
Let's return now to the position in the diagram. Consider it anew and see how effective is the Bishop, which on b2 seemed totally inactive. It is this Piece, however, which enables him finally to administer Mate No. 8.

White has undertaken an assault on the King's castled position and for this he has opened the g-file. Black has hit back by bringing his Queen's Rook to a7 for defence of the seventh rank. Therefore, on first examination, it seems that Black is going to worm his way out of the attack by means of exchanges.
Janowski still has a Piece which is not in play, the Queen's Rook. How can he bring it promptly into action without Black being able to hit back with an attack on White's Queen? By a simple move which forestalls Black's counterattack.



22


♖g3!


 



Why does this move prevent the counterattack 22 ... ♖e7 ? Quite simply because a typical mate would follow (our Mate No. 3) i.e. 22 ... ♖e7? (the action of the Black Queen on the Bishop on f6 is now masked) 23 ♘g6+ hxg6 24 ♖h3+ ♗h4 25 ♖xh4 mate.
So Black sees the danger being resolved by exchanging the hostile Knight. But this exchange has the disadvantage of bringing another Piece into the assault on the castled position.



22


...


♗xe5




23


♗xe5


♖e7




24


♕h6


 



The Queen leaves ... but for a better attacking position.



24


...


♕d7




25


♖ag1


 




There are four Pieces attacking the Pawn on g7, which is only defended three times. The two ways of supporting it lead to a catastrophe.



25


...


♖ff7



What would have happened if Marco had played 25 ... ♖g8, not abandoning the eighth rank?
White would have continued 26 ♖g4! with the difficult to parry threat of another typical mate (Mate No. 17A) 27 ♕xh7+ ♔xh7 28 ♖h4 mate. To be noted, with the same idea, 26 ♖g5 (pointed out by certain careless commentators) would be less exact. Why? Because Black would reply 26 ... ♖xe5, forcing White to play 27 dxe5 (the White Queen cannot be taken because of mate on g8) 27 ... ♕f7 and the attack is stopped.



26


♗xb8!


Resigns.



Since he remains a Piece down and under the impact of a strong attack. It is clear that if 27 ... gxh6 28 ♖g8 mate.
In this example, it is necessary to underline the subtle way in which White's 22nd move forestalled Black's counterattack ... ♖e7 by the latent threat of a mate in three moves. In many games, the blows and the possible combinations envisaged by the two opponents are more interesting than the moves actually played. It is the role of the commentator to reveal these to the reader.

The position, inspired by the game Lewitzky - Marshall, Breslau 1910, has been modified to make it more typical. Its solution, coming after the two previous exercises, is relatively easy.



1


♕g6!


 



Threatening 2 ♕xh7 mate. If 1 ... hxg6 2 ♘e7 mate. If 1 ... fxg6 2 ♘e7+ ♔h8 3 ♖xf8 mate. 1 ... h6 2 ♖xh6 etc. 1 ... ♕e4 2 ♘e7+ and mate next move.

This is a mixture of the mechanisms of Lucena's Smothered Mate and Anastasia's Mate.
Actually, in the game the Pawn placed on c4 in our diagram was on c7. Loyd announced mate in eight moves and showed it to his opponent who resigned. But with the Pawn on c7, instead of c4, the King could flee to a2 on the sixth move and there is no mate.
[It's actually mate in 9. White interposes with 3 ♘e3 or 3 ♘f4 thus delaying the mate by one move.]
- 29 -
No. Since there is an obvious mate in four moves.



31


♖xh7+

If 31 ... ♔g8 32 ♖hxg7+ and mate next move.



32


♕h5+

33

34

- 30 -
The plan to mate on h8 demands that beforehand the flight of the King to f7 is prevented. It is necessary to close the corridor. But 16 g6 is insufficient because of 16 ... ♕xg6. How did Alekhine solve the problem?



16


♘e5!


dxe5



There is no other move. If 16 ... ♕xe5 17 g6! If 16 ... g6 17 ♖h8+! followed by mate next move.
The Pawn on d6 is deflected; now it cannot come to d5 to block the a2-g8 diagonal.

- 31 -
The mate on g2 (Mate No. 8) is prevented by the Knight on e3. If 1 ... hxg3 2 fxg3, and the h-Pawn is protected by the White Queen. The solution? A Queen sacrifice to arrive at Mate No. 9.

White is threatening Lolli's Mate No. 9.



31


♖xh5+


gxh5




32


♕xh5+


♔g8




33


♕h8 mate.


 



And 30 ... ♕f5 is not a sufficient defence on account of 31 ♘e7.
But Black has a good defence which opposes the threat of Lolli's mate with the counter threat of the Corridor mate and renders the sacrifice unsound. For example:



30


...


♗xf4!!




31


♖xh5+?


♗h6!



And White must give up the exchange by 32 ♖xh6+ so as to be able both to stop the mate commencing with ... ♕e1+ and save the attacked Rook.
Note that 32 ♖e5 loses a Piece after 32 ... ♖xe5 33 ♗xe5 d4!
- 35 -



1


♗xh6


g6



If 1 ... gxh6 2 ♕xh6+ and 3 ♕ mates. If 1 ... f6 2 ♗c1+ ♕xh5 3 ♖xh5 mate. If 1 ... d5 2 ♕xh5 and 3 ♖xh5 mate.
[1 ... ♕e6 stops the mate in 3 but of course also loses at once.]



2


♕xg6+!


fxg6




3


♗xf8 mate.


 



- 36 -
This position has a little history. Teichmann - who was one-eyed - played 26 ... ♖g6. S.Tarrasch commenting on the game (Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger) wrote: "Naturally this Rook move is entirely wrong" and published a long analysis establishing that 26 ... ♕xe5 would give Black a win. This commentary was reproduced by many journals and even by the great monthly German chess magazine Deutsche Schachzeitung.
But in the book of the tournament, G.Marco replied "Despite only having one eye, the problem composer Teichmann saw at first glance that if he played 26 ... ♕xe5 it would be mate in four moves:



27


♕xh7+!!


♘xh7




28


♖d8+


♘f8




29


♖h8+


♔xh8




30


♖xf8


mate."



The object of the Queen sacrifice is twofold. First of all, it opens the h-file for the King's Rook. Then, it prepares for a check, that is to say without loss of time, without which Black would have the possibility of making a defensive move, coming with the Queen's Rook to d8.
Lastly, abandoning the protection of the eighth rank would have allowed a Corridor Mate.

In this position, White played 1 ♕g4?, and after 1 ... ♗xf5 2 ♕xf5 obtained a draw in the endgame.
But W. Henneberger could have announced mate in five moves. How?



1


♗g7+!


♖xg7




2

Threatening simultaneously 4 ♕xg8 mate, 4 ♖xg8 mate, and 4 ♕g7 mate.



3


...


♕d8




4


♖xd8


 



And Black, no longer able to parry the three threats, is mated on the following move.
- 39 -
Reminiscent of a position composed by Stamma, this is one of the most extraordinary mates to which a grandmaster has been subjected in a tournament game.

♘e2+!




37

Curiously, the continuation now given in earlier sources is 21 ♗g5+ ♔g3 22 ♖f3+ ♘xf3 23 ♘f5 and 'mate'. But this is false since the King can go to f2.
It is necessary to play as follows:



21


♖f4+


♔h5




22


♘g7+


 



Two variations:



22


...


♔g5




23


h4+


 



[Here the authors miss the quicker finish for White by 23 ♖g4+ ♔f6 24 ♘d5 mate, which is why the exercise reads: White mates in 8 moves and not 9.]



23


...


♔h6




24


♖xf7+


♗e3




25


♗xe3 mate.


 



Or



22


...


♔h6




23


♖xf7+


♗e3




24


♗xe3 mate.


 



- 41 -
This exercise is misleading and in a test - together with five other positions - we submitted to students, it stumped a number of them. It is, however, a typical mate, strictly conforming to the scheme of Mate No. 12C. Undoubtedly it is the possibility of giving check with the Rook which induced mistakes in the solutions of the competitors.

♗e7+


♔e8




2

2

4

♖xe1 mate.



The sacrifice of the Queen enables him to exploit the weakness of the first rank and deliver one of the derivative forms of the Corridor Mate.
- 43 -
This position, which in fact has been reached by a few masters - and notably Janowski - arises from a game played by White at Knight odds with the Max Lange Attack:
1 e4 e5 2 ♗c4 ♗c5 3 0-0 ♘f6 4 c3 ♘c6 5 d4 exd4 6 e5 d5 7 exf6 dxc4 8 ♖e1+ ♔f8 9 ♕h5 ♗d6 10 fxg7+ ♔xg7
And now a very pretty mate in four moves.



11


♗h6+


♔g8




12


♕g5+!


 



Deflecting the Queen in order to deliver Mate No. 14C.

Provoking the opening of the g-file, as in the ♕xf6 of Morphy's sacrifice.



1

gxf6




2

In order to bring the King to f8 to give check by ♗h6, without allowing Black the time to play an aggressive move.

3


♗h6+


♔g8




4


♖e8 mate.

Black cannot take the Queen on account of 2 ♖e8 mate.

The King is in the corridor. Now he will get rid of the protecting Knight.



3

♔xc8




5


♖e8 mate.


 



It's mate No.15B.
- 47 -
This position arose during the course of a simultaneous exhibition. It is justly famous.



1


♕d7+!


 



The classic sacrifice of the Queen to place the Black King in a situation where it will be subject to a double check.



1


...


♗xd7




2


♘d6+


♔d8




3


♘f7+


♔c8



And here we come back to mate No.15B by the same device as in the previous exercise.



4


♖e8+


♗xe8




5


♖d8 mate.


 



- 48 -



1


♕xf6!


♖xd1



The best. If 1 ... ♕xg3 2 ♖xg3 ♖xd1+ 3 ♔g2 and wins. If 1 ... gxf6? 2 ♗e5+! ♕g4 3 ♖xg4+ ♔h8 4 ♗xf6 mate (Morphy's Mate No. 14).



2


♕xg7+!


♔xg7




3


♗e5+


♔h6




4


♗g7+


♔h5




5


♗e2+


 



And Black has the choice between mate and giving back all the Pieces.



5


... ♔h4?


 




6


♗f6 mate.


 



Or:



5


...


♕g4




6


♗xg4+


♔g5




7


♗xd1+


♔f5




8


♗xf8 and wins.


 



Thus the threat of Morphy's mate has brought about a winning endgame.
- 49 -
Black played:



32


...


♕g6!



And White resigned.
The threat is 33 ... ♕xg1+ 34 ♔xg1 ♖c1+ 35 ♕f1 ♖xf1 mate (Mate No. 14C).
Is there a defence? Let us first try capturing the Queen.



33


♖xg6


♖c1+




34


♖g1


♖xg1+




35


♔xg1


♖c1+




36


♕f1


♖xf1 mate.



Again it is Mate No. 14C.
Let us now try to protect the first rank and bring back the Rook on a7.



33


♖aa1


♖c1!



Threatening a pinned mate 34 ... ♕g2 mate! The defence 34 ♖axc1 would be insufficient since after 34 ... ♖xc1, White will have to sacrifice the Queen anyway: 35 ♕e1 ♖xe1, and mate next move.



34


♕e1!


 



But Black is still winning because after the exchanges he is left a Bishop up. For example:



34


...


♕xg1+




35


♔xg1


♖xe1+




36


♖xe1


♖b8



and Black wins.
- 50 -

Editor's correction:
The authors gave here as the solution to a proposed mate in 6 moves: 1 ♖xh6+ gxh6 2 ♘f6+ ♔h8 3 ♖g7! Threatening the Arabian mate. Then 3 ... ♔xg7 4 ♘e8++♔g6 5♕f6+ ♔h5 6 ♘g7 mate. But apart from the fact that 3 ... ♕c7+ spoils the mate in 6 there is actually a mate in 4 by :

This position arises from a variation of the Muzio Gambit: 1 e4 e5 2 f4 exf4 3 ♘f3 g5 4 ♗c4 g4 5 0-0 gxf3 6 ♕xf3 ♕f6 7 d3 ♘c6 8 ♗xf4 ♕xb2? 9 ♗xf7+ ♔d8 10 ♗g5+ ♗e7 11 ♗xg8 d6.
There is now a mate in three moves:



1


♕f8+


♔d7




2


♗e6+!


♔xe6




3


♕f5 mate.


 



The stratagem and the mate are the same as in the previous exercise.

This position occurred in the last round of the Carlsbad Tournament, 1907. Rubinstein had 14½ and Maroczy, his only rival for first place, 13½. Therefore Rubinstein did not worry too much about winning the game since ½ point was sufficient for victory. That is undoubtedly why he played carelessly, 24 ... ♗a6?, a move which entailed rapid exchanges and a draw.
He had overlooked a mate in a few moves, thus:



24


...


♖h5!




25


h3


♘g4!!




26


fxg4


♖xh3+




27


♔g1


♕h2+




28


♔f1


♕h1+




29


♔e2


♕xg2 mate.



Or else:



25


g3


♕xg3




26


♗e4


♖xd1




27


♖xd1


♘xe4




28


fxe4


♗xe4+




29


♕xe4


♕xh2 mate.



In this variation 27 ... ♘g4 is equally winning.
The solver will verify that 25 ♘e5 would delay the mate by a move and the longest resistance is provided by 25 ♔g1. But mate is inevitable.

Eliminating the guard of f2.

In this position, Loyd played 33 ♕xf3! After his opponent had replied imprudently 33 ... ♕xf3?, he announced mate in three moves:

First of all, a little geography. Pistyan - which one must be careful not to confuse with the Italian city of Pistoia, as we have often seen done - is a small Czech spa town where they cure rheumatism. It is situated near the Carpathians, an hour and a half from Bratislava.
In the tournament contested here in 1922 and where E.D.Bogoljubow won ahead of A.Alekhine and R.Spielmann, the position in the diagram was reached between R.Réti and Major Hromadka, a charming man, but with a name that is unpronounceable for a guttural Frenchman.
You do not need to be very clever to realize that White is lost. But in reaching this winning position, Hromadka had used up a lot of time. He had six moves to make in two minutes.
He played 35 ... ♕g2+, and on 36 ♔e1 ♘xe5 37 ♗xe5 ♗f5 etc, ruined his position irreparably and in addition lost the game by not having played his 40th move in time. Réti therefore registered the full point.
On the 35th move, Hromadka could have
1) won the White Queen, which is not bad;
2) announced mate in five moves, which is even better.
Win of the White Queen



35


...


♗f5 ?!



and the Queen is lost, because, if she goes to d5, there is a mate as follows:



36


♕d5


♕g2+




37


♔e1


♕f2+!




38


♗xf2


gxf2+




39


♔f1


♘e3 mate.



Mate in a definite number of moves:



35


...


♖f2+!




36

Otherwise 36 ♔e1 ♕xg1+ 37 ♗f1 ♕xf1 mate.

A charming quiet move, completely encircling the Black King and prohibiting it from d6.

[4 ... ♕b4 would have merely delayed the mate by one move.]

♖e1+


♕e3+

A sacrifice to drive the King into a mating net.

It's the Epaulettes Mate. The position was composed and does not come from a game ... But it is plausible.

The adroit problemist, Edward Pape, has demonstrated here that the qualities required for composing problems also find their application in practical play.
