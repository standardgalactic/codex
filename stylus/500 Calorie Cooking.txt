Introduction
 
I have a husband who has food allergies. Since he is limited to what he can eat, dieting is never an issue for him. I can eat whatever I please, so watching my calorie and fat intake is required to maintain my optimal weight. I prefer to eat several meals throughout the day, so I have assembled some meal recipes that are less than 500 calories. If I eat lower calorie meals, I can eat more of them. I am not only concerned with the calorie count; I also like to eat a low fat, low salt diet.
The pictures in the book are all taken of the real serving size listed. The pictured meals are on standard size dinner plates (10 inch round plates) unless otherwise noted. I really like to eat, and I tried to create recipes that are filling and taste great. I'm not a fan of substitutions for most things. If I have to substitute a food that is just too high in fat to add to my diet, I try to add extra flavors to compensate. I have found that adding lemon or lime juice into recipes really reduces the need for salt. Sautéing with only a very little oil is an easy way to cut useless fat out of your diet. Even good fat is still high in calories.
My philosophy with food is basically everything in moderation. When I cook a dish that is slightly higher in cholesterol I will make sure that my other meals for the day do not have any cholesterol to ensure I remain within the daily recommended allowance. If I splurge and eat a high sugar dessert, I make sure the next day I eat very healthy. I eat red meat (beef and pork) only once a week, and the rest of the time I eat chicken, fish or vegetarian.
I have found that lowering the salt was harder for me than the fat content. It took me quite a while before I weaned myself off my need for salt. I still need to use some salt or I think the food is too bland. I have used the small amount of salt that I use in these recipes, however if you prefer no salt or more salt, please just adjust to your palette.
All the recipes in this book I cook gluten-free, however I have given alternatives for those of you who prefer to eat wheat. If you have multiple food allergies, please see my other cookbook. Allergy Free Cooking, listed on Amazon.

Vegetable Broth
This is a very flavorful broth that I use in place of any chicken or beef stock. Making my own broth allows me to monitor the salt and fat content. The roasted vegetables really add to the flavor, but they will darken the broth.

Scrape the vegetables into a large stock pot and add the water, salt, pepper, bay leaves and thyme. Bring the water to a boil; cover and reduce to a simmer for 1 hour. Strain well. Cool and store in the freezer.










Lentil Vegetable Soup
Total calories per serving: 275
This is a delicious vegetarian soup, and the lentils add protein and body to satisfy meat eaters. I like to spice up my soup with a little hot sauce right before serving.
The soup is pictured in a 4 cup capacity bowl.

Remove the bay leaf before serving.










Minestrone Soup
Total calories per serving: 411
This was my grandma's recipe. It is a very hardy soup that is satisfying for lunch or dinner. If desired, this soup can be made early in the day and reheated before serving. Reserve the fresh basil and add just before reheating. I freeze any leftover soup and simply reheat when needed.

Bring the broth to a boil; reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the green beans and potatoes and simmer an additional 20 minutes. Add the cannellini beans and zucchini and simmer another 20 minutes. Stir in the fresh basil before serving.










Black Bean Soup
Total calories per serving: 452
Black bean soup is a thick, rich soup that is packed with vegetables. The soup broth is a combination of tomato sauce and vegetable broth. It is seasoned with lime juice, cilantro, cumin, coriander and chili powder, which really provides a satisfying depth of flavor. I usually put the hot sauce on the table so everyone can add as much heat as they like. In my opinion, this is a soup that can handle quite a bit.

Remove the bay leaf and add the lime juice, scallions and cilantro. Season with hot sauce to taste.










Tuna Salad with Wasabi Vinaigrette
Total calories per serving: 267
This is a cool crisp salad with a spicy wasabi dressing. I only use light chunk tuna in water for this recipe, since it is cheaper and more importantly, healthier. I drain the water from the can and spread the tuna over the greens.

½ t wasabi paste
On four dinner plates layer the lettuce, red pepper, carrots, scallions and tuna. In a small bowl, whisk together the rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi. Slowly whisk in the olive oil. Drizzle the dressing over the salad. Top with the sesame seeds.










Salmon Cake Salad
Total calories per serving: 357
This is a lovely salad with a tartar sauce inspired dressing. The dressing uses raw cashews in place of mayonnaise, which add protein and vitamins without the unnecessary extra fat of mayonnaise.
The salmon cakes are made with Dijon mustard and Old Bay seasoning. The cakes are light and succulent on the inside and crispy on the outside. Make sure to really drain the canned salmon or the cakes will be harder to form.
I use Rice Chex in this recipe, as my husband is gluten intolerant. If you prefer, you can substitute the Rice Chex with whichever type of bread is your favorite.

In a small saucepan over high heat, bring the water to a boil. Remove the water from the heat and add the cashews. Allow the cashews to soak for 30 minutes. Drain the cashews reserving 1 tablespoon of water. In a food processor combine the cashews and lemon juice. Process until smooth and the consistency of mayonnaise adding the reserved water if it is too thick. Stir in the dill, Worcestershire sauce, scallions, 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, ½ teaspoon capers and dill pickles. Refrigerate until the salmon cakes are cooked.
In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Add the bell pepper and onion and sauté 10 minutes or until softened. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.
Preheat the oven to 375°. In a medium bowl, combine the Rice Chex and vegetable broth and let sit for 10 minutes. Add the drained salmon, cooked pepper and onion, corn, 1 tablespoon capers, egg, 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, Old Bay, parsley and chives. Carefully mix together and form into 8 patties. Spray a cookie sheet with cooking spray. Place the salmon cakes on the cookie sheet and bake in the oven for 20 minutes. Flip the cakes and cook an additional 15 minutes.
Layer a plate with 1½ cups of mixed greens, two salmon cakes and drizzle 2 tablespoons of the dressing over the top.

Curried Chicken Salad with Mango Dressing
Total calories per serving: 271
This is a bold salad that hits a lot of different flavors and textures. The spicy chicken curry salad lies on a bed of crisp romaine lettuce and is topped with a creamy sweet mango dressing. The cranberries and apples provide a sweetness and crunch, which really compliments the tenderness of the chicken.

In a large saucepan combine the chicken breasts and water. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer 20 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink. Remove the chicken from the water and refrigerate until cool, about 20 minutes. De-bone and dice the chicken breasts.
In a small bowl whisk together the yogurt, curry and 1 tablespoon lime juice. Add the celery, onion and diced chicken to the curry mixture and stir to coat.
In a food processor, combine the mango, ginger, 1 tablespoon lime juice, cilantro and pepper. Blend until smooth. On four dinner plates layer the lettuce, walnuts, apple, and cranberries. Pour the mango dressing over the lettuce. Top with the curry chicken salad.










Taco Salad
Total calories per serving: 252
This is my basic taco seasoning which I use for both taco salad and traditional tacos. I prefer this to the packaged taco seasoning, since I can control the amount of salt. Also, since my husband is gluten-free, I can be sure there is no flour used as a thickening agent.
I love the avocado dressing with this salad. The avocado that I'd normally put in the salad can do double duty here, and drastically reduce the total calories. In fact, because this salad is so low in calories, you can add 1 ounce of cheddar cheese and only increase your calorie count to 365. There is a still lot of flavor without the cheese though.

Add 1 cup of water, reduce the heat to low and simmer 30 minutes or until all the water has evaporated.
In a food processor, combine the avocado, cilantro, garlic, lime juice, apple cider vinegar, ¼ teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon chili powder and ¼ cup of water. Blend for 2 minutes until smooth. In a large bowl, combine the lettuce and tomatoes. Toss the lettuce and tomatoes with the avocado dressing. Layer the lettuce and tomatoes on four dinner plates and top with the taco meat. 









White Pizza
Total calories per serving: 451
I love to make individual pizzas on naan flatbread. When I make this gluten-free, however, I use corn tortillas. Two corn tortillas have 150 less calories than one naan flatbread. This white pizza uses all raw toppings and is not cooked. The vegetables are sliced very thinly and layered on top of a yogurt sauce. I like to use grated carrots on top for a cheese-like affect.

Pizza
Total calories per serving: 198
This is a more traditional cooked tomato sauce and cheese pizza. The vegetables are cooked before they top the pizza, which ensures that everything is perfectly cooked. I often change up the vegetable toppings to use what I have in the refrigerator, even using leftover cooked vegetables.

In a small saucepan, combine the tomato sauce, garlic and oregano over medium heat. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.
In a medium sauté pan over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Sauté the green peppers and onions for 20 minutes until browned. Remove the onions and green peppers and reserve on the side. Add the spinach to the pan and cook 3 minutes until wilted.
Preheat the oven to 425°. Lay the tortillas on two cookies sheets. Top each tortilla with the sauce, parmesan cheese, onion and green pepper, mushrooms, banana peppers and spinach. Bake the pizzas for 15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the tortillas are lightly browned.










Frittata
Total calories per serving: 179
This dish looks just as delicious as it tastes. The green and red from the vegetables, combined with the soft yellow of the eggs, create a beautiful dish that is perfect for serving to company. The asparagus, spinach, mushrooms and zucchini create a lush blend of flavors. Surrounding this medley of vegetables is the creamy eggs and cheese.

Add the sun-dried tomatoes, nutmeg and pepper to the eggs. Pour the eggs over the vegetables. Transfer the sauté pan to the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Top the eggs with the parmesan cheese. Bake for an additional 10 minutes until the eggs are set










Pepper, Mushroom & Onion Sandwich
Total calories per serving: 251
This is a simple sandwich that has a complex taste. The bitter arugula and the sweet sautéed onions provide a pleasing contrast, and the mushrooms and peppers add a hearty texture to the bun. I use a gluten-free bun, so the calorie count is based on that. If you choose another type of bun, be sure to look for buns that are about 160 calories. If you want to add some extra color to the sandwich, a slice of tomato adds a beautiful splash of red.

Add the balsamic vinegar to the peppers, mushrooms and onions. In each whole grain bun, place ¼ of the pepper, mushrooms and onion mixture and ¼ cup of arugula.










Vegetable Burrito
Total calories per serving: 368
These vegetable burritos include a variety of raw vegetables rolled in a tortilla, and seasoned with fresh hummus. I use an authentic hummus, flavored with only garlic and lemon. I also use this hummus recipe with sliced vegetables as an appetizer at parties. Make sure you really drain the black beans well and allow the corn to thaw and dry before wrapping in the tortilla, or the tortilla will end up soggy.

Falafel
Total calories per serving: 314
These falafels are a savory mix of sesame, cumin, coriander, cilantro and cayenne. They are baked in the oven rather than fried and then placed in pita bread and topped with tomatoes and cucumber. Homemade tahini sauce is spooned over each falafel adding another layer of flavors. I use gluten-free pita breads when I can find them. When I can't, I just use corn tortillas.  I also use Rice Chex cereal as a binder since it is gluten-free, but substituting bread crumbs is a viable alternative.

Refrigerate for 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375°. Lay the falafel patties on a cookie sheet. Bake 8 minutes, flip the patties and cook an additional 8 minutes. In a pita bread, add 2 falafel patties, sliced tomatoes and cucumbers and top with the tahini sauce.










Portabella Burger
Total calories per serving: 254
Using a portabella mushroom instead of a beef patty reduces your calories by 85%. You can still enjoy all the burger toppings without worrying about how much fat you are ingesting. The soy and herb rub allows the portabellas to brown beautifully, as well enhancing the overall taste.
This burger is pictured on a salad plate.

Chipotle and Lime Chicken with Avocado Spread Sandwich
Total calories per serving: 421
This is a hearty sandwich that is loaded with meat and vegetables. The avocado spread adds a smooth silky texture and a spicy contrast to the honey in the chicken. I used brown rice bread for the picture, however, use whatever whole grain bread you prefer.

Grilled Portabella, Baked Beans, Cole Slaw
Total calories per serving: 263
This is a low calorie barbeque with plenty of flavor. The portabella mushroom is spiced with a dry rub then broiled or grilled, leaving it with a smoky taste and a meaty texture. 
Baked beans are a favorite of mine and these have molasses and brown sugar for an old fashioned taste. The onion and mustard balances out the sweetness. I use Worcestershire sauce in these, so they are not 100% vegetarian. If you prefer, simply replace the Worcestershire sauce with tamari.
This is a mayonnaise-free cole slaw recipe so it is safe to leave at room temperature for several hours. The dressing is a blend of vinegar, honey, Dijon mustard and celery seed. I like to make this the night before serving so the flavors can really meld.

Chili
Total calories per serving: 302
This is a vegetarian chili that keeps all the flavors you would find in a traditional meat chili, except here we're using beans, corn, zucchini, green beans and mushrooms. The vegetable broth and tomato sauce is cooked until it thickens and extracts all the flavor from the chili powder, cumin and oregano. I think this chili is even better after it's been frozen, so I will often make a double batch of this recipe. 
The soup is pictured in a 4 cup capacity bowl.

This is a healthy light stir fry that is loaded with vegetables. If you want to add extra protein, adding 1 pound of tofu adds an additional 9.3 g of protein and only 79 calories. I add the tofu when I add the broccoli
My fried rice recipe uses only 1 teaspoon of sesame oil to fry the rice. Using a non-stick pan helps ensure that the rice still browns beautifully without the added fat. I like to top the rice with a sprinkle of sesame seeds.

Vegetable Curry, Millet
Total calories per serving: 351
This is a vegetable and tofu curry served over flavored millet. This curry is loaded with cauliflower, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, carrots and peppers. Since all curry powders vary, I will adjust the amount of curry powder up by another tablespoon if the curry flavor is not strong enough. When you stir fry the tofu, be careful not to stir until the tofu is browned and firm or it will break apart.
I like to serve this over millet, which has a nutty flavor that can hold its own against the strong curry. The millet is seasoned with soy sauce and scallions. This millet is delicious on its own, but with the curry sauce it is outstanding.

Eggplant Parmesan, Beet Salad
Total calories per serving: 399
The eggplant in this recipe is not breaded, and is simply sliced and cooked in a tomato sauce and topped with parmesan cheese. The eggplant is baked until it is tender and the sauce is bubbly and thickened. It is then served over quinoa pasta.
Beets are wonderful raw.  The beets are very thinly sliced and served over watercress. The dressing is a creamy herb dressing made with cashews. The cashews are soaked and then processed smooth, which adds a ton of flavor and protein to the meal.

Vegetable Lasagna, Arugula Salad
Total calories per serving: 479
This is my favorite lasagna recipe. It has a beautiful mix of vegetables that are cooked before assembling the lasagna, which helps ensure they are done perfectly. The sauce is a traditional tomato basil sauce that simmers slowly for an hour, giving it a wealth of depth. The parmesan on the top turns a lovely crispy brown.
Arugula is a slightly bitter salad green. I have paired the arugula with a sweet honey vinaigrette and cherry tomatoes to create a delicious contrast of flavors.

Zucchini Pasta Puttanesca, Endive Salad
Total calories per serving: 334
In this recipe, the puttanesca sauce is served over zucchini instead of traditional pasta. Puttanesca is a spicy blend of olives, anchovies, capers and red pepper flakes. The zucchini is sliced very thinly and blanched until just tender.  I use a vegetable peeler to create the zucchini pasta, and just throw away the seeds.
The endive and avocado salad provides a cool and crisp accompaniment to the puttanesca. The endive is dressed with a honey mustard vinaigrette, and the sweetness of the dressing pairs well with the slightly bitter endive.

Spaghetti Squash Cacciatore, Spinach Salad
Total calories per serving: 269
I love using spaghetti squash instead of pasta with marinara sauce, and this makes a great alternative for gluten-free diets. Spaghetti squash looks like most winter squash when raw, but once it's cooked, it shreds resembling spaghetti. The sweetness of the squash cuts the acidity of the canned tomatoes in the sauce.
Spinach salad with strawberries is a classic pairing. The sweet balsamic vinegar enhances both the strawberries and the spinach. I like the raw seeds in this salad, but if you prefer them toasted, simply add them to a dry pan over medium heat for 2-3 minutes.

Mexican Lasagna, Jicama Slaw
Total calories per serving: 467
This lasagna is a mouth watering combination of black beans, corn, tomatoes, sour cream and cheese. Make sure to only use full fat sour cream. A non-fat or low fat sour cream will curdle when heated. The cheddar cheese can be substituted with a low fat version. Personally, I would rather have only a little full fat cheese than a lot of the fat free.
Jicama is a root vegetable that has the consistency of apples, with a taste similar to water chestnuts. It has a white flesh that looks beautiful with the orange slices and red onion. Since jicama has such a mild flavor, the sharp cilantro and citric lime juice really stand out in this dish.
The picture is of the entire lasagna in a 8x8 pan and the whole jicama salad in its serving bowl.

Red Beans and Rice, Plantain
Total calories per serving: 475
This red beans and rice recipe is a filling and satisfying vegetarian meal. The beans and rice combine to form a complete protein. The rice is flavored with onions, peppers, garlic and herbs. The pinto beans are then stirred into the rice creating a delicious dish.
The plantains are roasted in the oven instead of the traditional frying. I have found that roasting sweetens the plantains yet allows me to leave out the oil and all the unnecessary calories and fat. You end up with a crispy outside and creamy inside.

Stuffed Cabbage, Broccoli Salad
Total calories per serving: 378
Stuffed cabbage is made with wild rice and vegetables, which are rolled in cabbage leaves and baked in a tomato basil sauce. The cabbage is boiled for a couple of minutes so it is pliable enough to roll around the rice filling. This stuffed cabbage freezes beautifully. For freezing, just place the rolled cabbage leaves in a freezer container, and cover with the tomato sauce. When you're ready to cook it, just let it thaw, top it with parmesan cheese and bake.
I love raw broccoli and this salad enhances the taste of the crisp broccoli instead of masking it. The honey and raisins bring natural sweetness and the walnuts bring additional crunch. If you don't like raw broccoli, I have used steamed broccoli in this recipe also. Just steam it lightly and then add the dressing.

Stroganoff, Balsamic Asparagus
Total calories per serving: 255
Beef stroganoff is a deliciously rich dish with more calories and fat than I choose to have on a regular basis. Modifying the recipe allows me to enjoy the flavors more often. I simply remove the beef and add more mushrooms. I use a variety of mushrooms to provide a meaty texture and I serve this over rice pasta instead of the traditional egg noodles. Be sure to take the sauce off the heat before adding the sour cream or it will curdle.
My family loves asparagus so I am always trying to find new ways to enjoy it. I like the pairing of the roasted asparagus with the salty soy sauce and tangy-sweet vinegar. The soy and vinegar can burn easily, so be sure to keep an eye on it. If the asparagus starts to get too brown but is not yet tender, add 1 teaspoon of water to the cookie sheet.

Salmon with Mustard, Kasha and Mushrooms, Sautéed Spinach
Total calories per serving: 405
This salmon is seasoned with dill and rosemary and then coated with tangy Dijon mustard. It is then roasted to medium in the oven. I always remove the skin before serving.
Kasha is toasted buckwheat and can be slightly bland. By stirring the kasha into the mushrooms and onion and coating it in the oil, the kasha remains separate. The sautéed mushrooms and onion add a toasted earthy flavor while the capers add a salty zip. The dill is added at the last moment and marries the kasha with the salmon.
This spinach is cooked very simply with garlic and olive oil. The garlic is toasted first and then the spinach is cooked until barely wilted. Over-sautéing the spinach will cause it to become soggy.

Blackened Catfish, Grits, Roasted Green Beans
Total calories per serving: 374
This is not a real blackened catfish, it simply uses a blacken seasoning. I dredge the fish in a spicy herb mixture and then sauté. The seasoning is a medium spice, so adjust the amount of cayenne to fit your taste.
I love to serve catfish with grits. In the picture I have the catfish next to the grits; however, I actually prefer mine on top of the grits. The grits are seasoned only by the vegetable broth, which allows them to absorb the flavors from the catfish.
Roasting green beans is by far my favorite way to cook them. I roast them until they are brown and crispy, and I usually add salt at the end of the cooking, like I was making French fries.

Tilapia with Bruschetta, Tomato Polenta, Broccoli with Parmesan
Total calories per serving: 276
Tilapia with bruschetta is a lightly seared fish with a cold basil and parmesan topping. The bruschetta is fresh and zesty and the fish is tender and mild. The combination really is delicious.
Tomato polenta adds a creamy texture to this meal. The polenta is smooth and cheesy with just a hint of acidity from the tomato. The bright red color also provides a nice visual appeal.
I love to cook broccoli, since it is low in calories and so versatile. Here, I have simply roasted the broccoli with an Italian seasoning and then coated with parmesan cheese to give it a nice cheesy crust.

Perch, Quinoa Tabbouleh, Peas
Total calories per serving: 421
This is a very clean summer menu. The perch is flaky and delicate without a lot of competing flavors, as it is simply seasoned with salt, pepper and lemon juice and then sautéed.
The quinoa and cucumber salad is a cool, refreshing salad with fresh dill and parsley. The quinoa is served cold with a lovely vinaigrette. The tenderness of the quinoa contrasts nicely with the crunchy cucumber and onion.
I am not a huge fan of peas, so I like recipes that jazz them up. This recipe has a ricotta cheese sauce that is flavored with fresh mint. The mint emphasized the sweetness of the peas, while the ricotta adds just a bit of tartness.

Pecan Encrusted Trout, Butternut Squash, Mashed Cauliflower
Total calories per serving: 395
This pecan encrusted trout leaves the fish with a crispy crust and a moist tender inside. By rubbing the trout with a little olive oil, the pecans will stick to the fish.  I bake this fish in the oven, since pan sautéing tends to burn the pecans.
Butternut squash taste similar to sweet potatoes. I like to add just a little brown sugar to the squash to make sure it will caramelize. I first cut the squash into two separate pieces (cutting the bulb from the stem), and then peel. It just seems easier to handle that way. The seeds are found in the bulb part of the squash, so just scoop them out with a spoon.
I make mashed cauliflower almost exactly how I make mashed potatoes. The only difference is the cauliflower can be processed in the food processor. I add a little Smart Balance and skim milk to the cauliflower and season with a little salt and pepper.

Miso Glazed Haddock, Quinoa and Snow Peas
Calories per serving: 297
Haddock is a very mild fish, so the strong marinade really stands out. This haddock is marinated in miso, soy, sesame oil and ginger. When the fish is broiled, the marinade helps the fish brown.
The quinoa and snow peas mimic the flavors of the haddock glaze. The quinoa is cooked with peppers and garlic and then flavored with sesame oil and soy sauce. The snow peas are added at the very end so they remain crisp.

Flounder in Lemon Sauce, Lemon Potatoes, Brussels Sprouts
Total calories per serving: 387
Flounder is a firm fish that holds up to this lemon and margarine sauce. I like to use Smart Balance or Earth Balance for my margarine in this recipe.
These lemon potatoes have an amazing contrast of flavors. The creamy roasted potatoes are enriched with margarine and then sprinkled with lemon juice. They are cooked until they have a rich roasted crust and a tender silky interior. Make sure to add the lemon juice after they are roasted or the lemon tends to turn bitter.
Brussels sprouts are a cabbage-like vegetable. They are sautéed with shallots until they begin to brown, and are then simmered gently in vegetable broth until they are tender. The combination creates a very lovely mild flavor.

Sardines Portuguese, Fennel Salad
Total calories per serving: 456
Sardines are a very versatile fish that unfortunately put a lot of people off. I have to admit, I usually remove the back bones before I eat them, although it is perfectly fine to eat them. These sardines are lightly sautéed, and are served atop a bed of rice, tomato sauce and olives. The strongly flavored sauce really balances the sardines.
Fennel is a licorice flavored vegetable that works really well with the sweetness of the avocado. The red onions add a touch of heat to the salad. I just lightly dress this with lemon and olive oil and a hint of basil.

Seared Scallops, Lemon Rice, Roasted Asparagus with Lemon Mustard Sauce
Total calories per serving: 314
Sea scallops are so tender and delicate that I like to cook them as simply as possible. I just sear them in a pan with a little salt and pepper. This way their sweet caramelized flavor is all you taste.
I love lemon with sea food, so this rice makes a perfect accompaniment to the scallops. The lemon and garlic mirror the flavor in the asparagus.
When I roast asparagus, I like to use thicker stemmed asparagus. They tend to brown without getting mushy. This asparagus recipe has a nice zesty coating of lemon and mustard.

Remove the mussels and place on top of the pasta. Increase the heat to high under the tomato and wine sauce, add the basil and reduce the sauce by half. Pour the sauce over the pasta and mussels.
 









Oysters Rockefeller, Creamed Corn, Radicchio
Total calories per serving: 312
I love oysters, but I am terrible at shucking them. Since keeping these in the shell makes a very pretty presentation, I often have the fish monger shuck them for me.
Although there is no cream in the creamed corn, scraping the corn husks creates a wonderful creamy sauce.
Radicchio is a bitter red leafy vegetable. Sautéing it reduces the bitterness while the hazelnut and apple juice dressing rounds out the flavor.

Coconut Shrimp
Total calories per serving: 479
Shrimp typically works exceptionally well with coconut. The sweetness of the coconut accentuates the delicate shrimp. Here, the lime and Thai chili sauce add even more layers of flavors.
If I cannot find Thai basil in my grocery store I use Italian basil. The taste is slightly different but not enough to take away from the dish.

Clams Casino Ramekins, Sautéed Polenta, Green Beans and Tomatoes
Total calories per serving: 307
This clams casino recipe is an adaptation of the traditional appetizer. I use the same flavors in the topping, but instead of filling each individual shell, I add several clams to a ramekin. When fresh clams are unavailable, canned clams can be used as an easy alternative.
Sautéed polenta is just polenta that I allow to cool, and then I cut it into triangles and sauté in a medium hot pan. The polenta gets nice and crunchy. Make sure to not turn the polenta more than once or it can break apart.
These green beans are my grandma's recipe, which she made for me a lot when I was a kid. The beans are cooked with tomato and basil until just tender. Frozen beans also work well with this recipe. If the tomatoes are not very juicy, add 1 tablespoon of water to the pan when cooking so they will not burn.

Squid Fra Diavolo, Citrus Salad
Total calories per serving: 439
Squid and tomato sauce go wonderfully together. The subtle flavor of the squid is accentuated by the acidic tomatoes. Fra diavolo is a very spicy tomato sauce that can be toned down or amped up by decreasing or increasing the red pepper flakes. Make sure not to overcook the squid or it will get very tough.
The citrus salad is a unique blend of tart grapefruit and salty feta cheese. The dressing is sweetened by the orange juice, which provides another layer of flavor. The visual affect of the pink grapefruit, with the red tomatoes on top of the bright green lettuce, is also extremely appealing.

Roast Turkey Breast
Total calories per serving: 371
This is a one pot meal that is great for serving to company. The turkey breast is roasted with carrots, onions, potatoes and bell peppers. The vegetables are beautifully caramelized while the turkey is cooking. I prefer the taste of turkey breast on the bone, but the boneless is much easier to carve. If you choose to use a boneless breast, reduce the size to a 1 pound breast.

1 t olive oil
¼ c fresh sage
¾ t dried rosemary
½ t garlic powder

Preheat the oven to 425°. Carefully loosen the skin of the turkey by sliding your hand between the skin and the breast meat. Season the turkey under the skin with ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper and garlic powder. Stuff the sage under the turkey skin. Place the turkey in a roasting pan and cook for 30 minutes.
Toss the potatoes, carrots, onions and bell peppers with olive oil, ½ teaspoon salt, rosemary and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Add the vegetables to the turkey pan and roast the vegetables for a total of 45 minutes.
About 15 minutes before the vegetables are done; when the breast registers 165°, remove the turkey from the oven. Allow the turkey to cool for at least 15 minutes, then remove the skin and carve. Serve 4 ounce portions of meat per person. Save the remaining turkey for later use.










Turkey Meatloaf with Miso Gravy, Miso Millet, Roasted Asparagus
Total calories per serving: 443
My husband loves meatloaf and this turkey meatloaf really satisfies. The meatloaf is gently flavored with onion, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. The meatloaf is cooked and then covered in a mushroom and miso gravy. Keep in mind that this gravy alone is very strongly flavored, however, once it is combined with the meatloaf and millet, the flavors blend beautifully.
A simple roasted asparagus completes this meal. Roasting adds a smoky flavor that really compliments the turkey meatloaf.

Moussaka, Dijon Green Beans
Total calories per serving: 380
This is a classic mousaka with a meaty filling and a creamy béchamel sauce. I have used ground turkey in this recipe instead of ground beef, which keeps the calorie count lower. I also add quinoa to the tomato sauce. This allows me to use less turkey yet still provide a very filling meal.
The green beans are flavored with a lemon Dijon dressing and then tossed with feta cheese. I like to roast the green beans, but in a pinch I have simply steamed them in the microwave for about 5 minutes in 2 tablespoons of water. I then just toss with the lemon and Dijon mustard and top with the feta cheese.

Chicken Almondine, Herbed Sweet Potato, Baked Zucchini
Calories per serving: 311
This chicken is moist and tender, and the almonds add body to the sauce and provide a mouth watering rich flavor. The lemon juice adds a hint of citrus which accentuates the herbs. If the sauce gets too thick after adding the cornstarch and lemon juice, whisk in 2-3 tablespoons of water.
The sweet potatoes that are paired with this recipe have a beautiful caramelized coating. The garlic powder and red pepper flakes give the potatoes a robust flavor. If your family prefers less spice, simply reduce the red pepper flakes or change it to black pepper.
Baking the zucchini lets you keep all the flavor of sautéing - without using additional oil. The parmesan cheese creates a crispy, slightly browned crust that blends beautifully with the oregano seasoning. I like to use a small casserole dish so I can have multiple layers. This allows the cheese to brown and the zucchini to become tender in the same amount of time.

Roasted Chicken with Pesto, Wild Rice, Kale
Total calories per serving: 444
I love pesto sauce and I am always trying to find new ways to use it. This chicken recipe really showcases the vibrant green pesto.
Wild rice is actually a grass. It is colorful and nutty. I make mine like a pilaf. Onions and rice are browned before the broth is added. Wild rice takes about as long as brown rice to cook.
Kale is an extremely healthy leafy green. One of the ways I like to cook kale is to braise it in a broth. This broth is full of onion, mushrooms, garlic and soy sauce. The balsamic vinegar sharpens the flavor of the kale as it finishes cooking.

Chicken and Pasta, Chopped Salad with Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette
Calories per serving: 418
This chicken and pasta recipe is unbelievably fast. From start to finish this can be ready in about 20 minutes. The sauce is enriched with ricotta cheese which melts into the broth, and the sun-dried tomatoes provide a chewy sweet contrast to the velvety sauce. When cooking the quinoa linguine, be sure to not overcook it.
I love this roasted garlic vinaigrette on the chopped salad. The sweet balsamic vinegar mellows the robust flavor of the roasted garlic. For this chopped salad I use my family's favorite raw vegetables, but the dressing pairs well with almost any vegetable combination.

Lemon Chicken, Millet and Artichoke, Roasted Carrots
Total calories per serving: 383
Since chicken breasts tend to be a bit bland, a nice sauce of lemon and wine adds a nice acidity without completely covering up the taste of the chicken. The chicken is flavored with basil and thyme and then braised in vegetable broth.
Millet is a firm, round grain that has a mild nutty flavor. I cannot find millet in my local grocery store, so I have to go to a local health food store to find it. I usually buy it in bulk and store it at home. This millet recipe is enhanced with artichokes. They add a creamy texture and an interesting flavor contrast.
Roasting carrots brings out their natural sugars. By adding a little parmesan cheese at the end of roasting, you can add an additional dimension to the carrots.

Stuffed Chicken, Tzatziki Wild Rice, Roasted cauliflower
Total calories per serving: 427
This roasted chicken breast is stuffed with spinach, Greek olives, feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. The combination of the salty cheese, pungent olives and sweet tomatoes adds layers of diverse flavors to the chicken.
I like to pair this chicken with a wild rice salad. The salad is dressed with a tzatziki sauce, which is a yogurt and cucumber sauce, flavored with dill and lemon. The salad should be served chilled.
Roasting cauliflower add a nutty component to the cauliflower. I like just a very simple seasoning of olive oil, salt and pepper.

Lime Marinated Chicken, Corn and Zucchini

This is a broiled chicken breast that is enhanced with a zesty lime marinade. The fresh cilantro soaks into the chicken and gives this dish a zesty piquant flavor. I like to marinate the chicken overnight for the most flavor.
The corn and zucchini is a bright fresh tasting warm salad. The cilantro and lime mimic the marinade in the chicken, creating a cohesive meal.

Chicken in Yogurt Sauce, Honey Sweet Potatoes, Ginger Broccoli
Total calories per serving: 440
This chicken recipe cooks in a zesty yogurt sauce that flavors the chicken and protects it from drying out. I have made this recipe by pounding the chicken breasts very thinly and cooking them only about 5 minutes in the yogurt when time has been an issue. The chicken actually soaks up even more of the yogurt sauce flavors.
I love honey with sweet potatoes. I add the honey after the potatoes are cooked to prevent them from burning. Drizzling the honey on while they are still very hot melts the honey into the potatoes.
I always try to create unity between the different dishes in a meal. That is why I love this broccoli with the chicken. Similar spices are used to create a delicious harmony. If you are not used to turmeric, remember that a little goes a long way.

Thai Chicken, Peanut Quinoa

This is a very basic Thai chicken recipe that is loaded with vegetables and flavor. I like the combination of the bok choy and broccoli, but I have used many other vegetable combinations. The peanut butter gives the sauce a creamy and unique flavor. I like to use a creamy peanut butter for the sauce.
I love this quinoa recipe. The peanuts give the already nutty quinoa even greater flavor. The peanuts also add a nice texture. I cook the quinoa as I would pasta whenever the liquid is only water.

Braciole, Creamy Polenta, Yellow Squash
Total calories per serving: 463
Braciole is a delicious beef dish that is stuffed with spinach and onions then braised in a rich tomato sauce. The meat is cooked until it is extremely tender. The sauce is infused with the beef drippings and the parmesan cheese that seeps out creating a decadently rich tomato sauce.
This polenta is cooked until creamy in a vegetable broth and finished with parmesan cheese. I like to soak up the tomato sauce from the braciole with the polenta. If the polenta gets too thick, add a tablespoon of water before adding the parmesan.
This yellow squash recipe works equally well with zucchini. The tomato and onion cook with the squash and create a nice cohesive dish.

Sirloin Steak with Horseradish Sauce, Kasha, Cucumber Salad
Total calories per serving: 481
Every now and then I crave a steak. This is a simple seared steak with a zesty horseradish sauce. The steak is cooked to medium rare. Add the hot drippings to the yogurt sauce slowly or it will curdle.
This kasha recipe is very basic. It is easy to alter the flavors by adding any herbs you like. Some of my favorite alternatives are tarragon, basil and mint.
This is a raw cucumber and onion salad in a dill sauce. The longer you let the salad rest in the refrigerator, the more the flavors blend.

Eye of Round with Chimichurri Sauce, Buttered Rice, Roasted Tomato
Total calories per serving: 409
Eye of round is a very lean cut of beef.  I like to serve mine with a modified chimichurri sauce. I use the pan dripping to create a gravy with fresh basil and cilantro. This adds a fresh taste to the beef. I serve this beef medium rare. Adjust your cooking time as you see fit.
For my buttered rice, I use Smart Balance or Earth Balance instead of butter. I flavor the rice with basil and cilantro to tie in with the beef sauce.
Roasted tomatoes are my daughter's favorite vegetable. The roasting brings out a lovely smoky flavor that is accentuated by the balsamic vinegar. If I am feeling really lazy, I use ¼ teaspoon garlic powder instead of the fresh garlic without compromising the taste.

Rosemary London Broil, Roasted Corn, Lemon Broccoli
Total calories per serving: 373
Skirt steak is a low fat inexpensive beef option. The problem with skirt steak however, is that if cooked improperly, it is very tough. Marinating the beef helps tenderize as well as flavor the steak. I will often marinate the steak overnight when I am not going to be home two hours before dinner.
Roasting corn in the oven, or on the grill, is an easy way to cook corn while adding plenty of flavor.  Be sure to let the corn cool slightly before removing the husks. I usually use a kitchen towel to hold the corn while I shuck it.
This lemon broccoli is browned in the oven with garlic and then doused with lemon juice.

Marinated Skirt Steak, Southwest Rice, Sautéed Zucchini
Total calories per serving: 489
I use a southwestern style marinade in this recipe with cilantro, cumin and lime juice. The marinade flavors and tenderizes the steak. After marinating be sure to wipe off any garlic or it can burn when broiling. This would cause the garlic to become bitter. With skirt steak, be sure to cut against the grain when carving or the steak will be tough.
I cook the rice in this recipe as I would pasta. I use plenty of water and drain the rice when it is tender. The rice cooks faster and with less of a chance of being over or under done. I then flavor the rice with a tomato, onion and pepper mixture.
This zucchini is simply cooked with a lot of garlic. The garlic is sautéed to a deep brown which really brings out a sweet nutty flavor. The zucchini is then quickly sautéed with the garlic flavored olive oil.

Garam Masala Pork Tenderloin, Baked Rice, Creamed Spinach
Total calories per serving: 375
Garam masala is an Indian spice blend. The masala is spicy without being hot. The pork is rubbed with the spice blend and marinated for a minimum of 2 hours. 
Baked rice is an easy way to cook rice. The rice gets slightly crispy around the edges and fluffy in the center. I don't like to add much extra flavor to the rice since I am serving it with highly spiced garam masala pork and creamed spinach.
This recipe for creamed spinach uses skim milk and is flavored with ginger, garlic and garam masala.

Herbed Pork Tenderloin, Sweet Potato Fries, Broccoli Rabe
Total calories per serving: 492
Pork tenderloin is a low calorie, low fat meat that really absorbs the flavor of a spice rub. I cook my tenderloin to medium or 140°, if you like your pork well done, increase the cooking time accordingly. I then let the meat rest for 10 minutes which brings the temperature up another ten degrees.
These sweet potato fries are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Since they have a sweet flavor naturally, I like to balance that sweetness with garlic powder.
Broccoli rabe is similar to broccoli but with a slightly bitter taste. Boiling the broccoli rabe first removes that bitterness. Finishing with a quick toss in flavored oil really is all the broccoli rabe needs.

Sesame Pork Tenderloin, Spicy Quinoa, Sesame Carrots
Total calories per serving 413
This is a delicious Asian pork marinade. The soy sauce and sesame oil penetrate the pork creating a tender pork roast. Sesame oil has a very intense flavor. One teaspoon is usually plenty to add its toasty sesame flavor.
Quinoa soaks up the flavors that it is cooked in. The chili sauce gives this dish a warm spicy flavor that compliments the pork and carrots. The scallions at the end add freshness and crunch to the finished dish.
This carrot recipe is my version of the carrots served at Japanese streak houses. They are steamed until they are just tender then sautéed a couple of minutes with soy and sesame.

Lamb Chops, Mashed Sweet Potato, Roasted Parsnips
Total calories per serving: 473
Lamb chops are a tender and juicy meat. They are marinated overnight in rosemary and garlic removing any gaminess from the lamb. I like to broil my lamb chops to medium rare.
These mashed sweet potatoes are simply flavored with milk and margarine and whipped until they are creamy and smooth. The sweet flavor compliments the garlic and rosemary in the lamb marinade.
Parsnips are a root vegetable that taste similar to carrots. Roasting them really brings out their flavor. I like to pair the parsnips with mint for added sweetness.

Lamb Shish Kabobs, Scalloped Potatoes
Total calories per serving: 460
Shish kabobs are a delightful combination of cooked vegetables and meat. These are marinated in a yogurt sauce prior to broiling, although grilling these is a marvelous alternative. I like to pre-cook the vegetables just slightly since I like my lamb medium rare. I find that if I try to cook the vegetables with the meat, the meat tends to overcook. Make sure not to roast the vegetables too much or they will fall apart when skewering them.
These potatoes are made with vegetable broth instead of milk or cream. The caramelized onions add a sweet rustic flavor to the potatoes.
