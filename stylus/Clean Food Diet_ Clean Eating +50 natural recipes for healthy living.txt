Introduction
 
The more progress we make
in the food industry, the more additives and preserves we seem to use. Every
single food we buy at the supermarket has at least one additive added to
preserve it better, to make it look better or to taste better. But luckily over
the last few years, you can see that more people have stopped eating whatever,
whenever and began to become more interested in where their food comes from,
how it is being produced, what it contains, and what health benefits it has.
This has led to a movement that is trending more and more called clean
eating. And that can only be a good thing, right?!
 
 









What is clean eating
 
This is a question I hear
often, but it has such a simple answer. Clean eating is very straightforward,
and it doesn't even count as a diet; it's more of a lifestyle. Clean eating is
a concept that you need to embrace; a concept that revolves around the idea of
knowing what your food contains and where it comes from. To put it simpler,
clean eating simply means avoiding processed foods. Processing refers to food
that has been processed before, such as many canned goods, white flour (and
pastries made with it), and foods that have ingredients you can't identify. As
a general rule, processed foods include anything from a hotdog to pasta sauce
and instant oatmeal. 
 
The problems with these
foods is that they've been processed so much that part of (or all) the
nutrients have been destroyed. Moreover, often additives are added to preserve
the food longer, to make it look better, improve its taste, and make it
irresistible. But these additives have been linked to serious health problems,
including cancer, so they shouldn't be part of anyone's diet.
 
 









What to eat
 
Now that all the processed
foods have been removed from your diet, let's see what you are allowed to eat:
 
Whole foods -
This is simple and refers to eating fruits and
vegetables fresh raw rather than including them in
foods that we can live without. For instance, instead of eating banana nut
muffins, eat a banana and some nuts. Also, use whole grains when cooking rather
than processed ones. This includes: quinoa, bran, bulgur, and the list can go
on. Focus more on grains that still have their full nutritional content and you
will get more fibers and nutrients just by following this simple and handy
change.
Canned foods -
as long as they don't have any additives. Canned beans, tomatoes, corn or other
vegetables are ok to eat as long as you read the ingredient list carefully and
make sure it contains as little ingredients as possible. Buy organic cans if
you can afford it as they surely have less salt and no additives.
Foods that have ingredients
you can recognize easily - whenever buying something, read the
label carefully and make sure you know every ingredient listed there. You will
be surprised to find that many types of crackers and breads comply with clean
eating rules, and this spares you a lot of time baking your own at home.
Fresh fruits and vegetables -
you can indulge on these all you want. They are healthy, delicious, and can be
combined into many recipes. Try to eat seasonal and buy organic or from sources
that don't use additives. When out of season, you can buy frozen fruits and
vegetables, but choose reliable brands and be sure to read labels.
Dried fruits
Farm range eggs
Nuts and seeds -
almonds, hazelnuts, pecans, cashews, chia, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds - you
can snack on these or use them in salads.
Healthy fats -
coconut oil, avocado oil, and olive oil are what we call healthy fats, and they
can be used in cooking with great success, but they can also be eaten raw, all
of them having plenty of health benefits.
Dairy products -
as long as they are hormone-free, come from a safe source, and are also low in
fat.
Healthy sweeteners -
such as honey or agave syrup - they are both allowed, but use as little as
possible.
 
 









How to eat clean
 
Clean eating doesn't
necessarily mean choosing certain foods or ingredients. It also assumes cooking
at home for yourself; stop buying readymade food from supermarkets or
restaurants. Cooking for yourself is cheaper and healthier because you get to
control the amount of fat and seasoning you add, and you can also use quality,
clean ingredients. This book includes plenty of recipes for you to try your
hand at, and they are all clean, delicious and healthy, but best of all, they
don't require an expert to cook them.
 
Another great concept of
clean eating is keeping your body hydrated. This means drinking at least two
liters of water daily and removing soda and carbonated drinks from your diet
for good. Our body and brain is made mainly from water so we need it in order
to function properly. Plus, water will help you detox your system and also
conduct the nutrients better into your blood and, furthermore, to your organs
and brain. This translates into better digestion, better brain functions, and
an improved health.
 
Apart from this, think
about food as a medicine and your body as a temple -treat it according to that
belief. The phrase "you are what you eat" has never been truer than
now! So focus on eating clean and channel your positive energy, and only then
will you see a change in your lifestyle. Your health will improve, your immune
system will be better, and you will feel much better overall. Your body will
know how to tell you when something's wrong, but it will also know how to show
you gratitude for taking care of it like you are supposed to!
 
 









How to Cook Clean
 
Cooking doesn't necessarily
preserve the nutrients and benefits of your food. Some of these nutrients are
destroyed, like vitamin C, but others are increased. So if you're not a
follower of the raw trend, I suggest you cook your food wisely so it tastes
great and preserves as many nutrients as possible.
 
Cooking clean starts with
choosing clean ingredients, the ones that come from safe sources and are
healthy and chemical-free. With these kinds of ingredients on hand, the job is
half done already! From delicious ingredients to amazing cooked food is just
one step.
 
Clean cooking means
avoiding frying food on huge amounts of oil and focusing more on frying in
small amounts of oil, steaming, stewing, and cooking on low heat. However, of
all of these, steaming is the most nutritious and preserves most of the
vitamins, antioxidants and fibers. Apart from the cooking technique, there's
one more important thing to consider - reducing the amount of salt you use in
cooking. You are free to use spices and herbs, but reduce the salt and try to
enjoy food in the most natural possible way. That's when you get more flavors
and nutrients that are crucial for a healthy lifestyle, healthy mind, and a
healthy body.
