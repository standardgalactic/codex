Introduction
From a technological standpoint, the past decade has been an exciting one. Ten years ago, Apple's original iPhone provided a glimpse into the future, and showed the world what could be possible using a smartphone. But by today's standards, that original iPhone's capabilities aren't that impressive, especially when you know what is possible with an iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, or the iPhone X.
During this past decade, many of us have become extremely reliant on our iPhones. The device has evolved into a powerful communications, productivity, organization, digital-photography, navigation, information-gathering, digital-payment, fitness, money-management, and entertainment tool that fits easily in the palm of our hands and functions almost anywhere.
As the iPhone has continued its rather rapid evolution, Apple has introduced the iPad tablets and Apple Watch, all of which now work seamlessly together in ways that only science fiction writers and the world's leading tech visionaries (including the late Steve Jobs) could have imagined just a decade ago.
The operating system that allows the iPhones and iPads to function is called iOS. In September 2017, Apple introduced a major update, called iOS 11. It offers an impressive collection of enhancements to existing features and functions, as well as new tools that we'll soon come to rely heavily upon in our daily lives.
This all-new, seventh edition of iPad and iPhone Tips and Tricks quickly gets you up to speed using iOS 11. It uncovers the most important functionality that this operating system has to offer and also helps you acclimate to the newest functions of the latest iPhone and iPad models.
However, if you haven't yet upgraded to one of these new devices, you can still take full advantage of what iOS 11 has to offer, as long as you're using a compatible smartphone or tablet that was released by Apple in the past few years.

 Note
The iOS 11 edition of Apple's proprietary operating system functions on an iPhone 5s, iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and the iPhone X smartphone.
As for compatibility with the iPad, iOS 11 works on the iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3, iPad mini 4, iPad 5th generation, iPad, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, and all iPad Pro models released to date (including those with a 9.7-inch, 10.5-inch, and 12.9-inch display).


 Note
If you purchased a new iPhone or iPad after September 19, 2017, iOS 11 came preinstalled on your mobile device. Otherwise, you need to upgrade your device's operating system by following the steps outlined in Chapter 1, "Discover iOS 11 and the Newest iPads and iPhones."

For those who are new to using an iPhone or iPad and have recently migrated from another smartphone or tablet (such as an Android device), this edition of iPad and iPhone Tips and Tricks teaches you what you need to know to become proficient using iOS 11 on your new smartphone or tablet.
With the introduction of iOS 11, Apple has once again implemented hundreds of new features and functions, while improving upon what was offered by iOS 10.

 What's New
Siri can now be a real-time language translator. Upon activating Siri, begin a command by saying the word Translate and then say in English whatever you want Siri to translate. End the command by stating what language you want the word or phrase translated into.


For example, say, "Hey Siri, translate 'How do I get to the Eiffel Tower from here question mark' into French." Not only will Siri speak the translation within seconds so you can hear the phrase and correct pronunciation, but the translation is simultaneously displayed on the screen.
At the time of writing, Siri can translate from English to Chinese, Spanish, French, German, or Italian, but additional languages will be added over time.
If you're using this translation feature while visiting another country, you're able to use the improved Maps app to obtain detailed, turn-by-turn, real-time walking, driving, or public transportation directions in an ever-growing selection of major cities around the world.
An Internet connection is required to use either of these functions on your iPhone or iPad.


 Note
When it comes to screen size, the latest iPhone and iPad models offer multiple options. The iPhone 8 offers a 4.7-inch Retina HD display, and the iPhone 8 Plus offers a 5.5-inch Retina HD display. The iPhone X features a 5.8-inch Super Retina HD display and is the first iPhone to utilize OLED Multi-Touch screen technology.
Meanwhile, the latest iPad models include the iPad mini 4 (with a 7.9-inch Retina display), the iPad (with a 9.7-inch Retina display), the 10.5-inch iPad Pro (with a 10.5-inch Retina display), and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (with a 12.9-inch Retina display).
Regardless of which smartphone or tablet model you select, all these latest devices run iOS 11. However, the appearance and layout of screens and menus in apps automatically adapt and vary based on the device you're using.
When you're looking at screenshots throughout this book, keep in mind that what you see on your device's screen will vary slightly if you're using a different model iPhone or iPad than what was used to create a particular screenshot.

Not only has iOS 11 introduced awesome improvements to the operating system itself, but many of the core apps that come preinstalled with iOS 11—such as Contacts, Calendar, Reminders, Notes, Safari, Mail, News, Music, TV, Home, and Messages—have some impressive and useful new features.
Plus, with more of us relying heavily on online (cloud-based) services to store and share important data, documents, photos, and files, iOS 11's new Files app makes it easy to access, manage, share, and transfer files—not just when using Apple's own iCloud Drive service, but also when using other popular cloud-based services, such as Dropbox, Box, and Google Drive.
Meanwhile, if you're an iPad Pro user, you'll discover that enhancements made to iOS 11's Dock, Control Center, App Switcher, and Multitasking feature make it easier than ever to simultaneously run two apps at once and be able to easily drag and drop (transfer) content between the apps. In other words, your tablet can function more like a full-featured notebook computer than ever before.

 Note
Throughout this book, iOS mobile device refers to any Apple iPhone or iPad that's running the iOS 11 operating system.
Unless a specific iPhone or iPad model is mentioned (such as iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X), the term iPhone refers to all iPhone models capable of running iOS 11. Likewise, unless a specific iPad model is described, the term iPad refers to all iPad models that are capable of running Apple's latest mobile device operating system. When iPad Pro is mentioned specifically, this includes all iPad Pro models, regardless of screen size.
If you plan to continue using iOS 10 with your iOS mobile device, pick up a copy of iPad and iPhone Tips and Tricks, Sixth Edition, which focuses on the older version of Apple's mobile device operating system.

Some app icons (on the Home screen or Dock) have a new look, and in some cases, the location of onscreen icons and menu options have been revised. The Lock Screen, Notifications screen, Spotlight Search screen, Command Center, Dock, and App Switcher have also been redesigned, and offer faster access to useful information and popular functions. How to use each of these tools is described later in the book.

 Note
Chapter 16, "iOS 11 and Apple Pay Security and Privacy Strategies," explains how Apple Pay continues to offer a secure way to use your iPhone (and in some cases your iPad) to make purchases from the iTunes Store, your favorite retail stores, or online stores by taking advantage of the Touch ID or Face ID technology that's built in to Apple's more recently released smartphones and tablets. Among other things, a Touch ID sensor (that's built into the Home button) enables you to scan your fingerprint to securely confirm debit or credit card purchases.
On the iPhone X, the all-new Face ID feature works in conjunction with the smartphone's front-facing TrueDepth camera. For the first time, it can use state-of-the-art facial recognition to identify its user. Just by looking at your iPhone X's screen, you can unlock the phone or confirm an Apple Pay purchase.


During this past year, not only have hundreds of new banks and credit unions begun supporting Apple Pay, but thousands of additional retail and online merchants around the world now accept it.

You'll soon discover that iOS 11 has become even better at integrating the technological capabilities of the iPhone or iPad with apps and the Internet to put a vast amount of personalized information at your fingertips, exactly when and where you need it.
You're also now able to use your iPhone or iPad to wirelessly control or manage an ever-growing selection of "smart" devices and appliances in your home, such as your TV, cable box, and DVR, as well as lights, thermostat, door locks, garage door opener, refrigerator, convection oven, wireless surveillance cameras, and home security equipment.
Discovering What's New in iOS 11
Let's take a quick look at just a few of the major new features and enhancements made to iOS 11. You'll learn strategies for the best way to use the majority of these features later in the book. But first, here's a rundown of what's new and noteworthy about iOS 11:
 App Store—The App Store app, which grants you online access to more than two million apps for your iPhone or iPad, has been redesigned. It's now easier to browse through the App Store to find, learn about, and acquire new apps for your mobile device.
 Apple Pay—In addition to using Apple Pay to make online and retail store purchases, starting in early 2018, you'll be able to use the Messages app to instantly and securely send cash to other people (or receive cash that gets transferred and deposited into the bank account of your choice). This functionality is also available using the optional PayPal or Cash app, for example.
 Augmented reality—The ability to use the iPhone or iPad's camera to capture your real-life surroundings in real-time, and then superimpose computer-generated content over what you see on the screen uses new technology that iOS 11 can now take advantage of in games, as well as a new category of productivity and lifestyle apps. App developers are first coming up with interesting new ways to use this technology.

 Note
Be sure to check out the new app category within the App Store, called AR Apps, to discover ways augmented reality technology is currently available to you.

 Automatic Setup—When upgrading to a new iPhone or iPad, in addition to retrieving and moving content to the new device from an iCloud Backup that was created by your older device, this feature wirelessly gathers information (like personal settings, iCloud Keychain data, and Apple ID-related information) from your other device, to dramatically streamline the activation and setup process for the new device.
 Camera—On the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, the Camera app supports a new Portrait Lighting mode. It also offers improved image stabilization and a selection of new filters. Most iPhone and iPad Pro models have an improved True Tone flash.
 Control Center—Available anytime, the Control Center continues to offer quick access to iOS 11's commonly used features and functions, such as the ability to turn on/off Airplane mode, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. From here, you can also adjust the screen's brightness, control the Music app, and adjust the speaker's volume. For the first time, however, the layout of Control Center is customizable, so you can add icons for the features, apps, and functions you use the most often.
 Do Not Disturb While Driving—When turned on (either manually or automatically, depending on how you set up this feature), certain functions of your iPhone will be deactivated while you're driving so you're not distracted and tempted to engage in unsafe use of the smartphone. If you're the parent of a teen driver, insist that he or she turns on this feature on their phone whenever they're driving.
 Dock—The redesigned Dock on the iPad is now accessible from the Home screen or while using any app. In addition to being able to customize which app icons appear, iOS 11 predicts which apps you'll want to use next, shows icons for recently used apps, and displays the app icon for the app most recently used on another iOS mobile device or Mac that's compatible with the Handoff feature.
 Drag-and-Drop—On the iPad, it's now easier than ever to use the Multitasking feature to open and use two apps on the screen simultaneously, and then drag and drop content between apps.
 File Preview—When you press your finger on the thumbnail for a file within the Files app, or that you've received from someone else via email (as a file attachment), you can now see a preview of it, and immediately mark up or annotate that preview, before saving, printing, or sharing it with others. You also can open it within a compatible app installed on your iPhone or iPad.
 Files—This new app replaced the iCloud Drive app, and makes it much easier to preview, add, manage, retrieve, and share data, documents, files, folders, and photos, that are stored online, within a compatible cloud-based service, such as iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, or Box. Being able to store files in the cloud allows you to free up internal storage space within your mobile device. However, to use the Files app and interact with cloud-based services, an Internet connection is required.
 Maps—When using this app for turn-by-turn navigation directions, it now displays the posted speed limit on your screen and indicates which lane you should travel in based on up upcoming turns or lane merges. In addition to offering improved navigation information in more cities around the world and just about the entire United States, the Maps app now offers indoor maps for major airports and shopping centers.
 News—Along with providing you with up-to-the-minute news about topics you're personally interested in, from sources and content creators you select, the iOS 11 edition of the News app provides curated Top Stories in a personalized format.
 QuickType Keyboard—On the iPad, the QuickType virtual keyboard now displays two letters, numbers, or symbols per key, and allows you to switch between them with an easy downward flick of the finger. On an iPhone, a new function makes it easier to hold the phone and use the virtual keyboard with just one hand.
 Siri—Siri has been around for several years now, and the feature continues to improve with each new version. Siri's voice sounds more natural, the feature can be used as a language translator, and Siri responds to many more types of app-specific commands and requests, while being able to obtain information from a broader range of online-based sources.
What you'll soon discover is that with iOS 11, Apple has worked hard to make it easier to truly personalize and customize your iPhone or iPad, while giving you faster and more secure access to content that's stored in your mobile device, or that's available via the Internet. In addition, apps integrate better with one another, as well as with iCloud and other popular online (cloud-based) services.
Thus, your most important data, documents, photos, files, content, and information are more readily available to you, and can seamlessly sync between all of your iOS mobile devices and computers that are linked to the same online account(s).
Wait, What? the iPhone X Has No Home Button
For 10 years, iPhone users (and later iPad users) have been trained to press the Home button built into the front of their mobile device to handle a wide range of tasks. As part of the complete redesign of the iPhone X (released in conjunction with the tenth anniversary of the iPhone), the Home button has been removed. Instead, the 5.8-inch Super Retina display takes up almost the entire front of the smartphone. The iPhone X is the first to feature an OLED Multi-Touch display, with a 2,436 by 1,125 pixel resolution. In non-tech-speak, it's more vivid and displays more detailed content than any other iPhone or iPad screen to date.
The iPhone X still works seamlessly with iOS 11, but as you'll discover, some of the ways you interact with this new smartphone are different, compared to all other iPhone models. Instead of the Home button, you often need to perform a specific type of on-screen finger swipe, or press the Side button on the device to handle tasks that the Home button was formally responsible for.

 Note
Throughout this book, if you're using an iPhone X and see an instruction that includes pressing or tapping the Home button, instead take advantage of the appropriate finger gesture or press the Side button to handle the same task.

Because there's no Home button on the iPhone X, instead of using a fingerprint scan to verify your identity when unlocking the phone or authorizing a purchase, the phone relies on cutting-edge face recognition, so you simply need to look at the screen.
In addition, the iPhone X, iPhone 8, and the iPhone 8 Plus can take advantage of Qi-compatible wireless charging mats; instead of plugging your phone into an external power source, you can simply place the smartphone on a specially designed power mat. Eventually you'll be able to use Apple's AirPower accessory, which will be released in 2018. Charging mats for use at home or work are now available from a wide range of third-party companies. Apple also is working with cafes, restaurants, airports, and hotels around the world to have these mats installed into tables within public places, so you can more easily recharge your phone when you're out and about.
What This Book Offers
This all-new, seventh edition of iPad and iPhone Tips and Tricks helps you quickly discover all of the important new features and functions of iOS 11, and shows you how to begin taking full advantage of this operating system and its bundled apps, so that you can transform your smartphone or tablet into the most versatile, useful, and fun-to-use tool possible.
Using easy-to-understand, non-technical language, along with full-color screenshots, each chapter of this book focuses on using various aspects of iOS 11 and the apps that come preinstalled with it.
Throughout the book, look for What's New, Tip, Note, Caution, and More Info boxes that convey useful tidbits of information relevant to the topic. The What's New boxes highlight new features or functionality that is being introduced in iOS 11, while the More Info boxes provide website URLs or list additional resources that you can use to obtain more information about a particular topic.







1. Discover iOS 11 and the Newest iPads and iPhones

In this Chapter
 Learning about the latest iPhone and iPad models and what each offers
 Discovering how to use some basic iPhone and iPad functions
 Interacting with your iOS mobile device

As of late 2017, Apple's lineup of iOS mobile devices included a handful of new iPhone and iPad models, all of which run iOS 11. The operating system includes many useful new features, built-in functions, and preinstalled apps that allow the mobile devices to work more seamlessly with cloud-based services, including iCloud.
iPad Pro users will see the biggest advancements when upgrading from iOS 10 (or an older version) to iOS 11. Thanks to the improved Multitasking mode, App Switcher, and Dock, working with two apps simultaneously on the same screen and dragging and dropping content between apps is easier than ever.
In a nutshell, the latest iPad Pro models (with a 10.5-inch or 12.9-inch Retina display) have taken a giant step closer to functioning like a full-featured notebook computer, especially when you use them with the optional Apple Pencil and Apple Smart Keyboard.

 More Info
To compare the technical specifications and features offered by Apple's current lineup of iPad, iPad mini, and iPad Pro models, visit www.apple.com/ipad/compare.

Meanwhile, the current lineup of iPhone models includes the iPhone 8 (which has a 4.7-inch Retina HD display), the iPhone 8 Plus (which has a 5.5-inch Retina HD display), and the completely redesigned iPhone X (which has a 5.8-inch Retina HD display). These new iPhones feature wireless charging, along with other new built-in technologies that broaden the capabilities of these smartphones, making them more powerful and convenient to use.
Older iPhone models, including the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6s, and iPhone SE continue to be available, and all run iOS 11.

 More Info
To see a technological comparison between the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X, visit www.apple.com/iphone/compare. Click the See All Models option near the top-center of the browser window to include a summary of technical specifications for the older, but still available, iPhone models.

Discovering What's New with the iPhone X
For the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, Apple's iPhone X offers a complete redesign of the smartphone. It includes the fastest processors and most advanced technologies included within an iPhone to date.
As you can see from Figure 1.1, the Home button (with its Touch ID sensor) has been removed, and the front-facing camera has been improved, allowing for secure and accurate face recognition as a way to unlock the phone and confirm online and Apple Pay purchases.

 Note
If you're a veteran iPhone user, you'll have to get used to not having a Home button when using the iPhone X. Instead, you'll need to become accustomed to a selection of new on-screen finger gestures for navigating the phone and working with apps. For other features and functions, you need to use the iPhone X's Side button.


FIGURE 1.1
The redesigned iPhone X is the most technologically advanced iPhone ever released. It's available in a silver or black casing, with either 64GB or 256GB of internal storage.
On most iPhones, a user can swipe up from the bottom of the screen, or swipe down from the top of the screen, to access certain features, such as Notification Center or Command Center, and use the Home button to handle a variety of tasks.
On an iPhone X, however, when placing your finger near the top or bottom of the screen, it now matters where on the screen you start the motion when you initiate a swipe.
Getting Ready to use Your New iPhone or iPad
If you're upgrading your iPhone or iPad from an older model to a newer one, the initial setup and activation process for the new device has been streamlined, thanks to iOS 11. You can take advantage of the Automatic Setup option, which combines retrieving your content from your iCloud account and wirelessly transferring information (including your personal settings and preferences, along with your iCloud Keychain data) between your older iPhone or iPad and your new one. Be prepared to place your old device next to the new one during the Automatic Setup process.

 Note
Attention Android phone users! If you're switching to an iPhone from any Android-based smartphone (running the Android 4.0 or later operating system), first of all, what took you so long? Second, Apple provides an app-based tool to seamlessly and wirelessly migrate your data and content to the iPhone.
On your Android device, download and install the free Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store and follow the on-screen prompts to transfer your contacts, message history, camera photos and videos, web bookmarks, email account information, and calendar/scheduling information.


 Note
Need help migrating to a new iPhone or iPad? Within 90 days of purchasing the new device (or within two years, if you acquired AppleCare+), visit the Apple Store and be sure to bring along both your new and old smartphones or tablets to receive free assistance. If you go on a different day than the day when you purchase the new iPhone or iPad, you need to make a free appointment with an Apple Genius. Visit https://getsupport.apple.com.

Charging Up and Getting Ready to go
Your iPhone or iPad comes with a built-in battery that has up 12 hours of battery life; battery life depends on the iPhone or iPad model, and how you use it throughout the day. To ensure your smartphone or tablet will be ready to use whenever you need it, get into the habit of keeping its battery charged.
On older iPhone or iPad models, you have several options for charging the iPhone or iPad's battery:
 Use the white USB cable that came with your iOS mobile device to connect your iPhone or iPad to your computer.
 Connect a power adapter to the USB end of the white cable that came with your device, and then plug in the power adapter to an electrical outlet. Plug in the Lightning connector end of the cable to the bottom of your iPhone or iPad.
 Connect an optional external battery pack to your iPhone or iPad, either directly to its Lightning port or with the white USB cable that came with the device.
 Invest in an optional car charger that's compatible with your iPhone or iPad, so you can recharge the battery and use the mobile device while you're driving, without consuming battery power.

 What's New
When using an iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, or iPhone X, you're also able to take advantage of its wireless charging capabilities, which means you'll need to acquire a Qi-compatible charging pad.
Apple will introduce the optional AirPower wireless charging mat sometime in 2018 (which will work with the latest iPhones, AirPods, and Apple Watch series 3). To learn about third-party companies, like Belkin ($59.99, www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F7U027) and Mophie ($59.95, www.mophie.com/shop/wireless-charging-base), that make Qi wireless charging products that are currently available, visit www.qiwireless.com.
Apple is also currently working with cafes (like Starbucks), airports, hotels, and restaurants to have charging pads installed into tables and publically accessible locations, which will make it very convenient to recharge the battery of your compatible iPhone.

The battery-life indicator is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen. When this icon is solid green, the battery is fully charged. As the battery depletes, the battery icon becomes white.

 Note
When a lightning bolt icon appears to the right of the battery life indicator, the device is connected to an external power source and is charging. You can continue using your iPhone or iPad while it's charging.

If the battery drains before you plug it into an external power source, your iPhone or iPad automatically shuts down (powers off) and will not be functional again until it's plugged in to charge. However, no information or content is lost if the device turns off due to a dead battery.

 Tip
In addition to the battery icon, you can adjust a setting so that the percentage of battery power remaining displays to the immediate left of the battery icon. Launch Settings, tap Battery, and then turn on the virtual switch associated with Battery Percentage.
When your iPhone's battery is running low but you don't immediately have a way to recharge it, extend the life of the battery by turning on Low Power mode. To turn on this feature, launch Settings, tap Battery, and then turn on the virtual switch associated with Low Power mode (see Figure 1.2).
As soon as you turn on the Low Power Mode feature, certain features and functions that typically consume a lot of battery power are deactivated, allowing you to extend the life of the battery and continue to use your device a bit longer.
To make it easier to access the Low Power Mode feature, add it to the Control Center. How to customize the Control Center is covered in the next chapter.


FIGURE 1.2

Turning Off or Putting to Sleep the iPhone or iPad
Your iOS mobile device can be turned on, turned off, placed into Sleep mode, or placed into Airplane mode.
 Turned on—When your phone or tablet is turned on, it can run apps and perform all the tasks it was designed to do. The touchscreen is active, as is its capability to communicate. To turn on the iPhone or iPad when it is powered off, press and hold the Side button for about 5 seconds, until the Apple logo appears on the screen. Release the Side button, and then wait about 15 seconds while the device boots up. When the Lock screen appears, you're ready to begin using the iPhone or iPad.

 Note
Depending on which iPhone or iPad model you're using, the location of the Side button varies. On older iPhone models, this button was referred to as the Sleep/Wake button, and is located on the top-right corner of the smartphone.

 Turned off—When your iPhone or iPad is turned off and powered down, it is not capable of any form of communication, and all apps that were running are shut down. The device is dormant. To turn off your phone or tablet, press and hold the Side button for about 5 seconds, until the Slide to Power Off banner appears on the screen. Swipe your finger along this red-and-white banner from left to right. The device shuts down.
 Sleep mode—To place your iPhone or iPad into Sleep mode, press and release the Side button once. To wake up the device, press the Side button (or the Home button on all devices but the iPhone X). In Sleep mode, your device's screen is turned off, but the phone or tablet can still connect to the Internet, receive incoming calls (iPhone) or text messages, retrieve emails, and run apps in the background. Notification Center also remains fully operational, so you can be alerted of preset alarms. Sleep mode offers a way to conserve battery life when you're not actively using your phone or tablet.

 Note
By default, your iPhone or iPad goes into Sleep mode and auto locks after 5 minutes. To adjust this time interval or turn off the Auto-Lock feature, launch Settings, tap the Display & Brightness option, and then tap the Auto-Lock feature. Your options include the ability to activate Auto-Lock after 2, 5, 10, or 15 minutes, or never.


 Tip
Another way to place any iPad into Sleep mode is to place an optional Apple Smart Cover (or compatible cover) or Apple Smart Keyboard (which doubles as a Smart Cover) over the screen (the iPad Cover Lock/Unlock option must be turned on from the General menu in Settings). In Sleep mode, an iPad "wakes up" for an incoming call (when used with iOS 11's Handoff feature), a FaceTime call, or an incoming text message.

 Airplane mode—This mode enables your device to remain fully functional, except it can't communicate in any way using a cellular (3G/4G/LTE) connection. The iPhone cannot make or receive calls, and neither the iPhone nor iPad can send or receive text/instant messages via a cellular network. Apps that do not require Internet access to function normally. So, if you're aboard an airplane, you can switch to Airplane mode and continue reading an eBook, playing a game, word processing, watching a movie that you've downloaded from the iTunes Store, or working with a wide range of other apps. After switching into Airplane mode, you can turn Wi-Fi Internet access and Bluetooth functionality back on yet keep the cellular connection turned off. This is useful if you're traveling abroad and don't want to incur international cellular roaming charges, or if you're aboard an airplane or a cruise ship that offers Wi-Fi service.

 Tip
To turn on or off Airplane mode, launch Settings, and tap the virtual switch for Airplane mode. Alternatively, launch Control Center, and then tap the Airplane mode icon.
Once the device is in Airplane mode, keep in mind that you can quickly re-enable Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, if needed, by tapping their respective icons in Control Center (see Figure 1.3).
When the iPhone or iPad is in Airplane mode (or turned off altogether) you're able to recharge its battery a bit faster, but you won't be alerted about incoming calls and text messages, for example, until the phone is taken out of Airplane mode or turned back on.

You can also place an iPhone or iPad into Do Not Disturb mode. This mode automatically routes incoming calls directly to voicemail. You can customize the Do Not Disturb feature to allow certain people to reach you when you otherwise want to be left alone.

FIGURE 1.3
Turn on/off Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth from the redesigned Control Center by tapping on the appropriate icon.

 Tip
To activate and customize the Do Not Disturb feature, launch Settings and tap the Do Not Disturb option. From the Do Not Disturb submenu, turn on the Manual or Scheduled virtual switch, based on how you want this feature set up.
To later turn on or off the feature, access Control Center and tap the crescent moon-shaped icon.
When turned on, a moon icon is displayed on the iPhone or iPad's status bar, and all calls and alerts are silenced. You can turn on or off this feature at any time, or you can schedule specific times you want Do Not Disturb to be activated, such as between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays. To do this, turn on the Scheduled feature.
If you set the Alarm Clock feature in your iPhone or iPad via the Clock app or using Siri, this feature continues to work, even with Do Not Disturb turned on.

When your iPhone is turned off, all incoming calls are forwarded directly to voicemail, and it is not possible to initiate an outgoing call. Likewise, incoming text messages, FaceTime calls, and other communications from the outside world cannot be accepted when an iPhone or iPad is turned off. Instead, when you later turn on the device, notifications for these missed messages are displayed in the Notification Center, in their respective apps, and potentially on the Lock screen, depending on how you set up Notification Center.

 What's New
It's a good idea to limit notifications your iPhone generates while you're driving, especially if your smartphone is not connected to a vehicle via CarPlay. To do this, from the Do Not Disturb submenu within Settings, tap the Activate option below the Do Not Disturb While Driving heading. You can set this feature to activate automatically when you're in a moving car, or you can opt to manually activate it from Control Center or the Do Not Disturb submenu within Settings.

Upgrading from iOS 10 to iOS 11
Anyone who purchased an iPhone or iPad before September 19, 2017 needs to upgrade to iOS 11. The easiest way to do this is to use your mobile device to access any Wi-Fi hotspot, or your wireless home network, to establish a high-speed Internet connection. Then, from the device's Home screen, launch Settings.

 Tip
Before upgrading your iOS mobile device from iOS 10 (or earlier) to iOS 11, be sure to create a backup of your iPhone or iPad using the iTunes Sync Backup feature or the iCloud Backup feature. After you install the iOS 11 operating system, all your apps, data, and personalized device settings will automatically be fully restored.

Next, tap the General option from the main Settings menu, and then tap the Software Update option. If your device is running any version of iOS 10 (or earlier), a message indicates that an operating system upgrade is available. Follow the onscreen prompts to download and install the latest version of iOS 11 for free.
The upgrade takes between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on which iPhone or iPad model you're using, its internal storage capacity, the Internet connection speed, and how much information is currently stored on your device.

 Tip
Every few months, Apple updates the iOS to add new features to your iPhone or iPad. When a free iOS update is available, a message appears on your device's screen and a Badge icon appears in the Settings app icon on your Home screen.

Interacting with Your iPhone or iPad
If you're a veteran iPhone or iPad user, you already know that Apple's iOS mobile operating system enables you to interact with your mobile device using its touchscreen. Data entry, for example, is typically done using the virtual keyboard displayed on screen when it's needed. Based on the type of information you're entering and the app you're using, the keyboard's layout adapts automatically.
When you're not using the virtual keyboard, much of your interaction with the iPhone or iPad is done through a series of taps, swipes, and other finger gestures on the Multi-Touch display.

 Note
iPad Pro users can interact with their tablets using the optional Apple Pencil ($99, www.apple.com/apple-pencil), which enables users to write or draw directly on the tablet's screen with extreme accuracy.

Using the Touchscreen
To navigate your way around iOS 11 on your iPhone or iPad, you need to learn a series of basic taps and finger gestures.

 Note
The iPhone 6s and all subsequent models offer the 3D Touch feature, which includes two touchscreen gestures called Peek and Pop.
When you're accessing the Home screen or using a growing number of compatible apps, if you press and hold your finger firmly on an icon or item, you can get a quick glimpse of what tapping or holding down your finger would reveal. Then, if you want to access that content, press a bit harder on the screen to "pop" into it.
For example, if you're using the Mail app and looking at your Inbox, which displays a listing of incoming messages, you can gently hold your finger on a message to preview it ("peek"), and then if you want to open the message and work with it, press your finger down a bit harder to "pop" it open.
This also works on the Home screen. Many apps offer quick access to the most common features of the app by pressing firmly on its icon. For example, if you hold your finger on the Camera app icon, a menu that enables you to quickly take a selfie, record a video, record a slow-mo video, or take a photo is displayed.

As you learn more about iOS 11's features throughout this book, you'll discover how to use them by executing the necessary taps, swipes, pinches, and other finger gestures.
When you turn on the device or wake it from Sleep mode, virtually all of your interaction with the smartphone or tablet is though the following finger movements and taps on the device's highly sensitive Multi-Touch display:
 Double-Tap—Used to zoom in/out in certain apps, or center the content you're viewing on the screen in some apps.
 Drag—Press and hold your finger over an icon or object, and then drag it along the screen to an different location. When using a Move button, for example, you'd use the drag gesture. On an iPad Pro, the Drag gesture is used to move selected content from one app into another app.
 Flick—Press gently on the screen and then move it left, right, up, or down, to scroll or pan.
 Five-finger pinch (iPads only)—To exit any app and return to the Home screen, place all five fingers of one hand on the screen so that they're spread out, and then draw your fingers together, as if you're grabbing something. Be sure, however, that the Multitasking Gestures are turned on in the Settings app (found under the General heading).
 Hold—Instead of a quick tap, in some cases it is necessary to press and hold your finger on an icon or onscreen command option. When a hold action is required, place your finger on the appropriate icon or command option, and hold it there with a slight pressure. There's never a need to press down hard on the smartphone or tablet's screen. (Hold works with all iOS mobile devices running iOS 11, and is different from the Peek and Pop gestures that are exclusive to the newer iPhone models).
 Pinch—Using your thumb and index finger, perform a pinch motion on the touchscreen to zoom out when using certain apps. Or "unpinch" (by moving your fingers apart quickly) to zoom in on what you're viewing on screen when using many apps.
 Pull-down—On all iPhone and iPad models, except the iPhone X, quickly swipe your finger down from the very top of the iPhone or iPad's screen. This causes the Notification Center to appear. You can hold the device in portrait or landscape mode for this to work.

 Tip
The pull-down gesture is also used to access iOS 11's enhanced Spotlight Search feature. Use a pull-down gesture that starts in the middle of the iPhone or iPad's Home screen to access the improved Spotlight Search feature.
One use of Spotlight Search is to quickly find any information that's stored in your mobile device or to perform a web search.
Enter a keyword or search phrase into the Search field, tap the Search key on the virtual keyboard, and then tap one of the search result listings to access the related data or content by automatically launching whichever app it relates to.

 Swipe—A swipe refers to quickly moving your finger along the screen from right to left, left to right, top to bottom, or bottom to top, in order to scroll left, right, up, or down, depending on which app you're using.
 Swipe Up—At any time, you can swipe your finger in an upward direction on most iPhone models (starting at the bottom of the screen) to make the redesigned Control Center appear. From here, you can access a handful of functions. On any iPad, use the swipe up gesture from the bottom of the screen to access the redesigned Dock.
 Tap—Tapping an icon, button, or link that's displayed on your device's screen serves the same purpose as clicking the mouse when you use your main computer.
 Touch and Hold—When working with text created using the virtual keyboard, press and hold your finger on the screen over a letter or word to see a magnified view and be able to manually move (reposition) the onscreen cursor.

 Tip
For iPad users, iOS 11 works with a two-finger gesture. This enables you to more accurately move the cursor around on the screen (in some apps), which is useful when editing text or highlighting text to select, copy, cut, and then paste, for example.
To move the cursor on the screen, place two fingers next to each other over the cursor or text you want to highlight and drag your fingers slowly around on the screen. The onscreen cursor follows your movement.


 Note
On all iPhone and iPad models, except the iPhone X, you're able to return to the Home screen anytime by pressing the Home button once, regardless of which app is being used.


 Tip
Apple continues to make navigating around your favorite apps with taps, finger gestures, and swipes easy. For example, on any screen where you're scrolling downward, such as when you're surfing the Web with Safari, tap the time that's displayed at the top center of the screen to quickly return to the top of that page or screen.
Meanwhile, if you're typing something on any iPhone and don't like what you typed, instead of pressing and holding the Delete key to erase your text, simply shake the smartphone in your hand for a second or two to "undo" your typing. Be sure to turn on the Shake to Undo feature by launching Settings and tapping Accessibility.


 Tip
When you're using one of the more recently released iPhone models, double-touch (use a gentle tap, as opposed to pressing) the Home button, and everything that's displayed on the screen shifts downward, so you can more easily reach it with your thumb. Plus, as you're reading emails, you can use your thumb (on the hand you're holding the iPhone with) to swipe left or right across an Inbox message listing to manage that incoming message.

Working with the Home Button
Here's how to use some of the Home button's main functions when using iOS 11 on any iPhone or iPad model (except the iPhone X):
 Activate Siri—Press down and hold the Home button for two seconds from the Home screen or when using any app.
 Access the App Switcher—From any app (or from the Home screen), quickly press the Home button twice. Press the Home button again (or select an app) to exit the App Switcher.
 Exit an app and return to the Home screen—When using any app, press the Home button once to exit it and return to the Home screen. Keep in mind that in most cases this does not shut down the app; it continues running in the background.
 Reboot the device (without deleting any of your apps or data)—On older iPhone models and on all iPads, press and hold the Home button simultaneously with the Side button for about five seconds until the Apple logo appears on the screen.

 Note
When using an iPhone 7 or iPhone 8 series phone, to reboot the device, press and hold the Side button simultaneously with the volume down button located on the side of the smartphone, as opposed to the Sleep/Wake and Home button on other iPhone and iPad devices (except the iPhone X).

 Return to the main Home screen—When viewing any of the Home screens on your mobile device, press the Home button once to return to the main Home screen.
 Wake up the device from Sleep mode—Press the Home button once when your iPhone or iPad is in Sleep mode. If the device is powered down, press and hold the Side button for several seconds instead.
Use the Touch ID that's built in to the Home button of compatible devices to unlock it, confirm a payment using Apple Pay, or when making a content purchase from the App Store, iTunes Store, iBook Store, or within a participating app. Touch ID can also be used to grant you access to certain apps that otherwise require a password, such as a banking or credit card app.

 Note
For iPhone X users, instead of using Touch ID to scan a fingerprint, the Face ID feature is used in conjunction with the phone's front-facing camera for digital face recognition.


 Tip
On the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 series that have a Touch ID sensor built into the Home button, you can customize how the button feels when you press it. To do this, launch Settings, tap the General option, and then tap the Home Button option. The 1, 2, and 3 circular icons are displayed; each represents a different feel for the Home button. Tap one at a time to experience the difference when you press the Home button, and then select the one you like best. Tap Done to save your selection.

Interacting with the iPhone X
Following are some of the new iPhone X finger gestures and uses of the Side button that have replaced the uses of the Home button:
 To access the Home screen using an iPhone X, place your finger near the bottom of the screen and swipe up.
 To utilize Multitasking mode and access the App Switcher, place your finger near the bottom of the screen and swipe up. However, instead of removing your finger from the screen at the end of the swipe, hold it in place for about a second.
 To access Control Center while using the iPhone X, place your finger near the top-right side of the screen and swipe down.
 To access Siri, either use the "Hey Siri" command, or press and hold the Side button for about two seconds.
 To quickly launch the Wallet app and access Apple Pay (to make a payment in a retail store, for example), quickly press the Side button twice, and then look at the iPhone X's screen (to utilize Face ID) and authorize the purchase.
Using the Virtual Keyboard
Whenever you need to enter data into your iPhone or iPad, you almost always use the virtual keyboard that pops up on the bottom portion of the screen when it's needed. The virtual keyboard resembles a typewriter or computer keyboard; however, certain onscreen keys have different purposes, depending on which app you're using.
When you're using an app that involves numeric data entry, such as Numbers or Excel, the layout and design of the virtual keyboard can change dramatically.

 Note
More information on how to use the updated QuickType virtual keyboard displayed on an iPad is covered within Chapter 3, "Take Advantage of iOS 11 Features for the iPad."

Use these tips to more easily work with the virtual keyboard:
 Divide the virtual keyboard in half (iPad)—Make it easier to type on the virtual keyboard with your two thumbs while holding the device. To split the keyboard (see Figure 1.4), hold down the Hide Keyboard key that's located in the lower-right corner of the virtual keyboard, and select the Split option. Alternatively, use the index fingers on your right and left hand simultaneously, place them in the center of the virtual keyboard when it's visible, and then move them apart.

FIGURE 1.4
Especially when holding an iPad in portrait mode with two hands, using the split keyboard makes it easier to type with just your two thumbs.
 Undock and move the virtual keyboard (iPad only)—Hold down the Hide Keyboard key (displayed in the lower-right corner of the keyboard) to be given the opportunity to undock or split the keyboard. Select Undock, and then while holding down the Hide Keyboard key, drag the keyboard up or down to reposition it.
 Turn on or off the keyboard's key click sound—Launch Settings, tap the Sounds option, and then turn on or off the virtual switch associated with Keyboard Clicks.
 Adjust auto-capitalization, autocorrection, check spelling, enable caps lock, predictive, split keyboard (iPad only), and the keyboard shortcuts options—Launch Settings, tap the General option, and then tap the Keyboard option to access the Keyboard menu. Turn on or off the virtual switch associated with each option.

 Tip
When using the virtual keyboard, to turn on Caps Lock, quickly double-tap the Shift key (it displays an upward-pointing arrow). Tap the key again to turn off Caps Lock.

 Make the virtual keyboard disappear—You can often tap anywhere on the screen except on the virtual keyboard itself, or you can tap the Hide Keyboard key (iPad only), which is always located in the lower-right corner of the keyboard.
 Make the virtual keyboard appear—If you need to enter data into your iPhone or iPad but the virtual keyboard doesn't appear automatically, simply tap an empty data field. An appropriately formatted virtual keyboard displays.
 Make the keys on the virtual keyboard larger—For some people, a larger keyboard makes it easier to type. Simply rotate the iPhone or iPad from portrait to landscape mode. Keep in mind that not all apps enable you to rotate the screen.
 Access emoji/symbols keyboards—Tap the Emoji (smiley face) key, located between the .?123 and microphone keys, to access alternative virtual keyboards that enable you to incorporate hundreds of different graphical emojis into your messages and documents.
 Use the keyboard with one hand on an iPhone—Adjust the virtual keyboard to make it more accessible when you want to hold and use the iPhone with one hand. Press and hold the Emoji key and from the Keyboard Settings pop-up menu, tap the keyboard icon displayed on the right or left, based on which hand you're holding your iPhone in.
Creating Keyboard Shortcuts
If there's a sentence, paragraph, or phrase you need to enter repeatedly when using an app, you can enter that text just once and save it as a keyboard shortcut. Then, instead of typing a whole sentence, you can simply type a three-letter code that you assign to that shortcut, and the virtual keyboard inserts the complete sentence.
To create your own keyboard shortcuts, follow these steps:
1. Launch Settings and tap the General option, followed by the Keyboard option.
2. From the Keyboards menu, tap the Text Replacement option.
3. When the Text Replacement window appears, press the + icon to add a new shortcut.
4. Fill in the Phrase field with the complete sentence (or any text) you want to include, such as, "I am in a meeting and will call you back later."
5. In the Shortcut field, enter a three-letter combination to use as the keyboard shortcut, such as "IAM" (representing "I am in a meeting and will call you back later").
6. Now, anytime the virtual keyboard is displayed (when using any app), simply type IAM to input the full sentence.
Using an Optional External Keyboard
If you expect to do a lot of data entry or word processing on your iOS mobile device, instead of using the virtual keyboard, purchase an optional external keyboard that connects to the smartphone or tablet using a wireless Bluetooth connection or the device's Lightning port.
The Apple Smart Keyboards ($159 or $169, depending on the model, www.apple.com/shop/ipad/ipad-accessories), are available specifically for the various iPad Pro models. These keyboards use a proprietary Smart Connector to attach the keyboard to the tablet using magnets. No pairing is required, and the keyboard is powered by the iPad Pro.

 More Info
For other iPad and iPhone models, Apple (http://store.apple.com), Belkin (www.belkin.com), Logitech (www.logitech.com), and Zagg (www.zagg.com) are a sampling of companies that offer compatible external keyboards. Some of these keyboards are built in to phone or tablet cases that also double as stands.

Using Headphones with the Newest iPhones
Starting with the iPhone 7 series, Apple removed the headphone jack from its smartphones. To compensate for this, you have five options:
 Use the iPhone's built-in speakers to play all audio.
 Invest in wireless (Bluetooth) headphones (or a Bluetooth phone headset), such as the AirPods or PowerBeats3 Wireless Earphones.
 Use the supplied Lighting to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter to plug your existing headphones (with a 3.5mm jack) into the Lighting port on the bottom of your phone.
 Acquire wired headphones with a Lightning Connector. The iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X come with wired EarPods with a Lightning Connector.
 Link your iPhone with external, wireless (Bluetooth or AirPlay-compatible) speakers, such as a HomePod.

 Note
Any wireless (Bluetooth) headphones or headphones with a Lightning Connector that you purchase for your iPhone will also work with any iPad model. As of late 2017, all current iPad models also still have a 3.5mm headphone jack built in.

Keeping it Covered
Apple, along with many independent companies, offers a vast selection of optional, custom-fitted cases and covers for each of the iPhone and iPad models. Some cases include an external keyboard, and others double as a stand for the smartphone or tablet.
Using a case or cover protects your mobile device against damage (especially while you're on the go), and also enables you to further personalize your device when you choose a case or cover design and color scheme that matches your personality and taste.
Apple's own cases and covers are available from all Apple Stores, Apple.com, and authorized Apple resellers. Third-party cases and covers can be purchased wherever smartphones and tablets are sold, as well as from Amazon.com and other online-only sellers.
Understanding Applecare+ Coverage
AppleCare+ extends the warranty of your iPhone or iPad from 90 days (which is included with each device purchase) to two years, and includes unlimited telephone and in-person technical support.
Coverage against most types of accidental damage is also included (although a deductible will apply). Loss or theft coverage is not, however, included. Repair prices for a broken iPhone or iPad can be extremely costly without AppleCare+, which can make this a good investment, particularly if you also use the free tech support option.
The cost of AppleCare+ varies according to which model iPhone or iPad you own. If you're part of the Apple Upgrade Program (www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program), AppleCare+ is included for free each time you upgrade to a new iPhone.

 Note
Some wireless service providers, along with independent insurance companies, such as Square Trade (www.squaretrade.com) and Worth Ave. Group (www.worthavegroup.com), offer their own iPhone and iPad insurance plans. Some of these plans include loss or theft coverage for the device, but do not include unlimited technical support from Apple.

2. Customize Your iPad or iPhone

In this Chapter
 Personalizing your iPhone or iPad by adjusting the options available from within Settings
 Customizing the Lock screen and Home screen
 Customizing and using Control Center
 Getting to know what's possible from the Lock screen, Dock, and App Switcher

More than ever before, users are able to customize their iPhone or iPad beyond personalizing the appearance of the Lock screen, Home screen, Dock, and Control Center. Now you can control more options within Settings that allow for greater privacy and security.
This chapter focuses on personalizing and customizing your iOS mobile device and gets you acquainted with a selection of the most popular or useful options available from within Settings, Control Center, Notification Center, Spotlight Search, and the App Switcher.

 Note
Spotlight Search enables you to quickly find any information or content stored locally within your mobile device or that you have stored within a cloud service linked with the Files app. When necessary, this search tool can also scour the Internet to find information you're looking for.
One of the ways to access Spotlight Search is from the Home screen. Place your finger near the middle of the screen and swipe down. You see the Search field at the top-center of the screen (see Figure 2.1), along with Siri App Suggestions.
If you make the appropriate adjustments in Settings, you also can access Spotlight Search by swiping to the right on the Lock screen (without first unlocking your device).
On the Spotlight Search screen (and on an iPad's Dock), iOS 11 displays a few of your most recently used apps, recommendations for apps your mobile device thinks you might want to use next, and apps you were just using on another Mac or iOS mobile device linked to the same iCloud account (when the Handoff feature is active).


FIGURE 2.1
The Spotlight Search feature is accessible from the Home screen.

 Note
Depending on which model iPhone or iPad you're using, the options available from the main Settings menu (and all submenus within Settings) vary. If you read in this book about an option that's not listed in the Settings menu or a Settings submenu on your own devices, it typically means that feature isn't available on the model iPhone or iPad you're using.

One of the first things you should do when you begin working with a new iPhone or iPad is to launch Settings and invest the time necessary to manually review and customize each of the available options. Once you make changes within Settings, they remain saved and active until you manually alter them.

 Note
If apps you install enable you to customize specific features within the app, those customization options often are available to you from within Settings.


 Note
To customize iCloud-related functions, including Family Sharing and iCloud Drive, launch Settings, tap your profile photo/username, and then tap the iCloud option to reveal the iCloud Control Panel.
More about using iCloud with your iOS mobile device is covered in Chapter 7, "Use iCloud and the Files App."

Using the Settings App
You launch Settings by tapping the Settings app icon on the Home screen. The main Settings menu is displayed (see Figure 2.2). In most cases, you need to tap one of the displayed options to reveal a submenu related to a specific iOS 11 feature, function, or app. The menus and submenus are displayed in a hierarchical structure.

FIGURE 2.2
To launch Settings, tap the Settings icon from the iPhone or iPad's Home screen.

 Tip
To quickly find a feature or function you want to adjust while in Settings, use the Search field that's displayed at the top of the main Settings menu. If the Search field isn't visible, place your finger anywhere on the main Settings menu and swipe down.
Type a keyword associated with the feature or function you're looking for, such as Wallpaper, Handoff, or Low Power Mode.


 Tip
When a Settings option's virtual switch is positioned to the right and you see green (see Figure 2.3), that option is turned on. When the switch is positioned to the left, it's turned off. Tap the switch to toggle its setting on and off.
When a right-pointing arrow (>) is displayed to the right of an option, that feature has a submenu; tap the right-pointing arrow or its listing to open the submenu.


FIGURE 2.3
To turn on a feature, the switch should be positioned to the right and green should be showing.
As you work your way deeper into each submenu, a left-pointing arrow (<) icon appears near the upper-left corner of each submenu screen. It enables you to exit out of each Settings submenu and move a step back toward the main Settings menu. If you've made adjustments, those changes are automatically saved when you exit out of the menu or submenu within Settings. If you exit out of a menu or submenu without making any changes, nothing is altered.
On all iPhone and iPad models, except for the iPhone X, press the Home button once to exit out of Settings entirely (and, if applicable, save your changes). If you're using an iPhone X, use a single swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access the Home screen from anywhere.
The following sections describe the most commonly used options available from the Settings main menu. Remember, these options vary slightly, based on which model iPhone or iPad you're using and the hardware configuration of that device.

 Tip
To access anything having to do with your Apple ID and iCloud, from the main Settings menu, tap your profile photo/username to reveal the Apple ID submenu. From here, tap iCloud to access the iCloud Control Panel and manage all things having to do with using iCloud in conjunction with the iPhone or iPad you're currently using. Read more information about using iCloud in Chapter 7.

Airplane Mode
This feature applies to all iPhones and iPads. The Airplane mode option has no submenu; it simply offers one virtual on/off switch. When Airplane mode is turned on, a small airplane icon appears in the upper-left corner of the screen.

 Note
Airplane mode shuts down your iPhone or iPad's ability to communicate in any way (wirelessly) with other devices, a cellular network, or the Internet. Once in Airplane mode, you can then turn Wi-Fi or Bluetooth back on manually, while keeping cellular connectivity turned off.

After your device is placed into Airplane mode, you can still turn on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth after the fact, enabling the iOS device to access the Web via a Wi-Fi hotspot (to use the wireless web access available on some commercial aircrafts, for example), and also communicate with a Bluetooth-enabled wireless keyboard, external speaker(s), wireless headphones, a printer, or phone headset.

 Tip
When you turn on Airplane mode, the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth features of your iPhone or iPad get turned off automatically. You can, however, turn them back on manually while still in Airplane mode. Do this from within Settings or Control Center.

Wi-Fi
When you tap this option, a submenu containing a virtual on/off switch is displayed. When it's turned on, a listing of available Wi-Fi networks (hotspots) is displayed directly below the Choose a Network heading.

 Tip
When you're reviewing a list of available Wi-Fi networks, look to the right side of each listing for a lock icon. This indicates that the Wi-Fi hotspot is password protected. Tap a hotspot that does not display a lock icon, unless you possess the password for that network.
Also on the right side of each listing is the signal strength of each Wi-Fi hotspot in your immediate area. When given the option, choose a network with the strongest signal for the fastest web-surfing experience.

To choose any Wi-Fi hotspot listed, tap its listing. In a few seconds, a check mark appears to the left of your selected Wi-Fi hotspot and a Wi-Fi signal indicator appears in the upper-left corner of your device's screen, indicating that a Wi-Fi connection has been established.
If you select a Wi-Fi network that is password protected, you will see an Enter Password window the first time you tap that network. Using the device's virtual keyboard, enter the correct password to connect to the network you selected. You will often have to do this when connecting to a public Wi-Fi hotspot offered in a hotel or at a private business, for example.

 Tip
If you leave the Wi-Fi option turned on, your iPhone or iPad can automatically find and connect to an available Wi-Fi hotspot based on whether you have the Ask to Join Networks option turned on or off. When the Ask to Join Networks feature is turned off, your iPhone or iPad reconnects automatically to wireless networks and Wi-Fi hotspots that you have connected to previously, such as each time you return to your home or office.


 Note
If you attempt to access a public Wi-Fi hotspot—in an airport, library, or school, for example—you might be required to accept terms of a user agreement before Internet access is granted. In this case, your iOS device says it's connected to a Wi-Fi hotspot, but until you launch Safari and accept the user agreement terms, your other apps, including Mail, aren't able to access the Internet.


 Caution
The main drawback to using a Wi-Fi connection is that a Wi-Fi hotspot must be present, and you must stay within the signal radius of that hotspot to remain connected to the Internet. The signal of most Wi-Fi hotspots extends for only several hundred feet from the wireless access point (the Internet router). When you go beyond this signal radius, your Internet connection is lost.
For example, if you want to fully utilize the Maps app for real-time, turn-by-turn navigation directions, you must have a cellular data connection. If you try using this feature with a Wi-Fi connection, as soon as you move out of the signal's radius, the Internet connection is dropped and your mobile device can't pinpoint your location or gather related information from the Internet.

Bluetooth
Turn on Bluetooth functionality to use compatible Bluetooth devices, such as an Apple Watch, HomePod, AirPods, any wireless headset (or headphones), an external keyboard (unless it's an Apple Smart Keyboard), some printers, or wireless speakers.
In Settings, tap Bluetooth, and then turn on the virtual switch in the submenu. The first time you use a particular Bluetooth device with your iOS mobile device, you will probably need to pair it. Follow the directions that came with the device or accessory to perform this initial setup task. Some Bluetooth devices, like AirPods, automatically pair with your iOS device. The pairing process should take less than 15 seconds.
After you've paired a device, as long as it's turned on and in close proximity to your iOS device, and the iOS device has the Bluetooth feature turned on, the two devices automatically establish a wireless connection and work together.

 Tip
If you're using your iPhone or iPad without having a Bluetooth device connected, and you do not want to use the Handoff feature built in to iOS 11, turn off the Bluetooth feature. This helps extend the battery life of your iOS device.

Cellular
The Cellular submenu includes several settings you can control. When Cellular Data is turned on, your iOS mobile device can access the 3G/4G/LTE cellular data network from the cellular service provider to which you're subscribed. When this option is turned off, your device can access the Internet only via a Wi-Fi connection, assuming that a Wi-Fi hotspot is present.
Tap the Cellular Data Options listing to turn on or off cellular data roaming. When turned on, Data Roaming enables your iPhone or iPad to connect to a cellular network outside the one you subscribe to through your wireless service provider. The capability to tap in to another wireless data network might be useful if you must connect to the Internet, there's no Wi-Fi hotspot present, and you're outside your own service provider's coverage area (such as when you're traveling abroad).

 Caution
When your iPhone or iPad is permitted to roam (the Data Roaming option is turned on), you will incur hefty roaming charges, often as high as $20 per megabyte (MB). Refrain from using this feature unless you've purchased a cellular data roaming plan through your service provider, or be prepared to pay a fortune to access the Web.

Depending on your service provider, you might be able to transform your iOS device into a personal hotspot so other devices can connect wirelessly to the Internet via Wi-Fi using your iPhone or iPad's cellular data connection. If your provider allows, this option is available from the Cellular submenu of Settings. Tap the Personal Hotspot option, turn it on, and then set up a Wi-Fi password.

 Note
Scroll down within the Cellular submenu within Settings to determine which apps can access your iPhone or iPad's cellular data connection (as opposed to using only Wi-Fi to access the Internet). When an app listing's virtual switch is turned on, that app can use a cellular data connection. When it's turned off, that app must rely exclusively on Wi-Fi Internet connectivity when it's available.

Notifications
From the Notifications submenu in Settings (see Figure 2.4), you're able to determine which apps function with Notification Center, and you can determine the other ways in which apps that generate alerts, alarms, or notifications notify you. This applies to preinstalled apps as well as most other apps you install from the App Store.

FIGURE 2.4
All apps that are capable of exchanging data with Notification Center are listed under the heading Notification Style.

 Note
Widgets are associated with certain specific apps that get displayed in Notification Center and on the Today screen (see Figure 2.5). When you use an app's widget, you can quickly manage or handle tasks associated with that app without manually launching the app. When looking at the Today screen, scroll down and tap the Edit button to set up and configure available widgets. Not all apps have widgets associated with them.


FIGURE 2.5
Widgets give you quick access to app-specific functions and information from the Today screen, which is accessible from the Lock screen or Notification Center.
When you tap the Notifications option in Settings, a listing of all apps capable of generating alerts, alarms, and notifications is displayed below the Notification Style heading. Tap each item to customize notifications for that app (see Figure 2.6).
Later, as you install additional apps onto your device from the App Store, return to this menu to adjust Notifications related to those apps as well.

FIGURE 2.6
Customize how each compatible app will get your attention using alerts, alarms, or notifications.

 Tip
When you tap an app in the Notification Style list, the first option is labeled Allow Notifications. When turned on, this app shares information with Notification Center. When turned off, no alerts, alarms, or notifications will be generated by that app.

The following list describes the different types of notification options:
 Sounds—Determines whether the app will be able to generate audible alerts or alarms to get your attention. When turned off, the selected app remains silent but can generate on-screen notifications (if you enable those settings).
 Badge App Icon—For compatible apps, when a new alert or notification is generated, a number displays on the app icon on the Home screen. For example, when used with the Mail or Messages app, the Badge App Icon displays the number of new, unread messages you've received.

 Note
A badge is a small red-and-white circle in the upper-right corner of an app icon on your device's Home screen. The badge contains a number that shows you that something relating to a specific app has changed. For example, a badge appears on the App Store app icon when one of more of your apps requires an update.

 Show on Lock Screen—Notifications generated by the app are displayed on the Lock screen as well as within the Notification Center. This allows anyone who happens to look at your screen to see notifications, such as the first few lines of an incoming email or text message, or Caller ID information for an incoming call.
 Show in History—Notifications from compatible apps are listed on screens that show your history of using the iPhone or iPad.
 Show as Banners—Notifications are displayed as one of two types of banners: Temporary and Persistent. When you choose Temporary, the app displays a banner at the top of the screen for each new alert or notification, but the banner automatically disappears after a few seconds. When you choose Persistent, the banner remains on the screen until you manually swipe it away with your finger.
 Show Previews—A preview of the message or notification is displayed, such as the first few lines of an incoming email or text message.
Some apps have additional notification options. For example, the Calendar submenu under Notifications (see Figure 2.7) displays a submenu that enables you to separately customize alerts, alarms, and notifications related to Upcoming Events, Invitations, Invitee Responses, Shared Calendar Changes, and Siri Found in Apps. The submenu that appears for each of these options (see Figure 2.8) enables you to determine where related notifications are displayed, and which alert style should be used.

 Note
The Siri Found in Apps option allows you to use voice commands to find content stored within an app. For example, you can ask Siri, "What time is my next meeting?" or "Where is my next meeting?" and Siri accesses the Calendar app to find this information, assuming you've granted Siri access to the Calendar app.


FIGURE 2.7
Depending on the app, there can be several levels of submenus that enable you to customize how each app exchanges information with Notification Center.

FIGURE 2.8
iOS 11 options give you control over what information is displayed by Notification Center, plus you can choose how, when, and where that information is displayed.

 Tip
Use these quick tips to manage the Notification Center:
 Avoid getting bombarded by excessive notifications from apps that aren't too important to you by manually setting Notification Center to work only with apps that you deem important. Turn off notifications for all other apps.
 At the very bottom of the Notification Center settings submenu on the iPhone are two features: AMBER alerts and Emergency Alerts. When turned on, if the government issues an AMBER alert in your area or a message is broadcast over the Emergency Broadcast System, an alert appears on your device.
 To protect your privacy, consider setting up Notification Center to refrain from having alerts displayed on your Lock screen. To do this, tap each app under the Notifications Style heading, and turn off the Show on Lock Screen option.
 The options for available notifications vary by app. For example, for the Messages app, you can assign Notification Center to display message previews on the Lock or Home screens, plus repeat alerts between 0 and 10 times at 2-minute intervals to get your attention.

Control Center
The redesigned Control Center (shown on an iPhone in Figure 2.9) grants you quick access to a handful of smartphone- or tablet-related functions and apps. For the first time, you can customize Control Center to display app icons and give you quick access to apps and iOS 11 features/functions you use most often.
To display Control Center, no matter what you're doing on any iPhone (except for the iPhone X), place your finger near the very bottom of the screen and swipe up.
On the iPad, quickly press the Home button twice to make the Control Center and App Switcher appear. If you're using the iPhone X, access the Control Center by placing your finger near the top-right corner of the display and swiping down.
From within Settings, however, tap the Control Center option, and then tap Customize Controls to determine which iOS 11 features/functions and which app icons will be displayed within the Control Center (see Figure 2.10).

FIGURE 2.9
The redesigned Control Center gives you quick access to a bunch of commonly used features and functions.

FIGURE 2.10
Use Settings to customize what functions and apps are accessible from the Control Center.
The app icons and iOS 11 features/functions that will be displayed as part of Control Center are displayed below the Include heading. To remove any of these options, tap on the - icon for a listing.
To add a function or app icon to the Control Center, look below the More Controls heading and tap the + icon associated with a specific listing.
Once you've added all of the functions and app icons you desire to the Control Center, use the Move icons (the three lines) to rearrange the order in which the tools and app icons are displayed within Control Center.
Do not Disturb
The Do Not Disturb feature, which is discussed in Chapter 1, "Discover iOS 11 and the Newest iPads and iPhones," enables you to temporarily turn off your iPhone or iPad's capability to notify you about incoming calls, text messages, and app-specific alerts, alarms, or notifications when the device is in Sleep mode (locked) or while the device is being used. Read Chapter 1 for more information.
General
When you tap the General option in Settings, various additional options become available. For example, from here you can access the Software Update feature to update your iOS whenever Apple releases an update. You also can customize options related to AirDrop, Handoff, CarPlay, and how the Home button is used (on all devices except for the iPhone X). This submenu also provides access to your iPhone or iPad's Accessibility options, iPhone/iPad Storage options, the Restrictions feature, and time/date, keyboard, and language options (refer to Figure 2.2).

 What's New
The Offload Unused Apps option allows your iPhone/iPad to automatically delete apps from your device that you never use, which frees up internal storage space. When this feature is turned on, any app-specific data, documents, or files remain saved.
To turn on this feature, launch Settings, tap General, tap iPhone/iPad Storage, and then tap Offload Unused Apps . The first time you do this, you see a message indicating how much internal storage space can be saved by removing unused apps (see Figure 2.11).
You can always reinstall an app from the App Store, if and when you decide to use it.


FIGURE 2.11
Use the Offload Unused Apps feature to free up internal storage space within your iPhone or iPad.

 Note
A growing number of popular car manufacturers are making their vehicles compatible with the iPhone via the CarPlay feature. Only turn on this feature if you drive a car that's compatible with it. For privacy reasons, do not use CarPlay in conjunction with a rental car or someone else's vehicle.
When your iPhone is linked with your vehicle, you can activate Siri, control the Music app, or access other apps while driving simply by pressing the Siri button on your steering wheel or tapping various options displayed on your vehicle's infotainment center screen.
Every car manufacturer interacts with CarPlay differently, so check the owner's manual for your car to determine what's possible. Tap the CarPlay option under the General menu in Settings to customize the feature and link your iPhone with your vehicle, if applicable.


 Note
The Accessibility menu option displayed under the General menu of Settings gives you access to an extensive list of customization options that are designed for people with vision, hearing, or physical limitations.

Every so often, you might run into a problem with your iPhone or iPad that results in a system crash or the need to reset specific settings. For example, to restore your iPhone or iPad to its factory default settings and erase everything stored within it, tap the Reset option, tap the Erase All Content and Settings option, and then follow the on-screen prompts.

 Tip
In general, you should refrain from using any of the Reset setting unless you're instructed to do so by an Apple Genius or a technical support person. If you upgrade to a new iOS mobile device and want to return your old device to factory settings and erase all of your data and content so you can safely give away or sell the device, use the Erase All Content and Settings option in the Reset submenu of Settings.


 Caution
Before using any of the options found under the Settings Reset option, which could potentially erase important data from your iPhone or iPad, be sure to perform a manual iCloud backup or iTunes sync and create a reliable backup of your device's contents.

Display & Brightness
The Display & Brightness options enable you to control the brightness of your iPhone or iPad's screen, plus customize the default text size and type style. In general, you should leave the virtual switch for the Auto-Brightness feature turned on and then use the Brightness slider only when you manually need to adjust the screen to accommodate a specific lighting situation.

 Tip
From the Display & Brightness submenu in Settings, you can activate and customize the Night Shift screen viewing feature. When turned on, this feature adjusts the onscreen colors and brightness that are displayed to make viewing the screen less strenuous on your eyes when you're using the iPhone or iPad at night or in a low-light area.
If you often use your iPhone or iPad at night, while lying in bed before you go to sleep, for example, be sure to turn on the Night Shift feature.
The customization options offered within Settings enable you to auto-schedule the Night Shift feature to turn on at sunset and turn off at sunrise. Alternatively, you can set the specific times this feature automatically turns on and off by tapping the Night Shift listing to access the Night Shift submenu. From the Night Shift submenu, use the Color Temperature slider to manually adjust the warmth of the color palette used when the feature is turned on.

Wallpaper
You can choose a custom graphic to be used as the wallpaper behind your device's Lock and Home screen. Tap Wallpaper to adjust this.

 Note
Your iPhone or iPad has more than two dozen preinstalled wallpaper designs built in, plus you can use any digital images stored in the Photos app as your Lock screen or Home screen wallpaper. Figure 2.12 shows the Choose (Wallpaper) submenu.


FIGURE 2.12
Tap the Choose a New Wallpaper option to select a new graphic or photo to be used behind your Lock or Home screen as a wallpaper.
To change the wallpaper, tap Choose a New Wallpaper. Tap the Dynamic, Stills, or Live thumbnail to reveal iOS 11's built-in Wallpaper options, or select a photo from an album that's listed under the Photos heading.

 Tip
Live wallpapers (available for the latest iPhone models only) animate when you place your finger on them as they're being displayed in the Lock or Home screen. They work better on the Lock screen where they're not covered with app icons.

If you choose a preinstalled graphic, follow the on-screen prompts to select and save your options for the Lock or Home screens.
If you prefer, you can use a picture that's in your Photos app. To select one of your own photos to use as your Lock screen or Home screen wallpaper, tap the Wallpaper option in Settings and then tap Choose a New Wallpaper. Next, tap an album thumbnail to reveal images stored within the Photos app.
Tap the thumbnail that represents the image you want to use as your wallpaper. On the preview screen, use your finger to move the image around on the screen and to zoom in or out. (The Perspective Zoom On/Off option is displayed in the lower-right corner of the preview screen to let you know whether you can adjust the zoom on the photo.)
Tap the Set option to save your selection. Figure 2.13 shows a custom Lock screen on an iPhone, and Figure 2.14 shows a custom Home screen on an iPad.

FIGURE 2.13

FIGURE 2.14
A still wallpaper selected from within Settings is displayed as the Home screen wallpaper behind the app icons (shown here on an iPad).

 Caution
If the image you opt to use is not sized appropriately for both the portrait and landscape aspect ratio on the iOS mobile device's screen, the image can appear distorted or not fill the entire screen when you rotate your device.

Sounds
Tap this option to adjust the overall volume of the iPhone or iPad's built-in speaker (or the volume of the audio you hear through headphones), as well as to turn on or off various audible tones and alarms your phone or tablet generates.
From this menu, you can assign specific audio tones, sounds, or ringtones to specific types of app-specific alerts and alarms. You also can turn on or off the click noise associated with pressing keys on the iPhone or iPad's virtual keyboard.
Turn on the Vibrate mode so that the iPhone handset shakes instead of or in addition to playing a ringtone. You can control the ringer volume using an onscreen slider and adjust the custom ringtones and audio alerts associated with various features and functions of your iPhone. Your device has a built-in library of different alerts and ringtones, plus you can download additional ringtones from the iTunes Store.

 Tip
Manually adjust the ringer and speaker volume using the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons located on the left side of your iPhone or iPad. Alternatively, you can use the volume controls in the Control Center. Some apps, like Music and TV, also display an in-app volume control slider.

Siri & Search
The Siri feature enables you to communicate with and issue commands to your iPhone or iPad using your voice. From the Siri submenu in Settings (see Figure 2.15), you can fully customize this feature.

FIGURE 2.15
Customize Siri functionality from the Siri submenu in Settings.
On many newer iPhone and iPad models, Siri can always be waiting for you to say, "Hey Siri," from anywhere nearby to activate the Siri feature and then issue a spoken command. Otherwise, it's necessary to press and hold the Home button for about two seconds to activate Siri.
From the Siri submenu within Settings, select the primary language Siri understands, choose between giving Siri a male or female voice, and select Siri's accent—American, Australian, or British. You can also determine which apps Siri has access to when providing you with information or responses to your queries.

 Note
To learn more about how to use Siri, see Chapter 4, "Say It and Make It So Using Siri."

Touch Id (or Face Id) & Passcode
You need to manually enter your iPhone or iPad's passcode to access this submenu (see Figure 2.16). Determine whether your device's Touch ID (Home button sensor) can be used to identify your fingerprint to unlock the device or approve online purchases. Plus, turn on the Apple Pay option to activate Apple Pay on compatible devices. Tap Add a Fingerprint to securely scan and store your fingerprint(s). These fingerprint scans cannot be accessed by Apple or third parties.
Scroll down on the Touch ID & Passcode submenu to access options that enable you to decide which features, if any, will be accessible from the Lock screen (while the device is still locked).
For an added layer of protection against someone hacking into your iPhone or iPad, turn on the virtual switch associated with Erase Data. When turned on, if someone enters the wrong passcode 10 times in a row, the device automatically erases itself. As the device's primary user, you can later restore the device from an iCloud Backup or iTunes Sync Backup once you recover it.

 What's New
If you're using an iPhone X, when you tap Face ID & Passcode from the Settings menu, you're granted access to a variety of features for activating and customizing the smartphone's face recognition feature.


 Note
Older iOS mobile devices not equipped with Touch ID or Face ID simply have a Passcode option available to them in Settings.


FIGURE 2.16
Customize how the Touch ID sensor will be used on your iPhone or iPad.
Battery
This submenu enables you to display the battery life percentage remaining on your device in the top-right corner of the screen in addition to the Battery Status Bar. From the Battery submenu within Settings, you can also see how individual apps that are running on your iPhone or iPad are affecting the device's overall battery life. Tap the Last 24 Hours or Last 7 Days tab, and then view the apps listed below the Battery Usage heading if you're wondering why your iPhone or iPad's battery is draining too quickly. You can extend battery life by shutting down specific apps and keeping them from running in the background when you're not using them.
Privacy
This menu option in Settings gives you privacy control in terms of how information is shared between apps and shared with other people. See Chapter 16, "iOS and Apple Pay Security and Privacy Strategies," for more information about how to best use these tools to protect your privacy and security when using your iPhone or iPad.
iTunes & App Store
Choose which Apple ID account you want to associate with the iPhone or iPad you're using, and manage that account by tapping the Apple ID option displayed near the top of this menu.
From below the Automatic Downloads heading, determine whether the device you're using will automatically download content acquired from other computers or mobile devices that are linked to the same iCloud (Apple ID) account. This relates to Music, Apps, Books/Audiobooks, and App Updates acquired from the iTunes Store, iBook Store, and App Store.
Wallet & Apple Pay
If you're using one of the more current iPhone or iPad models that has a Touch ID sensor built in to the Home screen (or an iPhone X with Face ID), use the options available from the Wallet & Apple Pay submenu to set up the Apple Pay feature and the Wallet app (on the iPhone).
This process involves linking one or more of your credit or debit cards to Apple Pay so that you can authorize purchases when you're shopping at retail stores, shopping on the iTunes Store, shopping on compatible websites, or making purchases through certain third-party apps.

 Note
See Chapter 16 for more information on using Apple Pay with your iPhone and iPad to make secure payments online or at a participating retail store or restaurant.


 What's New
Starting in early 2018, Apple Pay will allow users to instantly send or receive cash from other Apple Pay users via the Messages app.


 Tip
On compatible iPhones, to speed up making payments using Apple Pay in stores, turn on the Double-Click Home Button option. Then from the Lock screen, quickly press the Home button twice to launch the Wallet app and select the stored debit or credit card with which you want to pay. When this option is turned off, you must manually launch the Wallet app from the Home screen.
If you're using an iPhone X, to quickly activate the Wallet app to make an Apple Pay payment, press the side button twice.

From under the Transaction Defaults heading, choose a default debit or credit card to use with Apple Pay transactions, plus store your default shipping address, email, and phone number. This speeds up the checkout process.
Accounts & Passwords
Access this submenu within Settings to manage each of your email and cloud accounts that are linked with the mobile device you're using. This includes schedule information that you maintain using a compatible cloud-based application, such as Outlook.com, that can be set up to sync with the Calendar app.
App-Specific Customization
Many of the apps that come preinstalled with iOS 11 allow you to customize features/functions from within Settings. Tap the specific listing for Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Notes, Reminders, Messages, FaceTime, Maps, Safari, News, Home, Music, TV, Photos, Camera, iBooks and Game Center to access a Settings submenu for that specific app.
In subsequent chapters of this book that focus on specific apps, customizing those apps from within Settings is covered in greater detail.

 What's New
If you're a paying cable TV or satellite TV subscriber, from the main Settings menu, tap the TV provider option and select your cable TV or satellite TV provider. You'll be asked to provide your log-in information for your existing cable TV or satellite TV account.
Once you provide this information, your iPhone or iPad will be able to log you into compatible TV network apps so you have full access to programming you're entitled to as a subscriber.
For example, you'll be able to automatically log into the HBO GO app to access on-demand HBO programming if you're already a paid HBO subscriber.

User-Installed Apps
Other individual apps that you have installed on your iPhone or iPad and that have user-adjustable options or settings available are listed at the bottom of the Settings menu. Tap one app listing at a time to modify these settings.
Working with Control Center
Regardless of what you're doing on your iPhone or iPad, you can access Control Center to have quick access to popular iOS 11 features and functions, as well as some of the most commonly used apps. Some of the default options available from Control Center include the following:
 Airplane Mode—Quickly turn on/off Airplane mode on your iPhone or iPad by tapping on this icon.
 Wi-Fi—Turn Wi-Fi on or off with a single tap, without having to access Settings.
 Bluetooth—Turn Bluetooth on or off so that your iPhone or iPad can link to Bluetooth devices it has already been paired with.
 Do Not Disturb—Manually turn on/off the Do Not Disturb feature after you've customized this option in Settings.
 Rotation Lock—Normally, when you rotate your iPhone or iPad sideways, the screen automatically switches from portrait to landscape mode. To prevent this from happening when the phone or tablet is rotated, turn on the Rotation Lock feature by tapping on its icon.

 Caution
With some apps, having the Rotation Lock turned on could prevent you from accessing certain app-specific features or views. For example, turning on Rotation Lock prevents you from using the Week view in the Calendar app on an iPhone.

 Flashlight—Use the rear-facing camera flash on the back of your iPhone or iPad Pro as a flashlight. Turn it on or off by tapping the flashlight icon.
 Music Controls—Tap the Play/Pause, Fast Forward, or Rewind icon to control the currently playing music (via the Music app or another compatible app). When applicable, the song's title and artist is displayed in conjunction with the music controls.
 Volume Control—Adjust the volume control for your iPhone or iPad's built-in speakers or the headphones or speakers linked to your mobile device.
 Screen Brightness—Manually adjust the screen's brightness using this slider.
 Camera—Launch the Camera app.
 Home App Controls—If you have your iPhone or iPad set up to wirelessly control "smart" devices in your home—such as lighting, the thermostat, or appliances—and the "smart" devices are HomeKit compatible, you're able to control multiple "smart" devices from the Home app. Press the Home app icon within Control Center to access the Home app's widget, which offers one-touch shortcuts for managing "smart" equipment.

 What's New
From the Control Center submenu within Settings, you're able to choose some of the iOS 11 features and app icons that appear in Control Center. Additional options you can add include: Alarm, Magnifier, Notes, Stopwatch, and Text Size.
On an iPhone, you're also able to add an icon for controlling Low Power Mode, which reduces iPhone battery power consumption when the battery is running low, allowing you to use the iPhone a bit longer before recharging it.
Voice Memos (an audio recording app) and the new Do Not Disturb While Driving feature—which prevents you from using your iPhone for particularly dangerous tasks, such as texting, while you're driving a car—are also options that can be added to the Control Center.

Organizing Apps in Folders
If you're like most iPhone and iPad users, you'll probably be loading a handful of third-party apps on your device. After all, there are well over two million third-party apps to choose from. To make it easier to find your apps on the iPhone or iPad's Home screen, and to reduce onscreen clutter, you can group app icons together into folders.
From the Home screen, tap and hold down any app icon until all the app icons begin shaking. Drag one app icon on top of another to automatically place both of those apps in a new folder.
You can organize your apps in folders based on categories, like Travel (see Figure 2.17), Games, or Productivity, or you can enter your own folder names and drag and drop the additional app icons into the folders you create. After your app icons are organized, simply press the Home button (on all iOS devices, except for the iPhone X) to save your folders and display them on your Home screen. On an iPhone X, to return to the Home screen, from the bottom of the screen, swipe up.

FIGURE 2.17
On this iPhone, a Travel folder has been created.
To open a folder, tap its icon. Tap any of the contained app icons to launch one of the apps. Figure 2.18 shows a Travel folder that contains a bunch of popular travel-related apps, which have been grouped to make them more accessible.

 Note
You can create as many separate folders as you want to be displayed on your Home screens, plus there is no limit to how many apps you can place into each folder.


FIGURE 2.18
This Travel folder was created to organize the travel-related apps currently installed on this iPhone. Using folders helps to eliminate clutter on your Home screen.
If you later want to remove an app icon from a folder so that it appears as a standalone app icon on your Home screen, simply press and hold any of the folder icons until all the onscreen icons start to shake. The folder's contents are displayed.
While the app icons are shaking, simply drag the app icons, one at a time, back onto the Home screen. Each is then removed from the folder. Press the Home button to finalize this action. (On an iPhone X, from the bottom of the screen, swipe up.)
Moving App Icons Around on the Home Screen
To move app icons around and reorganize them on the Home screen, press and hold down any app icon with your finger. When the app icons start to shake, use your finger to drag one app icon at a time around on the Home screen.
Your iPhone or iPad can extend the Home screen across multiple pages. (Switch pages by swiping your finger from left to right, or right to left when viewing the Home screen.)
To move an app icon to another Home screen page, while the icon is shaking, hold it down with your finger and slowly drag it to the extreme right or left, off the screen, so that it bounces onto another of the Home screen's pages.
The Dock is a customizable selection of app icons that is present on each of the Home screens. On an iPhone, you see the Dock along the bottom of the Home screen. On an iPad, the Dock is displayed on the Home screen, but you can access it anytime by placing your finger near the bottom of the screen and swiping up. Chapter 3, "Take Advantage of iOS 11 Features for the iPad," explains how to choose which app icons appear on the left side of the Dock.

 Tip
On an iPad, the right side of the Dock holds app icons for the most recently used apps. If you have the Handoff feature enabled, the icon for an app you were using on another iOS mobile device or Mac linked to the same iCloud account is in that area of the Dock, so you can pick up your work on the device you're using from where you left off on the other computer or mobile device.


 Note
From the Dock, you're also able to launch the iPad's Multitasking mode, so two apps are displayed on the screen at once. Read Chapter 3 for more information about Multitasking mode.

When you switch pages, the icons displayed on the Dock remain constant. Place your most frequently used apps in the Dock, so that they're always visible from the Home screen.
As the app icons are shaking on the Home screen, press the black-and-white X in the upper-left corner of an app icon to delete it from your iPhone or iPad.

 Note
You're able to manually delete most of the apps that come preinstalled on the iPhone and iPad, which means you can delete preinstalled apps that you opt not to use. (You can always reinstall deleted apps later.) However, certain apps, like Photos, Camera, Clock (iPhone), App Store, Settings, Wallet, Phone (iPhone), Safari, Messages, and Health (iPhone) can't be deleted (but you can move them around or place them in folders).

Discovering What's Possible from the Lock Screen
The Lock screen automatically displays the current time and date, along with the wallpaper of your choice. You can also set it up so app-specific alerts or banners are displayed on the Lock screen when applicable, plus you can decide whether you want the ability to access Control Center directly from the Lock screen.
Controlling what information can be displayed on the Lock screen, which makes it potentially viewable by anyone without requiring they unlock the phone, is one of the ways you're able to protect your privacy. From within Settings, you can opt to turn off most functionality that displays app-specific Notifications content on the Lock screen, as well as block access to the Today screen (which includes the Spotlight Search field), and the ability to access Control Center, without first unlocking the device.
While viewing the Lock screen, swipe to the left to access the Today screen, which is virtually identical to the Today screen accessible from Notification Center.
This Today screen displays information you configure from within Settings, such as the local weather forecast for your current location or your upcoming appointments (scheduled using the Calendar app). You can also customize it to display a list of recently used apps, news headlines, information about upcoming destinations that use the Maps app, battery details, and access to app-specific widgets.
To choose which app-specific widgets are displayed, scroll down on the Today screen, and tap the Edit button. After unlocking the device, you see the Add Widgets screen, which has a list of available widgets.
Currently activated widgets are listed first. To deactivate any of them, tap the - icon to the left of the listing. To change the display order of the widgets, place your finger on a widget listing's Move icon (the three lines) and drag it up or down.
Scroll down on the Add Widgets screen to view a list of available widgets that are not yet active. They're displayed under the More Widgets heading. Tap the + icon associated with any of these widgets to activate it.
Tap Done to save your changes. You can also control the information displayed on the Lock screen from within Settings. To do this, launch Settings, tap the Touch ID & Passcode option (or the Passcode option on older devices), enter your passcode, and then scroll down to the Allow Access When Locked option. Turn on the virtual switches associated with the options you want to have accessible from the Lock screen (refer to Figure 2.16).
Managing Your Customized Notification Center Screen
Access iOS 11's Notification Center window/screen from the iPhone or iPad at any time by placing your finger anywhere near the top of the screen and swiping down. (If you're an iPhone X user, swipe down from the top-center of the display.)

 Note
Notification Center displays all alerts, alarms, and notifications generated by your device in one place.

The information displayed in Notification Center is divided into two screens, which you can scroll between by swiping from right to left or from left to right. The first Notification Center screen (also known as the Today screen) is shown in Figure 2.19. It displays a Search field at the top. From here, you can locate any information stored in your device or perform an Internet search.
The date and time is also displayed. Scroll down and tap the Edit icon at the bottom of the screen to customize what information is displayed, such as a weather forecast, stock information, upcoming Calendar events, upcoming reminders, or app-specific widgets.
The secondary Notification Center screen displays alerts, alarms, and notifications generated by your mobile device, and the apps you have set up to work with Notification Center. It's important to customize what information is displayed on this screen by launching Settings, and then tapping the Notifications option.
From the Notifications menu in Settings, tap each app listing to determine which apps will display content within Notification Center.

FIGURE 2.19
The Today screen of the Notification Center is customizable and can display a weather forecast, as well as content from other apps or app widgets.
Any listing for an alert, alarm, or notification is interactive. You can tap or swipe the listing to launch the appropriate app and gain immediate access to the information that's related to what you're being alerted about.
All alerts, alarms, and notifications are displayed in chronological order, with the newest information displayed first.
To clear all notifications from Notification Center, tap the small X icon displayed to the right of the Earlier Today, Yesterday, or a previous day's headings, and then tap Clear.

 Note
When viewing an item from within Notification Center, swipe sideways (right to left) across a listing to access the View or Clear buttons. If you swipe across a listing from left to right, you see an Open button. Alternatively, tap a listing to open it. When you open a listing, the app related to the notification is launched and the related content automatically is displayed.
Using one of the newer iPhones, press down gently on the listing to use the phone's 3D Touch capabilities to view a menu of available options. For example, if you're looking at a message from the Mail app about a new incoming email, use the 3D Touch function to quickly preview the email, and then tap the Trash or Mark As Read option. Press down on the preview to launch the Mail app and further read, respond to, or manage that message.

Using the App Switcher
At any given times, multiple apps will be running on your iPhone or iPad simultaneously, although on an iPhone you can view only one app at a time. On an iPad, when using Multitasking mode, you can view two apps on the screen simultaneously, but many more can be running in the background.
To quickly switch between apps that are running, shut down apps, or take advantage of the Handoff feature to pick up what you were doing on another mobile device or Mac that's linked to the same iCloud account, use the App Switcher.
To launch App Switches on any iPhone (except the iPhone X), quickly press the Home button twice (from any screen but the Lock screen). On an iPad, the App Switcher and Control Center are displayed on the same screen. Access it by pressing the Home button twice.

 Note
When you're using an iPhone X, place and hold your finger near the bottom center of the screen, swipe up with that finger, and hold your finger in place (on the screen) an extra second.

The App Switcher (shown on an iPhone in Figure 2.20 and on an iPad in Figure 2.21) displays large thumbnails of the apps currently running in the background. To re-launch an app, tap its thumbnail. To shut down an app, swipe up on that thumbnail. You can easily scroll through the app thumbnails using horizontal finger swipes.
On an iPhone, if the Handoff feature is available for a specific app you were just using, a banner for it is displayed along the bottom of the screen. Tap the banner to launch that app on the device you're currently using to pick up where you left off on a different device.

 Note
On an iPad, if the Handoff feature is available for a specific app, that app icon is displayed on the extreme-right side of the Dock (and an iPhone logo is shown in the top-right corner of that app's icon).

3. Take Advantage of iOS 11 Features for the iPad

In this Chapter
 Discover what's new in iOS 11 that's exclusive to the iPad and iPad Pro
 Use multiple apps simultaneously
 Drag and drop content between apps
 Work with the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard

The way you can interact with an iPad or iPad Pro has greatly improved with iOS 11, regardless of which apps you typically use. Some of the new or improved iOS 11 features that make an iPad more efficient to work with include
 A redesigned Dock and Control Center
 Better multitasking capabilities
 Easier ways to transfer content between apps using drag and drop (or copy and paste)
 The ability to mark up or annotate content using the Apple Pencil (on an iPad Pro)
 Keyboard shortcuts when using an iPad Pro with an optional Smart Keyboard
When you combine these features with the apps you're already using (or soon will be using) on your tablet, you'll quickly discover that the experience of using an iPad is closer than ever to working with a notebook computer without losing the convenience of the touchscreen display. This chapter covers some of iOS 11's newest features that are specific to iPads—and in some cases, exclusively to the latest iPad Pro models.

 Note
The iPad offers a 9.7-inch Retina Display, whereas the iPad mini 4 features a 7.9-inch LED-backlit Multi-Touch display. On the upside, these models are less expensive than higher-end models, but they also lack some of the newer technologies built into the latest iPad Pro models.
The latest iPad Pro models offer a 10.5-inch or 12.9-inch Retina Display, a faster processor, multiple built-in speakers, as well as other technologies that make these models considerably more advanced. As a result, iPad Pro models can function more like laptop computers when handling common computing tasks, such as word processing, spreadsheet management, working with PDF documents, or managing emails. iPad Pro models also work with the optional Apple Pencil ($99.00) stylus and optional Smart Keyboard ($149 to $169, depending which iPad Pro the keyboard will be used with). If you want to be able to handwrite, draw, or annotate content on your tablet's screen an iPad Pro model is worth checking out.
All iPad and iPad Pro models come in several case colors and system configurations. For example, you have options in terms of the amount of internal storage the tablet contains, as well as whether the iPad (or iPad Pro) can connect to the Internet via only Wi-Fi or also via a 4G (LTE) cellular data connection.


 Note
Many of the features discussed in this chapter apply to all iPad models. Some, however, are exclusive to the latest iPad Pro models.


 Tip
To quickly compare current iPad and iPad Pro models before making a purchase, visit www.apple.com/ipad/compare. After you purchase an iPad (or iPad Pro), you can't add features to upgrade it, so make a decision based on what you anticipate your future needs will be.
For example, if you plan to store a massive number of high-resolution digital photos, large document and data files, as well as a library of HD video content on your tablet (including television shows and movies), choose a model with plenty of internal storage space.

Getting to Know the Customizable Dock
Chapter 2, "Customize Your iPad or iPhone," introduces the newly redesigned Dock (see Figure 3.1). In addition to the Dock changes, the Control Center is more powerful and versatile than ever. For example, you can place your finger on any app icon on the iPad's Home screen and drag it onto the Dock so it becomes more easily accessible, especially if you're working with multiple Home screen pages.

FIGURE 3.1
The newly redesigned Dock on the iPad.

 Tip
To see a list of recently accessed files that an app in the Dock has used, press and hold your finger on that app icon. For apps that are compatible with this feature, you see a list of recently accessed files (see Figure 3.2). Tap any of the file listings or image thumbnails to launch the app and continue working with that file.


FIGURE 3.2
Certain apps allow you to use the Dock to quickly access files you've recently worked with.

 Tip
If you're working with a photo in the Photos app, and you want to quickly send the image to someone else using the Messages app, place and hold your pointer finger from your right hand on the image thumbnail. Using your left hand's pointer finger, simultaneously swipe upward from the bottom of the iPad's screen to make the Dock appear.
Next, use the finger on your right hand to drag the selected image thumbnail directly over the Messages app icon. Select which message conversation the image should go in, and place the image thumbnail into the Send field for that conversation. Tap the Send icon to complete the process.

The redesigned Dock, which is consistent no matter which Home screen you're on, holds more apps than previous versions. The right side of the Dock includes icons for recently used apps and, if applicable, icons representing apps you were just using on another iOS mobile device or Mac (which means you can use the device you're using now to quickly pick up where you left off on some other device). This takes advantage of iOS 11's Handoff feature that's covered in Chapter 6, "Sync, Share, and Print Files Using AirDrop, AirPlay, AirPrint, and Handoff."
To manually add an app icon to the Dock, locate it on the Home screen, place your finger on it, and then drag it to the desired location on the left side of the Dock. To remove an app icon from the Dock and return it to the Home screen, place and hold your finger on the app icon and drag it up and out of the Dock.
To delete an app from the Dock (or the Home screen), place and hold your finder on the app icon until all of the compatible app icons start to shake. The apps you can delete from your tablet altogether have an X in the top-left corner. Tap the X on an app to delete that app from your tablet. (You can always reinstall it at a later time, for free, from the App Store.) Keep in mind that not all apps that come preinstalled with iOS 11 can be deleted. Refer to Chapter 2 for more information on how to customize your Home screen, delete apps, and organize apps into folders.

 What's New
Using any iPad, to access the redesigned Control Center and App Switcher while using any app, place your finger near the bottom of the screen and swipe up. Instead of a quick swipe to access the Dock, keep moving your finger up in one steady motion until the App Switcher and Control Center appear (see Figure 3.3).
Alternatively, press the Home button twice in quick succession to access the App Switcher and Control Center screen.
If you're using an iPhone, press the Home button twice in quick succession to access the App Switcher. To access the Control Center, place your finger near the bottom of the screen and swipe up. Remember, if you're using an iPhone X, the finger gestures to access the Home screen, App Switcher, Control Center, as well as other iOS 11 features are different. Refer to Chapter 1, "Discover iOS 11 and the Newest iPads and iPhones," for more information.
From the App Switcher, you can instantly switch between apps that are currently running on your tablet; just tap the enlarged app thumbnail for the app you want to use. Scroll left or right to view all apps that are running.
To close an app altogether (but not delete it from your iPad), place your finger on an app thumbnail in the App Switcher and swipe up.


FIGURE 3.3
Take a look at the new appearance of iOS 11's Control Center and App Switcher.
Introducing the Redesigned Control Center
If you have swiped up to access the App Switcher and Control Center, but you don't see the Control Center, swipe to the left to access the Control Center. Here, you'll see a handful of icons and sliders you can use to access or work with some of iOS 11's most popular features. For example, you can turn on and off Airplane Mode, AirPlay, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. You can also control the Music app, adjust the iPad screen's brightness, adjust the master volume control for the tablet, and turn on or off Screen Mirroring.
The icons displayed on the Control Center control the screen's rotation lock, Silent mode, Do Not Disturb mode, and flashlight; access the Timer features of iOS 11; allow you to launch the Camera app; or access the Home app's Favorites buttons (used to control smart appliances and lighting in your home). As you learned from Chapter 2, what's displayed on the Control Center is somewhat customizable from within Settings.

 Note
Refer to Chapter 2 to learn more about how to use the App Switcher and Control Center with any iPad or iPhone model.


 Tip
Regardless of what you're doing on your iPad or iPad Pro, if you want to quickly return to the Home screen, either press the Home button, or do a five-finger pinch gesture on the tablet's screen. Start by separating your fingers on your right hand and placing them on the tablet's screen. Next, quickly draw your fingers together as if you're grabbing something. The app you were using continues running in the background, but you instantly jump to the Home screen.

Accessing and Managing Files
People use cloud computing and online-based file storage/sharing services for a wide range of purposes. You already know that iCloud integration is built directly into iOS, however, not everyone uses iCloud for all of their file storage/sharing needs.

 Note
You'll learn more about using iCloud with your iPad or iPhone from Chapter 7, "Use iCloud and the Files App."


 What's New
In iOS 11, the iCloud Drive app, which was previously used to access and manage files stored within your iCloud account, has been replaced by the new Files app.
The Files app does more than integrate with iCloud; it also offers a centralized place to access and share files stored on other supported cloud-based services, including Dropbox (www.dropbox.com) and Box (www.box.com).

The new Files app grants you access to your iCloud Drive, Dropbox, and/or Box account(s), so you can easily access and share files stored in the cloud and transfer files between cloud-based services with ease. Other third-party apps that allow files to be stored in the cloud, can easily be set up to work with the new Files app. The list of cloud-based services and third-party apps that the Files app works with is continuously expanding.

 Note
To work with the Files app and access cloud-based content, your iPad or iPhone must have Internet access via a Wi-Fi or cellular data connection. If you know you'll be in an area with no Internet access, make sure to download the content while you still have Internet access.

Finding Your Files Stored in the Cloud
There are several ways to locate files stored within cloud-based services that are compatible with the Files app.

 Tip
You can set up your iPad's Spotlight Search feature to help you find files stored in the cloud via the Files app. Launch Settings, select the Siri & Search option, tap Files app, and then turn on the virtual switch associated with Search & Siri Suggestions. (Like many features built into iOS 11, this also works on the iPhone.)

To manually find a file, launch the Files app from the Dock and then follow these steps:
1. On the left side of the screen, below the Browse heading, tap the cloud service you want to access, such as iCloud Drive (see Figure 3.4).

FIGURE 3.4
Select which cloud-based services you want to access from the Files app.
2. At the bottom of the screen, tap the Recents option to see your most recently accessed files, or tap on the Browse option (refer to Figure 3.4) to view a directory of files, folders, and subfolders.
3. Open the appropriate folder or subfolder by tapping its thumbnail or listing, and then locate the file(s) you want to open, view, share, or work with.

 Tip
Displayed near the top center of the screen are command tabs that allow you to configure how the files are displayed. If you access iCloud Drive, for example, your sort options include Name, Date, Size, or Tags.

4. A preview of the selected file displays within the viewer. You're now able to manage or work with the selected content. See the next section, "Managing Files and Folders from the Files App" for details.

 Tip
As you're looking at the file directory for the cloud-based service you've selected, tap the Add Folder icon in iCloud Drive to create a new folder or subfolder. You can then add files to and rearrange files in the folder by dragging and dropping, using the Copy and Paste commands, or using the Duplicate and Move commands.

To use the File app's Search tool to find a file stored in the cloud, follow these steps:
1. On the left side of the screen, below the Browse heading, tap the service you want to access.
2. Displayed along the top of the screen is a Search field. Within this field, type what you're looking for, such as a filename, keyword, date, or tag.
3. Tap the Search key on the virtual keyboard to display search results. In Figure 3.5, the Files app is accessing an iCloud Drive account.

FIGURE 3.5
Use the Search tool within the Files app to locate files and content stored online.
4. Tap the icon or listing that represents the search result you want to open, preview, share, or work with.
5. Tap the Markup/Annotate icon (if applicable) to write or draw on the file, or tap the Share icon to open the Share menu.
Managing Files and Folders from the Files App
Using the Files app, once you select any file, photo, or document that's stored within the cloud, you see a preview of the selected content. At this point, you have two or three options, depending on the file type (see Figure 3.6).

FIGURE 3.6
A PDF is being previewed within the Files app.
 If the file type you selected is a graphic file (such as a photo) or a PDF, you can mark up or annotate the file by tapping the Markup/Annotate icon.
 Tap the Share icon (see Figure 3.7) to share the file with other people via the Internet (using Messages, Mail, Facebook Messenger, or another compatible app) or AirDrop. You can also use the Share menu to import the file into a compatible app that's installed on your tablet. For example, if the file is a Word document, tap the Copy to Word icon. If it's a PDF, select the Copy to PDF Expert icon, if you have this optional app installed.

FIGURE 3.7
The Share menu in the Files app offers a handful of ways to work with files.

 Tip
The Copy and Print command icons are in the bottom row of the Share menu (refer to Figure 3.7). The Print command works if you have an AirPrint-compatible (wireless) printer linked with your iPad. The Copy command enables you to place the selected content into the tablet's clipboard and then paste (import) it into another compatible app.

 To exit out of the preview screen, tap Done in the top-left corner of the screen.

 Note
When you're previewing a file, the command icons along the top of the screen disappear after a few seconds. To make them re-appear, tap anywhere on the screen.

To simultaneously manage multiple files from the Files app, launch the app, and select the cloud service you want to access. Tap the Select option in the top-right corner of the screen, and then tap the appropriate files or folders. A circle icon appears within each selected file and folder thumbnail. One at a time, tap on the folder(s) or file(s) you want to select.
As soon as at least one file or folder is selected, the Duplicate, Move, and Delete options become active along the bottom of the screen, as does the Share option, when applicable (see Figure 3.8):
 Use the Share command to access the Share menu.
 Tap Duplicate to make a copy of the selected file (or files) and folder, and then place them in another directory or move them to another service that's accessible from the Files app. The original files and folders stay in their original location, while copies of the selected files and folders are placed in the newly selected location.
 With the Move option, you can move the location of the selected files or folders somewhere else. The files aren't copied, and they do not remain in their original location.
 Use the Delete option to delete the selected files or folders. Deleted files and folders are removed from the tablet and the cloud-based service, so they're no longer available to you from anywhere.

 Tip
If you delete content accidently and want to retrieve it, tap the Recently Deleted option, which is under the Browse heading. Tap the Select option, and then choose the files you want to restore. Tap the Recover option to restore the selected files and place each of them back in their original folders. Keep in mind, though, that files moved to the Recently Deleted folder do not stay there forever.


FIGURE 3.8
Use the Duplicate, Move, or Delete options at the bottom of the screen to manage the selected content within the Files app.
Adding Tags to Files and Folders
The Tags option, which is listed under the Browse heading, enables you to color-code files and folders and then sort and display content by color. You can also add one or more text-based tags to a file or folder.
To add a tag to a file or folder, select it by tapping its thumbnail icon to preview it, and then tap the Share menu. Tap the +Tag option, which is at the top of the Share menu to the right of the filename and then choose the tag you want to associate with the file or folder (see Figure 3.9).
You can create your own text-based tags, which you can then use to search for files.

FIGURE 3.9
Make content easier to identify, sort, and locate by adding a color-coded or text-based tag.
To create a new tag from scratch, open any file that you want to assign a tag to, and then tap the Share menu. Next, tap on the +Tag option. From the Tags menu, tap the Add New Tag option and type a title for the tag. (You can also associate a color with it.) Tap the Add Tag button to save the tag and begin using it. This newly created tag is added to the Tag menu, which means you can just tap it in the list to add it to other files.
Annotating and Marking Up Files
When you select a PDF or a graphic file to preview in the Files app, the Markup/Annotate icon is displayed near the top-right corner of the screen. If you're using a regular iPad, use your finger as a stylus to write or draw on the screen. However, if you're using an iPad Pro, the Apple Pencil works extremely well with these tools for added precision.
After you tap the Markup/Annotate icon a collection of annotation and markup virtual writing and drawing tools are displayed along the bottom of the screen (see Figure 3.10):
 Undo—Tap to erase the last thing you did.
 Redo—Tap to restore what was removed when you tapped the Undo command.
 Pen —Select this tool and then choose your virtual ink color by tapping one of the color icons, which are also along the bottom of the screen.
 Highlighter—Just like a real highlighter, this virtual tool is ideal for drawing attention to text within a PDF. Select the Highlighter tool and ink color, and then use your finger or Apple Pencil to draw over text.
 Pencil—This is the thinnest and most precise writing tool. Select it and then choose your virtual ink color.
 Eraser—Tap anything you've already drawn or written to erase it.
 Dotted-Line—Select this option to draw using a dotted line.

FIGURE 3.10
The markup and annotation tools offered by the Files app work with graphic files, digital photos, and PDFs.

 Tip
Tap the + icon in the bottom-right corner of the annotation screen to access a menu for adding additional content. Options include Text (to add typed text), Signature (to create and then paste your virtual signature into the file), Magnifier (used to zoom in on one area of the image or file you're previewing), and Shapes/Arrows (add, resize, and position a square, circle, dialog box, or arrow).


 Tip
When working with the Apple Pencil on an iPad Pro, after selecting a virtual writing or drawing tool, the harder you press down on the screen with the stylus, the darker and thicker the virtual ink will be.

Keep in mind that these markup and annotation tools are available to you while previewing a file directly from the Files app. If you select a file, tap the Share button, and then open it within the Notes app (or another compatible editing app or a PDF editor app), you have access to a much broader selection of powerful markup, annotation, and drawing tools.
One use for the markup and annotation tools built into the Files app is to compose and store your virtual signature, and then paste that signature into documents or files as you're previewing them. This is extremely useful if you need to sign a PDF of a contract or if you want to add a digital signature to a letter you've composed before sending it out.
To create and place a digital signature, follow these steps:
1. Launch the Files app and open any graphic or PDF.
2. Tap the Markup/Annotation icon.
3. Tap the + icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
4. Select the Signature option from the menu.
5. In the New Signature window (see Figure 3.11), use your finger or the Apple Pencil to write your signature on the designated signature line. If you've previously saved a signature, you have the option to select it.
6. If you like the appearance of the signature, tap the Done option to save it. To redo the signature, tap the Clear option and then rewrite the signature.
7. Your signature appears within a box in the center of the tablet's screen. Place your finger in the center of this box and drag it to the location where you ultimately want the signature to appear (see Figure 3.12).

FIGURE 3.11
Handwrite your personal signature on the iPad's screen using your finger or the Apple Pencil.

FIGURE 3.12
Resize and position your virtual signature exactly where you want it to appear within the file you're working with.
8. Place your finger on one of the blue dots at the corners of the box to resize the signature by dragging it in or out at a diagonal.
9. Tap Done in the upper-right corner to save changes you've made to the file. The file is uploaded to the cloud-based service it came from. From within the Files app, tap on the Share icon to share the now signed file with others via text message, email, or AirDrop, for example, or to export the file into another app.

 Tip
After you create a signature once, it is stored within the Files app. Later, when you access the Signature feature, you can select the saved signature or create a new one.

Multitasking with the iPad
iOS 11 has dramatically improved the multitasking capabilities of the iPad (particularly the iPad Pro models); you can run two apps simultaneously on the screen. It's now easier than ever to drag and drop, copy and paste, or move content quickly between compatible apps.
To launch and use two apps at once (see Figure 3.13), from the Home screen (or App Switcher), launch the first app you want to use, such as the Photos app (shown on the right in Figure 3.13). Place your finger near the bottom of the screen and swipe up to see the Dock. Place your finger on the icon for the second app you want to use (Safari, on the left in the figure), and drag it up and toward one side of the screen. The second app launches.
At this point, the window for the second app is floating on the screen. You can drag this app window right or left. To hide this second app window, drag it off the side of the screen. To make it reappear, drag it back onto the screen by placing your finder near the right or left edge and swiping inward, toward the center of the screen.
While the second app window is floating, place your finger on the horizontal bar near the top of the window and drag it down slightly to activate the split-screen mode, where the two apps are running in fixed windows. It's then possible to move the divider bar between the two apps left or right, depending on how much of the screen you want each app to occupy. In Figure 3.13, the two apps are each using half of the iPad Pro's screen.
Notice that a horizontal app divider bar appears between the two apps. Place your finger on the gray bar located in the center of this divider line and drag it left or right to increase or decrease the size of the second app window.
To replace one of the two apps with another, access the Dock, and drag a new app icon into one of the two app windows.

FIGURE 3.13
Work with two apps simultaneously and transfer content between them. Shown here are Safari (left) and Photos (right).

 What's New
When you have two apps running simultaneously, you can access the App Launcher and then access two different apps that you want to use simultaneously. From the App Switcher, you can switch between different screens, each with two apps running simultaneously, as shown in Figure 3.14.


 Note
Not all iPad apps are compatible with multitasking (split-screen) mode, although more and more app developers are incorporating this functionality into their respective apps. Of the apps that support this feature, not all allow you to drag and drop content across the screen, from one app to the other. Again, this is functionality that is being added to more and more apps over time.


FIGURE 3.14
From the App Switcher, you can access two or more separate screens, each with two apps simultaneously running in each using Split Screen.
Multitasking with the Files App
As you're working with one app, such as the Notes app, you can simultaneously open the Files app, acquire a photo or another type of file from the cloud, and then drag and drop it into the Notes app in a matter of seconds. Here's how to do this:
1. Launch an app, such as Notes. Open or create a document.
2. Place your finger near the bottom of the iPad's screen and swipe up to make the Dock appear.
3. Place your finger on the Files app icon and drag it up and to the right (or left) to launch the app in multitasking (split-screen) mode. Two app windows are displayed on the screen simultaneously.
4. Within the Files window, locate the file (a graphic, for example) you want to import into the Notes document. Place your finger on the file's icon and drag it to the location within the Notes app (on the opposite side of the screen) where you want the image to be.
5. The original file remains stored in the cloud, but a copy is downloaded and transferred to the document you're working with.
6. To close the Files window, place your finger on the divider bar between the app windows, and drag it to the side where the Files app is situated.

 Caution
This drag-and-drop feature works with many other apps—for example, you can drag pictures from Photos into an email that you're composing. However, not all apps support this feature.
When you place your finger on the selected content and attempt to move it to the other app window, a green and white plus-sign icon will appear in the top-right corner of the thumbnail of the file you're moving. If this plus-sign icon does not appear, the two apps are not currently able to support the drag-and-drop feature, or you're attempting to drag and drop an unsupported file type.

Using the Apple Pencil with the iPad Pro
For iPad Pro users, the Apple Pencil ($99.00, www.apple.com/apple-pencil), which looks and feels just like a traditional pencil, has become a "must have" accessory if you want to be able to write, draw, annotate, markup, or sign content within documents, files, or photos. The Notes app, for example, allows you to handwrite notes or draw directly on the screen, and a handful of third-party note taking apps also transform your tablet into a digital notebook or sketchbook. When it comes to photo editing or marking up photos, the Apple Pencil allows many editing and image enhancement tools to be utilized with greater precision than using your finger. For iOS 11, Apple Pencil support has been added to a wide range of apps, including Microsoft Word and Excel.

 Tip
Apple Pencil is pressure sensitive. When you use a regular writing instrument, if you press harder, you draw thicker or darker lines; the same is true of Apple Pencil. This accessory is extremely precise and works with virtually zero lag time.

The first time you attempt to use the Apple Pencil with your iPad Pro, you need to pair it with your tablet. This process takes less than one minute. Follow these steps:
1. From the Home screen, launch Settings.
2. Tap Bluetooth within the main Settings menu.
3. When the Bluetooth submenu is displayed, remove the top of the Apple Pencil to reveal its Lightning connector and place it into the Lightning port located at the bottom of your iPad Pro.
4. Tap the Pair button in the Bluetooth Pairing Request window that appears.
5. The Apple Pencil is displayed below the My Devices heading within the Bluetooth menu. To the right of the listing it should say Connected.
6. If you haven't already done so, leave the Apple Pencil connected to the iPad Pro for five to six minutes to fully charge the internal battery for the stylus.
7. When you're ready to use the Apple Pencil, remove it from the iPad Pro's Lightning port and replace the white cap. The Apple Pencil now works with all compatible apps.

 Note
The Apple Pencil works for approximately 12 hours per charge (which takes about six minutes). However, a 15-second charge keeps the Apple Pencil operational for about 30 minutes.


 Tip
To discover third-party apps that work with Apple Pencil (in conjunction with your iPad Pro), launch the App Store app. Tap the Search option and then type Apple Pencil Apps in the Search field. Scroll through the app preview listings to discover hundreds of compatible apps for writing, taking notes, drawing, editing photos, signing documents, handwriting musical scores, completing crossword and Sudoku puzzles, and more.

Understanding Keyboard Shortcuts
For the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, Apple offers an optional, full-size Smart Keyboard that doubles as a protective screen cover for your tablet. The Smart Keyboard uses an innovative Smart Connector to link directly with the tablet using magnets, and it's powered by the iPad, so there's no pairing, battery charging, or setup involved. When the Smart Keyboard is connected to the iPad Pro, it works just like a traditional computer keyboard, and it helps the tablet function more like a laptop computer. Any app that works with the virtual (on-screen) iPad keyboard also works with the Smart Keyboard.
For the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, the Smart Keyboard is priced at $159.00. For the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the Smart Keyboard is $169.00.
In addition to being thin and lightweight, which makes it easy to transport, the Smart Keyboard uses iOS 11 and app-specific keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts allow you to work faster and more accurately. Most of these shortcuts make use of the Command key, followed by a number or letter. Many are identical to what you might already be accustomed to using on a Mac. To learn more about Smart Keyboard shortcuts, visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205237. Table 3.1 lists some popular keyboard shortcuts.

4. Say it and Make it so using Siri

In this Chapter
 Introduce yourself to Siri
 How to use Siri with your iPhone or iPad
 How to use the Dictation feature as an alternative to the virtual keyboard
 How to use your iPhone with CarPlay in your vehicle

Siri is designed to be a virtual assistant that responds to commands, questions, and requests that you say, as opposed to type, into your mobile device. Siri has access to the content stored in your iPhone or iPad, as well as an ever-growing arsenal of Internet-based resources that you can use to quickly gather information or answers that you need within seconds after you verbally state your request.

 Tip
Because Siri functionality is primarily web-based and requires Internet access to use, it's continuously evolving. Recently, more and more third-party developers have been integrating Siri functionality into their own apps and smart devices, which has broadened the types of commands and questions Siri can respond to. For example, if you want to order an Uber, instead of launching the Uber app, you can speak a command into your Internet-connected iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch.
If you have smart lighting or a smart thermostat installed in your home, simply say, "Hey Siri, turn on the living room lights." or "Hey Siri, dim the dining room lights by 50 percent." If your home's temperature needs an adjustment, say, "Hey Siri, set the thermostat to 70 degrees."


 Tip
Depending on how you set up Siri within Settings, simply say, "Hey Siri," to activate this feature from all newer iPhones or iPads. Older devices must be plugged in to an external power source to activate Siri using the "Hey Siri" command. When you do this, the familiar, "What can I help you with?" screen appears, and you hear Siri's "ready" tone.
You can also press and hold down the Home button for two seconds to activate Siri at any time.

Even with ongoing improvements being made to Siri, it's important to realize that Siri does not understand everything, and this feature does have its limitations in terms of what it can do and which apps it works with. When you get accustomed to working with Siri, however, this feature can make you more efficient when using your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Apple HomePod.
In addition to using cutting-edge voice recognition, Siri uses advanced artificial intelligence, so it doesn't just understand what you say, it interprets and comprehends what you mean and then translates your speech to text. And if you don't initially provide the information Siri needs to complete your request or command, you're prompted for more information.

 What's New
Siri can now translate spoken words or sentences (almost instantly) between languages. When iOS 11 first launched in late 2017, Siri supported English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, and Italian. Additional languages will be added moving forward.
To use the translation feature, activate Siri and say, "Translate [word or sentence] into [language]." Siri says the translation and simultaneously displays it on the iPhone or iPad's screen (see Figure 4.1).
If you're going to make use of the translation feature while traveling overseas, you'll need to have Internet access from your iPhone or iPad. Consider using a low-cost personal Wi-Fi hotspot from a company like SkyRoam (www.skyroam.com), which offers unlimited Internet connectivity for up to five devices in more than 100 countries, for a flat fee of $8.00 to $9.00 per day.


FIGURE 4.1
Siri can now translate speech between languages almost instantly.
What You Should Know Before Using Siri
For Siri to operate, your device must have access to the Internet via a cellular or Wi-Fi connection. Every time you make a request or issue a command to Siri, your iOS mobile device connects to Apple's data center. Thus, if you're using a cellular data connection, some of your monthly wireless data allocation gets used up (if a cellular data allocation is imposed by your wireless service provider).

 Tip
Because a Wi-Fi connection is typically significantly faster than a cellular data connection, Siri often responds faster to your requests and commands when you use a Wi-Fi connection.

You should also understand that heavy use of the Internet, especially when connected via a cellular data connection, depletes the battery life of the iPhone or iPad faster. So, if you constantly rely on Siri throughout the day, the battery life of your device will be shorter.

 Caution
If your iPhone or iPad is placed in Airplane mode (and Wi-Fi connectivity is turned off), Siri does not function. You'll receive a verbal message stating that Siri is unavailable.

Customizing Siri
In iOS 11 Siri is "smarter" and better able to assist users with a broader range of tasks, and it's also more customizable than ever. To customize Siri features, launch Settings and tap the Siri & Search option. From the Siri & Search submenu (see Figure 4.2), you can completely turn off the Siri feature by turning off the virtual switches associated with the Listen for "Hey Siri," Press Home for Siri, and Allow Siri When Locked options.
Turn on the virtual switch associated with the Listen for "Hey Siri" feature if you want your iPhone or iPad to continuously be listening for the words "Hey Siri," which will cause the feature to activate, even if you're across the room from your mobile device. When using the "Hey Siri" command, there's no need to touch your iPhone or iPad to use the Siri feature.

FIGURE 4.2
Be sure to customize Siri from within Settings.
Turn on the Press Home for Siri feature if you want to be able to activate Siri by pressing and holding down the Home button on your iPhone or iPad for about two seconds.

 Caution
When you turn on the virtual switch for the Allow Siri When Locked option, you (or someone else) can access Siri while the phone is still locked. This potentially allows someone to access content stored within your phone or to access a phone feature without entering your private passcode or scanning your fingerprint using the Touch ID sensor or using the iPhone X's Face ID feature.
This feature is convenient, but when it is turned on your mobile device is not as secure as it is when the feature is turned off.

You also use the Siri & Search submenu in Settings to set the default language to your native language and to customize Siri's voice.

 What's New
From the Siri & Search submenu within Settings, tap the Siri Voice option to give Siri an American, Australian, or British accent, and choose between a male and female voice. You'll discover that regardless of which combination of options you choose, the iOS 11 version of Siri sounds more human.

The Voice Feedback menu option allows you to determine if Siri will beep and provide voice feedback rather than displaying content on the screen. Choose the Always On option if you want Siri to always provide voice feedback (even when the ring switch of your iPhone/iPad is set to Silent).
Select the Control with Ring Switch option if you want Siri to refrain from giving you audio feedback when the ring switch is manually set to silent. This setting is overridden when you use a Bluetooth headset or when your iPhone is connected to your vehicle via CarPlay.
The Hands-Free Only option allows Siri to provide verbal feedback only when you use the "Hey Siri" command and when a Bluetooth headset is connected or the iPhone is connected to your vehicle via CarPlay.

 Tip
The first time you turn on the "Hey Siri" feature, your iPhone or iPad asks you to speak several Siri-related commands so that the device can learn what your voice sounds like. Follow the onscreen prompt and say what's requested. This process takes less than one minute, and you need to do it only once.
Right from the start, Siri will probably understand most of what you say. However, as you begin using this feature often, you will become acquainted with the best and most efficient ways to communicate questions, commands, and requests to generate the desired response.


 Tip
To get the most out of Siri, turn on your iOS device's master Location Services functionality (Settings, Privacy, Location Services), and then make sure Location Services is set up to work with Siri.
Also from the Location Services submenu, tap the Siri & Dictation option and select the While Using the App option. With this setting enabled, Siri is able to use Location Services only when you're actively using Siri.

Providing Siri with Your Personal Info
Siri works best when it knows details about you, including your name, phone number(s), home address, work address, and the names of your relatives.
Providing Siri with this information is a two-step process. First, launch the Contacts app, and create a record for yourself. Be sure to include as much information as possible. You can find information about how to do this in Chapter 14, "Use Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, and Notes."
Next, go to the Siri & Search submenu in Settings, tap the My Information option, and select your own Contacts entry.
The more information you include in your personal Contacts entry, the more helpful Siri will be when it comes to responding to questions or commands, like, "How do I get home from here?" "How long will it take me to get to work today?" or "Call mom at home."

 Tip
By default, Siri addresses you by your first name, based on the information in your own Contacts entry. However, you can activate Siri and say, "Siri, call me [nickname]." Siri remembers your request and addresses you by that name in the future.

Siri also uses information stored in the Related Name fields as you create or edit entries within the Contacts app. By tapping this field, you can add a relationship title, such as mother, father, brother, or sister when creating or editing Contact app entries.

 Tip
You can teach Siri which of your contacts are your relatives. Simply activate Siri and say, "[name] is my father," for example. Siri will remember these relationships in the future.

Then, when using Siri, if you say, "Call Mom at home," Siri knows exactly to whom you're referring. Otherwise, if you activate Siri and say, "Call my mom at home," the first time you use Siri for this task, Siri asks who your mother is.
As long as you have a Contact entry for your mother stored in the Contacts app, when you say your mother's real name, Siri links the appropriate contact and remembers this information. This applies to any nickname or title you have for other people, such as "wife," "son," "mother," "dad," or even "Uncle Jack."
Allowing Siri to Work with Third-Party Apps
A growing number of third-party app developers are implementing ways to use Siri. To turn on this functionality for compatible apps, launch Settings, tap the Siri & Search option, and then scroll toward the bottom of the Siri & Search submenu until you see a list of third-party apps that are installed on your iPhone or iPad and that support Siri. Tap each listing and then turn on or off the virtual switch associated with each app to indicate whether you want Siri functionality to work with it. For example, if you have the Philips Hue smart lighting system installed in your home, and you want to be able to control the lights using your voice, be sure to turn on Siri functionality for the Hue app.
Activating Siri
If you want to use Siri, you first must activate it. There are multiple ways to do this:
 Use the "Hey Siri" command. This works even when the device is in Sleep mode, but not when the iPhone or iPad is powered off altogether. On compatible iPhones and iPads, whatever you're doing, simply say the phrase, "Hey Siri" out loud, and Siri responds.
 Press and hold the Home button on your iPhone or iPad for two seconds.
 Press and hold the Call button on your wireless Bluetooth headset that is paired with your iPhone or iPad. This enables you to speak to Siri on your device from up to 30 feet away.
 If you're using Apple EarPods, press the middle button on the controls on the cable.
 Press the CarPlay button built in to the steering wheel or dashboard of your compatible car when your iPhone is linked with your vehicle.

 What's New
If you want to use Siri with Apple's AirPods, pair the AirPods to your iPhone/iPad, launch Settings, and then tap the Bluetooth option. Below the My Devices heading, tap the Info (i) icon associated with the AirPods listing.
Below the Double-Tap on AirPod heading, tap the Left and Right option (one at a time) and then choose the Siri option if you want to be able to activate Siri by double-tapping on one (or either) of your AirPods while they're in your ears. Otherwise, you can use the "Hey Siri" command to activate Siri while wearing one or both AirPods.

Using Siri as Your Virtual Assistant
When Siri is activated, the message "What can I help you with?" displays on the screen, along with a rainbow-colored, animated wave graphic (see Figure 4.3). On some iPhone and iPad models, you simultaneously hear Siri's activation tone. When not listening for spoken commands, the Some Things You Can Ask Me screen replaces the animated wave graphic. Tap the colorful orb icon at the bottom-center of the screen to activate or reactivate Siri.

FIGURE 4.3
After you have activated Siri, this interactive menu screen appears.
Once Siri is activated, you have about five seconds to begin speaking before the feature deactivates. To reactivate it, simply tap the microphone icon or repeat one of the previously mentioned steps.
For the most accurate results when using Siri, speak directly into the iPhone, iPad, AirPods, Apple Watch, HomePod, or headset. Try to avoid being in areas with excessive background noise. Also, speak as clearly as possible so Siri can understand each word in your sentence.
Discovering How Siri Can Help You
The great thing about Siri is that you don't have to think too much about how you phrase a command, question, or request. Siri automatically interprets what you say.

 Tip
When you're in a quiet area, activate Siri and then speak. Stop speaking when you're finished, and Siri responds accordingly. However, if you're in a noisy area, Siri might have trouble determining when you've stopped speaking. To avoid this problem, press and hold the Home button as you speak to Siri. When you're finished speaking, release the Home button so Siri can process your request.

To get the most out of using Siri—with the least amount of frustration as a result of Siri not being able to comply with your requests—develop a basic understanding of which apps this feature works with and how Siri can be used with those apps.
Siri can be used with most of the apps that come preinstalled with iOS 11 plus an ever-expanding collection of third-party apps. Siri can also find information on the Internet by performing web searches. You can use Dictation mode, however, in any app where the microphone key appears on the iPhone or iPad's virtual keyboard.
The following sections provide a sampling of what Siri can be used for, as well as tips for how to use Siri effectively.

 More Info
For an up-to-date summary of Siri's capabilities and a sampling of how to phrase commands or requests to work with Siri's newest features, visit this page of Apple's website: www.apple.com/ios/siri.

Here are some quick tips on using Siri:
 You can use Siri to launch any app. To do this, activate Siri and say, "Launch [app name]." If it's a game you want to play, simply say, "Play [game name]." Another option is to say, "Open [app name]."
 For more information about how Siri can be used, activate Siri and say, "What can you do?" Or after activating Siri, wait for the "What can I help you with?" message, and then tap the small question mark that's displayed in the bottom-left corner of the screen (refer to Figure 4.3).

 Tip
Tap the Bluetooth icon displayed in the bottom-right corner of the screen (also shown in Figure 4.3) to switch between using your iPhone or iPad's built-in speaker, a Bluetooth headset/speaker, AirPods, or CarPlay.


 Tip
Siri understands commands related to the Home app and HomeKit-compatible "smart" equipment, which means that you can control home automation equipment that your iPhone or iPad is linked with, such as your lights, thermostat, door locks, or security cameras.
Siri also responds to requests or questions related to almost anything having to do with sports, movies, entertainment, restaurants, music, weather, locations, or stocks. Plus, Siri can look up information when you pose almost any type of question, or you can use it to verbally control almost any iPhone/iPad-related feature that's adjustable from within Settings or Control Center. For example, you can activate Siri and say, "Turn on Airplane mode" or "Turn off Do Not Disturb."

Finding, Displaying, or Using Information Related to Your Contacts
Every field in a Contact's entry is searchable and can be accessed by Siri. Or you can ask Siri to look up a specific contact for you and display that contact's Info screen.
Again, the more information you include in each entry stored in your Contacts database, the more helpful Siri can be.

 Tip
When Siri displays the Info screen for a Contact, it is interactive; you can tap a displayed phone number to initiate a call, or tap an email address to launch the Mail app to send email to that address. If you tap a regular address, the Maps app launches, and if you tap a website URL, Safari launches and opens that web page.

Siri can also use information stored in your Contacts database to comply with various other types of requests for sending text messages and emails, giving you directions to specific addresses in Contacts, and looking up information you have stored in the database (such as birthdays and names).
Initiating a Call
Initiate a call by activating Siri and then saying, "Call [name] at home," or "Call [name] at work." This works if that person has a Contacts entry associated with their name, as well as a phone number labeled Home or Work, respectively.
You could also say, "Call [name]'s mobile phone," or "Call [name]'s iPhone." If you just use the command call, and that person has several phone numbers in their Contacts entry, Siri gives you the option to select which number you want to call.
Alternatively, if someone's contact information or phone number is not stored in your iPhone, you can say, "Call" or "Dial" followed by each digit of a phone number. Thus, you'd say, "Call 212 555 1212."

 Tip
You can also ask Siri to look up a business phone number or address by saying, "Look up [business name] in [city, state]." Or, you could say, "Look up [business type, such as a dry cleaner] in [city, state]."

On the iPhone, when Siri finds the phone number you're looking for, Siri says, "Calling [name] at [location]," and then automatically initiates a call to that number by launching the Phone app. Siri also has the capability to initiate FaceTime video calls. Use a command, such as, "FaceTime with [name]."
Setting Up Reminders and To-Do Items
If you constantly jot down reminders to yourself on scrap pieces of paper or sticky notes, or manually enter to-do items into the Reminders app, this is one Siri-related feature you'll truly appreciate.
To create a reminder, complete with an alarm, simply activate Siri and say something like, "Remind me to pick up my dry cleaning tomorrow at 3 p.m." Siri creates the to-do item, displays it on the screen for your approval, and then saves it in the Reminders app. At the appropriate time and day, an alarm sounds and the reminder message is displayed.

 Tip
When creating a reminder using Siri, provide a specific date and time, such as "tomorrow at 3 p.m." or "Friday at 1 p.m." or "July 7th at noon." You can also include a location that Siri knows, such as "Home" or "Work." For example, you could say, "Remind me to feed the dog when I get home," or "Remind me to call Emily when I get to work."


 Note
Siri also is compatible with the Notes app and enables you to create and dictate notes. To create a new note, activate Siri and begin a sentence by saying, "Note that I...." You can also say, "Note: [sentence]." What you dictate is saved as a new note in the Notes app.

Reading or Sending Text Messages
When you receive a new text message but can't look at the screen (such as when you're driving), activate Siri and say, "Read new text message." After Siri reads the incoming message, you're given the opportunity to reply to that message and dictate your response.
Using Siri with the Messages app, you can also compose and send a text/instant message to anyone in your Contacts database by saying something like, "Compose a text message to John Doe."

 Caution
Any time you dictate a text message or email that will be sent to someone else, make sure that when Siri translates your spoken words into text that the transcription is correct; otherwise, you could wind up sending a message that makes no sense or that has a meaning you didn't intend.

Checking the Weather or Your Investments
The Weather app can display an extended weather forecast for your immediate area or any city in the world, and the Stocks app can be used to track your investments. However, Siri has the capability to automatically access the Web and obtain weather information for any city, as well as stock-related information about any stock or mutual fund.
When you request stock information, you get a verbal response from Siri, and information about that stock is displayed on the iPhone or iPad's screen.
Finding Information on the Web or Getting Answers to Questions
If you want to perform a web search, you can manually launch the Safari browser, and then use a search phrase or question to type what you're looking for in the Search field. Another option is to perform your web search by entering it into the Search field via your iPhone or iPad's Spotlight Search feature.
Siri can also be used to perform web searches, by saying something like
 "Look up the [company] website."
 "Access the website cnn.com."
 "Search the Web for [topic]."
 "Google information about [topic]."
 "Search Wikipedia for [topic]."
 "What is the definition of [word]?"
You also can ask almost any type of question, and Siri seeks out the appropriate answer from the Internet. A question might be, "What does the Canadian flag look like?" or "What is the population of New York City?"

 Note
When you ask Siri a question that requires your iPhone or iPad to seek out the answer on the Internet, this is done through Apple using Wolfram Alpha. To learn more about the vast topics you can ask Siri about, from unit conversions to historical data, visit www.wolframalpha.com/examples.

If you're looking for the latest scores related to your favorite professional or college team or sporting event, just ask Siri. It's also possible to ask sports-related questions and then have Siri quickly research the answers via the Internet. When it comes to sports, here are some sample questions or requests you can use with Siri:
 "Did the Yankees win their last game?"
 "What was the score of last night's Patriots game?"
 "What was the score the last time the Yankees and Red Sox played?"
 "Show me the baseball scores from last night."
When it comes to movies, Siri can also help you decide what to go see, determine where movies are playing, look up movie times, and provide details about almost any movie ever made. Here are some sample questions or requests you can use with Siri that relate to movies:
 "Where is [movie title] playing?"
 "What's playing at [movie theater]?"
 "What's playing at the movies tonight?"
 "Find the closest movie theater."
 "Show me the reviews for [movie title]."
If you're looking to try out a new restaurant or want to learn more about a local dining establishment, Siri knows all about restaurants too. Plus, thanks to Yelp! and OpenTable integration, you can view detailed information about restaurants, make dining reservations, or read reviews.
Here are some examples of how you can use Siri when you want to know more about restaurants:
 "Where's the closest Japanese restaurant?"
 "Table for two at Palm Restaurant in Boston for 7 p.m."
 "Show me reviews for [restaurant name] in [city]."

 Tip
The detailed information Siri displays is interactive. For example, tap the phone number in a restaurant listing to initiate a call to that restaurant, or tap the listed address to launch the Maps app and get detailed directions.

Scheduling and Managing Meetings and Events
Like many apps that come preinstalled with iOS 11, the Calendar app is fully compatible with Siri, which means it's possible to use Siri to create or modify appointments, meetings, or events by using your voice. To do this, some of the things you can say include
 "Set up a meeting at 10:30 a.m."
 "Set up a meeting with Drew at noon tomorrow."
 "Meet with Emily for lunch at 1:00 p.m."
 "Set up a meeting with Rusty about third-quarter sales projections at 4:00 p.m. on December 12th."

 Tip
You can use Siri to reschedule or cancel events stored in the Calendar app. For example, you could say, "Move my 2:00 p.m. meeting to 4:00 p.m.," or "Cancel my 6:00 p.m. dinner with Rusty."
To obtain an overview of your schedule, ask a question like, "What does the rest of my day look like?," or "When is my next appointment?" You can learn about a specific event as well, by asking, "When is my next meeting with Kevin?" or "Where is my next meeting?"
Siri can also tap the Calendar and Maps app simultaneously if you ask a question like, "How do I get to my next meeting?" This works if you've filled in the Location field when creating an event in the Calendar app.

Sending Email and Accessing New (Incoming) Email
If you want to compose an email to someone, activate Siri and say, "Send an email to [name]." If that person's email address is listed in your Contacts database, Siri addresses a new message to that person. Siri then says, "What is the subject of your email?" Speak the subject line for your email. When you stop speaking, Siri says, "Okay, what would you like the email to say?" You can now dictate the body of your email message.
When you're finished speaking, Siri composes the message, displays it on the screen, and then says, "Here is your email to [name]. Ready to send it?" You can now respond "yes" to send the email message, or say "cancel" to abort the message. If the message isn't what you want to say, ask Siri to "Change the text to...."
Meanwhile, if you're expecting an incoming email from someone, you can activate Siri and say, "Any new email from [name]?" and not have to first manually launch the Mail app.
Siri also now has the capability to search through the subjects of your emails. So, you can activate Siri and say, "Do I have any emails about [subject]?"
Setting an Alarm or Timer
Siri can control the Clock app that comes preinstalled on your iOS device so that it serves as an alarm clock or timer. You can say something like, "Set an alarm for 7:30 a.m. tomorrow," "Wake me up tomorrow at 7:30 a.m." or "Set a recurring wakeup call for 7:30 a.m." to create a new alarm. Or, to set a 30-minute timer, say, "Set a timer for 30 minutes." As shown in Figure 4.4, a countdown timer is displayed on the iPhone or iPad's screen, and an alarm sounds when the timer reaches zero.
You can also simply use "Hey Siri" and ask "What's today's date?" "What time is it?" or "How many days until Christmas?" if you're too busy to look at the iPhone or iPad's screen, such as when you're driving.

FIGURE 4.4
Use Siri to set a timer.
Getting Directions Using the Maps App
Pretty much any feature you can use the Maps app for—whether it's to find the location or phone number for a business, obtain turn-by-turn directions between two addresses, access public transit information, or map out a specific address location—you can access using Siri.
To use Maps-related functions, say things like the following:
 "How do I get to [location]?"
 "Directions to [contact name or location]."
 "Find a [business or service name, such as Starbucks Coffee] near where I am."
 "What's a good steak restaurant in Boston?" (See Figure 4.5.)
 "What time does [store name] close tonight?"
 "Where is a good barber?" (When you ask a question like this, Siri relies on Yelp! reviews and other information to provide highly recommended businesses or restaurants.)
 "How do I get home from here?" If you're lost, or need directions home from anywhere, Siri uses your iPhone's GPS to pinpoint your current location, and then uses the Maps app to provide turn-by-turn directions to help you get home.

FIGURE 4.5
Ask Siri for restaurant recommendations based on a location and the type of cuisine you're in the mood for.
If Siri finds multiple businesses or locations that are directly related to your request, it asks you to select one, or all related matches are displayed on a detailed map.

 Note
When you ask Siri to look up businesses, landmarks, popular destinations, or restaurants, Siri integrates with the Yelp! online service to provide detailed information about many businesses and restaurants.

Controlling the Music
In the mood to hear a specific song that's stored on your iPhone or iPad or that's available via Apple Music (if you're a subscriber)? Maybe you want to begin playing a specific playlist, you want to hear all the music stored on your iOS device by a particular artist, or you want to play a specific album? Well, just ask Siri. You can control the Music app or the Apple Music service using your voice by saying things like the following:
 "Play [song title]."
 "Play [album title]."
 "Play [playlist title]."
 "Play [artist's name]."
 "Play [music genre, such as pop, rock, or blues]."
You can also issue specific commands, such as "Shuffle my [title] playlist," or speak commands, such as "Pause" or "Skip" as music is playing.

 Tip
If you subscribe to Apple Music and use the Music app, activate Siri and request to hear any of the songs in Apple's online music collection, which comprises more than 40 million songs and albums and is continuously expanding.
You can request to play (stream) music by song title, album title, or artist. Start by activating Siri and saying, "Play [song title]," Play [song title] by [artist name]," or "Play [album title]." Without an Apple Music subscription, you're limited to hearing the digital music you own.

As you're listening to music on your mobile device, if you want to hear similar music, activate Siri and say, "Play more music like this," or if you want to hear music that's popular, say something like, "Siri, play the number one Country song right now."
When streaming music from Apple Music, to purchase a song or album, activate Siri and say, "Buy this song" or "Buy this album." You're also able to use verbal commands to pause the music, skip to the next song, or repeat the currently playing song.

 Tip
If you are somewhere and hear a song being played and want to know the name of the song or who sings it, activate Siri and say, "What song is this?" or "Who sings this?" Siri listens for a few seconds and then provides information about the music that's playing.

Using Dictation Mode
In many situations when the iPhone or iPad's virtual keyboard appears, a microphone key is located to the left of the spacebar. When you tap this microphone key, Dictation mode is activated. An animated sound wave graphic displays on the screen as you speak.
You can say whatever text you were going to manually type using the virtual keyboard. You can speak for up to 30 seconds at a time. When you're finished speaking, you have to tap the Done key so that your device can translate your speech into text and insert it into the appropriate onscreen field.
For the fastest and most accurate results, speak one to three sentences at a time, and have your device connected to a Wi-Fi Internet connection.

 Tip
While using Dictation mode, you can easily add punctuation just by saying it. For example, you can say, "This is a sample dictation period," and Siri adds the period at the end of the sentence. You can also use words like "exclamation point," "open parenthesis," "close parenthesis," "open quotes," "close quotes," "comma," "semicolon," or "colon" as you dictate.

Using Carplay
Apple continues to work with most of the world's major car manufacturers to integrate the iPhone with the stereo system or infotainment system built in to many vehicles. This functionality varies depending on the make, model, and year of your car.
In some cases, if your vehicle is CarPlay compatible, there is a Lightning or USB port for your iPhone built in to the car. When you plug in your iPhone, your smartphone charges, plus it integrates directly with the car's in-dash infotainment system. This enables you to activate the iPhone's navigation capabilities via the Maps app, Siri functionality, and music capabilities by pressing the CarPlay button built in to your steering wheel or dashboard, for example.
In other cases, your device establishes a wireless Bluetooth connection with your car and enables you to play music that's stored on your iPhone via your car's stereo or that your iPhone streams from the Internet via Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, or another compatible music streaming app. It's also possible to use the Phone feature to make and receive calls hands-free while you're driving.
Every vehicle manufacturer is implementing iPhone integration differently, and this functionality is only built in to 2013 or later model year vehicles. If you have an older car, you must use third-party accessories to link your iPhone to the vehicle.
Typically, when you use Siri, information that's requested is displayed on the iOS device's screen. CarPlay functionality, however, offers much of the same functionality as Siri but turns off the iPhone's screen altogether. Thus, Siri offers only verbal responses to a user's requests, commands, and questions.

 What's New
iOS 11 offers a new feature, called Do Not Disturb While Driving. When turned on, incoming calls are allowed only when the phone is connected to a car (via CarPlay or Bluetooth) or a Bluetooth headset. Meanwhile, for safety reasons, other potentially distracting features are put into Do Not Disturb mode until you're finished driving.
To turn on/off this feature, launch Settings, tap the Do Not Disturb option, and tap Activate for the Do Not Disturb While Driving option. The three available options include Automatically, When Connected to Car Bluetooth, or Manually.


 Tip
If you've invested in any model Apple Watch, you also have full access to Siri from the watch when it is wirelessly paired to your iPhone or has Internet access. To activate Siri from the watch, press the Digital Crown for about two seconds until the Siri screen is displayed, and then start speaking into the watch. You can also use the "Hey Siri" feature.








5. Find, Buy, and use Third-Party Apps

In this Chapter
 How to find quality apps that are of interest to you
 How to install optional apps onto your iOS mobile device from the App Store
 What the difference is between iPhone-specific, iPad-specific, and universal apps

The collection of preinstalled apps that comes with iOS 11 enables you to use your iPhone or iPad for a wide range of popular tasks without first having to find and install additional apps. However, one of the things that has set the iPhone and iPad apart from the competition, and made these devices among the most sought-after and popular throughout much of the world, is the vast library of optional apps.
You can obtain all the apps currently available for your iOS device from Apple's online App Store. Then, as needed, iOS 11 can automatically update your apps to ensure you're always working with the most recently released version of each.

 Note
Although some apps are tweaked to work exceptionally well on the most recent iPhone or iPad models, all iPhone-specific apps can scale themselves automatically to accommodate the screen size of the iPhone model you're using. Likewise, apps for the iPad (as well as universal iPhone/iPad apps) automatically adapt to the screen size of the tablet you're using.

Working with the App Store
The iOS 11 edition of the App Store app not only features a redesigned app icon on the Home screen, but the entire layout and design of the app itself has been revamped. The purpose of the App Store app remains the same—to help you find, download, install, and update apps on your iPhone or iPad that don't come preinstalled with iOS 11.
There are two ways to access the App Store: directly from your iPhone or iPad (using the App Store app that comes preinstalled on your device), or using the iTunes software on your primary computer.
The App Store app is where you get apps for your iOS device. To get other things for your device—music, movies, TV show episodes, and ringtones—you use the iTunes Store app. Both require that your device have an Internet connection.
You can use the iTunes software on your primary computer to access the App Store, as well as many types of content. Anything you acquire is then transferred to your mobile device either using the iTunes Sync process or by downloading the apps or content from your online-based iCloud account.

 Note
The main focus of this chapter is on using the App Store app to find, install, and update optional apps. For information on how to use the iTunes software on your PC or Mac in order to access the App Store, visit www.apple.com/itunes.

Installing New Apps
If you're shopping for apps directly from your iPhone or iPad, tap the Price icon, followed by the Buy icon, to make a purchase. (Free apps display a Get icon in place of the Price icon.) You are asked to supply your Apple ID password (or place your finger on your device's Touch ID sensor—the Home button—to confirm and potentially pay for the transaction). iPhone X users can use Face ID to confirm purchases.
The acquired app automatically downloads and installs itself on your device. After it is installed, its app icon appears on your iPhone or iPad's Home screen and is ready to use.

 Tip
Instead of manually entering your Apple ID password to confirm an app purchase (or acquire a free app), if your iOS mobile device is equipped with a Touch ID sensor as part of its Home button, simply scan your fingerprint to approve the transaction. For this to work, the feature must be turned on once from within Settings. To do this, launch Settings, tap the Touch ID & Passcode option, enter your device's passcode, and then turn on the virtual switch associated with the iTunes & App Store option.

Restoring or Reinstalling Apps You've Already Downloaded
If you have Family Sharing set up via iCloud (see Chapter 7, "Use iCloud and the Files App"), it's possible to share apps you acquire with up to five other family members, without having to repurchase that app. With or without Family Sharing, you're able to install an app you acquire from the App Store on all of your own iOS mobile devices that are linked to the same iCloud account, as long as the app is compatible with each device.
Apps you've already acquired are indicated by an iCloud icon rather than a Get or Price icon. To download an app that you've already acquired or purchased (without having to pay for it again), make sure the iPhone or iPad you're currently using is linked to your iCloud account, and follow these steps:
1. Launch the App Store app.
2. Tap the Today, Games, Apps, or Update icon along the bottom of the screen.
3. Tap your iCloud/Apple ID account profile photo in the top-right corner of the screen.
4. When the Account screen appears, tap the Purchased option.
5. Scroll down the list of all apps you've previously acquired (or purchased). To install (or reinstall) any of these apps on the device you're using, tap the iCloud icon associated with the app's listing.

 Note
At the top of the Purchased screen, tap the All tab to view all the apps you've purchased to date that are compatible with the device you're using. You also have the option to tap the Not On This iPhone/Not on This iPad tab to view only apps you've acquired in the past that are not currently installed on the device you're using.


 Tip
From Settings, you have the option of having your iOS device automatically download and install any new (and compatible) apps, music, or eBooks purchases made using your Apple ID on any other computer or device. To set this up, launch Settings, select the iTunes & App Store option, and then adjust the Automatic Downloads options, which include Music, Apps, Books & Audiobooks, and Updates.


 What's New
To conserve internal storage space within your iPhone or iPad, a new feature automatically deletes apps from your device that you don't use. You can later reinstall them from the App Store for free. To turn on this feature, which also removes clutter from your Home screen, launch Settings, tap the iTunes & App Store option, and then from the iTunes & App Store submenu, turn the virtual switch for the Offload Unused Apps option.
When an app is automatically removed, any app-specific data remains stored within your mobile device and/or on iCloud. When you reinstall the app later, that data becomes fully accessible.


 Tip
To delete an app and its related files, data, or content, launch Settings, tap the General option, tap the iPad/iPhone Storage option, and then tap any in the list app.
You can see the file size of each installed app, plus how much internal storage space is being used by the content associated with the app. Tap the Offload App option to remove the app while preserving your content or data in the cloud. Tap the Delete option to erase the app and all related data or content (see Figure 5.1).
Another way to delete an app (and all of its related data and content), is via the Home screen. Press and hold down any app icon until they all start to shake, and then tap the X icon in the top-left corner of the app icon for the app you want to delete.


FIGURE 5.1
From within Settings, you can offload or erase an app from your iPhone or iPad (shown here).
Finding Apps, Music, and More
If you're shopping for apps, music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, audiobooks, eBooks, ringtones, or other content from your primary computer, with the goal of transferring what you acquire to your iPhone or iPad later via the iTunes Sync process or via iCloud, use the latest version of the iTunes software on your Mac or PC computer.
From your Internet-connected iPhone or iPad, you can acquire and enjoy different types of content using a handful of different apps. Table 5.1 explains which app you should use to acquire and then enjoy various types of content on your iOS mobile device.

 What's New
Apple has teamed up with hundreds of the world's leading educational institutions to offer courses and workshops through a free service, called iTunes U. Starting in September 2017, to access iTunes U materials, iPhone and iPad users should use Apple's free Podcasts app (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029) rather than the soon-to-be defunct iTunes U app.

Everything You need to Know About Apps
Apps are individual programs that you install onto your iPhone or iPad to give it additional functionality, just as you utilize different programs on your primary computer. For the iPhone or iPad, all apps are available from one central (online) location, called the App Store.
When you begin exploring the App Store, you'll discover right away that there are in excess of two million apps to choose from. They are divided into different categories to help make it easier and faster to find what you're looking for.

 What's New
The Games app category now has its own section within the App Store. To access it, launch the App Store and tap the Games icon at the bottom of the screen.
To access all other app categories, launch the App Store app, tap the Apps icon at the bottom of the screen, and then scroll down to the Top Categories heading. Tap the See All option displayed to the right of the Top Categories heading.
Tap a category that interests you, such as Health and Fitness, and then scroll down to see subheadings, including Apps We Love, Top Paid, and Top Free. To the right of these headings is a See All option you can tap to view all related app listings in that category.
After you tap the Apps icon at the bottom of the screen, you see a series of app listings under featured headings, like New Apps We Love or Our Favorites from Last Month. There are also special interest app categories, like Time for School or Plan a Dinner Party. These categories change regularly, and give you an opportunity to browse apps with a special theme or focus.

Understanding Device Compatibility
In terms of compatibility, all iOS apps fall into one of these three categories:
 iPhone-specific—These are apps designed exclusively for the various iPhone models that might not function properly on the iPad. Most iPhone-specific apps run on an iPad but may not take advantage of the tablet's larger screen.
 iPad-specific—These are apps designed exclusively for the iPad. Some work exclusively with the iPad Pro models. They fully utilize the tablet's larger display, and do not function on an iPhone or on other iOS devices.
 Universal—These are apps designed to work on all iOS mobile devices, including any model iPhone or iPad. These apps detect which device they're running on and automatically adapt.

 Tip
When reading the App Store description of any app, you can find the app's compatibility underneath the Information heading (see Figure 5.2).


FIGURE 5.2
From an app's Description screen, see which iOS mobile devices the app is compatible with.

 Tip
If you own two or more iOS devices, such as an iPhone and iPad, and the devices are linked to the same Apple ID (iCloud) account, you can purchase a universal (or iPhone-specific) app once, but then install it on all your iOS devices.

When you're browsing the App Store from your iPhone, by default it displays all iPhone-specific apps followed by universal apps, but it does not display iPad-specific apps. When you're browsing the App Store from your iPad, iPad-specific, universal, and iPhone-specific apps are all listed.

 Note
Because some app developers release the same app in both an iPhone-specific and an iPad-specific format, many iPad-specific apps have "HD" for High-Definition in their title, to help differentiate them from iPhone or universal apps. Some iPad-specific apps include the words "for iPad" in their title.

Buying Apps
Regardless of whether you use the App Store app from your mobile device or visit the App Store using the iTunes software on your primary computer, you must set up an Apple ID account and have a major credit card or debit card linked to the account to make purchases.

 Tip
If you don't have a major credit card or debit card that you want to link with your Apple ID account, it's possible to purchase prepaid iTunes gift cards from Apple or most places that sell prepaid gift cards.
To purchase prepaid iTunes gift cards online, visit www.apple.com/us/shop/gift-cards/itunes-electronic.
iTunes gift cards are available in a variety of denominations and can be used to make app and other content purchases. They are distinct from Apple gift cards, which are only redeemable at Apple Stores or Apple.com.

The first time you access the App Store and attempt to make a purchase, you are prompted to enter your Apple ID account username and password, or set up a new Apple ID account, which requires you to supply your name, address, email, and credit card information. For all subsequent online app purchases, you simply need to enter your Apple ID password (or place your finger on your device's Touch ID sensor), and the purchase is automatically billed to your credit or debit card or deducted from your iTunes gift card balance.
To set up electronic payment options for your Apple ID/iCloud account, another option is to launch Settings, tap the Wallet & Apple Pay option, select the Add Credit or Debit Card option, and then follow the on-screen prompts.

 Tip
An Apple ID account is also referred to as an iTunes Store account. To learn more about how an Apple ID account works or to manage your account, visit https://support.apple.com/apple-id.
The same Apple ID you use to make purchases can also be used as your username when you're using FaceTime for video calling or Messages to access the iMessage service, as well as to access your iCloud account.


 Tip
If you've forgotten your Apple ID username or password, using any Internet web browser, visit https://appleid.apple.com. Click the Forgot Apple ID or Password? option. Remember, even if you have multiple Apple computers and mobile devices, you need only one Apple ID account.

Some apps are free, but others need to be purchased or require you to make in-app purchases to fully utilize them. The following is an overview of how app pricing works.
Free Apps
Free apps cost nothing to download and install on your phone or tablet. In some cases, these are fully functional apps.
Other free apps are demo versions of paid apps. Certain features or functions of the app are locked in the free version, but are later made available if you upgrade to the paid or premium version of the app.
A third category of free apps comprises fully functional apps that display ads as part of their content. In exchange for using the app, you must view ads. These ads typically offer the option to click special offers from within the app or learn more about a product or service being advertised.

 Note
Many free apps that contain ads also have a paid app counterpart that's ad-free.

Another type of free app enables the user to make in-app purchases to add features or functionality to the app or unlock premium content. The core app, without the extra content, is free, however.

 Note
Some fully functional apps are free because they're designed to promote a specific company or work with a specific service. For example, to use the free HBO GO app, you must be a paid subscriber of the HBO premium cable channel.
Likewise, to use the free Netflix app, you must be a paid subscriber to this streaming movie service. The AmEx app is useful only to people with an American Express card, but the free Target app is useful to anyone who shops at Target stores.
The Southwest Airlines app (or the app for any major airline) is also free. It can be used to make and manage airline reservations with that airline, check in for a flight, create and store digital boarding passes, and manage a frequent flier account.

Paid Apps
After you purchase an app, you own it and can use it as often as you'd like, usually without incurring additional fees (although in-app purchases might be possible). You simply pay a fee for the app upfront, which is often between $.99 and $9.99. Typically, future upgrades of the app are free of charge.
Subscription-Based Apps
Each full-length digital edition of a magazine or newspaper requires its own proprietary app (also available from the App Store) to access and read that publication's content.
These apps are typically free, and then you pay a recurring subscription fee for content, which automatically gets downloaded into the app. Many digital editions of newspapers, such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, utilize a subscription app model, as do hundreds of different magazines. Usually, the main content of the digital and printed version of a publication are identical; however, you can view the digital edition on your iPhone or iPad, plus take advantage of added interactive elements built in to the app.
If you're already a subscriber to the print version of a newspaper or magazine, some publishers offer the digital edition free, whereas others charge an extra fee to subscribe to the digital edition as well. Or you can subscribe to just the digital edition of a publication.
With some publications, you can download the free app for a specific newspaper or magazine and then purchase one issue at a time (including past issues) from within the app. There is no long-term subscription commitment, but individual issues of the publication still must be purchased and downloaded. Or you can purchase an ongoing (recurring) subscription, and new issues of that publication will automatically be downloaded to your iPhone or iPad as they become available.

 Tip
Through the News app, many leading publications and media services offer content for free. You can fully customize what topics or publications you're interested in reading, and the News app presents all related content (potentially acquired from many sources) to you in an easy-to-read way.
Unless you acquire a paid subscription to a publication, when using the News app, you only have access to select articles and content, not the entire publication.
Learn more about the News app from online Chapter 17, "Customize Your Reading Experience with iBooks and the News Apps," which you can find at www.informit.com/tipsandtricksios11.

In-App Purchases
Some apps enable you to purchase additional content or add new features and functionality by making in-app purchases. The capability to make in-app purchases has become very popular, and is being used by app developers in a variety of ways. If an app offers in-app purchases, they are listed within the In-App Purchases section, which is below the Information heading of an app's description.

 Caution
The price you pay for an app does not translate directly to the quality or usefulness of that app. Some free or very inexpensive apps are extremely useful, are packed with features, and can really enhance your experience using your iPhone or iPad. However, there are also costly apps that are poorly designed, filled with bugs, or don't live up to expectations or to the description of the app offered by the app's developer or publisher. The price of an app is set by its developer.
Instead of using the price as the only determining factor if you're evaluating several apps that appear to offer similar functionality, be sure to read the app's customer reviews carefully, and pay attention to the average star-based rating the app has earned. These user reviews and ratings are much better indicators of an app's quality and usefulness than its price.

Researching Apps
Before committing to an app purchase, tap its title or graphic icon to view the app's description screen (see Figure 5.3), which displays the app's title and logo near the top of the screen, along with its price icon (or Get icon if it's a free app), average star rating, and the total number of ratings it has received.
Immediately below this information are sample screenshots or video clips from the app itself. Keep scrolling down to view a text-based description of the app. This description is written by the app's developer and is designed to entice you to acquire the app.

FIGURE 5.3
Ratings and reviews can be seen as part of an app's Description screen.
Further down the page are the app's ratings and reviews. Tap the See All option to view all of the app's ratings and text-based reviews (see Figure 5.4). Tap any review to read it in its entirety. Use this information to determine what your fellow iPhone and iPad users really think of the app.
The Ratings and Reviews chart graphically shows how many ratings the app has received, its overall average rating, and the total number of ratings. A top rating is five stars.
Below the App Store Ratings chart are reviews written by other App Store customers. Scroll down to read them.
Two more important sections in every app description are the What's New and Information sections. Because many apps are updated periodically, the What's New section lists changes or improvements made to each new version of the app. The most recent information about the app is listed first.

FIGURE 5.4
Every app description contains an average rating and a rating summary chart.
The Information section includes details about the app's seller/developer, the file size of the app, the app's category, which iPhone/iPad models the app is compatible with, the languages the app supports, and the age appropriateness rating for the app. This section also states whether the app offers in-app purchases or supports Family Sharing.
You can find a list of other apps from the same app developer as well as a list of similar apps.
Managing Your Account and Redeeming iTunes Gift Cards
When you scroll to the very bottom of the Today, Games, or Apps screen within the App Store, you see two command buttons: Redeem and Send Gift.
Tap the Redeem button to redeem a prepaid iTunes gift card. Tap the Send Gift option to send an iTunes gift card to someone else. The gift card is sent via email, and the recipient can redeem it almost instantly from the App Store, iTunes Store, or iBook Store.
Managing Your iTunes Account
Tap your profile photo in the top-right corner of the screen in order to access and manage your Apple ID account, access previous App Store purchases, redeem a Gift Card or Code, Send a Gift by Email, or Sign Out from your Apple ID account. If you haven't already done so, you need to sign into your account by typing your Apple ID password, using Touch ID, or using Face ID (if you're an iPhone X user).
From the Account window, tap your username (or profile photo) to access the Account Settings window (shown in Figure 5.5).

FIGURE 5.5
From the Account Settings window, manage your apps or digital subscriptions.
From here, you can further manage Apple ID features, update payment information, change your country/region, manage App Store-related alerts, manage app-related subscriptions, and customize other account-related functions.
Finding Apps
As you explore the App Store, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of apps that are available for your iOS device. If you're a new iPhone or iPad user, spending time browsing the App Store introduces you to the many types of apps that are available, and provides you with ideas about how your phone or tablet can be utilized in your personal or professional life.
However, you can save a lot of time searching for apps if you already know the app's exact title, or you know what type of app you're looking for. In this case, enter either the app's exact title or a keyword description of the app in the App Store's Search field to see a list of relevant matches.
If you're looking for a word processing app, either enter the search phrase "Microsoft Word" into the App Store's Search field, or enter the search phrase "word processor" to see a selection of word-processing apps.
To find specific iPad Pro apps that support the Apple Pencil, for example, within the Search field, enter "Apple Pencil Apps."
If you're looking for vertical market apps with specialized functionality that caters to your industry or profession, enter that industry or profession (or keywords associated with it) in the Search field. For example, enter keywords like "medical imaging," "radiology," "plumbing," "telemarketing," or "sales."
As you're evaluating an app before downloading it, use these tips to help you determine whether it's worth installing on your phone or tablet:
 Figure out what types of features or functionality you want to add to your iPhone or iPad.
 Using the Search field, find apps designed to handle the tasks you have in mind. Chances are, you can easily find a handful of apps created by different developers that are designed to perform the same basic functionality. Pick which is the best based on the description, screenshots, and list of features each app offers.
 Check the customer reviews and ratings for the app. This useful tool enables you to quickly determine whether the app actually works as described in its description. The customer reviews and star-based ratings are created by fellow iPhone or iPad users who have tried out the app firsthand. If an app has only a few ratings or reviews and they're mixed, you might need to try out the app for yourself to determine whether it will be useful to you.
 If an app offers a free version, download and test that first before purchasing the premium version. You can always delete any app that you try out but don't wind up liking or needing.
Keeping Your Apps Up to Date
Periodically, app developers release new versions of their apps. iOS 11 can automatically update your installed apps as long as your iPhone or iPad has access to the Internet.
To customize this auto-update option, launch Settings and tap the iTunes & App Store option. From the iTunes & App Stores submenu, make sure the virtual switch associated with the Updates option is turned on.
Keep in mind that some apps that have a large file size associated with them require a Wi-Fi Internet connection to initially download or later update.
At any time, you can see which apps have been updated, and read a summary of what functionality or features have been added to the app update (as well as which bugs have been fixed) by launching the App Store app and tapping the Updates icon.
If an app listed on the Updates screen has an Open button associated with it, the app has been recently updated. The date of the update is listed in the heading. Tap the app icon or its title to read about the update. Tap the Open button to launch the app and use it on your iPhone or iPad (see Figure 5.6).
From the Updates screen, if an Open button is not displayed, you might see a progress meter indicating the app is currently being updated and downloaded to your device. If an update is available but has not yet been downloaded and installed, an Update button, instead of an Open button, is displayed with that app.
As you're viewing the Updates screen, apps are listed in chronological order, based on when they were updated. Pending updates, if any, are displayed near the top of the screen.

FIGURE 5.6
The Updates screen has been redesigned in iOS 11. Use it to keep your apps up to date as new versions are released.
Managing Your Kids' App Acquisitions
As a parent, you're able to control what apps your child is allowed to purchase, install, and ultimately use on their iOS mobile device (or yours). It's also possible to control their online spending when it comes to apps and in-app purchases in several different ways.
To determine which apps and content your child is allowed to use on an iOS mobile device, activate the Restrictions options. To do this, launch Settings on the device, tap the General option, and then tap the Restrictions option.
From the Restrictions submenu, tap Enable Restrictions, create a four-digit passcode, and then turn on the virtual switches associated with iTunes Store, Music Profiles & Posts, iBooks Store, News, Installing Apps, Deleting Apps, and In-App Purchases, to limit what your child can do.
Under the Allowed Content heading, tap the Apps option, and determine what apps your child is allowed to access, based on an app's age appropriateness rating.
When you set up iCloud's Family Sharing, it's possible to set up your child's iOS mobile device so he or she needs to ask you for permission (via a text message to your iPhone or iPad) before acquiring any new apps or content. This feature also gives parents greater control over apps installed on a child's device.

 Note
In addition to the apps that come preinstalled with iOS 11, Apple offers a handful of optional Made By Apple apps, such as Pages (similar to Microsoft Word), Numbers (similar to Microsoft Excel), Keynote (similar to Microsoft PowerPoint), iMovie (video editing), Apple Store (online shopping via the Apple.com Online Store or an Apple retail store), GarageBand (music composition and editing), and Podcasts (listen to free podcasts and educational programming). If you have an Apple TV device connected to your HD television set, consider downloading the free Apple TV Remote app to use your iPhone or iPad as a TV remote control. These and other Apple apps are available for free from the App Store.


What's New
The iOS 11 edition of the App Store includes several new and permanent app categories you can browse through. For example, check out the AR Apps category to see information about the fast growing collection of augmented reality apps. Additional speciality app categories are continuously being created, but they are featured only temporarily within the App Store.
When you access the App Store, tap the Apps icon to view graphic banners that promote new, temporary, or seasonal app categories.

When it comes to syncing and sharing files and data (including app-specific data), your iOS mobile device is equipped with several tools, including AirDrop, AirPlay, AirPrint, and Handoff. These technologies are in addition to iCloud and the Files app, which are covered in Chapter 7, "Use iCloud and the Files App."
Wirelessly Transferring Files Using Airdrop
The AirDrop tool enables your iPhone or iPad to wirelessly transfer certain types of files (including photos) and other app-specific data to other iPhones, iPads, and Macs that are in close proximity, and that also support the AirDrop function.
To turn on the AirDrop feature on your iPhone, launch Control Center by swiping your finger up from the very bottom of the screen. When the Control Center appears (see Figure 6.1), press and hold your finger on the Wireless icon until the new Wireless menu appears (see Figure 6.2). Tap the AirDrop icon to access the AirDrop menu.

FIGURE 6.1
From the iPhone's Control Center, place and hold your finger on the Wireless icon.
On the iPad, launch Control Center by pressing the Home button twice in quick succession, and then tap the AirDrop icon (see Figure 6.3).

FIGURE 6.2

FIGURE 6.3
From the Control Center on an iPad, tap the AirDrop icon to access the AirDrop menu.
Activating Airdrop
The AirDrop menu (see Figure 6.4) offers three options:
 Receiving Off—This option deactivates the AirDrop feature. You're unable to send or receive files or content using AirDrop.
 Contacts Only—This option turns on the AirDrop feature but only allows you to exchange compatible, app-specific content with individuals who have an entry in your Contacts database.
 Everyone—This option turns on the AirDrop feature and allows you to exchange compatible, app-specific content with anyone in close proximity who's using a compatible Mac or iOS mobile device.

FIGURE 6.4
The actual AirDrop menu is the same on an iPhone or iPad that's running iOS 11.

 What's New
You also can access the AirDrop menu from Settings. Launch Settings, tap the General option, and then tap the AirDrop option. Select Receiving Off, Contacts Only, or Everyone from the AirDrop submenu.

Sharing Content via Airdrop
To send app-specific content from your device to another device, tap the Share menu in the app. For example, if you want to send a photo to another AirDrop user (or one of your other compatible Macs or mobile devices), launch Photos, view and select the photo(s) you want to send, and then tap the Share icon.
When the Share menu is displayed (see Figure 6.5), you see thumbnails (or usernames) representing people in close proximity who also have AirDrop turned on. Tap the intended recipient, and the selected photos are wirelessly sent.

FIGURE 6.5
Select AirDrop from the Share menu of compatible apps to send app-specific content to other iOS mobile devices or Mac users.
Depending on the app being used to send content via AirDrop, the recipient might see a pop-up menu that offers options for how to accept, view, store, or work with the incoming content.
In Figure 6.6, a Word document is being sent via the Files app from an iPhone to an iPad Pro via AirDrop. The pop-up AirDrop Open With window allows the recipient to open the incoming document in Word or another compatible app that's installed on their tablet. She also can choose to transfer the incoming document to a cloud-based service that the tablets linked with (in this case, iCloud Drive or Dropbox).

FIGURE 6.6
The AirDrop Open With pop-up window appears on a recipient's screen when an incoming document is being sent wirelessly from another computer or mobile device.

 Note
AirDrop is available only when using iPhones and iPads released within the last few years that are running iOS 8, iOS 9, iOS 10, or iOS 11.
If you want to use AirDrop between an iOS mobile device and a Mac, the Mac must have been released in 2012 or later, and be running OS X Yosemite, OS X El Capitan, macOS Sierra, or macOS High Sierra.


 Tip
In addition to the Photos app, the AirDrop feature is supported by the Share menu in other apps, including Contacts, News, Files, Maps, Notes, Safari, iBooks, and iTunes Store.

After you receive content via AirDrop, to access that content, launch the relevant app. For example, to view, organize, or edit photos you receive, open the All Photos/Camera Roll album in the Photos app. If you receive a Contacts entry, it is automatically added to your Contacts database and is accessible from the Contacts app.
As shown in Figure 6.6, if a Word document is sent, for example, the recipient is offered a handful of options for opening, viewing, or storing the incoming document.

 Caution
To avoid receiving unwanted content from strangers when you're in public places, such as an airport or theater, consider turning off the AirDrop feature until you need it. You can turn it off in Control Center. Select the Receiving Off option from the AirDrop menu.
Alternatively, turn on AirDrop and leave it on, but set it up so only content from people with entries in your Contacts app's database will be received.

Streaming Content Between Devices with Airplay
AirPlay is a wireless feature that enables your mobile device to stream content, such as photos, videos, or audio, to an AirPlay-compatible device, such as Apple TV, a Mac, or AirPlay-compatible speakers (including the new Apple HomePod).
To use AirPlay, your iOS mobile device and the other AirPlay-compatible device must be connected to the same wireless home network (via Wi-Fi). Then, when you turn on the AirPlay feature, the two compatible devices automatically establish a wireless connection.
After the connection is made, an AirPlay icon appears in compatible apps, such as Music, TV, and Photos, enabling you to transfer (stream) what you would otherwise see on your iPhone or iPad's screen, or what would be heard through the device's speaker, to another compatible device.
In addition to streaming photos and video (including iTunes Store TV show and movie purchases and rentals), you can use AirPlay to connect external wireless speakers to your iOS mobile device, and then stream music or other audio from your iOS mobile device to those compatible speakers.
In Figure 6.7, AirPlay has been turned on from the Music app on an iPhone to play on an Apple TV device connected to an HD television set.

FIGURE 6.7
From the Music app on an iPhone, AirPlay is selected to play the music through an HD TV's speakers via a connected Apple TV device.
Figure 6.8 shows that an iPad is wirelessly connected to an Apple TV device to stream digital photos stored in the Photos app on the tablet, so that they can be viewed on the HD television set that's connected to the Apple TV device. To set up this configuration, from the Photos app, select the images you want to share, tap the Share icon, and then tap the AirPlay icon. Alternatively, access the Control Center and turn on the Screen Mirroring feature (refer to Figure 6.1 or Figure 6.3).

 Tip
It's possible to use AirPlay to present PowerPoint or Keynote digital slide presentations on a TV or monitor that has an Apple TV connected to it. What appears on the TV is exactly what's displayed on your smartphone or tablet. To use this feature, from your mobile device, access Control Center and tap the Screen Mirroring button (refer to Figure 6.1 or Figure 6.3).


 Tip
From the TV app, if you have a TV show or movie stored on your iPhone or iPad and you want to watch it on an HD television set that has an Apple TV device connected, launch the TV app, begin playing the video content, tap the AirPlay icon, and select Apple TV. The video wirelessly transmits from your iPhone or iPad to your TV.


FIGURE 6.8
From the Photos app's Share menu, tap the AirPlay icon and then select Apple TV (when available) to stream photos from the iPhone or iPad to an HD television set.

 More Info
AirPlay-compatible speakers are available from a handful of different companies, starting around $49.95. Apple's HomePod speaker (www.apple.com/homepod) works seamlessly with AirPlay, so you can stream music from your iPhone or iPad to this speaker. To learn more about AirPlay, visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289.

Printing Content Wirelessly Using an Airprint-Compatible Printer
Another wireless feature offered by iOS 11 is AirPrint. It enables compatible apps to wirelessly send documents, data, or photos to be printed on an AirPrint-compatible laser, inkjet, or photo printer. For this feature to work, the iOS mobile device and the printer must be connected to the same wireless network.

 More Info
Dozens of different AirPrint-compatible printers are now available from companies such as Brother, HP, Canon, Lexmark, and Epson. To learn more about AirPrint-compatible printers, visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311.

After you've set up an AirPrint-compatible printer, use the Print feature that's built in to many apps, such as Files, Pages, Mail, Notes, Safari, Maps, and Photos. In most cases, the Print option is found within the Share menu of these apps, although this can vary. For example, from the Mail app, to print an incoming email message, tap the Forward/Reply icon, and select the Print option.

 Tip
If you're not using an AirPrint printer, it's possible to install specialized software on your Mac, such as handyPrint (www.netputing.com/handyprint) or Printopia (www.decisivetactics.com/products/printopia), to enable any printer to work with the AirPrint feature of your iPhone or iPad, as long as your Mac is turned on.

Using Handoff
Handoff is an iOS feature that works with many apps that come preinstalled with iOS 11, as well as the iWork for iOS apps (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote). It's also compatible with a growing number of third-party apps.
Basically, this feature enables you to begin a task on one of your Macs or iOS mobile devices, and then pick up exactly where you left off on another Mac or iOS mobile device that's linked to the same iCloud account and is within Bluetooth range (about 33 feet).

 Note
To use the Handoff feature between your iPhone and a Mac, the Mac must be running the latest version of OS X Yosemite, OS X El Capitan, macOS Sierra, or macOS High Sierra.

To enable the Handoff feature on your mobile device, launch Settings, tap General, and then tap the Handoff option. Turn on the virtual switch associated with the Handoff feature. You must do this on each of your iOS mobile devices. Also, make sure the device you're using is connected to the same wireless network as the device(s) with which you want to use these features, and make sure that Bluetooth is turned on.
Here's an example scenario for using Handoff: With Handoff turned on, start performing a compatible task on your Mac or iPhone. Then, to pick up what you were doing on an iPad, wake up the tablet and access the Dock. On the right end of the Dock is an app icon associated with the compatible app (such as Notes or Safari) you recently used on one of your other computers or mobile devices. In the top-right corner of the app icon, you see a tiny Handoff icon (see Figure 6.9).

FIGURE 6.9
After you wake up your iPad, access the Dock and look for the appropriate app icon on the right end of the Dock (Notes is shown here).

 Note
To pick up what you were previously doing while currently using a Mac, simply open the app you were previously using on your other Mac or iOS mobile device.


 What's New
When using an iPhone, access the latest (compatible) app and its file, photo, or content that was previously being used on a Mac or iPad, wake up your iPhone, and double-press the Home button to access the App Switcher. You see a banner related to the compatible app at the bottom of the screen. Tap it to open the app, and access the content or file you were previously working with.

Handoff also works for answering incoming calls to your iPhone from your iPad or Mac that's in close proximity (around 33 feet). When you receive an incoming call on your phone, you can answer that incoming call and engage in the phone conversation using your iPad or Mac (which transforms into a speaker phone). If you have a phone headset (such as Apple EarPods or AirPods) connected to your iPad or Mac, you can use that to engage in a more private phone conversation that's actually being routed through your iPhone.

 Note
For this aspect of the Handoff feature to work, your iPad or Mac must be linked to the same Wi-Fi network as your iPhone, plus both devices must be signed in to the same iCloud account and have Bluetooth turned on.

Make sure the Handoff feature is turned on for both your iPhone and iPad (or Mac). When your iPhone receives an incoming call, you see a notification on your iPad or Mac's screen; tap or click the Answer icon to answer the call. If you want to initiate a call from your iPad or Mac (via your iPhone), tap or click a phone number in the Contacts, Calendar, Maps, or Safari apps, for example.
Another nice feature of Handoff is that you can send and receive SMS and MMS text messages via your cellular service provider's texting network (as opposed to Apple's Internet-based iMessage service) from your iPad or Mac. These incoming or outgoing messages use the Messages app running on your iPhone (with its cellular connection) as a conduit.

 More Info

7. Use iCloud and the Files App

In this Chapter
 Syncing files, documents, photos, and data via iCloud
 Getting acquainted with the iCloud Drive feature and the new Files app
 Taking advantage of iCloud's Family Sharing feature to share purchased content with up to five other family members

iCloud is Apple's cloud-based service, which has been designed from the ground up to work seamlessly with all iOS mobile devices and Macs. Functionality for using iCloud's various features and functions is built directly into the iOS 11 operating system, as well as the macOS High Sierra operating system.
If you're an iPhone, iPad, or Mac user, setting up a free iCloud account enables you to take full advantage of the latest features and functions built in to your smartphone, tablet, or computer.

 Tip
Regardless of how many separate Apple computers and mobile devices you own and use, you need only one iCloud account per person (not per device). Each of your Macs and iOS mobile devices should be linked to the same iCloud account to sync and access your app-specific data, photos, files, and content purchases.

Setting up an iCloud account is free, but if you need access to more than the 5GB of online storage space that comes with each account, you must purchase more online storage. The monthly fee structure for additional iCloud online storage space is shown in Table 7.1.
Table 7.1 iCloud Online Storage Space Fees*



iCloud Online Storage Space
Monthly Fee




5GB
Free


50GB
$0.99/£0.79


200GB
$2.99/£2.49


2TB
$9.99/£13.99



*Charges for the monthly fees are automatically billed to the debit or credit card linked to your Apple ID account as a recurring charge. For more information on pricing outside the U.S. and U.K., visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238.

 Caution
You can use the included 5GB of online storage space—plus any additional space you pay for—to store your app-specific data, backup files, photos, and personal files. In the past, online storage for your photos, as part of iCloud's My Photo Stream and Shared Photo Streams, was provided for free. This is no longer the case.
Using iCloud Photo Library, which is managed from the Photos app on your iPhone, iPad, or Macs, online photo storage now consumes some of your 5GB online storage allocation and any additional storage space you purchase (based on the size of your personal photo library). However, the additional online storage space required to store your iTunes Store, App Store, iBook Store, and other content purchases continues to be free.

Managing Your iCloud Storage Space
To see and manage how your iCloud online storage space is actually being allocated, launch Settings, tap your username/profile photo, tap the iCloud option, and then tap the Manage Storage option (below the Storage heading near the top of the submenu).
From the iCloud Storage screen (see Figure 7.1), you see how much online storage space is currently available, as well as how much is being consumed by photos, backups, documents, data, mail, and your other stored content related to specific apps.

FIGURE 7.1
The Storage screen enables you to see how your iCloud account's online storage is currently being used. (The iCloud account shown here has been upgraded to have 2TB of online storage space.)
To conserve online storage space in your iCloud account, delete iCloud backup files for old devices, or backups that are redundant and no longer needed. To do this, launch Settings, tap on your username/profile photo, tap the iCloud option, tap the Manage Storage option, and then tap the Backup option.
Under the Backups heading within the Info submenu (see Figure 7.2), tap any of your device-specific listings. Then, to delete that old or unwanted backup, tap the Delete Backup option.

 More Info
Each iCloud account also includes a free @icloud.com email account. Use it to send and receive email from any devices linked to your iCloud account. Once the account is set up, iCloud automatically keeps your email account synchronized via the Mail App. The storage space required for your email messages (and related file attachments) utilizes some of the 5GB of free iCloud online storage space provided.


FIGURE 7.2
To free up online storage space, consider deleting old or unwanted backup files.

 Note
When you first create an iCloud account, you're encouraged to use your existing Apple ID and username. This is to encourage Apple computer and mobile device users to use the same Apple ID to make all of their iTunes Store, App Store, and iBook Store purchases, as well as use that same Apple ID to access Apple's online-based iMessage instant messaging service, use the FaceTime video-calling service, and use iCloud's other functionality.
To create and manage your Apple ID account(s), visit https://appleid.apple.com from any computer or Internet-enabled device. When you set up iCloud, try to use iMessage or FaceTime, or try to access the iTunes Store or iBook Store for the first time, you also have the option to create an Apple ID account.
From your iPhone or iPad, to view and manage your Apple ID account, launch Settings, tap the iTunes & App Store option, and then tap the Apple ID option. Tap the View Apple ID option to access and manage your account, or tap the iForgot option to recover a forgotten Apple ID username or password.

Accessing Content Saved to iCloud
By default, as soon as you establish your free iCloud account, anytime you acquire and download content from the iTunes Store, App Store, or iBook Store, a copy of that content is automatically saved in your iCloud account, and it's immediately available on all of your compatible computers and iOS mobile devices that are linked to that iCloud account. This includes all past purchases and downloads.

 What's New
All music, podcasts, and audiobooks acquired from the iTunes Store, or that you access from Apple Music, are accessible from the new Apple HomePod speaker or Apple TV device that's connected to your television set.

So, if you hear an awesome new song on the radio and you immediately purchase and download it from the iTunes Store using your iPhone, that song is also stored in your iCloud account. You can access that same song from your computer(s), iPad, iPod touch, HomePod, or Apple TV device without having to repurchase it. This feature also works with TV shows and movies purchased from the iTunes Store.

 Note
Another benefit to using iCloud is that syncing can be done from anywhere via the Internet, without using iTunes Sync or requiring a physical cable connection between your iOS mobile device and your primary computer.

Your Mac(s) and iOS mobile devices share many of the same apps, including Contacts, Calendar, Reminders, Notes, Photos, Safari, News, Music, and Maps. Your personal data for each of these apps can easily be set up to sync between all of your computers and devices that are linked to the same iCloud account.
Once this feature is set up, it continues to work in the background. How to set up and use this feature is explained shortly.

 Note
The iTunes Sync process is still possible by installing the iTunes software onto your primary computer and then connecting your iOS mobile device using the supplied USB cable, but this process for backing up and syncing data is less convenient than using iCloud. (You can do the Wi-Fi iTunes Sync process without a cable as long as both devices are linked to the same wireless network.)
Because using the iTunes Sync process is considered an antiquated way to sync and back up data, this book focuses on using iCloud. If you're still interested in using iTunes Sync, however, visit Apple's website (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977) for more information on how to use this feature.

If you ever opt to delete a content purchase (such as an app, music, TV show episode, movie, eBook, or audiobook) from your iOS mobile device, you always have the option of downloading and installing it again, for free, from iCloud.

 Tip
Depending on how you set up the iTunes Store, App Store, and iBook Store to work with iCloud, you're able to automatically have all your computers and iOS mobile devices download all new music, apps, and eBook content you purchase, or you can do it manually.
To adjust these Automatic Downloads settings, launch Settings, select the iTunes & App Store option, and then turn on the virtual switches associated with Music, Apps, and Books & Audiobooks that are listed under the Automatic Downloads heading.
You can set up your iPhone or iPad to automatically update all your apps as new versions of previously installed apps are released. To do this, turn on the virtual switch associated with the Updates option, also listed below the Automatic Downloads heading.
Due to their large file sizes, automatic downloads are not possible for TV show episodes or movies acquired from the iTunes Store. However, you can download these purchases manually onto all your computers and iOS mobile devices linked to the same iCloud account.


 Note
Although your iTunes Store music purchases might represent a portion of your overall personal digital music library, chances are that your library also includes CDs (which you have ripped into digital format), as well as online music purchases and downloads from other sources (such as Amazon.com).
For an additional fee of $24.99 per year, consider upgrading your iCloud account by adding the iTunes Match services. This grants you full access to your entire personal digital music library (including non-iTunes Store purchases) from all of your computers and devices that are linked to the same iCloud account. To learn more about iTunes Match, visit www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-match.
Alternatively, for $9.99 per month, sign up for the Apple Music service (www.apple.com/apple-music), and have unlimited access to almost every song in the iTunes Store's digital music library (more than 40 million songs and albums) via the Music app.

Accessing Your Purchased iTunes Stores Content from Any Device
If you do not have the Automatic Downloads option enabled, you can still manually load iTunes Store purchases onto your device by following these steps:
1. Make sure that your iOS device is connected to the Internet via a cellular data or Wi-Fi connection.
2. Launch the iTunes Store app on your device. If prompted, when the Apple ID Password window pops up on your screen, use the virtual keyboard to enter your Apple ID password. (You can also use your device's Touch ID to scan your fingerprint. iPhone X users can use Face ID instead of manually entering their Apple ID passwords.)
3. On an iPhone, tap the More icon, and then tap the Purchased option. On an iPad, tap the Purchased icon displayed at the bottom of the screen. Then, tap the Music, Movies, or TV Shows tab, based on the type of purchased content you want to access.
4. If you tapped Music, for example, a listing of music you have purchased (listed alphabetically by the artist/band's name) is displayed. Tap one listing to see what music is available from that artist (see Figure 7.3). If you chose Movies in step 3, directly select a movie. If you selected TV Shows, a list of TV series that you own episodes for is displayed. Tap a series name to view a listing of complete seasons or individual episodes you've previously purchased.

 Tip
To see a listing of your most recently purchased content, tap a category (Music, Movies, or TV Shows, for example), and then tap Recent Purchases.

5. Tap the iCloud icons associated with specific listings, one at a time, to select content you want to download (or redownload) onto the iPhone or iPad you're currently using. If you're looking at a listing of TV Shows, tap the main show listing to download all episodes you own. Otherwise, tap the iCloud icon that's associated with the specific episode(s) you want to download.

 Tip
If you've acquired audiobooks, an additional tab is displayed alongside the Music, Movies, and TV Shows options for this content.

6. Within minutes (or faster, depending on the speed of your Internet connection), the content you selected to download is available to enjoy on the iOS mobile device you're currently using.

FIGURE 7.3
From the iTunes Store app, access and download your previous purchases by tapping the Purchased icon. Here, the Music option has been selected.
7. Exit the iTunes Store app.
8. Launch the Music or TV app on your iOS mobile device to experience the newly downloaded (or redownloaded) content. To listen to audiobooks acquired from iBook Store, launch the iBooks app.
Using iCloud to Sync Your App-Specific Data, Documents, and Files
Most cloud-based file-sharing services serve mainly as a place in cyberspace to remotely store files. In many cases, you must manually transfer those files to and from the "cloud." Thanks to iCloud's integration with iOS 11, though, many of the core apps that come with the latest version of this mobile operating system, as well as a growing number of third-party apps, automatically keep data and files created or managed using those apps synchronized with other devices and computers linked to the same iCloud account. In terms of iOS 11's preinstalled apps, those compatible with iCloud data syncing include Photos, Mail (relating only to your free iCloud-related email account), Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Notes, Safari, News, Home, and Wallet.

 Note
It's important to understand that the app-related synchronization feature offered by iCloud is different from iCloud Backup, which creates a complete backup of your iOS mobile device that is stored online as part of your iCloud account.

To have data automatically synced to iCloud, you must turn on the feature for each app. To customize which of your compatible apps use iCloud functionality, follow these steps:
1. Launch Settings.
2. Tap your username/profile photo.
3. Tap the iCloud option.
4. The iCloud submenu, which is also referred to as the iCloud Control Panel, appears (shown in Figure 7.4 on an iPhone and Figure 7.5 on an iPad).

 Note
It's imperative that all of your Macs and iOS mobile devices, as well as your Apple TV and HomePod(s), are linked to the same iCloud account.


FIGURE 7.4
From your iPhone, turn iCloud functionality on or off for specific preinstalled Apple apps from the iCloud menu in Settings.

FIGURE 7.5
From your iPad, turn iCloud functionality on or off for specific preinstalled Apple apps from the iCloud menu in Settings.
5. Below the Apps Using iCloud heading is a list of all preinstalled iCloud-compatible apps on your iOS device. To the right of each listing is a virtual on/off switch. To turn on the iCloud functionality associated with a specific app, set its related virtual switch to the On position.

 Note
Scroll down within the iCloud Control Panel to view a list of apps you have downloaded to your iPhone or iPad that enable you to store content, data, or files within iCloud or iCloud Drive. Turn on or off the virtual switch for each app to activate this feature.
To turn on the iCloud Drive feature, also from the iCloud Control Panel, turn on the virtual switch associated with iCloud Drive.

6. When you have turned on the iCloud functionality for all the apps that you want to synchronize via iCloud, press the Home button to exit Settings and save your changes.
7. Repeat this process on each of your iOS mobile devices. If you have an iPhone and an iPad, you must turn on the iCloud functionality for Contacts, for example, on both devices to keep Contacts data synchronized via iCloud on both devices.

 Note
After you've turned on the iCloud functionality for specific apps, to stay synchronized, each computer or device must have access to the Internet. For this use of iCloud on your iPhone or iPad, a cellular or a Wi-Fi Internet connection works fine. For certain other iCloud features, such as managing iCloud Photo Library functions or iCloud Backup, your iPhone or iPad requires a Wi-Fi Internet connection.

When you turn on the iCloud functionality related to the Contacts app, for example, your iOS mobile device automatically syncs your Contacts app database with iCloud. Thus, if you add or update an entry on your iPhone, it automatically synchronizes with the Contacts app running on your other iOS devices, as well as the compatible contact management software that's running on your computers (such as the Contacts app or Microsoft Outlook on your Mac). This is also true if you delete a Contacts entry from one device. It is almost instantly deleted from all of your other computers and iOS mobile devices linked to the same iCloud account. (Keep in mind, there is no "undo" option related to this feature.)
As you surf the Web using Safari, when you turn on iCloud syncing functionality related to this app, all your Bookmarks and Favorites data, along with your Reading List information and open browser window/tabs data, are synced via iCloud.
To share your photos between iOS devices, your primary computer, or an Apple TV device, from the iCloud submenu in Settings, tap the Photos option to turn on the iCloud Photo Library feature.

 Tip
iCloud Keychain can automatically store the usernames, passwords, and credit card information (for online purchases) related to all the websites you visit, which means you can automatically sign in to websites when you revisit them. You don't need to remember each username and password you associated with website accounts.
When this feature is turned on once on each of your iOS mobile devices and Macs, your iCloud Keychain database syncs automatically (and securely) across all iOS mobile devices and computers that are linked to the same iCloud account.


 Note
Bank- and personal finance-related websites purposely do not support the iCloud Keychain feature. When visiting sites that require added security, iCloud Keychain might be able to remember your username, but it cannot automatically remember your password.


 More Info
iCloud is fully compatible with Apple's optional iWork apps, which include Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheet management), and Keynote (for digital slide presentations).
Depending on which version of the Microsoft Office apps you're using (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook), some of these support iCloud, as well as Dropbox (www.dropbox.com) and Microsoft's OneDrive service (https://onedrive.live.com/about). Although Office 365 supports iCloud directly, with some other versions, you need to use the Save As option and then select iCloud as the file storage location.

Accessing Your App-Specific Data Online from iCloud.com
Another benefit of using iCloud to sync your app-specific data is that using any computer or Internet-enabled device, you can visit www.iCloud.com to run online versions of iOS 11 preinstalled apps populated with all your app-specific data.
To do this, log in to iCloud.com using your iCloud username and password (which is typically your Apple ID username and password). Online versions of the Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Photos, iCloud Drive, Notes, Reminders, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, News Publisher, Find Friends, Find My iPhone, and Settings apps are available. This is shown on a Mac using the Safari web browser in Figure 7.6.
If you forget your iPhone at home, for example, you can still securely access your complete Contacts database, your schedule, your to-do lists, and your notes from any Internet-enabled computer, whether or not that computer is typically linked to your iCloud account.
After you log in to iCloud.com, click the onscreen app icon for the app you want to use. Then be sure to sign off from iCloud.com when you're finished. To do this, click your username in the top-right corner of the browser window, and then click the Sign Out option.

FIGURE 7.6
Log in to www.iCloud.com to access your app-specific content using online versions of popular iPhone and iPad apps.

 Tip
From iCloud.com, you can access and manage files you manually store in the iCloud Drive portion of your iCloud account. This includes non-app-specific files. To do this, log in to iCloud.com and click the iCloud Drive icon. You can then access or manage your files, folders, and sub-folders from the iCloud Drive web browser window.
Near the top center of the iCloud Drive screen, from left to right, are command icons for creating a new file folder, as well as uploading, downloading, deleting, and sharing (via email) selected files. This can also be done from the iPhone or iPad using the new Files app, as described later in this chapter.


 Tip
Many iCloud features are now accessible from Windows-based PCs; however, you must download and install the free iCloud for Windows software onto your PC, which is available from this page of Apple's website: www.apple.com/icloud/setup/pc.html.

Creating a Photo Library Using iCloud
When it comes to photo sharing, backup, and syncing on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, everything is handled through the iCloud Photo Library portion of your iCloud account. You can manage these tasks from the Photos app that comes bundled with iOS 11, as well as the macOS High Sierra version of the operating system and Photos app for the Mac.
iCloud Photo Library automatically syncs your complete personal photo library with all the computers and mobile devices linked to the same iCloud account (including Windows PCs). Plus, you can share specific albums (or a group of selected photos from within an album) with specific people, yet keep the rest of your photo library private.
To customize options related to iCloud Photo Library, launch Settings, tap your username/profile photo, tap iCloud, and then tap Photos. From the Photos submenu (see Figure 7.7), turn on the virtual switch associated with iCloud Photo Library, and if you want to be able to share certain albums with others, turn on the iCloud Photo Sharing option. You must do this on all your iOS mobile devices and from the iCloud Preference Pane on your Mac or Control Panel on PC computers.

FIGURE 7.7
Use the Photos menu in Settings on your iPhone or iPad to customize the iCloud Photo Library feature.

 Note
One goal of iCloud Photo Library is to give you full online access to your entire digital images library, anytime, from any of your computers or iOS mobile devices. As a result of this content being readily available via the Internet, the need to store digital images on your mobile device will be reduced, so you will ultimately be able to free up internal storage space on your iPhone or iPad.
Depending on the size of your entire digital photo library, it might become necessary, however, to purchase additional iCloud online storage space to store all of your digital images.
If your iPhone or iPad's internal storage space is limited, access Settings, tap your username/profile photo, tap iCloud, tap Photos, and then select the Optimize iPhone [iPad] Storage option (rather than the Download and Keep Originals option). Doing this enables you to work with lower-resolution versions of your images on your iPhone/iPad while keeping the full-resolution versions of those images in your iCloud account. Thus, your iCloud Photo Library (that gets stored in your iPhone or iPad) requires a lot less storage space.

Backing Up with iCloud
Another useful feature of iOS 11 is the capability to create a backup of your iOS device wirelessly and have the related backup files stored online ("in the cloud"). To use this iCloud Backup feature, your iOS mobile device must be connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi. Your primary computer is not needed, so the backup can be created from anywhere, and you can later restore your device from wherever a Wi-Fi Internet connection is present.
When activated, your iOS mobile device automatically creates a backup to iCloud once per day. For this to happen, your iPhone or iPad also must be connected to an external power source and a wireless Internet network. However, at any time, you can manually create a backup of your device to iCloud from within Settings. This can be done when your device is running on battery.
Follow these steps to activate and use the iCloud Backup feature on an iPhone or iPad:
1. Connect your device to the Internet via a Wi-Fi connection.
2. Launch Settings.
3. Tap your username/profile photo.
4. Tap the iCloud option.
5. Scroll down and tap the iCloud Backup option.
6. Turn on the virtual switch that's associated with the iCloud Backup option.
7. Tap the Back Up Now option to manually begin creating a backup of your iOS mobile device at any time.

 Tip
The first time you use the iCloud Backup feature to create a wireless backup of your iOS device, the process could take up to an hour (or longer), depending on how much data you have stored on your device.
In the future, the iCloud Backup process takes place once per day, automatically, when your iOS device is not otherwise in use. These backups save all newly created or revised files and data only, so subsequent iCloud Backup procedures are much quicker.
At the bottom of the Backup screen within Settings, the time (and date, if it's not the current day) of the last backup is displayed.

The purpose of creating and maintaining a backup of your device is so that you have a copy of all your apps, data, files, content, and personalized settings stored if something goes wrong with your device. If and when you need to access the backup to restore your device using iCloud, when prompted, choose the Restore from iCloud option. Likewise, if your iPhone or iPad gets lost or stolen and you replace it, you can restore the content from your old device onto the new one.

 Tip
To be able to restore your iOS mobile device completely from an iCloud Backup, you also need to turn on and be syncing app-compatible apps. Turn on these app-specific features from the iCloud Control Panel menu.

Sharing Purchased Content with Family Sharing
Thanks to iCloud's Family Sharing feature, up to six people can share some or all of their content purchases, while each person retains his or her own private iCloud account. With Family Sharing, you also have access to a Family folder in the Photos app that enables participating family members to share selected photos by placing them in this album. All other photos, however, remain private.
To set up a Family Sharing account, one adult in the family needs to turn on the feature and then invite up to five other family members. Launch Settings, tap your username/profile photo, tap iCloud option, and then tap the Set Up Family Sharing option.
One drawback to this feature is that the person setting up Family Sharing must choose one iCloud account associated with a credit card from which all purchases by all family members will be paid from this point forward. (This doesn't apply to gift cards, which are deducted from only the specific user's account.) The upside is that by using Family Sharing, parents can now approve their kids' spending for online content and in-app purchases as well as set spending limits.
As soon as Family Sharing is set up and the family members respond to the email invitation to participate, each person's music, TV shows, movies, eBooks, and compatible apps become available to everyone else. However, each family member can keep selected content purchases and photos private.

 Tip
Before a family member accepts a Family Sharing invitation, his iOS mobile device (or Mac) must already be signed in to his personal iCloud account.

When everyone is active with Family Sharing, the members of the group access each other's previously purchased content by launching the iTunes Store app, iBooks app (to access iBook Store), or the App Store app (to access apps), and tap the Purchased option. Select a family member from the displayed menu. The purchased content already acquired by that family member is displayed and becomes downloadable by others. All new purchases are considered acquired by the primary account used to manage the Family Sharing option.

 Tip
If you're a parent, turn on the Ask to Buy option when setting up the Family Sharing feature. Then when a child (under age 18) who is linked to the account wants to make a content purchase, the parent receives a text message asking them to approve the purchase. This approval is also required when a child wants to acquire free content.

In addition to the other Family Sharing features, events can be created and shared within an automatically created Family calendar using the Calendar app. Any participating family member can create an event with the Calendar app, like they normally would, and choose the Family calendar in the Calendar option in the New Event screen.
To view the Family calendar from the Calendar app, tap the Calendars option and then tap the Family option to select the Family calendar for viewing.
Any participating member can add or delete events from the Family calendar; however, any other calendars being managed by each person's Calendar app remain separate and private.

 Note
With Family Sharing, a Family list is created automatically in the Reminders app. This allows for centralized lists to be accessed and viewed by all participating family members. All other lists stored in each person's Reminders app are kept private (unless you opt to share your other lists as well).


 Note
If you use the Find My Friends app, you can deactivate the Share My Location feature and block family members from viewing your current location. This cannot be done from a child's Apple ID/iCloud account if the account was set up as a Child Account.

Like all of iCloud's features and functions, what's possible with Family Sharing will evolve over time. To learn more about this feature, visit www.apple.com/icloud/family-sharing.
Discovering the New Files App
If you're a veteran iPhone/iPad user, when you upgraded from iOS 10 to iOS 11, you probably noticed that the iCloud Drive app is missing. In its place is the new Files app.
The Files app enables you to remotely access the iCloud Drive portion of your iCloud account as long as your mobile device has Internet access. However, beyond just accessing files stored in iCloud Drive, the Files app offers additional functionality. For example, you can do the following:
 Access and manage files stored online within your accounts with compatible cloud-based services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box.com (see Figure 7.8). You're also able to locate and work with files stored locally on the mobile device you're using.

FIGURE 7.8
Access files from iCloud Drive, Dropbox, and other compatible cloud-based services from one app. Each service that's linked to the app is displayed below the Locations heading (shown here on the iPhone).
 Once you access a specific cloud-based account, you can view the contents of folders and subfolders, move files around, and create or delete folders and subfolders as needed.
 Upon opening a folder or subfolder, tap any file icon or listing to view a preview of that file. Figure 7.9 shows the preview of a sample Word document. However, if it's a photo, graphic, or PDF, for example, you can use Preview mode to annotate or mark up the file. Other types of files you can simply view in Preview mode.

FIGURE 7.9
Use Preview mode to review and annotate files, including Word and Pages documents, PowerPoint and Keynote presentation files, and Excel and Numbers spreadsheet files.

 Tip
When viewing the contents of an online-based folder or subfolder, you're able to create a new folder (or subfolder) and then move specific files into it. How this is done varies slightly based on which service you're using. Look for a Create Folder icon when browsing your folders or subfolders on a specific service via the Files app.

 As you're previewing a file, you can print the file or move it to another cloud-based location by tapping the Share icon to access the Share menu.
 From the File app's Share menu (see Figure 7.10), you can copy the selected file directly into a compatible app that's installed on your iPhone or iPad. For example, if you're accessing a Word document, you can copy that file into Word or Pages. If it's a PDF, you copy the file into iBooks or a third-party app for working with PDFs, such as PDF Expert.

FIGURE 7.10
Once you're previewing a selected file, you can import it into a compatible app that's installed on your mobile device. For example, a Word document can be imported and opened within Microsoft Word (or Pages).
 You can share specific files, subfolders, or folders with other people via the Share menu. You can use AirDrop, email, instant/text message (via the Messages app), or social media. Use the Add People option to collaborate with other people while working with a specific file.
Finding Files in the Cloud
The Files app offers several ways to quickly find specific files. For example, upon launching the Files app, within the Search field, enter a filename, date, file type, or any keyword that will help you quickly find a file you have stored in the cloud.

 Note
On an iPhone, the Browse screen includes a Search field, Locations menu (which allows you to access a specific service that the Files app is linked with), as well as a Favorites and Tags section. After you select an option, a new screen opens.
On an iPad, the Browse options are displayed along the left margin of the screen. The Search field is located near the top-center of the screen, and the contents of the selected service (and the folder or subfolder you select) are on the right side of the screen.
Once you select a file to preview, it fills the entire screen of an iPhone or iPad. Depending on the file type you're previewing, both the Markup/Annotation icon and the Share icon is displayed. (When the Markup/Annotation feature isn't available, you see just the Share icon.) The iPhone displays the Markup/Annotation icon in the top-right corner of the screen and the Share icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen. On an iPad, both icons are displayed in the top-right corner of the screen.
When you're finished working with the file, tap Done, which is in the top-left corner of the screen on both the iPhone and iPad.

Alternatively, tap the Locations option to select a specific cloud-based service the app is linked with, and search for files on that service.
To find a file you were recently working with, tap the Recents icon and then select a file to preview.
If there are specific files stored in the cloud that you work with or frequently access, use the Files app's Favorites tool to add these to your Favorites list.
To make files, folders, or subfolders more identifiable from within the Files app, you can color-code them, and add tags to them. Then, you can search, sort, and view files based on their color coding or text-based tag(s).
To assign a color-coded tag to a file, preview the file, tap the Share icon, and near the top-right corner of the share menu, tap the +Tag option (refer to Figure 7.10). Select a tag color from the displayed menu.

 Note
When viewing the contents of a folder or subfolder that's stored online within Cloud Drive, you're able to sort and display files by Name, Date, Size, or Tags. To do this, tap the Sorted By option near the top-center of the screen.

At the same time, you can also assign one or more text tags to a file. To this this, scroll down and tap on one or more of the displayed tags that you want to link with the file.
To create a new text tag and add it to your master list, as well as the file you're working with, tap Add New Tag. When prompted, enter a new tag, such as Meeting Notes, Ideas, Urgent, or a client's name. You're also able to assign a color to text tags.

 Tip
You can set up the Files app to work with iOS 11's Spotlight Search feature and Siri, which means you have more ways to quickly find content that's stored in one of your compatible accounts.
To set up this function, launch Settings, tap the Siri & Search feature, and scroll down to the Files app listing and tap it. Turn on the virtual switch associated with the Search & Siri Suggestions option.


 Tip
As you're viewing a directory of files within a folder or subfolder on an iPad Pro, press and hold your finger on a file listing or icon. Then you can drag the file to another location displayed under the Browse menu, or tap one of the command tabs above the file. Command icons include Copy, Duplicate, Rename, Move, Delete, Share, Tags, and Info.


 Tip
If you have an Apple Watch linked with your iPhone, you can use a photo from your iPhone as your watch face. Open a photo or graphic file with the Files app, tap the Share icon, tap the Create Watch Face icon.

Marking Up or Annotating a File
The markup and annotation features become available when you preview a compatible file (such as a PDF, graphic file, or digital image) within the Files app. From the Preview screen, tap the Markup/Annotation icon to reveal a collection of virtual writing and drawing tools. Select a tool, and then tap on a virtual ink color (shown in Figure 7.11). On an iPhone or iPad, use our finger to write or draw directly on your device's screen to annotate or mark up the compatible file you're previewing.

FIGURE 7.11
Use the markup/annotation tools built into the Files app to alter your digital images and PDFs.

 Note
The markup and annotation functionality built into the Files app works extremely well with an iPad Pro when used in conjunction with an Apple Pencil.


 Tip
How to use the Markup and Annotation functions of the Files app (with any iPhone or iPad model), as well as the ability to add text, lines, shapes, arrows, or a digital signature to a file you're previewing, is covered in greater detail in Chapter 3, "Take Advantage of iOS 11 Features for the iPad."

Collaborating on Files
The Add People option in the Files app (see Figure 7.12) allows you to select one or more people to collaborate with on a file. As changes are made, everyone you're collaborating with sees the changes—nearly in real time. From the Add People screen, choose how to send an Add People invitation. You also can tap the Share Options banner to choose what collaborators will be able to do with the shared file.

FIGURE 7.12
Use the Add People option offered by the File app to collaborate with others and simultaneously work with the same file, such as a Word document or Excel spreadsheet.







8. Navigate and Interact with Your World using the Maps App

In this Chapter
 Using the Maps app to obtain turn-by-turn directions between two locations
 Finding any address, landmark, point of interest, or business on a map
 Getting real-time public transportation information

The iOS 11 edition of the Maps app once again introduces an impressive collection of improvements that allow the app to work on its own, in conjunction with other iOS 11 features (including Siri, CarPlay, and the Apple Watch), or seamlessly with other popular apps, including Yelp!, Uber, Lyft, and OpenTable. Maps can be used for a lot more than just obtaining navigation directions!
Using Maps for More than Just Real-Time Navigation
The iOS 11 edition of the Maps app is now better than ever at providing accurate, turn-by-turn navigation directions between two locations using the iPhone or iPad's built-in GPS (Location Services) capabilities, in conjunction with the Internet. With this version of Maps, more information is clearly displayed on the screen and simultaneously provided to you verbally.
For example, when you're using Maps for driving directions, on the screen you see the posted speed limit for the road you're driving along (see Figure 8.1). Maps also shows you the best lane to be in when a turn is coming up or lanes are merging.

FIGURE 8.1
As you're driving, the Maps app displays a lot of useful information to help you reach your desired destination as safely and as quickly as possible.
Following are some of the other enhancements made to this version of Maps:
 Proactive suggestions—Based on your past use of the app, and information included within other apps, such as Calendar, the Maps app predicts your intended destination, and determines the fastest way to reach that destination based on traffic conditions, your schedule, and other factors. For example, the Maps app consults with the Calendar app to determine the time and location of your next appointment. When you're leaving a destination, it offers intelligent suggestions based on where you might want to go next, such as home or back to your office.
 Search—The Search tool built into the Maps app is now even more useful when it comes to looking up information about businesses, restaurants, points of interest, and services (such as banks, ATMs, gas stations, or hospitals). Use the improved Nearby feature to see what restaurants, coffee shops, services, and shopping are near your location. To access this feature while using turn-by-turn navigation, tap anywhere near the bottom of the screen (except for the End button) to reveal the Nearby menu.
 Mass transit information—If you use mass transit in an ever-growing number of cities around the world, the Maps app determines your current location and helps you map a route using local trains, buses, subways, and ferries (if applicable). The Maps app uses the Internet to access current schedules and provides step-by-step directions to help you navigate a city's mass transit system.
 Indoor maps—This new feature allows you to access detailed maps of major airports and shopping centers (malls) around the world so you can navigate more efficiently. For example, while in an airport, the Maps app can help you discover what dining options are available in your terminal, find the closest restroom, and guide you directly to your gate (or from your gate to baggage claim).
 Interactive favorites—As you travel around, if you discover a restaurant, business, attraction, or any other location you want to remember so you can come back to it sometime later, add that destination to the Maps app's Favorites list. This information syncs with your iCloud account, so whether you're using Maps on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, your selection of favorite locations is always accessible.

 Tip
As you're looking at a listing for an address, business, service, or point of interest, simply tap the Favorite button to add the location to your Favorites list.
To later access your favorites list, access the Maps app's Search field and then scroll to the bottom of the listed search results/search history. Tap the Favorites listing to access your Favorites list. Tap the desired destination.


 More Info
To quickly determine in what cities around the world specific Maps features work in, visit www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#maps.


 Tip
When you're using the turn-by-turn, real-time navigation function of the Maps app and you need to find a nearby gas station, restaurant, or coffee shop, simply tap anywhere along the bottom of the screen (except for on the End button), and then tap the Gas Stations, Dinner, or Coffee icon (see Figure 8.2).
If you tap the Gas Stations icon (or Dinner or Coffee icons), you see a listing of nearby gas stations. Tap the Go button that corresponds to the listing you'd like to choose. The Maps app automatically reroutes you to that destination. After you've visited the gas station, Maps enables you to continue to your original destination without having to re-enter any information into the app.
Your expected arrival time, the amount of time until you reach your final destination, and the current distance from your final destination will be updated to take into account the requested detour.


FIGURE 8.2
Finding the closest gas station, restaurant, or coffee shop while en route to your destination is easy.

 Note
To switch between using the iPhone's built-in speaker, a Bluetooth phone headset, or CarPlay (when applicable) while you're using the Maps app for real-time navigation, tap anywhere along the bottom of the screen (except for on the End button), and then tap the Audio icon (refer to Figure 8.2).
From the Output heading on the Navigation Voice screen, choose where you want the Maps app's audio to be played. Also from this screen, tap one of the volume options to change the volume of the voice prompts. Turn on the Pause Spoken Audio option if you want music, podcasts, or audiobooks to pause when the Maps app needs to speak.

As always, the Maps app requires continuous Internet access to function. Although the app works with a Wi-Fi connection, if you plan to use the app's turn-by-turn directions (Navigation) feature, you must use a cellular data connection (which uses up some of your monthly wireless data allocation with each use) because you'll be in motion and will quickly leave the wireless signal radius of any public Wi-Fi hotspot.

 Tip
While on the go, if you have a Wi-Fi Only iPad, consider using the Personal Hotspot feature built into your iPhone to create a private Wi-Fi network that will travel with you and that your iPad can utilize, or invest in a standalone personal Wi-Fi hotspot device, such as the SkyRoam Solis ($149.99, www.skyroam.com/solis). This device is ideal for international travelers using an iPhone or iPad, who don't want to incur high international cellular data roaming charges) when using the Maps app.

You can use a Wi-Fi connection to preload driving or public transportation directions before your departure, but if your route changes, your iOS mobile device isn't able to help if it can't connect to thet Internet.

 Note
If you're wearing an Apple Watch that's paired with your iPhone, navigation information is automatically and simultaneously displayed on your watch. If you're using an Apple Watch series 3 with a cellular connection, the Maps app works without the assistance of a nearby iPhone.

To use the Maps app, the main Location Services feature in your iPhone or iPad (as well as Location Services for the Maps app) must be turned on. To do this, launch Settings, tap the Privacy option, and then tap Location Services. From the Location Services submenu, turn on the Location Services switch near the top of the screen. Then scroll down and tap the Maps option. Be sure that the While Using the App option is selected.
Setting Maps App Preferences
To customize your Maps experience, launch Settings and tap the Maps option. From the Maps submenu (see Figure 8.3), select the default Preferred Transportation Type for the way you'll most often be using the app. If you'll typically be in your car and want driving directions, choose Driving. If you'll most often be using the app while walking, choose the Walking option. If you rely mainly on public transportation to get around, select the Transit option. Of course, you can always override this default selection while actually using the Maps app.

FIGURE 8.3
Use Settings to customize your preferences for the app.
Also from the Maps submenu within Settings, tap the Driving & Navigation option to personalize preferences related to options for navigating. For example, from under the Avoid heading, turn on the Tolls or Highways option if you want to avoid tolls or highways when the Maps app plans your routes.
From the Driving & Navigation screen (see Figure 8.4), you can turn on or off the onscreen compass display, determine whether you want the current posted speed limit displayed on the screen, and set a default volume for the computerized voice that you hear when being provided with turn-by-turn navigation instructions.

FIGURE 8.4
The Driving & Navigation submenu within Settings.

 Note
From the Maps menu within Settings (refer to Figure 8.3), you can select whether the app should measure distances in miles or kilometers and whether all map labels should be translated into English. If your car is capable of communicating with your iPhone (via CarPlay or Bluetooth), use the Show Parked Location option so your parking location is recorded and temporarily marked in the app every time you park.


 Tip
If you plan to use Uber or Lyft often, you can request a ride directly from the Maps app. To do this, you must have an active Uber or Lyft account and have the official Uber or Lyft mobile app installed on your iPhone or iPad. From the Maps submenu within Settings, look for the Ride Book Extensions heading and turn on the virtual switch associated with the app you use.

Getting the Most from Using the Maps App's Features
In addition to providing detailed maps, the Maps app is capable of displaying useful information within each map, including real-time, color-coded traffic conditions showing traffic jams, accidents, and construction, which can be graphically overlaid onto maps.

 Note
Mild traffic is showcased using orange, and heavy traffic is depicted in red. When construction is being done on a roadway, separate construction icons (in yellow or red) are displayed on the map.

When you look up a business, restaurant, point of interest, or landmark, the Maps app seamlessly integrates with Yelp! to display detailed information about specific locations.
The Yelp! information screens are interactive, so if you're using an iPhone and tap a phone number or the Call button, you can initiate a call to that business or restaurant. Likewise, if you tap a website URL or the Website button (on either an iPhone or iPad), Safari launches and the applicable website automatically loads and displays.

 Tip
To enhance the capabilities of the Yelp! integration, download and install the optional (and free) Yelp! app from the App Store. Without the Yelp! app, when appropriate, the Maps app transfers you to the Yelp! website. To be able to make restaurant reservations after using the Maps app to look up restaurants, also install the free OpenTable app onto your iPhone.
Once you install the Yelp! app, launch Settings, tap Maps, and from below the Table Booking Extensions heading, turn on the virtual switch associated with Yelp!. If you have the Open Table app installed on your iPhone or iPad and use it to make restaurant reservations, turn on the virtual switch for OpenTable from this menu as well to allow the Maps app to seamlessly share information with either or both of these apps.

Although Maps offers a lot of functionality packed into a standalone app, it's also designed to work with many other apps. For example, as you're viewing an entry in the Contacts app, when you tap an address, the Maps app launches and displays that address on a map. You can then quickly obtain detailed directions to that location from your current location, or from any address you select. This also works with any address displayed in almost any other app, such as Calendar, Mail, Messages, Notes, or Safari.

 Tip
Any time you receive a text message or view a Calendar event that has an address included within it, iOS 11 automatically determines you're looking at an address and turns it into an active link. Tap this link to launch the Maps app and view the address or obtain directions to or from that address.


 Tip
When creating or editing a Calendar event, by filling in the Add Location field, the iPhone or iPad is automatically able to calculate travel time from your current location to the destination. You can turn on a feature that alerts you when it's time to leave based on the anticipated travel time and current traffic conditions.

You can use many features built in to the Maps app using voice commands and requests, thanks to Siri. For example, regardless of what you're doing on the iPhone or iPad, activate Siri and say, "How do I get home from here?" "Where is the closest Starbucks?" or "Where is the closest gas station?" and then have the Maps app provide you with the directions and map you need.
Understanding the Maps App's Screen
The main screen of the iOS 11 edition of the Maps app sometimes displays a tiny compass in the upper-right corner of a map, as well as a map scale in the top-left corner of a map. The compass displays automatically when North isn't toward the top of the screen. The map scale appears if you're scrolling around a map using your finger or zooming in or out. From the Maps menu within Settings, you can also turn on the compass (driving direction indicator) and have it continuously displayed whenever you're using the Maps app and viewing interactive maps.
When you launch the app, the top section of the iPhone's display showcases a map. Tap the Info (i) icon to change your map view. Options include Map, Transit, or Satellite. From the Maps Settings menu, turn on the virtual switch associated with Traffic to superimpose real-time traffic conditions on the maps you view (see Figure 8.5).

FIGURE 8.5
From the Maps Settings menu, choose your maps view (Map, Transit, or Satellite), plus turn on/off real-time traffic conditions.
When viewing the main map screen, tap the My Location icon near the top-right corner of the screen to pinpoint your current location on the map, and center the map around that location. When you're using turn-by-turn navigation, your location is displayed on the map using a circular icon with an arrow in it.

 Note
When looking at a map of your current location, the current temperature is displayed in the bottom-right corner of the map.

Just below the map is the Search for a Place or Address field. Tap this field and manually enter your desired destination. Keep in mind that as you enter content into this field, the Maps app pulls information from the Contacts and Calendar apps, other compatible apps, and a vast database containing points of interest, businesses, and restaurants.

 What's New
Below the Search for a Place or Address field is a list of recent destinations as well as what Apple refers to as "proactive suggestions," for potential destinations. The suggestions are based on your recent activities and data found in other apps.


 Tip
In the Search for a Place or Address field, instead of manually typing the address of your desired destination, you can type the name of a point of interest, airport, restaurant, service, or business.
For example, if you type "Chinese restaurant" into this field, you see a list of Chinese restaurants that are close to your current location. However, if you want to find Chinese restaurants in another city and state, include the location in your search term—Chinese Restaurants, White Plains, New York, for example.
As you type in this field, the Maps app displays applicable search results. Tap a search result listing to select it.
Alternatively, tap the empty Search for a Place or Address field and then tap the Food, Drinks, Shopping, Travel, Services, Fun, Health, or Transport icon to seek out local businesses or services by category (see Figure 8.6). If necessary, tap a subcategory icon. Next, tap one of the search result listings that are of interest.
When you tap a listing, information about it is displayed (see Figure 8.7). If it's a business or restaurant, for example, the business/restaurant name, phone number, address, website URL, and other details are displayed. Tap the Directions button to quickly obtain directions from your current location to the desired location.
Tap the Call, Website, Favorite, or Share button to call the business, visit its website, add it to your Maps Favorite list, or share details about the business with others.


FIGURE 8.6
Instead of typing what you're looking for into the Where Do You Want to Go? field, tap one of the category icons, tap a subcategory icon (if applicable), and then tap a result listing.

FIGURE 8.7
When you look up a business, restaurant, service, or point of interest, details about it are displayed (based on content supplied by Yelp!). Tap the Directions button to obtain directions to that location.

 Tip
While viewing any map, tap a listed point of interest or business that's displayed in the map itself to view details about it. The information window is fully interactive. For example, if you tap the phone number or Call button, a call to that business is initiated using the Phone app (on the iPhone).
Tap the Directions button to obtain turn-by-turn directions from your current location to the selected destination.

Anytime you look up a listing in the Maps app, information appears in a window. Use your finger to drag this window up or down on the screen to see more or less of its content (see Figure 8.8).

FIGURE 8.8
Anytime you look up information about a business, point of interest, restaurant, or service, details about it are acquired from Yelp! and displayed in an adjustable-size window.

 Tip
In the Search for a Place or Address field, enter the name of any contact that has an entry stored in the Contacts app to find and display an address for that contact. Navigation details (directions) can be provided. The Maps app searches the contents of your iOS device (including the Contacts app), followed by a web-based search, if applicable.

As you're viewing a map, place one finger on the screen and drag it around to reposition the map. To rotate the map, place two fingers (slightly separated) on the screen, and rotate your fingers clockwise or counterclockwise. To then return to the north-up orientation, tap the compass icon.
Use a reverse-pinch finger gesture to zoom in or a pinch finger gesture to zoom out. If you're using the Satellite or Flyover Tour view, you can zoom in very close, and then drag your finger around the map to take a bird's-eye tour of the area.
Using the Mark My Location Option
To mark your current location on the map, tap the Info (i) icon to reveal the Maps Settings menu (refer to Figure 8.5) and then tap the Mark My Location option. A virtual pushpin is added to the map. You can then tap the Edit Location button to fine-tune the stored address, or tap the Directions button to obtain directions to that location if you want to return back to it later.
Tap the Share icon to share the marked location with other people via text message or email, for example. You can also add the marked location to the Maps app's Favorites list, create a new Contacts entry using the address, or add the address to an existing Contacts entry by tapping one of the options displayed if you scroll down in the Marked Location window.

 Tip
The Mark Location tool is ideal to help you remember where you parked your car. You must manually use this feature, unless your car is equipped with CarPlay or there's an established Bluetooth connection between your vehicle and your iPhone.

Managing Your Favorites List
The Maps app offers a Favorites list feature, which enables you to maintain a listing of places you commonly visit or want to be able to quickly refer to later. When looking at the information screen for any potential destination, tap the Favorite button to add that address to the Maps app's Favorites list.
To access your Favorites list, look below the Search for a Place or Address field and scroll down. Tap the Favorites option. A listing of your Favorite locations is displayed. Tap any listing to obtain information or navigation directions.
Swipe from right to left across a Favorites listing to access Remove and Share buttons. These enable you to manage your Favorites list.
Switching the Map View
When you're viewing a map, you can switch between viewing perspectives. Options include the following:
 Maps—This is the Maps app's standard view (see Figure 8.9). Roads and their names are displayed, along with points of interest, businesses, and services (including gas stations, restaurants, and hospitals). The posted speed limit and traffic conditions can also be displayed.

FIGURE 8.9
The standard Maps view. The orange line indicates mild traffic ahead, and the blue line indicates no traffic.
 Transit—When applicable, this map view displays public transportation maps for trains, subways, buses, and ferries. This map view (see Figure 8.10) is particularly useful when you're relying on public transportation in a major city, like New York City or London. Notice each bus and subway line is color-coded.
 Satellite—The map is displayed as a detailed satellite image (see Figure 8.11). When you choose this option, you can turn on or off virtual switches that allow traffic conditions and labels to be displayed, in addition to the multidimensional images. Tap on the 2D or 3D button to toggle between these viewing options.

FIGURE 8.10
Navigate your way around a city using a detailed public transit map. Shown here is the Times Square area of New York City.

FIGURE 8.11
The Satellite view utilizes detailed (multidimensional) satellite imagery to show a location on a map. Shown here is a 3D view of Times Square in New York City with traffic information superimposed.

 Tip
When you look up any business using the Maps app, if you then view the location of the business with the Satellite view, you can often determine the best nearby location for parking. Consider dropping a pin on that location, and then using turn-by-turn directions to get you to that spot. There are also third-party apps, like Parker, that can help you find a parking spot or paid parking lot in a major city.

Obtaining Turn-By-Turn Directions
To obtain navigation information to a particular destination, enter it into the Search for a Place or Address field, or select it from a search result listing after you tap a category, such as Food, Drinks, Shopping, Travel, Services, Fun, Health, or Transit.
Displayed immediately below a search result listing is a blue-and-white Directions button. This button displays your current driving distance to that location. Tap the Directions button to access the Maps app's trip overview screen (see Figure 8.12).

FIGURE 8.12
The trip overview screen outlines up to three possible routes, and provides estimated travel times for each, along with additional information.

 Note
By default, the Maps app uses your current location as the default starting location. To change this and select any other starting location, after entering or choosing your desired destination, and tapping the Directions button, tap the From My Location option below the To information, and then manually enter your starting location.
For example, if you're currently in Boston, Massachusetts, but you want to see directions between New York's Time Square and New York's LaGuardia Airport, in the Search for a Place or Address field, type LaGuardia Airport, New York. Tap the Directions button, and then tap the From My Location option. In the From field, type Times Square, New York (refer to Figure 8.12).
In the To and From fields, you can enter a contact entry's name, a full address, a city and state, just a state, or just a country. You can use two-letter state abbreviations, and you don't have to worry about using upper- and lowercase letters. For example, you can type New York, NY, new york, ny, or New York, New York, and get the same result. This goes for contacts or business names as well.
Choose your desired mode of transportation (Drive, Walk, Transit, or Ride), and then choose your selected route from up to three options. Tap the Go button to launch Navigation mode and begin receiving turn-by-turn directions.

When you tap a destination option, the Maps app calculates your distance from it and displays up to three separate routes on the map (refer to Figure 8.12). The recommended route is displayed with a dark blue line. Tap the route option you want to follow.

 Note
The Maps app takes current traffic conditions into account. So if you think the app is recommending a route that's longer (in terms of driving distance to your destination), it could be to avoid heavy traffic. Thus, the recommendation could ultimately result in a shorter travel time.
As you're driving to your desired destination, the Maps app analyzes traffic conditions ahead of you, and, if necessary, recommends an alternative route to save time. Maps notifies you that a time-saving route is available, and you have the option of following the alternate route.

Below the map, tap the Go button to choose the selected route and driving directions. Alternatively, tap the Walk, Transit, or Ride icon to alter your mode of transportation:
 Drive—Obtain real-time, turn-by-turn navigation directions for driving to your destination.
 Walk—Obtain real-time, turn-by-turn navigation directions for walking to your destination.
 Transit—Obtain real-time directions for using public transportation to reach your desired destination. This option is not yet available in all cities around the world. When it is available, the best option for using buses, trains, subways, and ferries are provided.
 Ride—Request a ride using Uber, Lyft, or another compatible taxi, limo, or ride-sharing service. Thus far, this feature is available only in certain major cities, and you must have the ride service's optional app (such as Uber or Lyft) installed on your mobile device.
After you select the mode of transportation, tap the green-and-white Go button to begin receiving real-time, fully narrated, turn-by-turn directions to your destination.
Displayed in the main area of the screen is a detailed map that shows where you are and where you're headed. Along the top of the screen, information about the next turn or driving direction is listed. Along the bottom of the screen, your estimated time of arrival, the amount of time remaining in your trip, and the current distance between your current location and your desired destination is displayed (see Figure 8.13). A compass (or the direction you're traveling) and the posted speed limit can also be displayed.
This information continuously changes as you travel toward your destination and automatically updates based on your travel speed and traffic conditions.

FIGURE 8.13
Navigation mode offers real-time, turn-by-turn directions, as well as detailed information about your current trip.

 Tip
Tap the End button to exit out of the navigation mode of the Maps app before reaching your destination.
While you're using the navigation feature of the Maps app, you can use the App Switcher to switch between apps, and use the iPhone or iPad to run another app. The Maps app continues running in the background and alerts you of upcoming turns or directions.
If you receive an incoming call on your iPhone, for example, the Phone app launches but the Maps app continues running in the background. When you switch to another app, with the navigation mode of the Maps app continuing to run, a blue bar pulses at the top of the screen that says Touch to Return to Navigation (see Figure 8.14). Tap it to return to the Maps app.


FIGURE 8.14
While the Maps app is providing real-time, turn-by-turn navigation instructions, you can exit out of the app and use a different app or iOS 11 feature.
Tap anywhere on the bottom information bar (except on the End button, which is shown in Figure 8.13) to reveal an icon menu of additional options (refer to Figure 8.2):
 Gas Station, Dinner, or Coffee icon—Take a detour and find the closest gas station, restaurant, or coffee shop, respectively.
 Overview—Switch to a different map view that showcases the entire route from your starting point to your selected destination. Tap the Resume icon to switch back to Navigation mode.
 Details—See a listing of all turns and directions you'll need to follow to reach your desired destination. Swipe down or up in this list to see upcoming directions. Tap Done to return to Navigation mode.
Looking Up Contact Entries, Businesses, Restaurants, Landmarks, and Points of Interest
One of the other primary uses of the Maps app is to find and display addresses, contacts, businesses, points of interest, or landmarks on a map screen. To do this, launch the Maps app, and in the Search for a Place or Address field, enter what you're looking for.
The following are some things you can enter in this field:
 A contact's name from your Contact's database. The Maps app looks up that contact's address that's stored in the Contacts app.
 The specific name of any business or restaurant. (If it's not nearby, type the business or restaurant name, followed by a comma, and then the city, state, and country). The Maps app looks up the business or restaurant's address on the Internet, displays it, and gives you the option to receive directions to it.
 The type of business or restaurant you're looking for, such as Chinese restaurant, seafood restaurant, bank, dry cleaner, or hospital. Enter a business or restaurant type to find nearby listings, or also include the city, state, and country to look up listings in other locations.
 The name of a point of interest or landmark. This can include the name of a major airport, or a landmark, such as the Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, The White House, The Golden Gate Bridge, London Eye, or Tower of London. You do not need to know the address for a point of interest. The Maps app maintains a vast database of them.
 Any full address that you manually enter (that is, street, city, state, country).
 The name of a city, state, or country.

 Tip
When looking up a famous landmark or popular city, you can often tap the Flyover Tour button to view a three-dimensional and animated virtual tour (from a visually impressive, helicopter-like viewing perspective).
Figure 8.15 shows a sample of what a Flyover Tour of The Statue of Liberty in New York City looks like. Tap the Start City Tour button to begin the animated virtual tour or place your finger on the screen and drag it around to manually explore the city. While doing this, zoom in or out using the reverse-pinch or pinch finger gestures.


 Tip
If you're looking for businesses or services in your immediate area, tap the My Location icon first (it's located in the top-right corner of the screen), so the iPhone or iPad pinpoints your location, and then enter what you're searching for into the Search for a Place or Address field. No city or state needs to be entered.
However, if you don't tap the My Location icon first, you must enter into the Search for a Place or Address field what you're looking for, followed by the city, a comma, and the state, to find local search results. Otherwise, the Maps app defaults to the last search location.


FIGURE 8.15
See a Flyover Tour of a popular city (almost anywhere in the world) when you look it up using the Maps app.
Using the Interactive Location Screens
Once search results are displayed, tap a desired result to view information pertaining to it that incorporates content from the Internet, Yelp!, and the Maps app. This information includes the phone number, address, website URL, hours of operation, and other information for that search result.
The information displayed depends on whether it's a business, restaurant, point of interest, or tourist attraction. Photos (provided by other iPhone, iPad, and Yelp! users) are often displayed as well. When applicable, text-based reviews and star-based ratings from other iPhone, iPad, or Yelp! users are displayed for that business, point of interest, service, or restaurant.

 Tip
If you look up information about a restaurant, the information screen features Yelp!-related information, including the type of food served, the menu price range (using dollar signs), the hours of operation, and potentially a website link that enables you to view the restaurant's menu. You can also determine whether the restaurant delivers or accepts reservations.
If reservations are accepted, use the optional OpenTable app to make reservations online. Activate Siri and say, "Make a reservation for [number of people] for [day and time]," or initiate a call from an iPhone to the restaurant by tapping the phone number field. When applicable, the Info or Yelp! screen for a business also tells you whether Apple Pay is accepted at that location.

Quick Tips for Using the Maps App
The following are some additional tips for working with Maps:
 When using the Maps app, your iPhone or iPad accesses the Internet extensively. This drains the device's battery faster. If you often use this feature from your car, consider investing in a car charger that plugs into your car's 12-volt or USB jack. This way, your iPhone's/iPad's battery remains charged (and can recharge) while it's being used.
 Using the Maps app for Navigation via a cellular data Internet connection requires a significant amount of wireless data usage. Using this feature depletes your monthly cellular data allocation unless you're subscribed to an unlimited wireless service plan (or a plan with a generous amount of cellular data). Also, if you're using international roaming to access the Internet from abroad, using Maps with a cellular data connection can get very expensive.
 Use iOS 11's Handoff feature to switch from using your iPhone to your iPad or Mac (or vice versa) in conjunction with the Maps app, without having to re-enter information.
 Take advantage of Siri to help you quickly find businesses, restaurants, points of interest, or acquire driving directions to or from your current location. When applicable, Siri automatically launches the Maps app and provides the appropriate information. For example, say, "Hey Siri, what time does the Apple Store in Boston close?" On the screen, Siri displays the locations of Boston-area Apple Stores. Tap the desired location and then view the store's detailed listing via the Maps app, which lists its hours of operation. Then, tap the Directions button to launch the maps app and obtain turn-by-turn directions to that location, or tap the Call button to call the store.







9. Shoot, Edit, and Share Photos and Videos

In this Chapter
 Discovering the image-editing tools built in to the Photos app
 Learning about the Camera app's Selfie and Live Picture features
 Taking advantage of the improved Portrait mode with the new Portrait Lighting feature on the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X.

Every day, more than 1.5 billion photos are taken on smartphones and tablets around the world. People love taking photos, and thanks to the digital cameras built in to all the iPhone and iPad models, plus improvements made to the iOS 11 edition of the Camera and Photos apps, it has never been easier or more fun to shoot, edit, view, print, and share your digital images or video clips.

 Note
In this chapter, the phrase, "newer iPhone and iPad models" refers to iPhone 6s series; iPhone 7 series; the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X; and the more recently released iPad Pro models.

Working with the Cameras
Whether you're using one of the latest iPhone models or an older iPhone (or any iPad model for that matter), you can take crystal-clear photos and create large and vibrant full-color prints from your digital image files, or share those images using options offered by the Photos app's Share menu.
The iPhone X is the first Apple mobile device to include a front-facing, 7MP TrueDepth camera (which can be used to take photos, shoot video, or participate in video calls via FaceTime, Facebook Messenger, or Skype). It can also be used to create and record Animojis (which are discussed in Chapter 12, "Communicate Better with the Messages App").
Both the iPhone 8 Plus and the iPhone X include two separate rear-facing cameras (offering a wide-angle and telephoto lens) and a redesigned Quad-LED True Tone flash with Slow Sync, which is designed to provide better results than older iPhone models when you're shooting in low light.

 Note
The iPhone 7 Plus also offers two, 12MP rear-facing cameras, but the image sensor and lenses on the iPhone 7 Plus are not as well equipped to handle low light as on the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X. Also, the flash on the iPhone 7 Plus does not offer the advanced Slow Sync feature.


 What's New
The iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X all feature Apple's A11 Bionic chip as its processor. When it comes to digital photography, this chip, along with other enhanced features within the phones, make it easier than ever to capture clear images when you're shooting in low light or while you (the photographer) is in motion, such as when you're taking a photo while in a moving vehicle.
For example, the iPhone X offers duel optical image stabilization, up to a 10x digital zoom, and a Quad-LED True Tone flash with Slow Sync—all of which come in handy when taking photos in less-than-perfect conditions.
When it comes to shooting HD video, the rear-facing camera within the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X can all shoot at 4K resolution at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second (fps), and it can also shoot 1080p resolution at 30 or 60 fps.

To switch between the rear-facing wide-angle and telephoto lenses on an iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, or iPhone X, tap the circular Zoom icon near the bottom center of the viewfinder screen, just above the shooting mode menu (see Figure 9.1). Alternatively, place and hold your finger on the circular Zoom Intensity icon, and a zoom slider (see Figure 9.2) appears. Use this zoom slider, or a reverse-pinch/pinch finger gesture, to zoom in or out from the Camera app's viewfinder screen.
When you switch to the telephoto lens, it is set to 5x magnification. You can then increase the zoom intensity up to 10x. To switch back to the wide-angle lens, tap the circular icon.

FIGURE 9.1
Tap the circular Zoom icon to switch between the wide-angle and telephoto lenses on an iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, or iPhone X.

FIGURE 9.2
Press and hold your finger on the circular Zoom Intensity icon to make the redesigned zoom slider appear.
When using the iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, or iPhone X, the default is for the Camera app to always use the wide-angle lens with 1x (zero) zoom magnification. Use the reverse-pinch finger gesture or the zoom slider to adjust the zoom between 1x and 10x without manually switching between the rear-facing cameras. The iPhone automatically switches from one camera to another when it's necessary.
Figure 9.3 shows what the zoom slider looks like on an older iPhone model that does not contain two rear-facing cameras. On an iPad, the zoom slider is displayed along the left margin of the viewfinder screen.

 Caution
When you're using higher levels of the optical or digital zoom (higher than 5x, for example) with the iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, or iPhone X, be sure to hold the smartphone very still as you press the shutter button to snap a photo. Even the slightest movement can cause the image to appear blurry or pixelated, particularly in low-light situations (when you aren't using the flash). The Camera app's built-in image stabilization sometimes compensates for this (mainly in well-lit situations), but not always.


FIGURE 9.3
Use the pinch or reverse-pinch figure gesture on the screen to make the zoom slider appear on older iPhone or iPad models.

 Note
The Camera Selection icon displayed in the bottom-right corner of the viewfinder screen is still used to switch between the front- and rear-facing cameras

The cameras built in to the iPhone 7 series and iPhone 8 series now include what Apple refers to as Optical Image Stabilization, improved body and face detection, as well as other features that work behind the scenes to help you automatically take clearer, more vibrant photos in a broader range of shooting situations.

 Note
The iPhone X offers what Apple refers to as Dual Optical Image Stabilization, an even more advanced version of Optical Image Stabilization, which helps to compensate for unwanted camera movement or shaking while shooting.

The iPhone 7 series, iPhone 8 series, or iPhone X have four auto-adjusting LEDs to create the True Tone flash rather than just two. This enables the smartphone to better analyze the available light, and then use the flash to simulate but brighten the ambient light when taking a photo. This new Quad-LED True Tone flash should help reduce red-eye, overexposed subjects, and unwanted shadows that a typical camera flash often causes. In some cases, though, you can capture more authentic colors and lighting by turning on the HDR shooting mode instead of using the flash.

 Tip
When you're using one of the latest iPhone models and viewing the Home screen, you can place and hold your finger gently on the Camera app icon to reveal a Touch 3D menu that enables you to access the Selfie picture taking feature, record a video, record a slo-mo video, or take a portrait by tapping one of the listed options (see Figure 9.4).


FIGURE 9.4
Quickly launch a specific feature of the Camera app directly from the Home screen by placing and holding your finger on the Camera app icon for about 2 seconds and using the iPhone's 3D Touch functionality.
Taking Photos or Shooting Video
The Camera app that comes preinstalled with iOS 11 is likely to be the app you primarily use to take photos or shoot HD video. However, many third-party apps allow you to take pictures and replace the need to rely on the Camera app. This is especially the case with social media apps, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat.

 Caution
The same iOS 11 version of the Camera app is installed on all iOS mobile devices. The features and functions of the Camera app depend on which iPhone or iPad model you're using, so some features might not be available to you.


 Note
If you activate the iCloud Photo Library feature offered by the Photos app (which enables you to sync your digital images between all iOS mobile devices and computers linked to the same iCloud account), your main photo album where all your photos are stored, including all newly shot photos, is called All Photos. However, when iCloud Photo Library is turned off, the main album where photos you take are stored is called Camera Roll.

Launching the Camera App
There are several easy ways to launch the Camera app:
 From the Home screen, tap the Camera app icon.
 From the main Lock screen, swipe from right to left.
 Tap the Camera app icon in the Control Center.
 On an iPhone with 3D Touch capabilities, press the Camera app icon on the Home screen to reveal a pop-up menu for using specific Camera app features (refer to Figure 9.4).
 Activate Siri and say, "Launch the camera app."
 If the Camera app is already running in the background, access the App Switcher and select the Camera app.
Shooting Photos or Video
All iPhones and iPads have at least two built-in cameras—one in the front and one on the back of the device, but the iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X each have three built-in cameras. The front-facing camera makes it easier to snap photos of yourself (that is, take a "selfie," or participate in video calls via FaceTime or Skype).
The rear-facing camera (which can take much higher-resolution photos or video) enables you to photograph or record whatever is in front of you. Tap the camera-shaped Camera Selection icon to switch between cameras.

 Note
The iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X all have two, 12MP rear-facing cameras. This means that every image uses 12 million individual pixels (colored dots) to compose and display the image. The cameras built into the iPhone X (and the functionality offered by them) is the most advanced to date, allowing you to take clearer, more vibrant photos in a wider ranger of lighting and shooting situations.

The main camera viewfinder screen, which occupies the main area of the screen, appears as soon as you launch the Camera app on an iPhone or iPad. What you see in this viewfinder is what will be captured in your digital photo (or video).
On the iPhone, along the top and bottom of the screen are several command icons and options. On an iPad, most command icons and options are displayed along the right margin of the screen.

 Note
If you're using an older iPhone or iPad model (pre-iPhone 6 series or pre-iPad Pro), some of the features and functions discussed in this chapter (such as HDR Auto mode, Live Photo, Burst shooting mode, and Portrait Lighting), aren't available to you.

To view the last photo you shot (or the last video clip recorded), tap the Image Preview thumbnail displayed in the bottom-left corner of the viewfinder screen (iPhone), or just below the Shutter button on an iPad. You can then use the Photo app's viewing and editing functions on that image or video clip.
At the bottom center of the screen on the iPhone is the camera's Shutter button. On the iPad, it's located in the right margin. Tap this to snap a photo or to start and stop the video recording.

 Caution
If you accidently press and hold the Shutter button for too long when trying to snap a single image, Burst shooting mode activates, and you wind up with several similar images taken in quick succession. To avoid this, be sure to quickly tap the Shutter button, not press and hold it down.


 Tip
In Photo mode, if you press and hold the Shutter button, Burst shooting mode automatically activates on newer iPhone and iPad models. This feature enables you to shoot multiple photos in quick succession (several frames per second) without having to keep pressing the Shutter button.
This feature is ideal for capturing a fast-moving subject, for example, and enables you to capture an action or event that happens very quickly. You can always delete the unwanted (extra) photos after choosing your favorite image(s) from the sequence.
Images shot using Burst shooting mode are placed in a separate album in the Photos app called Bursts.

Understanding the Shooting Modes
From the Shooting Mode menu offered on the latest iPhone models, your options include Time-Lapse, Slow-Mo, Video, Photo, Square, and Pano. Use your finger to manually scroll left or right to select your shooting mode. The active shooting mode is highlighted in yellow directly above the Shutter button.
On an iPad, the available shooting modes are displayed below the Shutter button in the right margin of the viewfinder screen. Scroll up/down to view and access them.

 Note
If you're using one of the latest iPhones, the Selfie shooting mode enables you to snap a photo and use the smartphone's entire screen as your flash. You can access this feature from the Home screen using the Camera app's 3D Touch menu, or anytime you're using the front-facing camera (as long as the flash option is set to On or Auto).

Here's how you can use the six shooting modes:
 Time-Lapse—Enables you to set up the Camera app to automatically keep snapping one photo at a time (the time interval is dynamically set by the iOS device) until you manually turn off this function. This feature works best if you mount the iOS mobile device on a tripod or use it with a stand. It's great for capturing changes that happen in a single scene over time, such as a sunrise or sunset. The content created when using the Time Lapse feature is stored in the Photos app as a video, not as a series of photos.

 Note
When shooting with Time Lapse mode, the longer you leave the feature turned on (so the Camera app keeps taking photos automatically over an extended period of time), the longer the interval is between shots. Typically, if you leave this feature turned on long enough, the images are condensed into a 30- to 40-second mini-movie that shows the animated time-lapsed images.

 Slo-Mo—Enables you to shoot high-action video but play it back in slow motion. When using one of the latest iPhone or iPad models, you can capture slow-motion video in 1080p resolution, at up to 240 frames per second. This shooting mode is ideal if you're shooting a fast-moving subject or a high-action activity.
 Video—Enables you to shoot HD-quality video using your iPhone or iPad. Depending on which device you're using, you can shoot 4K resolution video at up to 60 frames per second. Keep in mind that your iPhone or iPad is ideal for shooting relatively short video clips. These HD video files take up a tremendous amount of storage space, so if you want to shoot long home videos, consider using a dedicated video camera.

 Note
In Settings, you can select the video shooting resolution. The options vary based on the device you're using.
To adjust the default video resolution on any iPhone or iPad, launch Settings, tap the Camera option, and then tap the Record Video option or Record Slo-Mo option.
Keep in mind that the higher the resolution you select, the larger your video files will be. Larger files require more internal storage space in your mobile device.

 Photo—Used for taking most pictures, this shooting mode allows you to snap regular, rectangular-shaped digital images at the highest resolution the front- or rear-facing camera that's built in to your iPhone or iPad is capable of.

 Tip
The shooting resolution of the rear-facing camera can capture images and video at a much higher resolution than the front-facing camera. So, unless you're taking a selfie (a photo of yourself and whatever is behind you), you'll typically capture clearer, more vivid, and more detailed images and video using the rear-facing camera.

 Square—Automatically precrops images as you're shooting photos to be compatible with services such as Instagram. You wind up with square images.
 Pano—Launches the Camera app's panoramic mode, which is ideal for shooting vast landscapes, skylines, or large groups of people. You wind up with a long, rectangular image (see Figure 9.5).

FIGURE 9.5
The Pano (panoramic) shooting mode is ideal for shooting images of vast landscapes, large groups of people, or very wide areas.

 Tip
In addition to the Time-Lapse option, the Camera app on more recent iPhone and iPad models offers a Timer option. To turn on the timer, tap the Timer icon, and then set it for 3 or 10 seconds. Doing this determines how long the Camera app waits between the time you press the Shutter button and when an image is actually taken and saved.


 Note
The Live Photo feature of the Camera app enables you to snap a photo but capture it as a two- to three-second mini-movie (with sound) that can later be viewed as an animated image on any iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, Apple TV, or Apple Watch that's using the Photos app or is capable of displaying digital photos in other ways. For example, you can use a Live Photo as your custom watch face on the Apple Watch, or as the Lock screen wallpaper on your iPhone or iPad.
A Live Photo can still be treated as a regular digital image file. The iOS 11 edition of the Photos app allows you to edit, share, email, and print Live Photos.


 Tip
To capture a Live photo, from the viewfinder screen when taking a photo, tap the Live icon, which looks like a target and is in the top-center of the screen on an iPhone. On an iPad, it's the top command icon in the right margin of the viewfinder screen. When the feature is active, this icon is yellow.

Discovering Portrait Mode
For iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X users, the Portrait shooting mode is available from the Camera app. When you select Portrait mode, the rear-facing telephoto lens (5x zoom) of the iPhone is automatically selected, and a depth-of-field effect automatically is used, which means this shooting mode helps to ensure that your intended subject is in focus and displayed clearly, but the background is slightly blurred. This feature works best when you're holding the camera at least several feet away from your intended subject, and there's some type of background behind your subject.

 Tip
When your subject is located in front of anything that can be seen at a distance behind it, experiment using Portrait mode to tinker with the image's depth of field and create visually interesting effects in your photos that draw more attention to your subject. If your subject is standing directly against a wall, this feature won't work. The farther your subject is away from what's in the background, the more dramatic the blurred depth of field effect will be.

When you're using Portrait mode, be sure to tap the viewfinder screen directly over the intended subject to ensure that the Camera app's autofocus sensors home in on your intended subject rather than on something else in the foreground, background, or to either side of your subject.

 Note
When using Portrait mode, your intended subject can be a person, pet, or any object that's clearly positioned in front of something else.

To use the Portrait shooting mode, select it from the shooting mode menu. (Remember, this option appears only if you're using a compatible iPhone model.) Portrait mode is listed between the Photo and Square shooting modes. After you select it, tap your intended subject. The autofocus sensor appears over your subject.
In Figure 9.6, which uses Photo mode on an iPhone 7 Plus, notice that both the main subject in the foreground and the background are equally in focus. When you switch to Portrait mode, however, and tap your subject to use the auto-focus sensor directly on it (as shown in Figure 9.7), the subject stays in focus, but the background becomes slightly blurred. A Depth Effect message appears on the screen to indicate that this feature is being used.

FIGURE 9.6
With Photo mode, your intended subject (in this case, a flower) and what's in the background (the historic church) appear in focus.

FIGURE 9.7
With Portrait mode, the rear-facing telephoto lens of the compatible iPhone is used. Tap your intended subject, and the background automatically becomes blurred.
Figures 9.8 and 9.9 show the two photos side by side to highlight the differences in the results.

 What's New
Exclusive to the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X (and released as part of a free update to the iOS 11 operating system) is a new feature called Portrait Lighting. When you use this feature with the Portrait shooting mode, the Camera app simulates the professional lighting apparatus that would be available in a photo studio. The feature enables you to digitally incorporate special lighting effects directly into your photos while you're shooting or while editing in the Photos app.
After you turn on the Portrait shooting mode, tap the 3D-looking box icon in the viewfinder screen to scroll between lighting effects. Options include Stage Light Mono, Natural Light, Studio Light, Stage Light Mono, and Contour Light (see Figure 9.10). Each dramatically changes the appearance of a photo taken using the Portrait shooting mode.


FIGURE 9.10
Tap the Portrait Lighting Effect icon, and then scroll between the different effects. You'll see within the viewfinder how each impacts the image's appearance in real-time.

 What's New
If you're an iPhone X user, another new feature is the ability to use the Portrait shooting mode with the front-facing camera. This allows you to take crystal-clear selfies but have the background appear blurry in order, which adds a more artistic flare and depth to your photos. You can add Portrait Lighting Effects to portrait images taken with the front-facing camera.

Using the HDR Shooting Feature
The HDR feature offered by the Camera app stands for High Dynamic Range. You can use it only with the rear-facing camera. When turned on, this feature captures the available light differently, which can help you compensate for a photo that would otherwise be over- or underexposed. You can use this feature anytime, but it works extremely well in low-light situations.
When you take a photo using HDR mode, the iPhone or iPad actually captures several separate images simultaneously, and then automatically blends them into a single image in a fraction of a second. By doing this, you can capture more depth and contrast, plus make better use of available lighting. The result is often a more detailed and vibrant photo.
You can decide whether the original photo and the HDR version of a photo are both saved in the All Photos/Camera Roll album, or if just the HDR version of the image should be saved. To make this adjustment, launch Settings, tap the Camera option, and then turn on or off the virtual switch associated with the Keep Normal Photo option.
On the latest iPhones and iPads there are three HDR-related options: On, Off, or Auto. (On older iPhone and most iPad models, only the On or Off options are available.) If HDR Auto is available, it enables you to consistently capture the most vibrant photos in a wide range of lighting situations. The HDR button is displayed at the top of the Camera app's viewfinder screen on the iPhone, or above the Shutter button on the iPad. Tap it to toggle the HDR mode when taking photos.

 Note
When you turn on the HDR mode, the flash automatically is turned off.

Using the Built-In Flash
On the iPhone (and iPad Pro models), the flash icon enables you to control whether the built-in flash is used as you're shooting photos or video. Tap the Flash icon, and then tap the On, Off, or Auto option to toggle this feature.
The Auto option is offered only on the newer iPhone and iPad Pro models. The Auto option enables the smartphone to analyze the available light for you, and it automatically determines whether the flash is needed.

 Tip
Keep in mind that even in low-light situations, you can often achieve better results if you shoot photos using the HDR shooting mode rather than using the flash.


 Note
Starting with the iPhone 5 series, the smartphone includes what Apple calls a True Tone flash. This is really two flashes that work together and emit light in different colors. As a result, the Camera app analyzes the available light in each shooting situation and enhances it, while monitoring the natural colors in a photo.
The True Tone flash automatically reduces the red-eye effect when taking pictures of people, and it can often reduce or eliminate unwanted shadows in photos. In the iPhone 7 series, iPhone 8 series, and iPhone X, the built-in flash uses four separate LEDs that work together, as opposed to just two.
A True Tone Flash is also built in to the latest iPad Pro models.


 Tip
If you're using a newer iPhone model and you activate the flash when using the front-facing camera, the entire screen of your iPhone automatically serves as a simulated flash to brighten your face when the ambient light isn't adequate. Make sure the Camera app's flash option is turned on for this to work.

Using the Autofocus and Exposure Control Options
As you're looking at the Camera app's viewfinder and framing your shot, be sure to force the app to focus on your intended subject by tapping the screen directly over where your subject appears.
When you do this, the Autofocus Sensor box appears in the viewfinder, and the Camera app focuses on your intended subject (that is, what's in the box). What's behind, in front of, above, below, or to the sides of your subject may be slightly blurred.
If you're shooting people, however, the Camera app automatically identifies each person's face in a photo and focuses on those faces. An Autofocus Sensor box appears around each person's face.

 Tip
In addition to the Autofocus Sensor, some devices also have a manual Exposure Control slider. It looks like a sun-shaped icon that appears to the immediate right of the Autofocus Sensor.
When this Exposure Control slider is displayed, place your finger on the icon and slide it up or down to manually adjust the exposure before snapping the photo.

Snapping a Photo
Snapping a single digital photo using the Camera app is simple. Follow these steps:
1. Launch the Camera app.
2. Make sure the shooting mode is set to Photo or Square.
3. Choose between the front- and rear-facing cameras by tapping the Camera Selection icon. (If you're using an iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, or iPhone X, after selecting the rear-facing camera, use the zoom feature, or tap the 1x or 2x icon to switch between the wide-angle and telephoto lenses).
4. Compose your image by holding up your device and pointing it at your intended subject(s).
5. If desired, set the Timer feature.
6. To add a special effect to the image as you're shooting, tap the Filter icon and then select one of the nine displayed filters by tapping its preview image (see Figure 9.11). The Filters icon is displayed in the top-right corner of the Camera app's viewfinder screen on the iPhone.

 What's New
The nine special effect filters built into the iOS 11 edition of the Camera app (and Photos app) are called Vivid, Vivid Warm, Vivid Cool, Dramatic, Dramatic Warm, Dramatic Cool, Mono, Silvertone, and Noir. Selecting the filter called Original is the same as choosing no filter at all.


 Note
You don't have to add a filter when you shoot the photo. You can always add a filter later when editing a photo using the Photos app.

7. Choose the intended subject of your photo, such as a person or an object. Tap your finger on the screen where your subject appears in the viewfinder. An Autofocus Sensor box appears on the screen at the location you tap. The box is where the camera focuses (as opposed to something in the foreground, background, or next to your intended subject).
8. If necessary, use the Exposure Control slider (the sun-shaped icon) to manually adjust the exposure just before snapping a photo. You can later adjust or correct a variety of problematic issues in a photo—including its exposure, contrast, saturation, color, and shadows—using the Photos app.

FIGURE 9.11
As you're shooting a photo, choose one of the nine image filters to add an effect.

 Caution
As you're holding your iPhone or iPad to snap a photo or shoot video, be sure your fingers don't accidentally block the camera lens. On the more recent iPhone and iPad Pro models, located near the rear-facing camera lens is a tiny True Tone flash. Keep your fingers clear of this, as well.

9. If you want to use the Camera app's zoom feature, use a pinch motion on the screen. A zoom slider appears directly above the Shooting Mode menu and the Shutter button. Use your finger to move the dot on the slider to the right to zoom in, or to the left to zoom out. Alternatively, use a pinch or reverse-pinch finger gesture to manage the zoom level while shooting.

 Tip
Remember, the iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X displays the zoom intensity in a circular icon near the bottom center of the viewfinder screen. To make the zoom slider appear, place and hold your finger on the 1x icon. The redesigned zoom slider is displayed . Move your finger slightly left or right to increase or decrease the zoom intensity, or use the reverse-pinch or pinch finger gesture to adjust the zoom intensity.

10. Decide whether you want to use HDR mode or the built-in flash (iPhones or iPad Pro only) when taking the photo. (You can also choose neither of these options.)
11. When you have your image framed in the viewfinder, tap the Shutter button to snap the photo. Alternatively, press the Volume Up (+) or Volume Down (-) button on the side of your iPhone/iPad, which also serve as a Shutter button when using the Camera app.
12. The photo is saved in the All Photos/Camera Roll album of the Photos app. You can now shoot another photo or view the photo using the Photos app.

 Note
All regular photos are automatically stored in the All Photos/Camera Roll album as they're taken. The iOS 11 edition of the Photos app automatically places selfies into a separate Selfies album and sorts your panoramic shots into a Panoramas album.
Videos are placed in a separate Videos album, and slo-mo video clips are stored in an album called Slo-Mo.
When you use the Burst shooting mode, these groups of images are clustered together and placed in the Bursts album.
All these albums are automatically created for you. In the Photos app, you can move images into the Favorites album or any custom-named albums you create manually.

Shooting a Panoramic Photo
To take advantage of the panoramic shooting mode to snap a photo of a landscape, city skyline, or a large group of people, follow these steps:
1. Launch the Camera app.
2. Swipe the Shooting Modes menu, and select the Pano shooting mode.
3. Position your iPhone or iPad's viewfinder to the extreme left of your wide-angle shot. (When using the Pano shooting mode, hold the smartphone or tablet upright in portrait mode, unless you're shooting a very, very tall object.)

 Tip
If you tap the large arrow icon in the viewfinder, you can switch the panning direction from right to left, instead of left to right as you're capturing a panoramic shot.

4. Tap the Shutter button, and then slowly and steadily move (pan) your iPhone or iPad from left to right (see Figure 9.12).

FIGURE 9.12
When taking panoramic shots, the viewfinder screen looks very different on your iPhone or iPad.
5. The panorama slider moves from left to right as you capture your image. Tap the Shutter button again when you're finished, or continue moving the iOS device to the right until the entire length of the image has been captured.

 Tip
If you pan the iPhone or iPad too fast or too slow while taking a panoramic shot, or if your hand isn't steady, you see a message that tells you what you're doing wrong. Although you can continue taking that shot, for the best results, tap the Shutter button to stop shooting and then start again from step 1.

6. The panoramic photo is saved in the Panoramas album of the Photos app. You can then view, edit, or share it from within Photos. Like all images, it's also accessible from the All Photos/Camera Roll album.

 Tip
When viewing a panoramic photo, hold your iPhone or iPad in landscape mode; however, when shooting a panoramic shot, hold it in portrait mode.

Shooting HD Video
From the Camera app, you can easily shoot stunning HD video. Follow these basic steps for shooting video using your iPhone or iPad:
1. Launch the Camera app.
2. Select the Video shooting mode from the Shooting Mode menu. (If you want to shoot slow-motion video, select the Slo-Mo option, if it's offered by your iOS mobile device.)

 Note
When you select the Video shooting mode, on the viewfinder screen the Flash icon, Timer, Shooting Mode menu, Shutter button, and Camera Selection icon are all displayed. On the iPhone, the selected video resolution is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen.
When you start actually filming video, some of these icons disappear, and on some iPhones and iPads, the Still Image Shutter button becomes accessible.

3. Tap the camera selection icon to choose which camera you want to use. You can switch between the front- and the rear-facing camera at any time.

 Note
The newer iPhone and iPad models are capable of shooting 4K resolution video using the rear-facing camera.
On any iPhone or iPad, set the video recording resolution by launching Settings, tapping the Camera option, and then tapping the Record Video or Record Slo-Mo options. The available options are listed on the Record Video submenu screen, as well the amount of internal storage space needed to record each minute of video.
For example, when the iPhone 7 Plus records video in 4K resolution at 30 fps, each minute of saved video content requires 350MB of internal storage space.

4. If applicable, tap the Flash icon (iPhone/iPad Pro) to turn on the flash and use it as a continuous light source while filming video.
5. Hold your iPhone or iPad up to the subject you want to capture on video. Set up your shot by looking at what's displayed in the viewfinder.
6. In the viewfinder, tap your intended subject to make the autofocus sensor appear. If necessary, and if your device supports this feature, you can also manually adjust the Exposure Control using the displayed slider.
7. When you're ready to start shooting video, tap the Shutter button. The red dot turns into a red square. This indicates you're now filming. Your iPhone or iPad captures whatever action you see on the screen, as well as any sound in the area.
8. As you're filming video, a timer is displayed on the screen (see Figure 9.13). Your only limits to how much video you can shoot is based on the amount of available storage space in your iOS device and how long the battery lasts. (This app is designed for shooting short video clips rather than full-length home movies.)

FIGURE 9.13
When shooting video on your iPhone or iPad, make sure the timer is counting up. This indicates you're actually recording.
9. As you're filming, tap anywhere on the screen to focus on your subject using the app's built-in autofocus sensor.
10. To stop filming, tap the Shutter button again. Your video footage is saved. You can now view, edit, and share it from within the Photos app (or use an optional video-editing app, such as iMovie).

 Tip
Although the Photos app enables you to trim your video clips as well as view and share the videos, if you want to edit your videos, plus add titles and special effects, use Apple's feature-packed iMovie app, which is available from the App Store. For more information about iMovie, visit www.apple.com/apps/imovie.


 Tip
Depending on which iPhone or iPad model you're using, your Camera app might include a second, circular (white) Shutter button (refer to Figure 9.13). You can use this second Shutter button to snap high-resolution digital images at the same time you're shooting HD video.

Using the Photos App to View, Edit, Enhance, Print, and Share Photos and Videos
Use the Photos app to view, organize, edit, and share images stored on your iOS device or in your iCloud account. The iOS 11 version of the Photos app includes a robust selection of photo editing and image enhancement tools.

 Note
The Photos app has built-in face and object recognition, and it automatically sorts your images based on who or what appears in them.
In addition, the Camera app uses the GPS (Location Services) capabilities of your mobile device to record the exact location where each photo (or video) is shot, and it also records the time and date. As a result, the Photos app's Related feature is able to sort images based on location, who or what appears in your photos, and when they were taken and group those images together.
When you tap the Albums icon in Photos, you'll discover that separate folders for People and Places have automatically been created. These folders are auto-populated with appropriate photos as you take them.


 Tip
Tap the Places option to view a world map that shows the places you've been where you've taken photos, as well as how many photos you took there (see Figure 9.14).
Place your finger on this map and drag it around to reposition it. Use the reverse-pinch or pinch finger gestures to zoom in or out.
Tap any location tag on the map to view the collection of photos taken there. For this feature to work, you must have the Location Services feature turned on for the Camera and Photos apps.


FIGURE 9.14
The Places option in the Photos app enables you to see where in the world you've taken photos, and then quickly find and view those images (shown on an iPad Pro).

 Note
The All Photos/Camera Roll, Favorites, People, Places, Videos, Selfies, Live Photos, Portrait, Panoramas, Time-Lapse, Bursts, Screenshots, Slo-Mo, and Recently Deleted albums are automatically created on your behalf in Photos. These albums are populated with appropriate photos and video clips as you take them or transfer them into your iPhone or iPad.
If you opt to use third-party photography apps, additional albums may automatically be created to store images taken or edited using those apps. Any Albums you create are displayed with their custom names under the My Albums heading.


 What's New
From within Photos, you now can search for photos with specific objects in them. To do this, access the Search tool built into the Photos app and type an object that appears within any of your photos, such as trees, cars, houses, or cats.
For example, type dog within the Search field to locate and view thumbnails for all photos you have taken that contain dogs. You can also activate Siri and say, "Show me photos that contain dogs."
You can also to search images by the people who appear in them (assuming you've used the People feature within the Photos app to associate names with faces).

Experiencing Photos and Videos with Memories
The Memories feature automatically groups related images together and can present them in an animated, movie-like format that can include a title, music, special effects, and cinematic transitions. To access this feature, tap the Memories icon at the bottom of the Photos screen. The app uses your images and video clips to create a collection of animated presentations.
Thumbnails for the Memories that the Photos app has created are displayed (see Figure 9.15). Tap any Memory thumbnail to view, edit, and then share that Memory. From within the Photos app, you can share Memories just as you share a photo or video clip—on Facebook, for example.
When you tap one of the Memories thumbnails, the collection of images in it is displayed. Tap the Play icon to preview the Memory as is, or tap the Select option to choose specific images you want to delete from the Memory (see Figure 9.16).

FIGURE 9.15
The Photos app automatically creates Memories for you.

FIGURE 9.16
After selecting a Memory, you can view, edit, or share it from within the Photos app.
After tapping Select and choosing one or more images, tap the Share icon to share the selected images, or use the command icons displayed at the bottom of the Share menu to Copy, Hide, Print, or Duplicate these images.
As a Memory is playing, tap the screen to customize it. For example, choose a theme, like Happy, Uplifting, Epic, Dreamy, or Sentimental. Tap the Short or Medium option to determine the playback length of the Memory, or tap the Edit icon to fully customize the Memory.
From the Edit menu, you can add a custom title to the Memory, select music to be played in the background, customize the duration of the animated presentation, and add/remove photos and video clips included in the Memory.

 Tip
If you have video clips included in the memory, those need to be edited separately, as standalone videos (either using the Photos app or iMovie, for example). Those edited video clips can then be incorporated into an animated memory.

After making changes to the Edit menu, tap Done to save your changes to the Memory. Tap the Share icon to Share the Memory via email, text message, or by publishing it on Facebook or Twitter, for example.

 Tip
In addition to the usual sharing options offered when you access the Share menu while working with Memories, if you have the YouTube app installed on your iPhone or iPad and have an active YouTube (Google) account, you can upload your Memories directly to your YouTube channel from the Photos app.


 Tip
When viewing a particular Memory, scroll down to the bottom of the thumbnail images that are included in that Memory. Here, you'll discover a Related heading, with additional Memories that are somehow related to the one you're viewing. There's also an Add to Favorite Memories option and a Delete Memory option.

Navigating Around the Photos App
Displayed at the bottom of the Photos app are a series of command icons. Use these to navigate your way around the app, find your images, and then use the tools offered by the app to manage your photo collection, edit your images, and ultimately share them.
The main command icons in the Photo app include the following:
 Photos—Tap this option to sort and view all images stored locally within your iPhone/iPad or that are stored in your iCloud Photo Library. Images are sorted based on the time and date, as well as the location where they were taken. Use your finger to scroll up or down this screen. To select and work with any of the images, tap the Select option, and then tap their image thumbnails. You can then delete those images, share them (by tapping the Share icon), copy them into another folder (using the Add To option). Tap any single image to view it, and then use the Photos app's editing and management tools to work with that single image.

 Tip
When you select the Photos option, images are sorted based on when or where they were shot. Years displays thumbnails of all images shot in a particular year and includes details about where those images were shot.
Collections further breaks down a Years grouping to sort images based on when and where they were taken. Moments enables you to display thumbnails of images in a Collection that represent one location or date.
As you're viewing thumbnails in the Moments view, tap one of them to view and work with a single image. Tap the < icon in the top-left corner of the screen to move backward between individual photos, Moments, Collections, and Years.

 Memories—Access, view, edit, manage, and share Memories that are automatically created by the Photos app.
 Shared—Access and manage images you've stored in custom folders, or that have been placed online using iCloud's Photo Sharing feature.
 Albums—Access, view, and manage albums (folders), as well as individual images stored in each album. In addition to the albums that the Photos app has created and populated for you, you can create and manage your own custom albums, and place groups of photos you select in them.
Moving Images Between Albums
To copy selected images from one album to another as you're viewing thumbnails for images in a specific album, tap the Select option. Then, one at a time, tap the images you want to copy into another album. A check mark appears on each image thumbnail you select.
Tap the Add To option, and then tap which album from the displayed listing you want to move the selected images to. For example, you can choose the Family album if you have iCloud Family Sharing activated.
To create a new album from scratch, from the Add to Album screen, tap the New Album option. When prompted, type a title for the new album, and then tap the Save button.
Create as many separate albums as you need in the Photos app to properly group and organize your images. As you create a new album, it syncs with iCloud Photo Library if you have this feature turned on.

 What's New
After you select one or more images and tap the Share icon, you see the Share menu. Included within this menu is the Save to Files option. Tap this icon to transfer the image(s) to any cloud-based file folder or subfolder on any online file-sharing/storage service that you have linked with the new Files app, such as iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, or Box. (An Internet connection is required.) The selected images remain stored within the Photos app, but a copy is uploaded to the selected service. See Chapter 7, "Using iCloud and the Files App," for more information.

Viewing an Image in Full-Screen Mode
When viewing thumbnails of your images, tap any single image thumbnail to view a larger version of it.
On the iPhone, the Share, Favorites, Edit, Trash, and Back (<) icons and commands are displayed along the top and bottom of the screen. On the iPad (see Figure 9.17), these icons and commands are along the top of the screen.
Along the bottom center of the screen are thumbnails for all the images stored in the Album you're currently accessing.

 Tip
By tapping the Favorites (heart-shaped) icon associated with each image, you can place that image into a separate Favorites album and then opt to view or share only those images.

As you're viewing a photo, tap it to hide or show the command icons and options available, which automatically appear and then disappear after a few seconds when you first open a photo.

FIGURE 9.17
When viewing a single image (shown here on an iPad Pro), you can share it, add it to the Favorites folder, edit it, or delete it.

 Tip
When viewing an image, scroll down to view a map showing where the image was taken, and keep scrolling down to view related images. You can use the Show Photos from This Day option to view additional photos taken on the same day as the one you're viewing.

To exit the single-image view and return to the multi-image thumbnail view, tap anywhere on the screen to make the command icons appear, then tap Back (<) in the upper-left corner of the screen.
Tap the Edit icon to reveal the Photo app's image-editing options (shown in Figure 9.18 on an iPhone).

FIGURE 9.18
The Edit icons give you access to the Photo app's image editing tools.
Tools for Editing Photos
When you tap the Edit icon while viewing a single image, several command icons are displayed on the screen (refer to Figure 9.17). These icons provide the tools for quickly editing and enhancing your image. Your options are explained in the next sections.

 Note
You can use the tools built into iOS 11 to edit animated photos taken using the Live shooting mode. Live photos can be viewed using the Photos app running on any iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad that's running iOS 10 or iOS 11, the Apple Watch (running WatchOS 3 or WatchOS 4), via Apple TV (or Apple TV 4K), or any Mac that's running macOS Sierra or macOS High Sierra.


 What's New
When editing Live photos on a newer model iPhone, you're able to create image loops or use the new Bounce or Long Exposure options to make the Live images look even more impressive when they're viewed or shared. The Bounce feature plays the Live photo (mini-movie) and then immediately plays it in reverse. Use the Long Explore option to capture the passing of time or movement within a single frame.


 Tip
The Markup feature enables you to use your finger (or the Apple Pencil on compatible iPad Pro devices) to annotate or draw directly on an image (see Figure 9.19).
To access this feature, open and view a single photo, and then tap the Edit icon. From the Edit screen, tap the More (...) icon and then tap the Markup icon (see Figure 9.20).
From the Markup screen, select your drawing or annotation tool and virtual ink color from the icons that are displayed at the bottom of the screen. You also can select a thickness for the virtual drawing tool.
Once the annotation and drawing tool is selected, draw or write on the image itself. Tap the Add (+) icon to add a text-based caption directly on the image, add a digital signature to the image, or use the Magnifier to view a close-up a portion of the image. Tap the Square, Circle, Text Balloon, or Arrow icon to add one of these graphic elements to the image (see Figure 9.21). Tap Done to save your changes.
Whatever you draw or annotate in an image is saved and becomes part of that image. Thus, it's a good idea to create a duplicate image so you can keep the original and separately save the one you use the Markup features on.
Do this as you save the newly edited image the first time after using Markup. Alternatively, before using the Markup feature, open an image to view it, tap the Share icon, and then tap the Duplicate icon to create a copy.


FIGURE 9.19
Add text or draw on your photos using the Markup feature.

FIGURE 9.20
Tap the More icon and then tap the Markup icon.

FIGURE 9.21
Tap on the Add (+) icon to access this menu, which offers additional drawing and annotation tools, along with a Magnification tool.
Enhance
The Enhance icon looks like a magic wand. When you tap it, you can use a one-touch editing tool that automatically adjusts multiple aspects of a photo at once, including its contrast, exposure, and color, to make the image look better and the colors appear more vibrant. You can turn this feature on or off, but it is not manually adjustable.
Crop
Use the Crop tool shown in Figure 9.22 to manually adjust the cropping of the image by dragging one of the corners of the white frame horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The Crop tool also enables you to straighten a photo and readjust its angle by placing your finger on the straightening dial and moving it. Tap the Image Rotation icon to rotate the image 90 degrees.

 Tip
After using any of the Cropping tools, be sure to tap Done to save your changes. Alternatively, tap Cancel to exit out of this option without saving your changes.


FIGURE 9.22
Tap the Crop icon to access tools for cropping, straightening, and rotating an image.

 Tip
As you're cropping an image, tap the Aspect Ratio icon to select an aspect ratio, such as Original, Square, 3:2, 5:3, 4:3, 5:4, 7:5, or 16:9. Unless you need the image in a specific size, choose the Original option, and then use the Crop tool to adjust your image. Selecting an aspect ratio forces the basic dimensions to stay intact as you crop the image. This enables you to make accurately formatted prints later, without throwing off the image dimensions.


 Tip
Tap the Reset option to undo anything you've done using the Crop tool, Image Rotation tool, or Aspect Ratio tool.

Filters
The Photos app offers nine preinstalled special effect filters. After tapping the Filters icon, select the filter you want to apply to your image with a single onscreen tap. A preview of the altered image is displayed. To save the changes, tap Done. To discard the changes, tap Cancel, or tap another filter.

 Note
In addition to the filters that come preinstalled with the Photos app, third-party developers can now create optional filters you can use with the Photos app.

Adjust
The Photos app enables you to edit or enhance many different aspects of a photo. Begin by tapping the Adjust icon. Then, from the Adjust submenu, tap the Light, Color, or B&W option. Each one of these options reveals a submenu that offers a variety of editing tools.

 Tip
As you're using the various editing tools, press your finger gently on the image to toggle between viewing the original image and the edited version of the image you're working with. Doing this enables you to see the effect the editing tool is having on your image.

The Light Tools
When you tap the Light tool, a slider appears that enables you to manually increase or decrease the overall Light effect in the image being viewed (see Figure 9.23).
When you tap the Menu icon (after tapping the Light option), a submenu with options for Brilliance, Exposure, Highlights, Shadows, Brightness, Contract, and Black Point is displayed (see Figure 9.24).
Tap any of these options to reveal a separate slider you can use to manually adjust that option. Keep in mind that you can mix and match the use of these tools to create truly customized visual effects.

FIGURE 9.23
Use the slider to manually adjust the master Light tool.

FIGURE 9.24
The Light menu gives you access to seven additional tools you can use one at a time to edit your image.

 Note
The new Portrait Lighting feature available on the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X can also be used to digitally alter and enhance the lighting of any image shot using Portrait mode. This can be done while taking the photo, or after the fact using the Photos app. This feature is separate from the Light tools available to all iPhone and iPad users working with the Photos app.

The Color Tools
When you tap the Color icon, a master Color slider is displayed. Use your finger to manually adjust this feature. Tap the Menu icon to reveal additional color-related options, including Saturation, Contrast, and Cast (see Figure 9.25).
Each of these tools (see Figure 9.26) has its own slider that you can manually adjust. Again, after making a change, be sure to tap Done to save your edits. Alternatively, tap Cancel/Close to exit out of the selected editing tool without making any changes.

FIGURE 9.25
After tapping on the Color icon, tap the More menu icon to access tools for adjusting the Saturation, Contrast, and Cast in a photo.

FIGURE 9.26
Select the Saturation option and then use the slider to customize this setting.
The B&W Tools
Tap the B&W icon to instantly convert a full-color image into black and white. You can manually adjust the black, white, and grayscale colors using the B&W slider.
By tapping the Menu icon after selecting the B&W editing tool, additional submenu options enable you to manually adjust the image's Intensity, Neutrals, Tone, and Grain, which all relate directly to the black-and-white effect. Upon tapping one of these options, a separate slider is offered, so you can adjust the intensity of the tool and the effect it has on your image.
After making a change, tap Done to save your edits or Cancel/Close to exit out of the selected editing tool without making any changes.
Editing Live Photos
A Live photo can be edited just as you would edit any other photo within the Photos app. Select the Live image, and then tap Edit to use any of the tools you read about in the previous sections.
However, new to iOS 11 are several Live Photo Effects. In addition to using any of the other image-editing tools, add the Loop, Bounce, or Long Exposure effect to an image to make Live images look even more impressive when they're viewed or shared.
The Loop effect plays the Live photo in a continuous loop, as opposed to as a one- to two-second mini-movie. The Bounce feature plays the Live photo and then immediately plays it in reverse. Use the Long Explore option to capture the passing of time or movement within a single frame.
To edit a Live photo and add the Loop, Bounce, or Long Exposure effect, follow these steps:
1. Launch the Photos app.
2. Select the Live photo you want to edit and open it. All Live photos are automatically stored within the Live Photos album within Photos, as well as within the All Photos/Camera Roll album.
3. Tap Edit, and edit the photo as you normally would to enhance its appearance, straighten the image, or crop it.
4. After saving the edited Live photo, you see the edited photo (see Figure 9.27). Place your finger on the image and swipe up.
5. Displayed below the Effects heading are the options for Live, Loop, Bounce, and Long Exposure.
6. Tap the effect you want to preview (see Figure 9.28). For this example, I scrolled to the right on the iPhone and selected the Long Exposure effect.
7. If you like how the effect looks (shown in Figure 9.29), tap Back (<)to save the image and return to the previous Photos screen. If you opt to preview a different Live effect, swipe up on the image again and choose the effect you want from the menu.

FIGURE 9.27
While looking at a Live photo within the Photos app, swipe up to access the Live Effects menu.

FIGURE 9.28
Choose the Live effect you want to preview by tapping an option displayed below the Effects heading.

FIGURE 9.29
See the effect you selected on the Live image. The Long Exposure effect for a Live photo is shown here.
Editing Videos
When you tap the thumbnail for a video clip, you have the option of playing that clip from within the Photos app. The Share, Favorite, and Trash icons are displayed on the screen.
Tap the Edit icon to access the video trimming (editing) feature. To trim a video clip, look at the filmstrip display of the clip and move the left or right editing tabs accordingly to define the portion of the clip you want to edit and keep.
The box around the filmstrip display (representing the portion of the video you want to keep) turns yellow, and the Done option appears (see Figure 9.30). Before tapping Done, tap the Play icon to preview your newly edited (trimmed) video clip.
After trimming the beginning or end of the video clip, tap Done to save your changes. The Save As New Clip option appears. Tap it. To gain access to a comprehensive and powerful set of video editing tools, download and install Apple's iMovie app onto your mobile device.

FIGURE 9.30
Use the Photos app to trim video clips, but use the optional iMovie app to fully edit videos.
All videos you shoot and edit are stored automatically in the All Photos/Camera Roll album, as well as the separate Videos (or Slo-Mo album), which you can access by tapping the Albums icon at the bottom of the screen.
Printing Photos
iOS 11 is fully compatible with Apple's AirPrint feature, so if you have a home photo printer set up to work wirelessly with your smartphone or tablet, you can create prints from your digital images using the Print command in the Photos app. Follow these steps to print an image:
1. Launch the Photos app.
2. Tap any image thumbnail to view that image. You might need to open an album first by tapping the album's thumbnail if you have the Albums viewing option selected.
3. Tap the full-screen version of the image to make the various command icons appear.
4. Tap the Share icon.
5. Select the Print option.
6. When the Printer Options submenu appears, select your printer, determine how many copies of the print you'd like to create, choose the size of the desired print(s), and then tap the Print icon.

 More Info
To print wirelessly from your iOS device using the AirPrint feature, you must have a compatible printer. To learn more about AirPrint, and to configure your printer for wireless printing from your iPhone or iPad, visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311.

Third-Party Apps for Ordering Prints from Your Images
If you want to order professional-quality prints directly from your iPhone or iPad, and have them shipped to your door in a few days, use one of several apps (such as FreePrints) available from the App Store.
The free KickSend app, for example, determines your current location, and tells you which one-hour photo labs are in close proximity. Upload your photos to the desired lab directly from your iPhone or iPad, and within 30 to 60 minutes, pick up your prints at the selected location. KickSend is easy to use, and works with participating Walgreen's, CVS Pharmacy, Target, and Walmart locations.
The free Shutterfly app also enables you to order prints directly from your iOS mobile device, plus it gives you the option to create custom photo gifts, such as coffee mugs, mouse pads, iPhone cases, T-shirts, and other products that showcase your images. You can order enlargements, canvas prints, and other types of wall art that showcase your favorite photos.
Sharing Photos and Videos
After you have selected one or more images, tap the Share icon to access the Share menu (shown in Figure 9.31).

FIGURE 9.31
The Share menu offered by the iOS 11 edition of the Photos app (shown here on an iPad Pro).
Sending Images Wirelessly via Airdrop
If you're within close proximity to another Mac, iPhone, or iPad and the other computer or iOS mobile device also has the AirDrop feature turned on, you can wirelessly send images from within the Photos app using the AirDrop feature. This feature becomes active only when others nearby can receive an AirDrop transmission.

 Note
Use the options available from the Share menu to share selected images via AirDrop, Text Message, Email, iCloud Photo Sharing, Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr. You can also copy images to a compatible cloud-based file-sharing/storage service by tapping the Save to Files icon.
App icons for third-party apps that are installed in your iPhone or iPad and that you can use for sharing images are also displayed here—for example, Instagram or Facebook Messenger.
From the Share menu, tap the Add to Notes icon to export a photo directly into a note in the Notes app, or tap Save PDF to iBooks to export the image using the PDF file format so it can be viewed in iBooks.
Tap the More (...) icon to display a list of all apps installed on your iPhone or iPad that are compatible with the Photos app's Share menu. To add apps to the Share menu, turn on the virtual switch associated with each app listing when viewing the Activities menu.
The bottom row of command icons displayed in the Share menu offer a selection of tools for managing the selected image(s). Here, you'll find options including Copy, Slideshow, Hide, Print, Duplicate, Assign to Contact, Use As Wallpaper, Add to Album, Save to Dropbox (if you have the Dropbox app installed and an active Dropbox account), Save to Files, and More (...) command icons. On an iPhone, you need to scroll horizontally to see all of the icons.


 Tip
In the Share menu are options for iCloud Photo Sharing. To place photos online in a particular iCloud Photos album that you will ultimately want to share with other people, tap the iCloud Photo Sharing option, and then fill in the prompts offered in the iCloud window that appears.
To upload the selected images to iCloud Drive (which is different from iCloud Photo Library or iCloud Shared Albums), select the Save to Files option, select iCloud Drive, and then choose the folder or subfolder where you want to store the photo(s).

Copying an Image to Another App
In the Photos app, you can temporarily store a photo in your iOS device's virtual clipboard, and then paste that photo into another compatible app. To copy a photo into your device's virtual clipboard, follow these steps:
1. In the Photos app, select a single photo and view it in full-screen mode.
2. Tap the image to make the command icons appear.
3. Tap the Share icon.
4. Tap the Copy icon. The photo is now stored in the virtual clipboard.
5. Launch a compatible app and then hold your finger down on the screen to use the Paste option and paste your photo from the clipboard into the active app.
Showing Images on a Television via Airplay
Instead of viewing an image in full-screen mode on your iPhone or iPad, tap the AirPlay icon and select Apple TV (or Apple TV 4K) to wirelessly transmit the image to your HD television set. To use this feature with an HD TV, you need the optional Apple TV (or Apple TV 4K) device. To use the feature with a Mac, be sure AirPlay on your Mac is turned on.
Deleting Photos Stored on Your iOS Device
To delete one image at a time as you're viewing them in full-screen mode, simply tap the Trash icon.
To select and delete multiple images, as you're looking at thumbnails, tap the Select button. Tap each thumbnail that represents an image you want to delete. A check mark icon appears in each image thumbnail to indicate that the image has been selected. Tap the Trash icon to delete the selected images.

 Caution
When you opt to delete a photo, it's automatically deleted from the mobile device you're using, as well as from iCloud Photo Library and all computers and mobile devices that are linked to the same iCloud account.

Taking Advantage of iCloud Photo Library
Turn on the iCloud Photo Library feature from within Settings on all your iOS mobile devices, as well as from the iCloud Control Panel on your Mac or PC computers, and you'll be able to sync your entire digital photo library across all your computers and mobile devices, maintain an online backup of your images, and share groups of selected images (or entire albums) with other people.
To turn on iCloud Photo Library on each of your iOS mobile devices, launch Settings, tap your profile photo/username, tap the iCloud option, tap the Photos option, and then turn on the virtual switch associated with the iCloud Photo Library option. Use the other options in this submenu to customize the iCloud Photo Library feature on the device you're using.
Keep in mind that, based on how many digital photos are in your entire digital photo library, you might need to upgrade your iCloud account (for a monthly fee) to get additional online storage space. Refer to Chapter 6, "Sync, Share, and Print Files Using AirDrop, AirPlay, AirPrint, and Handoff," for more information about using iCloud.

 Note
When you store photos in your iCloud Drive, you can turn on the Family Sharing feature, which enables a Family Album. One single Family Album is accessible by up to six family members, who can freely add, edit, delete, and share images stored in that album. Everyone's other image albums remain private and separate from the Family Album.


 More Info
Instead of using the Camera app to take pictures and the Photos app to edit, manage, print, and share your photos, browse through the hundreds of third-party photography- and videography-related apps available from the App Store that can be used with or instead of the Camera and Photos apps.
These optional apps can provide you with a much broader toolbox for taking and working with your digital images. To find these apps, visit the App Store and browse the Photo & Video category.
Following are 13 of the more popular and powerful photo- and/or video-editing apps available for the iPhone and iPad (in alphabetical order):

10. Make and Receive Calls with an iPhone or iPad

In this Chapter
 How to use the calling features you'll find useful on your iPhone
 How to manage Favorites, Recents, Contacts, and Voicemail
 Take advantage of the Handoff features to answer incoming calls to your iPhone from your iPad or Mac

Although your iPhone is capable of handling a wide range of tasks, one of its core purposes is to serve as a feature-packed cell phone. Your iPhone makes and receives voice calls using a cellular network that's operated by the service provider you selected when the phone was activated. The Phone app that comes preinstalled on your iPhone offers a vast selection of calling features that make it easy to stay in touch with people.
After you set up and activate your new iPhone with a cellular service provider and choose a calling plan, the iPhone is capable of receiving incoming calls, plus it enables you to make outgoing calls using the Phone app.

 Note
Many cellular service providers offer plans that enable you to pay for the iPhone over time and then upgrade to the newest model iPhone each year when it's released.
Apple offers the iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available from Apple Stores and Apple.com. It involves paying up to 24 monthly installments to purchase an unlocked iPhone outright, or enables you to keep paying monthly installments but receive a brand-new iPhone (every 12 months) when a new model is released.
When you receive a new phone, if it's before the 24 installments have been paid, the installment plan restarts, or you can pay off the balance for the phone you already have and keep it, but then begin paying installments on the newest iPhone model.
The monthly installment varies, based on which model iPhone you acquire and how much internal storage space it contains. Keep in mind that the monthly installment you pay for the Apple Upgrade Program or your cellular service provider (for the phone) doesn't include cellular service. The service is a separate fee, which is based on the plan you select from a compatible cellular service provider.
One benefit to the Apple Upgrade Program is that AppleCare+ is included. To learn more about this program, visit www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-upgrade-program.

Choose a wireless service provider that offers the best coverage in your area, the most competitively priced calling plan based on your needs, and the extra features you want or need. When looking at coverage area maps for various service providers, focus on 4G LTE coverage, as opposed to 3G or plain 4G service. Some wireless service providers, for example, offer better international roaming coverage than others, whereas some are more generous when it comes to monthly wireless data allocation.

 Note
Cellular service providers continue to offer incentives to customers to switch to a specific carrier. For example, starting in September 2017, T-Mobile began offering a free Netflix subscription with its unlimited One family plans. Other providers offer deep discounts for signing up multiple family members under a single account.

Keep in mind that the iPhone hardware is sometimes slightly different based on which wireless service provider you choose, so you typically can't switch providers after you've acquired the iPhone (unless it's an unlocked iPhone or you exchange the iPhone for a model that's compatible with the new provider).
Using Your iPhone as a Phone
For your iPhone to make or receive calls, it must be turned on and not in Airplane mode. Unless you're using the Call Over Wi-Fi function (which not all cellular service providers support), a decent cellular service signal, which is displayed in the upper-left corner of the screen in the form of dots, is also a necessity. The more dots you see (up to five), the stronger the cellular signal (which is based on your proximity to the closest cell towers).

 Tip
From the Home screen of a compatible iPhone that offers 3D Touch capabilities, press and hold the Phone app icon to reveal a menu that gives you quick access to a handful of useful call-related features, including icons representing your most recently called contacts from the Phone app's Favorites list (shown in Figure 10.1).


FIGURE 10.1
Use the iPhone's 3D Touch capabilities from the Home screen (on compatible iPhones) to gain quick access to useful call-related features.
Managing Incoming Calls
Regardless of what you're doing on your iPhone, when you receive an incoming call, everything else is put on hold and the Phone app launches automatically, unless the iPhone is turned off, in Airplane mode, or the Do Not Disturb feature is turned on, in which case incoming calls automatically go to voicemail.
To control the volume of the ringer, press the Volume Up or Volume Down buttons on the side of your iPhone; or to turn off the ringer (which causes the phone to vibrate when an incoming call is received), turn on the Mute button on the side of the iPhone.
Avoid Answering and Silence the Ringer
While your iPhone is still ringing, you can silence the ringer and send the incoming call to voicemail after a 5- to 10-second delay, press the Power button or the Volume Up or Volume Down button one time.
To send the incoming call immediately to voicemail, double press the Power button. Alternatively, tap the Decline option displayed on the screen when the phone is not locked at the time the incoming call is received.
To temporarily silence the iPhone's ringer (when you go into a meeting or you're watching a movie, for example), switch on the Mute button, which is a small, physical switch located on the side of most iPhone models. When the Mute button is on, your phone vibrates instead of ringing when an incoming call is received.

 Note
If you're an Apple Watch user, cover the watchface with your hand to decline an incoming call.


 Tip
To customize the Vibrate feature, launch Settings, tap the Sounds & Haptics option, turn on the virtual switch associated with Vibrate On Ring or Vibrate On Silent, and then tap the Ringtone option under the Sounds and Vibration Patterns heading to select a custom vibration pattern when incoming calls are received.

Yet another way to be left alone is to put your phone in Do Not Disturb mode. This can be done automatically at certain predetermined times, or manually whenever you want to be left alone. To do this, access Control Center and tap the Do Not Disturb icon. Read more about the Do Not Disturb feature later in this chapter.
Answer Incoming Calls
There are several ways to answer an incoming call. If you're doing something else on your iPhone and it starts to ring, the caller ID for the incoming caller appears, along with a green-and-white Accept button and a red-and-white Decline button (as shown in Figure 10.2). Tap the Accept button to answer the call. If you tap Decline or wait too long to answer, the call automatically goes to voicemail.
If you're using your iPhone with EarPods, AirPods, ear buds, or a headset with a built-in microphone, answer an incoming call by pressing the Accept button on the headset.

FIGURE 10.2
Your iPhone notifies you when an incoming call is received. You can then answer or decline the call. This screen appears as long as the phone is not locked when the incoming call is received.

 Tip
When you receive an incoming call, displayed above the Decline and Accept buttons (or the Slide to Answer slider on the Lock screen) are two other options labeled Remind Me and Message (refer to Figure 10.2).
When you tap Message, a menu containing four prewritten text messages, along with a Custom button, is displayed. Tap one of the Message buttons to send that message to the caller via text/instant message. Or tap the Custom button to type a custom message to send to that caller. The incoming call is automatically transferred to voicemail.
To customize the prewritten messages available from the Message option, launch Settings, tap the Phone option, and then tap the Respond with Text option. Displayed on the Respond with Text menu screen are three customizable fields under the heading "Respond With:" Tap one of these fields to replace one of the default messages with your own.
The other option for managing incoming calls is the Remind Me option. When you tap this button, the incoming call is sent to voicemail, but you can quickly set a reminder (and alarm) for yourself to call that person back in one hour, when you leave your current location, or when you get home. For these last two options to function, Locations Services related to the Phone app must be turned on from within Settings.

If the iPhone is in Sleep mode (or on the Lock screen and locked) when an incoming call is received, unlock the phone by swiping your finger from left to right on the Slide to Answer slider, which automatically takes the phone out of Sleep mode, unlocks it, and answers the incoming call (shown in Figure 10.3).
Of course, if your iPhone has a Touch ID sensor built in to the Home button, you're able to unlock the phone and answer a call simply by placing your finger on the Touch ID sensor. An iPhone X user can simply look at the screen to unlock the phone to answer an incoming call.
Notice that the iPhone's Lock screen displays the Remind Me and Message icons but does not display an Accept or Decline button.
If you're too busy to answer an incoming call on your iPhone, you can simply let the call go to voicemail by doing nothing.

FIGURE 10.3
When an incoming call is received while the phone is in Sleep mode (locked), you need to unlock the phone to automatically answer it.

 Note
Answering the phone using an optional Bluetooth headset, such as Apple AirPods, automatically unlocks the phone if it's in Sleep mode.

After you answer an incoming call, you have a few additional options. You can hold the iPhone up to your ear and start talking, or you can tap the Speaker icon to use your iPhone as a speakerphone. It's also possible to use the phone with a wired or Bluetooth (wireless) headset or CarPlay, which offers hands-free operation. The headset option is ideal when you're driving, plus it offers privacy (versus using the iPhone's speakerphone option).

 Caution
If you're driving, choose a headset that covers only one ear, use the Speaker option for hands-free operation, or use CarPlay. Refrain from holding the phone up to your ear or covering both ears with a headset. Make sure you're familiar with state and local laws in your area related to the use of cell phones while driving.

When using a Bluetooth headset, you don't need to hold the phone up to your ear to carry on a conversation. If you're using a headset, answer the call by pressing the headset's answer button when you receive an incoming call. There's no need to do anything on your iPhone.
Set Up Call Forwarding
Call forwarding allows you to automatically reroute all incoming calls to another phone number, such as your home or office number. To set up call forwarding and turn this function on or off, launch Settings and then tap the Phone option.
Tap the Call Forwarding option, turn on the virtual switch for Call Forwarding, and then manually enter the phone number to which you want to divert all incoming calls.
Customizing Other Phone Options
From the Phone submenu in Settings, your iPhone's phone number is displayed at the top of the screen (see Figure 10.4). From this menu, you can customize a handful of Phone app and call-related features.

 Note
The options available to you depend on which model iPhone you're using and which cellular service provider the phone is linked with.

For example, tap the Announce Calls option. This allows Siri to tell you who is calling when a call comes in. From the Announce Calls submenu, choose when you want this feature to be active. Options include Always, Headphones & Car, Headphones Only, or Never.
With the Call Blocking & Identification option you can manage calls you've manually added to your Blocked Calls list. Using the Call Blocking feature is a way to reduce telemarketing calls (or calls from an "ex").

FIGURE 10.4
Customize options related to the Phone app from the Phone submenu within Settings.

 Tip
To manually add a phone number to your iPhone's Blocked Call list, after you've received at least one call from a number you want to block, tap the Recents button in the Phone app. Look for the incoming call's listing. Tap the Info (i) icon for the call and then scroll down and tap the Block This Caller option.
In the future, calls from this number will be blocked, until you manually remove the phone number from your iPhone's Blocked list. To do this, launch Settings, tap Phone, tap Call Blocking & Identification, tap Edit (located in the top-right corner of the screen), and then tap the - icon associated with the phone number listing.

Also from Settings, you have the option of enabling the Dial Assist feature, which figures out the dialing prefixes and phone number format that's necessary to make a call overseas. That makes initiating international phone calls much less confusing.
Tap Show My Caller ID to set whether you want your iPhone's phone number and/or your name to be displayed when you make calls from your iPhone to other people.
Using the Handoff Feature with Calls
When Handoff is activated, as long as your iPhone is within wireless proximity to your iPad or Mac (typically within 33 feet), it's possible to use your iPad (see Figure 10.5) or Mac to answer a call coming in to your iPhone.

FIGURE 10.5
When an iPhone and iPad are linked to the same iCloud account and have the Handoff option turned on, it's possible to answer an incoming call on the iPad (shown here).

 Note
All Macs and iOS mobile devices that are set up to work with the Handoff feature must be linked to the same iCloud account and have Bluetooth and Wi-Fi turned on. Keep in mind that some older iPhones and iPads do not support this feature. Likewise, only Macs purchased in 2012 or later (and running OS X Yosemite, El Capitan, macOS Sierra, or macOS High Sierra) support this feature.


 Note
When the Handoff feature is turned on and the iPhone is wirelessly linked with an iPad or Mac, you can initiate calls from that tablet or computer by tapping or clicking a displayed phone number that appears in the Contacts app, Safari, or another compatible app. These calls are initiated using your iPad or Mac, but they're actually handled by your nearby iPhone's cellular service connectivity.

To set up this feature, start with your iPhone and launch Settings, tap the General option, and then tap the Handoff option. From the Handoff submenu, turn on the virtual switch that's associated with the Handoff option. Next, repeat this process on your iPad. (This only needs to be done once per device.)
When the Handoff feature is turned on, your iPhone automatically maintains a wireless link to your iPad and/or Mac. When an incoming call is received, all connected devices ring, Caller ID information is displayed, and you can accept or decline the call from any connected device.
On the iPad or Mac, the tablet or computer acts like a speakerphone by taking advantage of the built-in microphone and speaker(s). You can also pair a Bluetooth wireless headset to your iPad or Mac, or you can connect a corded headset (with built-in microphone) to the tablet or Mac via the headphone jack.

 Note
To learn how to manage the Handoff feature on your Mac, visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681.

Managing the Do Not Disturb Feature
To activate and customize the Do Not Disturb feature, launch Settings and tap the Do Not Disturb option. To later enable or disable this feature, access the Control Center, and tap the crescent moon-shaped icon (shown in Figure 10.6).
When turned on, a moon icon is displayed on the iPhone's or iPad's status bar (at the very top of the screen), and all calls and alerts are silenced.
You can turn on or off this feature at any time or schedule specific times you want Do Not Disturb to be automatically activated, such as between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays. From the Do Not Disturb menu in Settings, determine whether certain important callers are allowed to reach you, even when the phone is in Do Not Disturb mode.

FIGURE 10.6
You can easily access the Do Not Disturb feature from Control Center.
Keep in mind that when your iPhone is turned off, all incoming calls are forwarded directly to voicemail, and it is not possible to initiate an outgoing call. Likewise, incoming text messages, FaceTime calls, and other communications from the outside world are not accepted when an iPhone is turned off, in Do Not Disturb mode, or in Airplane mode. Instead, notifications for these missed messages are displayed in Notification Center (depending on how you set up Notification Center), in their respective apps, and potentially on the Lock screen when you turn on the device or turn off Airplane mode.
Managing Calls in Progress
As soon as you answer an incoming call, the Phone app's display changes to the Call in Progress screen (see Figure 10.7). This screen contains several command icons, including Mute, Keypad, Speaker/Audio, Add Call, FaceTime, Contacts, and End. The caller's information and a call timer are displayed at the top of the screen.

FIGURE 10.7
The Call in Progress screen with the speaker feature active.

 Note
When you receive an incoming call, if the caller ID for that caller matches up with a contact entry stored in the Contacts app, that person's name, which number the call is from (Home, Work, Mobile, and so on), and the caller's photo (if you have a photo of that person linked to the contact) are displayed.
If there's no match in your Contacts database, the regular Caller ID data is displayed, which can include the person's name, phone number, and the city and state from which the call is originating. You might also receive calls labeled Private or Unknown.

Here's a summary of the command icons available to you from the Call in Progress screen during a phone conversation:
 Mute—Tap this icon to turn off your iPhone's microphone. You can still hear what's being said to you, but the person you're speaking with cannot hear you. When you're ready to be heard again, turn off the Mute feature by tapping this icon again.
 Keypad—Replace the current Call in Progress screen with the numeric telephone keypad. This is necessary for navigating your way through voicemail trees (for example, when you're told to press 1 for English, press 2 to speak with an operator, press 3 to track an order, and so on).
 Speaker (or Audio)—Tap the Speaker icon to switch from Handset mode (in which you hold the iPhone up to your ear to have a phone conversation) to Speaker mode, which turns your iPhone into a speakerphone. If you're using your iPhone with an optional Bluetooth headset (such as AirPods) or CarPlay, a third Headset/AirPods or CarPlay option is displayed.
 Add Call (+)—During a conversation with someone, you can initiate a conference call and bring a third party into the conversation by tapping Add Call, as described later in this chapter.
 FaceTime—If the person to whom you're talking is also using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and both devices have Internet access, tap the FaceTime icon to switch from a traditional voice call to a real-time video call using the FaceTime app. This is a free service.

 Tip
In addition to being able to launch FaceTime from the Phone app and switch from a normal call to a video call, you can use the separate FaceTime app to initiate a video or audio-only call from your iPhone (or iPad) that uses an Internet connection.
Many cellular service providers allow FaceTime calls to be made using a 4G LTE connection, although a Wi-Fi connection typically works better.

 Contacts—While you're conversing on the phone, you can access your Contacts database and look up someone's information by tapping this option.
 End—Tap the large red-and-white End button or press the end call button on your headset, if applicable, to terminate the call.

 Tip
Your phone conversation can continue while you're using other apps. To launch another app, press the Home button, and tap the app icon from the Home screen. To access the app switcher, double press the Home button and then tap any app icon that appears. To access the Control Center, place your finger near the bottom of the screen and swipe up.
When you view the Home screen or use another app while still on the phone, a green-and-white banner at the top of the screen says, "Touch to return to call," along with a call timer. Tap this green bar to return to the Phone app.

Responding to a Call Waiting Signal While on the Phone
As you're chatting it up on the phone, if someone else tries to call you will hear a call waiting tone. The caller ID information of the new caller is displayed on the screen, along with several command icons and buttons (see Figure 10.8). These commands are End & Accept, Send to Voicemail, or Hold & Accept.

FIGURE 10.8
The Call Waiting feature allows you to answer a second call while you're already engaged in a phone conversation.
If you place the first call on hold and answer the new incoming call (by tapping the Hold & Accept icon), you then have the opportunity to merge the two calls and create a conference call or switch between the two calls and speak with each person individually (while the other is on hold).
While engaged in a conference call on your iPhone, the names of the other parties on the call are displayed along the top of the screen, along with an Info icon. Tap the circular "i" icon to the right of this information to reveal a new screen that enables you to manage any of the parties involved with the conference call.
While you're engaged in a three-way call (with two other parties), you can tap the Add Call option again to add more parties to the conference call. How many parties you can add to a conference call is determined by your cellular service provider.
On the secondary Conference Call Info screen, associated with each name/Caller ID number is an End button and a Private button. Tap End to disconnect that party, or tap Private to speak with that party privately and place the other party (or parties) on hold. You can then reestablish the conference call by tapping the Back button to return to the previous Conference Call screen, and then tap the Merge Calls icon again.

 Tip
To turn off the Call Waiting feature, so you're never disturbed by another incoming caller during a phone conversation, launch Settings, tap Phone, and then tap Call Waiting. Turn off the virtual switch associated with Call Waiting.

Making Calls from Your iPhone
There are several ways to initiate a phone call from your iPhone; however, you typically must first launch the Phone app. Then, do the following:
 Dial a number manually using the keypad.
 Access a listing from your Contacts database (from within the Phone app), choose a number, and tap on it to dial that phone number.
 Use Siri (which is explained in Chapter 4, "Say It and Make It So Using Siri"). This can be done anytime, regardless of what app is running on your iPhone.

 Tip
If you're using one of the newer iPhone models and the "Hey Siri" feature is active, simply say "Hey Siri, call [name]" or "Hey Siri, call [name] at [location (such as home or work)]" to initiate a call.
 Redial a number from the Phone app's Recents call log.
 Select and dial a phone number from the Phone app's Favorites list.
 Dial a number displayed in another compatible app or iOS 11 feature, such as Maps, Messages, Mail, Safari, Contacts, or the Notification Center window. When you tap a displayed phone number, it dials that number and initiates a call using the Phone app.

Manual Dialing
To initiate a call by manually dialing a phone number, launch the Phone app and tap the Keypad option. Enter the desired phone number, one digit at a time, and press the green-and-white Call button to initiate the call.

 Tip
As you're manually entering a phone number, if you want to create a Contacts entry for it, tap the Add Number option, which is directly below the number you've entered, and then tap Create New Contact or Add to Existing Contact.


 Note
You can also use the Cut, Copy, and Paste features of iOS 11 to copy a phone number displayed in another app, and then paste it into the phone number field on the Keypad screen. Or, if you tap a phone number displayed in the Contacts app, listed in an email message, or displayed in a web page while you're using Safari, the Phone app automatically launches and a call to that number is initiated.

Dialing from a Contacts Entry
In the Phone app, you can look up any phone number stored in the Contacts app. Tap the Contacts icon at the bottom of the Phone app screen. When you tap a phone number in a Contacts entry (see Figure 10.9), a call is initiated.

FIGURE 10.9
Initiate a call by tapping any telephone number listed in a Contacts app entry.
To look up the number for a business, restaurant, tourist attraction, or service, launch the Maps app and type the name of the business you're looking for (along with its city and state) in the Search for a Place or Address field. Tap on the appropriate search result, and then scroll down to the phone number listing (see Figure 10.10). Tap the phone number or the Call button to launch the Phone app and initiate a call. (This also works with the optional Yelp! app, as well as other phone directory and business database apps.)

FIGURE 10.10
Use the Maps app to look up the phone number for a business, service, restaurant, or tourist attraction.
Using the Call Over Wi-Fi Calling Feature
Typically, when you initiate a call from your iPhone, it connects to the cellular network you've subscribed to, such as AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, or T-Mobile (if you're in the United States). Thanks to the Call Over Wi-Fi feature, if you're not in a good cellular network coverage area, but your compatible iPhone is within range of a Wi-Fi hotspot, you can still make a call to any landline or other cellphone via the Internet.
Once you initiate a Wi-Fi call, if you leave the Wi-Fi hotspot, your call is automatically transferred to the cellular network's Voice Over LTE feature, if your cellular service supports this option. Likewise, if you're using the Voice Over LTE feature and a Wi-Fi signal becomes available, the call is seamlessly transferred to the Wi-Fi network.
If a Wi-Fi network is available, manually initiate calls using the Call Over Wi-Fi feature (rather than over a cellular network) by launching Settings, tapping the Phone option, and then turning the virtual switch associated with the Wi-Fi Calling option.

 Tip
From either any iPhone or iPad, you can also make and receive Internet-based Voice-over-IP (VoIP) phone calls using Skype or a similar app. These calls can be made to or received from any landline or cell phone. You can participate in Skype-to-Skype calls for free. For other calls, Skype charges a very low per-minute rate (typically $0.02 or less per minute).
In addition to VoIP calls, Skype can be used for free video calls with Mac, PC, iOS mobile device, Android mobile device, or Windows mobile device users. Using FaceTime for video or audio-only calls, however, works only with other Mac or iOS mobile device users.
Skype is also ideal for saving money when you're making international calls from the United States, or to avoid hefty international roaming charges when you're calling home to the United States when traveling overseas.
Yet another Internet calling option is to use the audio calling feature offered by Facebook Messenger to initiate calls with your Facebook friends.

Managing Your Voicemail
Your unique iPhone phone number comes with voicemail, which enables people to leave you messages if you're not able to speak with them when they call. Just as with any voicemail service, you can record your outgoing message, play back missed messages from your iPhone, or call your iPhone's voicemail service and listen to your calls from another phone.
Using the Voicemail Transcription feature, you're able to read text-based versions of your incoming voicemail messages that your iPhone creates for you. This feature works automatically.
Recording Your Outgoing Message
To record your outgoing voicemail message, which is what people hear when they call your iPhone and you don't answer, follow these steps. Alternatively, you can have a computer-generated voice instruct callers to leave a message.
1. Launch the Phone app from the Home screen.
2. Tap the Voicemail icon, displayed in the lower-right corner of the screen.
3. In the upper-left corner of the Voicemail screen, tap the Greeting option.
4. From the Greeting screen, tap the Default option to skip recording a message and have a computer voice use a generic message. Alternatively, tap the Custom option to record your own outgoing voicemail message and continue to step 5.
5. Tap the Record option that's also displayed on the Greeting screen. Hold the phone up to your mouth and begin recording your message.
6. When you're finished recording, tap the Stop option. You can play back your message by tapping the Play option, or tap the Save option to save your message and activate it.
Playing and Deleting Voicemail Messages
It's possible to listen to audio voicemail messages either from your iPhone or by calling your iPhone's voicemail from another phone.
Listening to Voicemail From Your iPhone
From your iPhone, follow these steps to listen to and then save or delete an incoming voicemail message:
1. Launch the Phone app from the Home screen, or by swiping a voicemail notification appearing on the Notification Center screen.
2. Tap the Voicemail icon displayed in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
3. Under the Voicemail heading at the top of the screen is a listing of missed voicemail messages. Tap a message to highlight it.

 Note
When you see a blue dot to the left of a voicemail message listing, this indicates it's a new, unheard message. After you listen to the message, the blue dot disappears. When you tap the message to listen to it, the blue dot changes to a Pause/Play icon.

4. After a message is highlighted, tap the small Play/Pause icon. The message begins playing. It might, however, take a few seconds for the message to load. Expect a brief pause before the message begins.
5. Displayed immediately below the message's Caller ID information is a transcription of the message. It appears a minute or two after the message is recorded by the caller.
6. Near the bottom of the voicemail listing is a slider that depicts the length of the message, along with Speaker/Audio, Call Back, and Delete options. As your message plays, the timer slider moves to the right. You can listen to parts of the message again by moving this slider around with your finger.

 Tip
Associated with each incoming voicemail message is a Share icon and an Info icon. Tap the Share icon to access a variety of options for sharing or exporting the voicemail message. Tap the Info icon to reveal information about the caller and, among other things, view options that enable you to call back that person or create a new contact for him/her in the Contacts app. It's also possible to keep the caller from reaching you in the future by tapping the Block This Caller option.

7. When you're finished listening to the message, either leave the listing alone (which keeps the message saved on your phone) or tap the Delete option to erase it. You also have the option of calling back the person who left the message by tapping the Call Back option.
8. To exit the voicemail options, tap any of the other command icons displayed at the bottom of the Phone app's screen, or press the Home button on your iPhone.

 Tip
You might find it easier to listen to your voicemail messages via speaker phone, by first tapping the Speaker/Audio option that's displayed below the timer slider.


 Tip
If you accidentally delete an important voicemail, don't panic. From the voicemail screen, scroll to the very bottom of your voicemail message list and tap the Deleted Messages icon. Tap a message to highlight it, and then tap the Undelete icon.

Using the Message Transcription Feature
Thanks to automatic voicemail message transcription, when a caller leaves a voicemail message, the iPhone automatically transcribes that message (typically within a minute or two) and offers both text and audio versions of the message.
To access this feature, launch the Phone app and tap the Voicemail icon. Tap a listing for a new voicemail message. In addition to the familiar Play/Pause icon, as well as a slider for fast forwarding and rewinding through the audio message, you see a text transcription of the voicemail message.
Tap the Share icon to forward the message to yourself or other people using any of the options offered by the Share menu, such as text message or email. You also can export the voicemail message transcript into a compatible app, such as Notes.
Like the Dictation feature, the voicemail transcription feature often has trouble accurately interpreting words if the person speaking is in a noisy area or doesn't speak clearly. Consequently, this feature does not always provide 100-percent accurate voicemail transcript, especially for longer messages, but it does offer a readable version of the message that you can quickly review.
Creating and Using a Favorites List
The Phone app allows you to maintain a Favorites list, which is a customized list of your most frequently dialed contacts. To access this list, launch the Phone app, and then tap the Favorites icon.
To add a contact to the Favorites list, tap the + icon in the upper-right corner of the screen. Select any listing from your Contacts database, and tap it. When the complete listing for that entry appears, tap the specific phone number you want listed in your Favorites list. The newly created Favorites listing appears at the end of your Favorites list.

 Tip
Each Favorites entry can have one name and one phone number associated with it, so if a Contact entry has multiple phone numbers listed, choose one. If you want quick access to someone's home, work, and mobile numbers from your Favorites list, create three separate entries for that person.
When you create the entry in Favorites, the type of phone number (Home, Work, Mobile, iPhone, and so on) is displayed to the right of the person's name. A Favorites listing can also relate to someone's FaceTime identifier (their iPhone number, Apple ID, or the email address they used to set up their FaceTime account).

To edit the contacts already listed in your Favorites list, tap the Edit option in the upper-left corner of the screen.

 Tip
As you're viewing your Favorites list, tap the Info ("i") icon, shown to the right of each listing. This enables you to view that person's entire entry from within your Contacts database.

To dial a phone number listed in your Favorites list, simply tap its listing. The Phone app automatically dials the number and initiates a call.
Accessing Your Recents Call Log
The Phone app automatically keeps track of all incoming and outgoing calls. To access this detailed call log, launch the Phone app, and then tap the Recents icon at the bottom of the screen.
At the top of the Recents screen are two command tabs, labeled All and Missed, along with an Edit option. Tap the All tab to view a detailed listing of all incoming and outgoing calls, displayed in reverse-chronological order. Missed incoming calls are displayed in red. Tap the Missed tab to see a listing of calls you didn't answer. Tap the Edit option to delete specific calls from this listing, or tap the Info ("i") icon to view more details about that caller, including their recent call history with you.

 Tip
Missed calls are also displayed in the Notification Center window on your iPhone or as an icon badge or alert on your Home screen, depending on how you set up Notifications for the Phone app in the Settings app. To customize the Notifications options for the Phone app, launch Settings and tap the Notifications option. Then tap the Phone option. You can adjust how your iPhone alerts you to missed calls by personalizing the options on this Phone screen.

Each listing in the Recents call log displays the name of the person you spoke with (based on data from your Contacts database or the Caller ID feature) or their phone number. If it's someone from your Contacts database, information about which phone number (home, work, mobile, or such) the caller used appears below the name.
If the same person called you, or you called that person, multiple times in a row, a number in parentheses indicates how many calls were made to or from that person. This is displayed to the right of the name or phone number.
On the right side of the screen, with each Recents listing, is the time/date the call was made or received. To view the Contacts entry related to that person, tap the Info icon associated with the listing. At the top of a contact's entry screen are details about the call itself, including its time and date, whether it was an incoming or outgoing call, and its duration.
To call someone back who is listed in the Recents list, tap anywhere on that listing except for on the Info icon.
Customizing Ringtones
Thanks to the iTunes Store, you're able to purchase and download optional ringtones for your iPhone. Use one ringtone as your generic ringtone for all incoming calls, or you can assign specific ringtones to individual people.

 Tip
iOS 11 comes with more than two dozen preinstalled ringtones. To shop for ringtones, launch Settings, tap Sounds & Haptics, and then tap the Ringtone option. Tap the Tone Store option and then tap Tones to access the Ringtones section of the iTunes Store. (An Internet connection is required.)
When you purchase and download a new ringtone, it becomes available on your iPhone's internal ringtones list. Ringtones from the iTunes Store cost either $0.99 or $1.29 each. Before you purchase a ringtone, you can preview it by tapping the ringtone's listing and then tapping its name.
Using a specialized app, such as Ringtones - Unlimited Ringtones Maker, Ringtone Maker, or Ringtones for Me, it's also possible to create your own ringtones using music or audio from your iTunes library.

To choose a default ringtone for all your incoming calls, launch Settings and select the Sounds & Haptics option. Scroll down to the Ringtone option and tap it. A complete listing of ringtones stored on your iPhone is displayed. Select the one you want to hear when you receive calls.
Picking Custom Ringtones for Specific Contacts
To assign a custom ringtone to a specific contact so that you hear it when that person calls your iPhone, follow these steps:
1. Launch the Contacts app.
2. Using the Search field or by scrolling through your listing of entries, find the specific contact with whom you want to link a custom ringtone.
3. When the contact is selected and you're looking at that Contacts entry, tap the Edit option in the upper-right corner of the screen.
4. From the Info screen that displays that contact entry's data, scroll down to the Ringtone field and tap it.
5. When the Ringtone screen appears, select a specific ringtone from the list that you want to assign to the contact and tap it. You can choose a specific song (purchased from iTunes) or ringer sound that reminds you of that person.
6. Tap the Done icon to save your selection and return to the contact's Info screen.
7. When that contact calls you, you will hear the ringtone you just linked to that contact (as opposed to the default ringtone).

 Tip
Also from a Contact's entry screen in the Contacts app, it's possible to choose a special vibration pattern for the phone when that person calls. To do this, tap the Vibration option and choose a vibration pattern from the Vibration menu, or scroll to the bottom of this screen and tap the Create New Vibration option to create a custom vibration pattern for that contact.


 More Info
Many states have outlawed using a cell phone while driving unless you have a wireless headset or hands-free (CarPlay) feature on your phone. Although the speakerphone feature of your iPhone counts as a hands-free feature, to ensure the best possible call quality while you're driving, invest in a wireless Bluetooth headset.
Using a headset enables you to keep your hands free while you're talking so you can easily access other apps or iPhone features during a phone conversation.
Bluetooth wireless headsets are priced as low as $20 but can cost as much as $200. If you want to ensure the highest-quality phone conversations possible so that people can hear you and you can hear them even if there's background noise present, invest in a good-quality Bluetooth wireless headset that includes a noise-canceling microphone and a good-quality speaker. Plus, choose a headset that's comfortable to wear and that has a long battery life.
Apple's popular wireless AirPods work as stereo headphones when you place one AirPod in each ear. However, using just one AirPod (in one ear), it can be used as a wireless headset with the Phone app. To learn more about this optional $159.00 accessory, visit www.apple.com/airpods, or visit any Apple Store or authorized Apple dealer.


 What's New
Built into iOS 11 is a new Emergency SOS feature. After you turn on the feature, when you rapidly press the Sleep/Wake button on your iPhone five times, your iPhone automatically calls one or more Emergency Contacts that you've established.
To set up this feature, launch Settings and tap the Emergency SOS option. Turn on the virtual switch associated with the Auto Call option. Tap Edit Emergency Contacts in Health to select whom the iPhone should call in an emergency.








11. Send And Receive Emails with the Mail App

In this Chapter
 Sending and receiving emails using the Mail app
 Managing emails from your inbox(es)
 Discovering new Mail app features and functions

If you're someone who's constantly on the go, being able to send and receive emails from virtually anywhere there's a cellular or Wi-Fi Internet connection enables you to stay in touch, stay informed, and be productive from wherever you happen to be.
The Mail app offers a comprehensive set of tools to help you compose, send, receive, and organize emails from one or more of your existing email accounts. From your iPhone or iPad, you can simultaneously manage your personal and work-related email accounts, as well as the free email account that's provided when you set up an iCloud account.
Before you can begin using the Mail app, it's necessary to set up your existing email accounts from within Settings.

 Note
If you don't yet have an email account, there are several ways to get one. You can sign up for a free Apple iCloud account, which includes an email account. In addition, Google offers free Gmail accounts (http://mail.google.com), and Yahoo! offers free Yahoo! Mail accounts (https://login.yahoo.com/account/create), both of which are fully compatible with your iOS device's Mail app.

Adding Email Accounts to the Mail App
You use the Settings app to add accounts to work with the Mail app. The Mail app works with virtually all email accounts, including industry-standard POP3 and IMAP email services.
If you have an email account through your employer that doesn't initially work using the setup procedure outlined in this chapter, contact your company's IT department or Apple's technical support for assistance.

 Note
The process for setting up an existing email account to use with your iPhone or iPad and the Mail app needs to be done only once per account.

Follow these steps to set up your iOS device to work with each of your existing email accounts:
1. Launch Settings.
2. Tap Account & Passwords.
3. From below the Accounts heading, tap Add Account.
4. Select the type of email account you have. Your options include iCloud, Microsoft Exchange, Google (Gmail), Yahoo!, AOL, Outlook.com, or Other (see Figure 11.1). Tap the appropriate option.

 Note
If you have a POP3 or IMAP email account that doesn't otherwise fall into one of the provided email types, tap the Other option and follow the onscreen prompts. You need to enter information that's provided by your Internet Service Provider or email service provider.
If you have an existing Yahoo! email account, for example, tap the Yahoo! option. When the Yahoo! account Sign In screen appears (see Figure 11.2), enter the email address that's associated with the account, tap Next, and then enter the account's password.


FIGURE 11.1
Choose the type of email account you'd like to add by tapping the appropriate option.

FIGURE 11.2
If you're setting up a Yahoo! Mail account, tap the Yahoo! option, and then fill in your existing account information.

 Note
As you're adding an email account from within Settings, depending on the account type, you might be prompted to manually enter the account name. This should be your full name (or whatever you want to appear in the From field of outgoing emails). You can opt to use just your first name, a family name (such as "The Anderson Family"), or a nickname, based on what you want to share with the recipients of your emails.
If prompted for a description, you can enter anything that helps you personally differentiate the account from your other accounts, such as Home Email, Work Email, or Yahoo! Email. The description is something that you see only on your device.

5. After you've entered information for your existing email account, your iOS mobile device connects to the email account's server and confirms the account details.
6. After the account has been verified, you see a new window with options. They're probably labeled Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, and Notes, although depending on the type of email account you're setting up, some of these options might not be available. Be sure to turn on the virtual switch associated with the Mail option. Figure 11.3 shows how the menu looks when setting up a Yahoo! Mail account to work with an iPhone.

 Note
The rest of the options offered by this Settings submenu are used to determine what additional app-specific data can be linked with the Mail account and related apps on your mobile device and that you use elsewhere.


 Caution
If you're already syncing app-specific data for Contacts, Calendar, Reminders, or Notes with iCloud, do not also sync them with Yahoo!, Google, or a Microsoft Exchange-compatible account, or you could wind up with duplicate records or entries in each app. Likewise, if you're already syncing your app-specific data with Google, don't also sync this information using iCloud.

7. Tap the Accounts option. Below the Accounts heading within the Accounts & Passwords submenu, the newly added email account is listed.
8. Below the Accounts listing is the Fetch New Data option. Use this to determine how often your iOS device automatically accesses the Internet to check for and download new incoming email messages from each email account's server.

FIGURE 11.3
For email accounts related to online services, such as Yahoo! or Google, you'll be prompted to choose what additional content you want to sync and share with your iOS mobile device. Be sure to turn on the virtual switch associated with Mail.

 Tip
Tap Fetch New Data to customize how you receive new email. From the Fetch New Data submenu screen, either enable or disable the master Push feature. When turned on, your iPhone or iPad automatically accesses and displays new incoming emails as they arrive on your email account's server.
When the Push feature is turned off, select how often you want to check for new emails using the Fetch feature. Your options include Automatically, Manually, Hourly, Every 30 Minutes, or Every 15 Minutes.
For each email account, manually select the Push or Fetch feature (some types of email account support only one or the other). From below the Fetch heading, customize the Fetch option.
The benefit of having the Fetch feature set to Manually is that you can greatly reduce your cellular data usage. This is important if you have a monthly data allocation through your cellular service provider. If you have an account that offers unlimited wireless data, or you use a Wi-Fi connection, this is not a concern. Using the Fetch (Manually) feature can also help you extend your device's battery life.

9. If you have another existing email account to set up, return to step 3 and repeat this process. Otherwise, exit the Settings app and launch the Mail app.

 Tip
Depending on the type of email account you're setting up, the information for which you're prompted will vary.
If you plan to set up a POP3 or IMAP email account, in addition to your existing email address and password, you might be prompted to enter your host name [mail.example.com] and outgoing mail server information [smtp.example.com]. Obtain this information from your email account provider, Internet service provider, or the IT department at your company before attempting to set up this type of account on your iPhone or iPad.

After at least one email account account is set up, return to the main Settings menu and select the Mail option. From the Mail submenu, you're able to customize a wide range of options pertaining to how the iOS mobile device you're using accesses, displays, and organizes your emails. For example, by tapping on the Notifications option, you're able to adjust how you're alerted when new (incoming) emails are received to each of your email accounts.

 Tip
When you purchase a new iOS device, it comes with free technical support from AppleCare for 90 days. If you purchased AppleCare+ with your iOS device, you have access to free technical support from Apple for two years. This includes the ability to make an in-person appointment with an Apple Genius at any Apple Store and have someone set up your email account(s) on your iPhone or iPad for you.
To schedule a free appointment, visit www.apple.com/retail/geniusbar. Or call Apple's toll-free technical support phone number and have someone talk you through the email setup process. Call 800-APL-CARE (275-2273).

Customizing Mail Options From Settings
To customize options available in the Mail app, launch Settings and select the Mail option. Displayed on the Mail submenu screen (see Figure 11.4) are a handful of customizable features for managing your email accounts.

FIGURE 11.4
From Settings, you can customize a handful of settings relating to the Mail app and how your incoming and outgoing emails (from all of your accounts linked with your iPhone or iPad) are handled.
At the top of the Mail submenu screen within Settings, tap Siri & Search and turn on the virtual switch associated with this feature to allow Siri and the Spotlight Search feature built into iOS 11 access Mail-related data from your email account(s).
Next, tap Notifications, turn on the Allow Notifications option displayed at the top of the submenu, and then tap each listed email account to customize Notifications-related options. These include how the selected mail account (and the Mail app) uses sounds, the Badge App Icon, and alerts to get your attention when new (incoming) emails arrive in your inbox.

 Note
Notice that the VIP mailbox is treated like a separate email account when it comes to setting Notifications. As you work with the Mail app, you're able to create a master VIP list (comprising important people you communicate with across all your accounts). When you receive an incoming email from someone you have manually added to the VIP list, this type of Notification can be handled differently to ensure it gets your attention. How to manage your VIP list is discussed later in this chapter.

When you scroll down the Mail submenu screen, the following customizable options relating to how the Mail app manages your email accounts and email messages are offered:
 Preview—As you look at your Inbox (or any mailbox) using the Mail app, determine how much of each email message's body text is visible from the mailbox summary screen, in addition to the From, Date/Time, and Subject. Choose None, or between one and five lines of the email message to preview.

 Tip
The Preview option also affects the email-related notifications that appear in the Notification Center if you assign it to continuously monitor the Mail app. You can adjust this in Settings by tapping the Notifications option from the main Settings menu.

 Show To/Cc Label—Decide whether to view the To and Cc fields when viewing the preview screen for emails.
 Swipe Options—This feature helps you manage the Inbox of your email accounts. As you're looking at the previews of each message in your Inbox, swipe across each message listing to access menu options. Configure which Mail-related command(s) become available to you by swiping across a message listing (see Figure 11.5).

FIGURE 11.5
Access commonly used commands for managing incoming messages by swiping your finger across a message listing.

 Tip
Tap Swipe Options in the Mail submenu to access the Swipe Options submenu and determine which email management-related commands become available to you when you swipe across a message listing when viewing an Inbox. This only needs to be done once.
Choose the email-related commands you most often use to organize your incoming messages so you can access them faster. Figure 11.6 shows the Swipe Right submenu, which allows you to select which Mail-related commands become accessible when you swipe from left to right across a message listing within your inbox. Be sure to customize the Swipe Left and Swipe Right options separately.


FIGURE 11.6
The Swipe Right submenu allows you to customize which Mail-related commands become available when you swipe from left to right across a message listing within your inbox.
 Flag Style—When you flag an email as important, the Flag style determines whether the Mail app displays a flag-shaped icon or a colored dot next to each flagged email message.
 Ask Before Deleting—This option serves as a safety net to ensure that you don't accidentally delete an important email message from your iOS device. When this feature is turned on, you're asked to confirm your message deletion request before an email message is actually deleted. By default, with some email service providers, you cannot delete email messages stored on your email account's server. When you delete a message from the Mail app, it is deleted from your iPhone or iPad but is still accessible from other devices. Check with your mail service provider to see how this feature is set up and whether it is changeable.
 Load Remote Images—When an email message has a photo or graphic embedded in it, this option determines whether the image is automatically downloaded and displayed with the email message. You can opt to refrain from automatically loading graphics with email messages to reduce the amount of data transferred to your iPhone or iPad (which is a consideration if you're connected to the Internet via a cellular data network). You still have the option to tap the placeholder icon in the email message to manually download the images in a specific message.

 Note
In addition to reducing your cellular data usage, disabling the Load Remote Images option can help cut down on the amount of spam (unsolicited emails) you receive. Remote image loading can be tracked by the senders of spam and used to verify valid email addresses. When the senders are able to verify your address, they can send you more mail. If you don't load the image, your address is unverified to the sender.
When turned off, displaying images embedded within an email requires an additional step on your part because you now must tap the image icon to load the image if you want to view it.

 Organize by Thread—This feature enables you to review messages in reverse chronological order if a single message turns into a back-and-forth email conversation in which multiple parties keep hitting Reply to respond to messages with the same subject. When turned on, this makes keeping track of email conversations (called threads) much easier, especially if you're managing several email accounts on your iPhone or iPad. If it's turned off, messages in your Inbox are displayed in reverse chronological order as they're received, not grouped by subject or sender.
 Collapse by Thread—As you read email messages as part of a long thread (back and forth email conversation), the Mail app automatically collapses read messages making it easier to scroll through a conversation. Simply tap any message to expand and reread it, as needed.

 Tip
Also available from the Mail submenu within Settings are the Most Recent Message on Top and Complete Threads options, which are displayed below the Threading heading. Turn on the Most Recent Messages on Top option to display the newest (most recent messages) first when viewing the conversation thread. Turn on the Complete Threads option if you want all messages within the thread to be displayed, even when some messages have been moved to other mailboxes.
When viewing an Inbox, tap the >> icon that's displayed to the right of the time and date a message was received to expand the thread and see listings for all messages within that thread, without first actually opening the latest message. To close the expanded thread in the inbox, tap the icon that contains two downward-pointing arrows.

 Always Bcc Myself—When this feature is turned on, a copy of every outgoing email is sent to your Inbox. Typically, all outgoing messages are automatically saved in a Sent folder related to that account. If your email account type does not enable you to access sent emails from another computer or device, using the Bcc Myself option compensates for this. When you send an email message from your iPhone or iPad, using this feature ensures that the message becomes accessible from your primary computer.
 Mark Addresses—With this option, you can enter a portion of an email address and then be alerted each time an email is received that meets that search criteria. For example, if you do business with many people who work at The Widget Company and their email addresses end with @widget.com, anyone with an email address ending with @widget.com, such as johndoe@widget.com, sales@widget.com, or janedoe@widget.com, can be automatically flagged in your Inbox to get your attention. All you have to do is store "widget.com" in the Mark Address field. This feature is particularly useful if you work in a corporate environment.
 Increase Quote Level—When turned on, anytime you reply to a message or forward a message, the content of that original email appears indented, making it easier to differentiate between the message you add and the original message being replied to or forwarded. This option affects the message formatting, not the actual content.
 Signature—For every outgoing email that you compose, you can automatically add an email signature. The default signature is "Sent from my iPhone" or "Sent from my iPad." However, with this option you can create customized signatures for each email account. A signature might include your name, mailing address, email address, phone numbers, and so forth.

 Note
From the Signature submenu screen within Settings, you can create a signature and use it with all email accounts by selecting the All Accounts option. However, you can assign different signatures to each of your accounts by selecting the Per Account option.

 Default Account—If you're using the Mail app to manage multiple email accounts, when you reply to a message or forward a message, it is always sent from the email account to which the message was originally sent. However, if you tap the Compose New Email icon to create a new email from scratch, the email account from which the message is sent is whichever you have set up as the Mail app's default account. If you want to change this account for a specific email, simply tap the From field as you're composing a new email and select one of your other accounts.
Viewing Your Incoming Mail
When you launch the Mail app, the Inbox for your various email accounts is displayed. You can opt to display incoming messages for a single email account, or display the incoming messages from all of your email accounts by selecting the All Inboxes option.
Even though Mail enables you to simultaneously view incoming emails from multiple accounts within a single listing (on the same screen), behind the scenes, the app automatically keeps your incoming and outgoing emails and your various email accounts separate. So if you opt to read and respond to an email from your work-related Inbox, for example, that response is automatically sent out from your work-related email account and saved in the Sent folder for that account.
Viewing all the Inboxes for all of your accounts simultaneously makes it faster to review your incoming emails, without having to manually switch between email accounts.
If you have multiple email accounts being managed from your iOS device, to view all of your Inboxes simultaneously, or to switch between Inboxes, follow these steps:
1. Launch the Mail app.
2. The Inbox you last looked at is probably displayed. If only one email account is set up to work with your iPhone or iPad, the last email you viewed is displayed.
3. Tap Mailboxes in the upper-left corner of the screen to see a list of your inboxes so you can select which Inbox you want to view. If you're looking at a particular account's Inbox, the arrow-shaped option is labeled with the name of the mailbox.
4. From the menu that appears, the first option displayed is All Inboxes. Tap it to view a single listing of all incoming emails, or tap any single email account that's listed on the Mailboxes screen.

 Tip
If you receive an email from an automated email list that you're on, and the Mail app determines this, at the very top of the message is a banner that states, "This message is from a mailing list." You're then given the option to unsubscribe to that list with a single tap of the screen (see Figure 11.7). This feature, when used over time, can help you reduce the amount of spam or unwanted (and unsolicited) email you receive.


FIGURE 11.7
Tap the Unsubscribe option above the email's header if you want to immediately request to be removed from the mass email list.

 Tip
Tap the VIP mailbox listing to view only emails from your various Inboxes that have been received from people you've added to your VIP list. When you tap the VIP option, the emails are displayed in a single list of all the VIP messages from all the accounts you're managing on your iPhone or iPad.
Below the VIP listing under the Inboxes heading is a Flagged listing. This enables you to view a separate mailbox comprising only emails (and message threads) you've previously flagged as being important. Again, this is a comprehensive list from all the accounts you're managing on your iPhone or iPad. The Mail app keeps the messages sorted behind the scenes, based on which account each is associated with.


 Tip
As you're viewing any Inbox (or All Inboxes) the Filtered by Unread icon is in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Tap it to see only new, unread messages. Tap the icon again to turn off this feature and view all messages currently stored in the selected Inbox(es).

As you're viewing a listing of messages within All Inboxes, a specific inbox, or any mailbox, type a keyword, date, name, email address, or search phrase in the Search field to quickly find a particular message or message thread that contains the search word or phrase you entered.

 Tip
A >> icon displayed to the immediate right of the time and date an email message was received in your Inbox indicates that the message is part of an ongoing message thread. Tap the >> icon to display all messages in that thread within the Inbox. Tap the icon again to condense the message thread to a single message listing. Tap the message listing to open and view the entire message (as well as all previous messages in the thread).

Composing an Email Message
From the Mail app, it's easy to compose an email from scratch and send it to one or more recipients. Just tap the Compose icon. On an iPhone, the Compose icon is in the lower-right corner of the screen in the Mail app. On an iPad, the Compose icon is in the top-right corner of the screen.

 Note
The Compose icon looks like a square with a pencil on it.

When you tap the Compose icon, a blank New Message email message template appears. Using the virtual keyboard, fill in the To, Cc, Bcc, and Subject fields (see Figure 11.8). You must fill in the To field with a valid email address for at least one recipient. The other fields are optional.
You can send the same email to multiple recipients by either adding multiple email addresses to the To field or adding email addresses to the Cc or Bcc fields.
The From field is automatically filled in with your email address. If you're managing multiple email addresses from the iPhone or iPad, the default address (which you select from the Mail submenu within Settings) is used. If you want to change the address from which the email is being sent, tap the From field to select one of your other accounts. See the "Customizing Mail Options from Settings" section earlier in this chapter for information on changing the default account.

FIGURE 11.8
Tap the Compose icon to create an email from scratch and send it from your iOS device.

 Tip
As you fill in the To field when composing an email, the Mail app automatically accesses your Contacts database to match up entries. This feature can save you time, because you don't have to manually enter that entire email address. If you know that the person you're sending an email to is already in your Contacts database, you can type that person's name in the To field.
The Mail app also remembers email addresses for people with whom you've corresponded in the past through email via the Mail app, even if those addresses are not stored in your Contacts database. If you begin entering an email address that the Mail app recognizes, the app gives you the option to auto-complete the address and fill in the To field.
When you begin manually entering an email address, the Mail app offers suggestions. Either select a suggestion or continue typing.

Next, tap the Subject field and use the virtual keyboard to enter the subject for your message. As you do this, the subject appears at the very top center of the Compose window (replacing the New Message heading).

 Tip
When using almost any app with a Share menu, to compose and send an email that contains app-specific content without first launching the Mail app, tap the Share icon and select Mail from the Share menu.
A New Message screen appears with the related app-specific content already attached to that outgoing email message. Use the virtual keyboard to compose your email, and then tap the Send icon. The email message is sent and you are returned to the app you were using.

To begin creating the main body of the outgoing email message, tap in the main body area of the Compose Message screen, and begin using the virtual keyboard (or an optional external keyboard) to compose your message. You also have the option of tapping the Dictation key and then dictating your message using the Dictation feature.

 Caution
If you have the Auto-Capitalization, Auto-Correction, or Check Spelling features turned on, as you type, the iPhone or iPad automatically corrects anything that it perceives as a typo or misspelled word. Be very careful when using these features because they are notorious for plugging the wrong word into a sentence. Especially if you're creating important business documents and emails, make sure you carefully proofread whatever you type before sending it. Typically, these features are helpful, but they do have quirks that can lead to embarrassing and unprofessional mistakes.
To control the Auto-Capitalization, Auto-Correction, and Check Spelling features, launch Settings, tap the General option, select the Keyboard option, and then turn on or off the virtual switch associated for each option displayed in the Keyboard menu screen.


 Tip
When turned on, the QuickType feature monitors what you're typing in real time and anticipates what you're about to type (based on the context of what you're typing). It then suggests appropriate words or phrases.
Use this feature to speed up and improve the accuracy of your typing. The QuickType suggestions are displayed as tabs just above the virtual keyboard (see Figure 11.9). In this case, the word "hope" was being typed. After the user typed the letters "h" and "o," however, the iPhone predicted that the word "hope" would be used, and offered it as a recommendation within a tab displayed above the virtual keyboard.
Tap a suggestion tab to select that word and insert it into your message. Then continue typing.


FIGURE 11.9
The QuickType feature works nicely when composing emails using the Mail app. Notice the suggested text displayed in tabs just above the virtual keyboard.

 What's New
With iOS 11 running on any iPad, you might notice that as you're using the virtual keyboard, two numbers, letters, and symbols appear on each key (see Figure 11.10). The number, letter, or symbol displayed in black is the main option. For example, if you want to type the letter b, tap the B key, which also displays a slash (/) in gray. To type a slash, place your finger on the B key and swipe down, and then tap the / symbol.
To switch to uppercase letters, tap the Shift key (the upward-pointing arrow key at the far left of the keyboard). To turn on Shift Lock so everything you type is in uppercase, double-tap the Shift key.
To alter the virtual QuickType keyboard to display symbols and numbers, tap the .?123 key. To return to the alphanumeric keyboard, tap the ABC key.


FIGURE 11.10
To access the "alternate" letter, number, or symbol that's displayed on an iPad's virtual keyboard key, press and hold the key. When the alternate letter, number, or symbol is displayed prominently, tap it.
The signature you set up from within Settings for the selected From account is automatically displayed at the bottom of each newly composed message. You can return to Settings to turn off the Signature feature or change the signature that appears. A signature can also be edited or added manually, directly from the Compose screen, as you create or edit each message.
When your email is fully written and ready to be sent, tap the Send option. In a few seconds, the message is sent from your iOS device, assuming that it is connected to the Internet. A copy of the message appears in your Sent or Outbox folder. As a message is being sent, a "Sending" notification appears near the bottom of the Mail app's screen.

 Tip
The Mail app enables you to format your outgoing email messages and include bold, italic, and underlined text (as well as combinations, like bold-italic text).

On an iPhone, you format text within an email message you're composing by typing the text as you normally would using the virtual keyboard. After the text appears in your email, hold your finger on a word to make the Select, Select All, Paste, Quote Level, Insert Photo or Video, and Add Attachment command tabs appear above that word.
Tap Select, and then use your finger to move the blue dots to highlight the text you want to modify. When the appropriate text is highlighted in blue, tap the right-pointing arrow above the text (next to the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands), and then tap the BIU option. A new menu appears above the highlighted text with three options labeled Bold, Italic, and Underline (shown in Figure 11.11). Tap one or more of these tabs to alter the highlighted text.

FIGURE 11.11
On an iPhone, you can format text after it's been typed in the Mail app. You can add bold, italic, or underline.
On an iPad, in the top-right corner of the virtual keyboard is a text formatting (BIU) icon, as well as an Attach Photo and a File Attachment icon (refer to Figure 11.12). By tapping this formatting icon and selecting a typestyle, you can format text in real time as you're typing. If you want to type using bold/italic text, for example, tap the B and I icons. Alternatively, you can use the Select command after text is typed, and adjust the typestyle using the directions outlined earlier for the iPhone.

FIGURE 11.12
Format text as you're composing an email on an iPad (using the virtual keyboard) by tapping on the BIU option.

 What's New
If you're using an iPad Pro with a Smart Keyboard, you can use a handful of keyboard shortcuts to quickly format text. Refer to Chapter 3, "Take Advantage of iOS 11 Features for the iPad," to learn more about the Smart Keyboard and keyboard shortcuts.


 Tip
When using any iPad model, to more accurately move the cursor around the screen (to select content to cut and paste, for example) place two fingers together on the screen (directly over the cursor), and then drag your fingers around on the screen. Also, if you're using an external keyboard with your iPad, press the Control, Command, or Options key to access available shortcuts (which are specific to the app and keyboard you're currently using).

Inserting a Photo or Video into Outgoing Mail
As you're composing an outgoing email on an iPhone, one way you can insert a photo or video clip that's stored in the Photos app into that email is to place and hold your finger anywhere in the body of the email where you want to embed the content.

 Note
On the iPhone, tap the right-pointing arrow displayed to the right of the Select, Select All, and Paste commands to access the Insert Photo or Video option.

When the Insert Photo or Video tab is displayed, tap it. Select the photo you want to insert into the email by selecting an album and then tapping an image or video thumbnail. The photo/video you selected is previewed in the Choose Photo window. Tap the Use button to insert the photo or video into your email.

 What's New
On the iPad, tap the Attach Photo icon to select and import a photo (from the Photos app) into your email, or tap the File Attachment icon to attach to your outgoing email a file, document, or photo that's stored within one of your cloud-based accounts (such as iCloud Drive or Dropbox) that are linked with the new File app. Refer to Chapter 7, "Use iCloud and the Files App," for more information about using your iPhone or iPad with a cloud-based file-sharing and file-storage service.
If you're using an iPad Pro, launch the Photos app side-by-side with the Mail app, and then use iOS 11's Multitasking feature to drag-and-drop selected photos directly into the body of the email you're composing.

Repeat this process to include multiple images within an email, keeping in mind that the overall file size associated with the outgoing email is often limited by your email service.

 Tip
When you insert a photo into an outgoing email you are prompted to choose the image size. Your options include Small, Medium, Large, and Actual Size. Each is accompanied by the file size of the image(s) you're sending. Tap one of these options when prompted.
On the iPad, tap the Images option to the right of the Cc/Bcc, From field, and then tap the Small, Medium, Large, or Actual Size tab on the newly displayed Image Size field to customize the image file size.

Inserting an Email Attachment
To add a file attachment into an email you're composing, place and hold down your finger in the body of the email where you want to insert the file. From the menu that appears tap the Add Attachment option. Alternatively, if you're using an iPad, simply tap the File Attachment icon at the extreme right on the toolbar above the virtual keyboard.

 What's New
If you're using an iPad Pro, to attach a file to an outgoing email from the Mail app, use Multitasking mode to launch the Files app while you're composing an email. Locate and select the files you want to attach to or embed within the outgoing email, and then drag and drop one or more files from the Files app directly into the Mail app when the two apps are displayed side by side.

When you opt to attach a file to an outgoing email, your iOS mobile device accesses online accounts linked with the Files app, and enables you to select one or more files stored within one of your compatible cloud-based accounts, such as iCloud Drive or Dropbox. (Most files stored locally within your iPhone or iPad, with the exception of photos, are not accessible for sharing from the Mail app.)
Select the file of files you want to attach to the outgoing email by tapping its icon or listing and then tap Done. The selected files are attached to the outgoing email message.
Using Select, Select All, Cut, Copy, and Paste
The iOS operating system offers Select, Select All, Cut, Copy, and Paste commands, which are accessible from many iPhone or iPad apps, including Mail. Using these commands, you can quickly copy and paste content from one portion of an app to another or from one app into another app, whether it's a paragraph of text, a phone number, or a photo.

 Note
If you're an iPad Pro user, you're also able to use Multitasking mode to drag and drop content between apps.

To use these commands, use your finger to hold down on any word or graphic element on the screen for one or two seconds, until the Select and Select All tabs appear above that content. To select a single word or select the content you want to copy or cut, tap the Select tab. Alternatively, to select all the content on the screen, tap the Select All tab.
After text (or a graphic element, such as a photo) is selected, tap the Cut tab to delete the selected content from the screen (if this option is available in the app you're using), or tap the Copy tab to save the highlighted content in your iPhone or iPad's virtual clipboard.
Now, move to where you want to paste the saved content. This can be in the same email or document, for example, or in another app altogether. Choose the location on the screen where you want to paste the content, and hold your finger on that location for two or three seconds. When the Paste tab appears, tap it. The content you just copied to the virtual clipboard is pasted into that location.

 Tip
On the iPad, the Undo, Redo, and Clipboard icons are displayed above the virtual keyboard. If you're using a Smart Keyboard, these commands can be accessed via keyboard shortcuts.
Tap the Undo icon to go one step back and undo the last thing you did when composing the email. Tap the Redo icon to counteract what the Undo command just did.
When you select content in an outgoing email, for example, the Cut, Copy, and Paste command icons are displayed on the top-left side of the virtual keyboard. Tap the scissor-shaped icon to use the Cut command. The icon that looks like two sheets of paper represents the Copy command, and the clipboard-shaped icon works as the Paste command.


 Tip
In the Mail app, as you use the Select, Select All, Cut, Copy, and Paste commands, notice a Quote Level option that appears on the menu above the highlighted text or content you select. Tap this to increase or decrease the indent of that content, which impacts how it's formatted on the screen.

Saving an Unsent Draft of an Email
To save a draft of an email without sending it, as you're composing the email message, tap the Cancel button in the upper-left corner of the Compose message window. Two command buttons appear: Delete Draft and Save Draft. To save the unsent draft, tap Save Draft.
You can return to it later to modify and send it. To do this, from the main Inbox screen in Mail, tap the left-pointing Mailboxes at the upper-left corner of the screen. From the Mailboxes screen, scroll down to the Accounts heading, and tap the listing for the email account from which the email draft was composed.
When you see a list of folders related to that email account, tap the Drafts folder. Tap the appropriate listing to open the email message. You can now edit the message or send it.
Reading Email
Just like the Inbox on your main computer's email software, the Inbox of the Mail app (shown in Figure 11.13 on an iPhone) displays your incoming emails.

FIGURE 11.13
The Inbox screen of the Mail app displays a list of your incoming emails on the iPhone.
On an iPhone, the Inbox screen takes up the entire screen. On an iPad, the Inbox list is displayed on the left side of the screen, while a selected email message is displayed on the right side of the screen (see Figure 11.14).

FIGURE 11.14
The Inbox screen of the Mail app on an iPad is displayed on the left, while the entire selected email message (highlighted in gray in the Inbox list) is displayed on the right.

 Note
As you're looking at the Inbox for any of your email accounts (or the All Inboxes mailbox), to the left of each email message preview you might see an icon. A blue dot represents a new and unread email (or an email that has been marked as unread). A solid blue star represents a new and unread email from someone on your VIP list, and a gray star icon represents a read email from someone on your VIP list.
An orange flag-shaped icon to the left of an email preview means that you have manually flagged that message (or message thread) as urgent. Instead of a flag icon, a blue dot with an orange circle can be displayed indicating a message is urgent and unread. Just an orange dot is displayed after the message has been read. You can choose between a flag or a dot icon from Settings.
A curved, left-pointing arrow icon means that you have read and replied to that message, whereas a right-pointing arrow icon means you've read and have forwarded that message to one or more people.
A bell icon means that the Notify Me option has been turned for that message.
If no tiny icon appears to the left of an email preview listing, the message has been read and is simply stored in that inbox (or mailbox).

When you're viewing your Inbox(es), a list of the individual emails is displayed. Based on the customizations you make from the Settings app from the Mail submenu, the Sender, Subject, Date/Time, and up to five lines of the message's body text can be displayed for each incoming message listing.

 Note
If you're using the Mail app on an iPad while holding the tablet in portrait mode, place your finger near the left side of the screen and swipe to the right to open the Inbox sidebar.

On the iPhone, when viewing your Inbox and the listing of incoming (new) email messages, tap any message listing to read that message in its entirety. When you do this, a new message screen appears. At the bottom of this screen is a series of command icons for managing that email.

 Tip
When you receive an email from someone whose contact information in your Contacts app has changed, you see a banner at the top of the message that states, "New Contact Info Found." Tap Add to automatically update that person's Contact entry with the new or updated information.


 Tip
If you're using a newer iPhone model, take advantage of the 3D Touch features to quickly review emails. As you're looking at the Inbox listing, place and hold your finger gently on a specific email listing. A preview of that entire email message is displayed. If you want to open and read the message, press down on the screen a bit harder when the preview is visible.

On the iPad, the email message that's highlighted in gray on the left side of the screen is the one that's currently being displayed, in its entirety, on the right side of the screen. Tap any email on the left side of the screen to view the entire message on the right side of the screen.
Located at the top of the Inbox message listing is a Search field. You might need to swipe your finger downward along the Inbox to reveal it. Tap the Search field to make the virtual keyboard appear so you can enter a search phrase and quickly find a particular email message. You can search the content of the Mail app using any keyword, a sender's name, a date, or an email subject, for example. You can also use your device's Spotlight Search feature to quickly locate content within email messages.

 Note
When using an iPad Pro with the 12.9-inch screen, the Mail app uses a three-pane view (as opposed to just two). On the extreme left is the Mailboxes pane. The middle pane is the selected Inbox message listing, and the right pane displays the selected message.

Managing the Inbox with the Edit Button
Located on top of a mailbox's message listing (to the right of its heading) is the Edit button. Tap this option to quickly select multiple messages from a mailbox, such as your Inbox, and delete or move the selected content to another mailbox (or folder), as shown in Figure 11.15.

FIGURE 11.15
Tap the Edit button, and then manage your incoming messages, mark them, delete them in quantity, or move them to the Trash folder.

 Tip
After tapping Edit, manually select one or more message listings to move or delete, or tap the Mark All option to select all the messages in that Inbox. You can use the Flag or Mark As Read/Unread options for all the selected messages.


 Tip
If you tap the Mark button to the left of the Trash and Move buttons, you can then flag them or mark one or more emails as read or unread. You can also move selected messages to your Junk folder.

After you tap the Edit button, an empty circle icon appears to the left of each email message preview listing. To move or delete one or more messages from the current mailbox's listing (which could be your Inbox, VIP, Archive, or Junk mailbox), tap the empty circle icon for that message. A blue-and-white check mark fills the empty circle when you do this, and the Mark, Move, and Trash options are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
After you've selected one or more messages, tap the Trash button to delete one or more messages simultaneously from the mailbox (they go to the Trash folder), or tap the Move button and then select to which folder you want to move those email messages. Tap the Mark option to Flag the message, mark it as unread, or move it to the Junk folder.
To exit this option without doing anything, tap the Cancel button displayed at the top of the Inbox listing.
Deleting Individual Incoming Messages
As you're looking at the listing of messages in your Inbox (or any mailbox), you can delete individual messages, one at a time, by swiping your finger from right to left over a message listing. Tap the red-and-white Trash option to delete the message.
Tap the More (...) option to access a menu (shown in Figure 11.16) to access a more detailed menu that includes options for Reply, Reply All, Forward, Mark, Show Related Messages, Notify Me, and Move Message options (see Figure 11.17).

FIGURE 11.16
After swiping from right to left across a message listing in your Inbox, tap More to reveal this menu.

FIGURE 11.17
The More menu provides another way to access commonly used features for managing your email messages.

 Tip
Another way to delete a message from your Inbox, or any mailbox, is to tap a message listing to view that message, and then tap the Trash icon.

Viewing Your Emails
When a single email message is selected from the Inbox listing, that message is displayed in its entirety. At the top of the message, see the From, To, Cc/Bcc (if applicable), Subject, and the Date/Time it was sent.
In the upper-right corner of the email message is a blue Hide command. If you tap this, some of the message header information will no longer be displayed. To make this information reappear, tap the More (...) option.
As you're reading an email, tap the flag icon to flag that message and mark it as urgent, or mark the email as unread. These options appear within a pop-up menu. When you flag a message, an orange flag (or an orange dot) is displayed in the message itself (to the right of the date and time) and in the Inbox (mailbox) in which the message is stored. Plus, from your Inboxes menu, if you tap the Flagged option, you can view a separate mailbox that contains only flagged (urgent) messages.
Using the Mail App's Vip List Feature
In addition to flagging individual messages as important, the Mail app can automatically highlight all emails sent from particular (important) senders, such as your boss, specific clients, close friends, or family members. Once you add a sender to your VIP List, all their incoming emails are marked with a star icon instead of a blue dot that represents a regular, new incoming email.
To add someone to your VIP list, as you're reading an email from that person, tap the From field (the name/email address). A Sender screen (iPhone) or window (iPad) appears. Tap the Add to VIP option. This adds and keeps that sender on your custom VIP list until you manually remove them. To later remove someone from your VIP list, read any of their email messages and tap the From field. When the Sender window appears, tap the Remove from VIP option (which has replaced the Add to VIP option).

 Tip
From the Mailboxes menu, tap the VIP listing to view a special mailbox that displays only incoming emails from people on your VIP list. Using the VIP list feature helps you quickly differentiate important emails from spam and less important incoming emails that don't necessarily require your immediate attention.

Dealing with Incoming Attachments
The Mail app enables you to access certain types of attachment files that accompany an incoming email message. Dozens of file formats are compatible with the Mail app. As you add third-party apps that support other file formats, they become recognized by the Mail app. This includes files related to text, photos, audio clips, video clips, PDFs, and eBooks, as well as iWork and Microsoft Office documents and files.
To open an attached file using another app, in the incoming email message, tap and hold down the attachment icon for a second. When you release your finger, you see a pop-up menu of command icons. These icons represent options for sharing, managing, printing, annotating, copying, or transferring the file to a cloud-based account your iPhone or iPad is linked with.
For example, if you receive a PDF, you can open, view, and annotate it using the Preview feature, or you can import the file into a compatible app that allows you to view or fully manage and work with PDFs, such as iBooks or the PDF Expert app (which is available from the App Store).

 What's New
If you simply tap the file attachment, in most cases, the new Preview screen displays the content of the attached file. It might take up to one or two minutes to first download the file.
Depending on the file type, you can markup and annotate the file by tapping the Markup/Annotate icon, or tap the Share icon to access the Share menu, which displays a handful of options for managing and storing files printing them (if applicable), and sharing them.

Organizing Email Messages in Folders
You can easily move email messages into a folder, enabling you to better organize your emails. Here's how to do this:
1. From the Inbox listing, tap Edit above the Inbox listing. Or, if you're viewing an email message, swipe your finger from right to left across the message listing.
2. Tap Move. A menu that offers various folders and options available for that email account is displayed.
3. Tap Move Message, and then tap the mailbox folder to which you want to move the message. The email message is moved to the folder you select.

 Note
The Move option is also available by swiping from right to left across a message listing from your inbox and then tapping More.


 Tip
As you're managing incoming and outgoing emails, the Mail app uses the default mailboxes that are already associated with that email account, such as Inbox, Drafts, Sent, Trash, and Junk. For some accounts, you are limited to only these default mailboxes. However, for many types of email accounts, you can create additional mailboxes and then move messages into those mailboxes to organize them.

Forwarding, Printing, and Replying to Messages
As you're reading incoming emails, you can forward a message to someone else, reply to the message, or print the email by tapping the left-pointing, curved-arrow icon displayed when you're viewing an email. When you tap this icon, as you're reading any email message a menu offers the following options: Reply, Forward, and Print. If the message you're viewing has more than one recipient, an additional option, Reply All, appears.
To reply to the message you're reading, tap the Reply (or Reply All) option. An email message template appears on the screen that already contains the content of the message you're replying to. Refer to the "Composing an Email Message" section for details on how to write and send an email message from the Mail app.
To forward the email (or message thread) you're reading to another recipient, tap the Forward icon. If an attachment is associated with the email, you're asked, "Include attachments from original email?" and offered two options: Include and Don't Include. Tap the appropriate response.
When you opt to forward an email, a new message template appears on the screen. However, the content of the message you're forwarding appears in the body of the email message. Start the message-forwarding process by filling in the To field. You can also modify the Subject field (or leave the message's original subject), and then add to the body of the email message with your own text. This text appears above the forwarded message's content.

 Tip
To forward an email to multiple recipients, enter each person's email address in the To field of the outgoing message, separating each address with a comma (,). Alternatively, you can tap the + to the right of the To field to add more recipients.

When you're ready to forward the message, tap Send, or tap Cancel to abort the message-forwarding process.
If you have an AirPrint-compatible printer set up to work with your iOS device, tap the Print option that appears when you tap the left-pointing curved-arrow icon as you're reading an email.

 More Info
Use these quick tips to manage your email:
 When viewing your Inbox, to refresh it and load new messages, swipe your finger down in Inbox. The message Updated Just Now displays at the bottom center of the Inbox screen or pane when your messages are up to date. Otherwise, the time and date that the Inbox was last updated is displayed. Your Inbox can refresh only when the iPhone or iPad has Internet access.
 As you're reading email, if the text is difficult to see, you can automatically increase the size of all text displayed in the Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Messages, and Notes apps by adjusting the Accessibility option in Settings. To make this font size adjustment, launch Settings. Select the General option, and then tap the Accessibility option. From the Accessibility submenu, tap the Larger Text option. Turn on the virtual switch associated with this feature, and then use the slider to select a more suitable text size.
 While looking at the Home screen on a newer iPhone model, press and hold down on the Mail app icon to make the app's 3D Touch Pop menu appear. Four options appear, including All Inboxes (view the Inbox for all of your accounts on a single screen), VIP (view the VIP inbox), Search (enter a keyword or search phrase to find in any of your incoming or outgoing emails), and New Message (used to compose a new message from scratch).
 When using almost any app (Contacts, Calendar, Notes, Safari, Reminders, Messages, and so on), tap an email address in the app to compose and send an email to that person via the Mail app. The To field automatically includes the email address you tapped.
 When you see a new message notification displayed in the Notification Center screen, on an iPad, swipe across the listing from right to left, and then tap the View option to quickly open the Mail app and view that message. On an iPhone with Touch 3D, press and hold your finger on the message listing to see a preview of that message (along with a Trash and Mark As Read option). Tap the notification to launch the Mail app and read that message.


 Tip
The Mail app also has a Notify Me feature. As you're reading an email, tap the flag icon and then select the Notify Me option to activate this feature for the message you're reading. Then, when you receive a response from anyone related to this email thread, you are automatically notified.








12. Communicate Better with the Messages App

In this Chapter
 Discovering new ways to communicate using the Messages app
 Sending and receiving text messages using your cellular service provider's text-messaging service
 Taking advantage of Apple's iMessage service to communicate with other iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac users
 Discovering the new Animoji feature on the iPhone X

For better or worse, people around the world have adopted text messaging as a primary way to communicate with others. This communication method is faster and more convenient than phone calls or email, for example, and it allows you to quickly share information almost instantly.
The Messages app on the iPhone allows you to send and receive SMS or MMS text messages via the text messaging service provided by your cellular service provider. These messages can be sent to or received from any other smartphone in the world, and they can include text, photos, and short video clips. The service is available as long as your smartphone is connected to a 3G/4G/LTE cellular network.
In addition, if you use iOS 11's Handoff feature whenever your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch are in close proximity (within Bluetooth range, which is about 33 feet), the Messages app on your tablet or watch can use your iPhone as a conduit to the cellular network to send and receive text messages through the Messages app.

 Tip
When an Apple Watch series 3 is connected to a cellular network, it can independently send or receive text messages via the cellular network it's connected to, using your smartphone's phone number or Apple ID information (for iMessage). The iPhone doesn't need to be in close proximity to the watch for this to work.

What makes the Messages app extra powerful, however, is that when you communicate with any other iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Mac user, you can send and receive unlimited instant messages via Apple's free iMessage service. Because iMessage is Internet-based, your iOS mobile device can use a cellular or Wi-Fi Internet connection to communicate with other people.
The Messages app integrates seamlessly with iCloud, so all of your incoming and outgoing messages are mirrored across all of your iOS mobile devices (including Apple Watch) as well as any Mac that's tied to the same iCloud account.

 What's New
As an added security measure, the iOS 11 edition of the Messages app automatically encrypts messages as they're being sent. Plus, the newly designed App Drawer at the bottom of the Messages screen makes it easy to share a wide range of content with others, including, stickers, emojis, music, and content from third-party apps. If you use Apple Pay (or another service, like PayPal or Cash), you can instantly and securely send or receive money via the Messages app.


 What's New
One feature, called Animoji, is something younger people in particular will enjoy. It's available exclusively on the iPhone X, and it uses the phone's front-facing TrueDepth camera to analyze the muscle movements on someone's face as they're taking or showing emotions. Then it uses that information to animate a dozen different emojis in real-time. The result is that whether the user chooses a panda, cat, unicorn, or alien, that emoji character comes to life and replicates the facial movements of the user as he's talking.
You can record a short message using an Animoji that has your own voice, and then paste the animated character directly into an outgoing message to be sent via iMessage.
To use this feature, tap the Animoji icon in the App Drawer, choose your favorite character, and then tap the Record button. Record your message using exaggerated facial expressions, and then move the recorded message into the message field.

When used with iMessage, the iOS 11 edition of Messages offers colorful animations, which allow users to emphasize a celebratory statement, for example, by displaying animated balloons, confetti, or fireworks on the entire screen as they send messages.
Users can also create personalized handwritten notes, using their finger as a writing instrument on the screen (or the Apple Pencil with a compatible iPad Pro), and then send those notes as messages to other iMessage users.
Because people like to communicate using emojis, iOS 11 includes a vast library of these whimsical, graphic characters, and makes it easier to insert them into outgoing text messages.

 Note
An emoji is not animated and can be sent from any iPhone or iPad. To send or receive an Animoji, however, you must have an iPhone X.

The Invisible Ink feature enables text messages to materialize on the recipient's screen when they swipe over them. Plus, when video clips, photos, and other animated graphics are included in a text message, that content can easily be viewed from directly within the Messages app.
Communicating Effectively with the Messages App
Text messaging was designed to make communications between two or more people fast and easy. Today, "texting" has become a preferred and highly efficient form of communication.
In addition to sending and receiving text-based messages, the Messages app supports the sending and receiving of photos, video messages, video clips, emojis, virtual handwritten messages, animated backgrounds, audio messages, and content available from third parties, including virtual stickers (available from the App Store).

 Tip
Available from the App Store is an ever-growing collection of third-party apps that add functionality to the Messages app, or that allow the Messages app to send and receive specific types of information or content.
To find these apps, on an iPhone, tap the App Store "A" icon that's to the left of the Compose message field. Then from the App Drawer, tap the App Store icon (see Figure 12.1).
Tap the Visit Store button to browse through the selection of apps that work with the Messages app.
The apps you already have installed on your iPhone or iPad that are compatible with the Message app are displayed in the App Drawer. Tap any of these icons to select a specific type of content to send, including music from the Music app, animated stickers from a third party, a file stored online within your Dropbox account, a virtual Starbucks gift card (see Figure 12.2), or cash (using Apple Pay, PayPal, or the Cash app).


FIGURE 12.1
Tap the App Store "A" icon to access or create special content that can be sent via the Messages app using the iMessage service.

FIGURE 12.2
If you have the Starbucks app installed on your iPhone or iPad, you can instantly send someone a Starbucks gift card via the iMessage service.

 Note
If the person you're communicating with via the Messages app has an entry in your Contacts app's database, and that entry contains the person's photo, it is displayed in the Messages app; otherwise, the person's initials are displayed by default. Or, if there's no Contacts entry at all for the person, a generic graphic and their smartphone's phone number is displayed.

Most iPhone service plans have three components: voice, data, and text messaging. When you sign up with a wireless service, choose a paid text-messaging plan that allows for the sending or receiving of a predetermined number of text messages per month, or pay for an unlimited text messaging plan.
If your plan has no text messaging component, you are charged for every text message you send or receive. However, these days, most cellular service plans, especially family plans, come with unlimited text messaging.
There are different types of text messages. There are text-only (SMS, or Short Message Service) messages, as well as text messages that can contain a photo or video clip (which are sometimes referred to as MMS, or Multimedia Messaging Service). These messages can be sent to the smartphone of one or more people simultaneously via the Messages app.

 Note
The Messages app supports audio and video messages when you communicate with other iMessage users. Instead of typing a message, use the app's audio recording interface to record a short audio message and then send it to one or more recipients.
Alternatively, you can record and send a short video message (from within the Messages app) using one of the cameras that are built in to your iPhone or iPad. How to do this is explained shortly.


 Tip
You can make an adjustment in Settings so that the Messages app stores all of your text messages forever. Alternatively, you can save internal storage space in your mobile device by adjusting the Keep Messages option to 30 Days or 1 Year. Launch Settings, tap Messages, and then tap the Keep Message option.


 Note
Be sure to use options available within Settings to customize the functionality of the Messages app. To do this, launch Settings, tap the Messages option, and then customize one setting at a time from the Messages submenu (see Figure 12.3). Start by turning on the virtual switch that's associated with the iMessage service, so you can use the app's enhanced features and functions when communicating with other Apple iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Mac users.


FIGURE 12.3
Customize a handful of Messages-related functions from the Messages submenu in Settings (shown here on an iPad Pro).
Using the Messages App with Apple's iMessage Service
Unlike the text-messaging services available through cellular service providers, Apple's iMessage service is free of charge, and it allows for an unlimited number of messages to be sent and received. The service also taps into your iPhone's or iPad's other functions, and allows for the easy sharing of photos, videos, locations, and contacts. It works seamlessly with Notification Center and Siri, as well as a vast collection of third-party apps and content.
iMessage enables you to participate in text-based, real-time conversations. When someone is actively typing a message to you during a conversation on iMessage, a bubble with three periods in it appears to indicate that the other person is currently typing.

 Caution
Using iMessage from anywhere to send and receive messages via the Internet is always free. When you're traveling overseas, use this feature exclusively with a Wi-Fi Internet connection to avoid international cellular data roaming charges, which can be costly.


 Note
In addition to using iMessage, some people who are active on Facebook use Facebook Messenger as a free way to communicate in real time using text-based instant messages (which can also include photos, video clips, emojis, and other content), audio calls, and video calls. The Messenger app is separate from the official Facebook app, which is used to access the Facebook social media service; you can download the Messenger app from the App Store.
Many other companies and services (including Skype, AIM, Cisco Jabber, WhatsApp, Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft) also offer instant messaging via the Internet. These services are also free of cost to use, but you can communicate only with people connected to that same service.

Setting Up a Free Imessage Account
Because traditional text messaging is tied to a cell phone, which has a unique phone number, there is no need to have a separate username or account name when using the phone's text messaging feature via your cellular service provider.
If you know someone's cell phone number, you can send a text message to that person from your cell phone (and vice versa). However, because iMessage is web based, before using this service, you must set up a free iMessage account (which is linked to your Apple ID/iCloud account).
The first time you launch the Messages app to use it with the iMessage service, you're instructed to set up a free account using your existing Apple ID. Or, instead of using your Apple ID, tap the Create New Account option to create an account that's linked to another existing email address.

 Note
To make it easier to communicate via iMessage, you can associate your cellular phone number, Apple ID, and other email addresses to the same iMessage account. Launch Settings, tap Messages, and then tap the Send & Receive option. Add a check mark next to each phone number and email address (including the email address associated with your iCloud account) that you want the Message app to recognize.

The unique Apple ID, email address, or iPhone phone number you use to set up your iMessage account is how people find you and are able to communicate with you. If you want someone to be able to send you messages via iMessage, that person must know the iPhone phone number, Apple ID, or email address that you have set up to work with the iMessage service.
Likewise, to send someone a message via iMessage, you must know the iPhone phone number, Apple ID, or email address the recipient used to set up his or her iMessage account.

 Tip
Confused about the colored text bubbles? When you send a text message and it is displayed in a blue text bubble, you're using the iMessage service. However, if you're using your cellular service provider's texting service, your text bubbles are displayed in green. Depending on your cellular service plan, charges may apply.

Working with the Messages App
The Messages app on the iPhone has two main screens: a summary of conversations labeled Messages, and an actual conversation screen labeled at the top of the screen using the name of the person or people you're conversing with. The conversation screen displays a handful of command icons that give you access to the app's features and functions, most of which are available only if you're communicating using the iMessage service.
On the iPad, the Messages screen is divided into two main sections (or panes). On the left is a listing of your previous conversations. The right side of the iPad screen is the active conversation window. From here, you can initiate a new conversation or respond to incoming messages, one at a time.
Whether you're using an iPhone or an iPad, switching between conversations requires just one or two onscreen taps. Plus, thanks to group messaging, it's possible to communicate with two or more people at the same time and have everyone in the group be able to read and respond to all messages sent by all group members.
Creating and Sending a Text Message
The first time you launch Messages, the New Message screen is visible, the cursor flashes on the To field, and the virtual keyboard is displayed. If you have contact information stored in the Contacts app, as soon as you start typing in the To field, Messages attempts to match existing contacts with the name, cell phone number, Apple ID username, or email address you're currently typing. When the intended recipient's name appears, tap it.

 Tip
To initiate a conversation with someone, tap the New Message icon that appears in the upper-right corner of the Messages screen on the iPhone or next to the Messages heading on the upper-left side of the iPad's screen.

To quickly search your Contacts database to find one or more recipients for your text messages, tap the blue-and-white plus icon to the right of the To field as you're composing a new message. A scrollable list of all contacts stored in Contacts displays, along with a Search field you can use to search your contacts database from within the Messages app.

 Tip
If you're using an iPhone, to use your cellular service provider's text messaging service to send a message to another cell phone user, enter the recipient's cell phone number in the To field of a new message. This applies if the person doesn't have an entry in your Contacts database that contains her smartphone's phone number.
If you're using an iPhone or an iPad to send a message to another iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch user via iMessage, in the To field, enter the recipient's Apple ID, iPhone's phone number, or the email address that user has linked with their iMessage account.
In your Contacts database, you can create a separate field for someone's iMessage username, or when viewing the person's Contacts listing, simply tap the appropriate contact information based on how you want to send the text message.

After filling in the To field with one or more recipients, if you have the Show Subject Field feature turned on (from within Messages submenu in Settings), tap the optional Subject field to create a subject for your text message, and then tap the blank message field to begin typing your text message. If you're sending only text in your message, however, type the text, and then tap the Send icon.

 Tip
As soon as you type something into the message field, the Send icon is displayed. This icon looks like an upward-pointing arrow in a circle. Simply tap this icon to send the message. Once you hit send, there is no "undo." You can't take back, unsend, or erase a message.
To access some of the enhanced features built in to the Messages app (when using iMessage), press and hold down the Send icon to access the Send with Effect options.
The Send with Effects menu has two tabs at the top: Bubble and Screen. Tap the Bubble option to reveal the Slam, Loud, Gentle, and Invisible Ink features (see Figure 12.4). Any of these options add an attention-getting animation to the text bubble when you're using iMessage to communicate.
If you choose Invisible Ink, the message is sent using invisible virtual ink. The recipient must swipe their finger over the incoming message to make the message readable on their screen.
After choosing one of these options, tap the Send icon.


FIGURE 12.4
Add special animated effects to your outgoing messages when sending an iMessage with the Messages app.

 Tip
To send an animated background screen with a message, first fill in the message field with text, or use another iMessage feature to create or collect content to send. Then, instead of pressing the Send icon, press and hold the Send icon to reveal the Bubble and Screen tabs.
Tap the Screen tab, and then scroll right to left to toggle between the new animated text bubbles (called the Echo effect), a spotlight, animated balloons, confetti (see Figure 12.5), an animated heart balloon, lasers, fireworks, a shooting star animated sequence, and a "celebration" animation, which will be displayed across the entire background of the message area in the Messages app. Several of these animations are new to iOS 11.
After you select a screen animation, tap the Send icon. The recipient will receive your message and see the full-screen animation you selected.


FIGURE 12.5
Send an attention-grabbing, full-screen animation with your message. The Confetti effect is shown here.
Instead of sending basic text to the intended recipient or recording an audio message, when using Messages to communicate via the iMessage service, tap the App Store ("A") icon to the left of the message field to reveal the App Drawer, which enables you to attach optional enhanced content to the message, including animated stickers (which are different from Animojis on an iPhone X).
By default, the App Drawer includes the App Store icon, along with the Digital Touch icon, Images icon, and Music icon. Icons for other compatible apps already installed on your iPhone or iPad are also included.
To make the App Drawer temporarily disappear on an iPhone, place your finger on the App Store icon (displayed to the left of the message field) and swipe downward.
Figure 12.6 shows the App Store being browsed for third-party apps that work with iMessage and the Messages app. To get here, I tapped the icon to the left of the message field and then tapped the App Store icon in the App Drawer.

FIGURE 12.6
From within the Messages app, access a special area of the App Store that showcases apps that work with the Messages app.

 Tip
Tap the camera icon to snap a photo (using one of the iPhone or iPad's built-cameras) so that you can send that photo to the intended recipient in a message. Alternatively, select a photo or video clip that's currently stored in the Photos app. (Tap the Photos button, after tapping on the Camera icon, to do this.) After you select one or more photos, each gets embedded into the outgoing message, and thumbnails for them appear in the Message field. Tap the Send icon to send the photos or video clips to the recipient(s).
When you tap the Camera icon, a mini version of the Camera app's viewfinder screen is displayed. Use the camera selection icon to switch between the front- and rear-facing cameras, and then snap a photo by tapping the Shutter button. That photo is then added to the message field, and it will be sent when you tap the Send icon.


 Tip
After tapping the App Store "A" icon, tap the heart-shaped Digital Touch icon to draw something special on the screen (to be sent as an animated graphic within the text message).
From the Digital Touch window, make the window bigger by tapping the up-arrow icon at the top of the window. Tap on the Info (i) icon to view a Digital Touch menu (see Figure 12.7) that describes the finger gestures that you can use to overlay an animated sketch, tap, fireball, kiss, heartbeat, or heartbreak graphic.
As soon as you create one of these Digital Touch animations, it is automatically sent to the recipient, without you having to tap the Send icon.
Tap the Video icon to capture a short video sequence or still image, and then annotate or draw on it. This can be done in real time or after shooting.


 Tip
To add special content to an outgoing message, tap the App Store icon, and then from the App Drawer, tap an app icon, such as the Music icon. Next, tap a thumbnail that represents a recently played song from the Music app (see Figure 12.8) to share it. A link to the song is automatically sent to the message recipient.
Tap the Images icon to select an animated graphic that helps to convey a message you want to send. Keep scrolling down to view a vast selection of GIFs (see Figure 12.9). Tap the thumbnail for the one you want to send.
In the Find Images search field that's displayed just above the GIF thumbnails, type a keyword or search phrase to help you quickly find an appropriate GIF to send. Tap the ^ icon to increase the size of the window that displays the GIFs menu.


FIGURE 12.7
Use one of these Digital Touch finger gestures or annotate a photo or video in real time.

FIGURE 12.8
Select a recently played song from the Music app to share with someone via iMessage.

FIGURE 12.9
Choose an animated GIF to help you convey a message using graphics.

 What's New
To customize which app icons appear within the App Drawer, and in what order, scroll to the extreme right of the App Drawer and tap the More (...) icon. Then tap Edit.
You can rearrange app icons in the App Drawer. To remove apps from the App Drawer, turn off the virtual switch associated with an app's listing (see Figure 12.10).


 Note
Third-party apps that are installed within your iOS mobile device and that are compatible with Messages allow you to send specific types of content or information, including money (via Apple Pay, PayPal, or Cash) to a recipient.


FIGURE 12.10
Determine which compatible app icons should appear within the Message app's app drawer.

 Tip
To start a new group message, from the Messages app, tap the Compose icon to create a new message from scratch. Within the To field, enter each person's phone number (if using a text messaging service) or their iPhone phone number, Apple ID username, or the email address that's associated with their iMessage account. Separate each recipient with a comma. Alternatively, after entering a recipient's details, tap the + to the right of the To field to add another recipient.
Once you're engaged in a group message, tap the Info (i) icon for that conversation to add new participants (by tapping the + Add Contact option), create a Group Name, share your current location, share your location on an ongoing basis, hide alerts related to the conversation, or leave the conversation.

Recording and Sending an Audio Message
When using iMessage, it's possible to record and send short audio messages via the Messages app. To do this, launch Messages, select the person you want to send the message to, and then press and hold your finger on the microphone icon to the right of the message field. This begins the recording process. Simply start speaking into your iPhone or iPad.

 Note
Sending an audio file by tapping the microphone icon to the right of the message field is different from using iOS 11's Dictation feature, which enables you to speak into your iPhone or iPad and have the device transcribe what you say into text. To use the Dictation feature in Messages, tap the microphone key at the bottom of the virtual keyboard (to the immediate left of the space bar).

When you're finished recording, lift your finger from the microphone icon. You can delete the audio message by tapping the X icon. Tap the Play icon to preview your audio message before sending it. Send your audio message to the intended recipient by tapping the Send icon or by swiping your finger upward.
Using the Messages app, it's also possible to receive an incoming audio message. Instead of text being displayed, an audio message icon is displayed. Tap it to play the message.

 Tip
In Settings, set up the Messages app to automatically delete audio messages or animated graphic messages after a certain amount of time, or keep them forever (or until you manually delete them). Storing audio messages or animated graphics requires additional internal storage space in your iPhone or iPad. To adjust this setting, launch Settings, tap the Messages option, and then tap the Expire option, which is listed under the Audio Messages heading.


 Tip
Using the iPad's Split Screen or Multitasking feature, you can keep the Messages app running on one side of the tablet's screen (and engage in one or more conversations) while simultaneously continuing to work with another app.

Participating in a Text-Message Conversation
As soon as you tap Send to initiate a new message conversation and send an initial text, audio, photo, animated graphic, or video message, the New Message window transforms into a conversation window, with the recipient's name displayed at the top center.
Displayed on the right side of the conversation window are the messages you've sent. The responses from the person you're conversing with are left justified and displayed in a different color on the screen within text bubbles (see Figure 12.11).

FIGURE 12.11
A sample text message conversation via the Messages app on an iPhone.
As the conversation continues and eventually scrolls off the screen, use your finger to swipe up or down to view what's already been said.

 Tip
Whenever there's a pause between the sending of a message and the receipt of a response, the Messages app automatically inserts the date and time in the center of the screen so that you can later easily track the time period during which each conversation took place. This is particularly helpful if there are long gaps and the conversation takes place over time.

Communicating with Emojis
Anytime you're engaged in a conversation using the Messages app, tap the Emoji key (between the 123 and Dictation keys on the virtual keyboard) to access hundreds of graphic emojis.
In addition to many different face emojis, which you can use to graphically depict emotions, iOS 11 offers hundreds of emojis sorted into different categories. After tapping the Emoji key on the keyboard, tap any emoji category icon at the bottom of the screen, or scroll from right to left (or left to right) between the emoji menus (see Figure 12.12).

FIGURE 12.12
Choose from hundreds of nonanimated emojis to insert into a message.
To add an emoji to your text message, simply tap the emoji you want, and it will appear in the message field. Tap the ABC key (in the lower-left corner of the virtual keyboard) to return to the regular QWERTY (alphanumeric) keyboard.

 Tip
As you're typing a message using text in the Messages app, a built-in feature automatically enables you to swap specific words with emojis related to those words, without you having to search for the emojis. While you're typing, if you use a word like "happy" or "sad" that has a related emoji, that emoji is displayed in a tab as part of the QuickType keyboard, above the regular virtual keyboard keys.
To turn on this feature, press and hold down the Emoji key on the keyboard, tap the Keyboard Settings option, and turn on the virtual switches associated with Shortcuts and Predictive.
When you're finished typing a text-based message, tap once on the Emoji key. Words in your messages that correspond to emojis are highlighted in orange. Tap any of those words to see a list of emojis that relate. Tap an option to replace the word in your message with the selected emoji.

Generating a Quick Response to a Message and Adding Emphasis
Anytime you receive a message via the iMessage service, if you want to quickly send an emphasized graphic response, simply press and hold your finger on the text bubble you want to respond to. Within a second or two, a menu bubble appears that contains six "emphasized" responses, which are large graphic icons. Your options include a heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, the message "Ha Ha," exclamation points, or a question mark (shown in Figure 12.13).

FIGURE 12.13
Send an emphasized response to any text message in the form of a graphic icon that gets attached to the text bubble you're responding to.
Tap your desired response, and it is automatically sent (and attached to the text bubble you responded to). There is no need to tap the Send icon.
Responding to an Incoming Message
Depending on how you set up the Messages app in Settings, you can be notified of an incoming message in a number of ways. Notification of a new message can be set to appear in Notification Center. Or, if the Messages app is already running, a new message alert is heard and a new message listing appears on the Messages screen (iPhone) or under the Messages heading on the left side of the iPad screen.
If you already have the conversation screen open and a new message from the person you're conversing with is received, that message appears on the conversation screen. Meanwhile, if you're an Apple Watch user, the messages you receive are automatically displayed on your watch's screen as well. This includes all graphic-oriented message features available through iMessage.

 Tip
When a new message arrives, a blue dot appears to the left of the new message's listing (under the Messages heading on the iPad or on the Messages screen on the iPhone). The blue dot indicates it's a new, unread message.

To read the incoming message and respond to it, tap the incoming message listing. If you're looking at the listing in Notification Center, for example, and you tap it, the Messages app launches and the appropriate conversation window automatically opens.
After reading the incoming text message, use the virtual keyboard to type your response in the blank message field, and then tap the Send icon to send the response message.
Relaunching or Reviewing Past Conversations
From the Messages screen on the iPhone, or from the left side of the screen on the iPad, when the Messages app is running, you can view a listing of all saved conversations. Each listing displays the person's name, the date and time of the last message sent or received, and a summary of the last message sent or received. Tap any of the listings to relaunch that conversation in the Conversation window. You can either reread the entire conversation or continue the conversation by sending a message to that person.

 Tip
By tapping one listing at a time, you can participate in multiple conversations.
On the iPhone, to exit the conversation screen you're currently viewing, tap the left-pointing arrow icon in the upper-left corner of the screen (labeled Messages). On the iPad, tap one of the other listings under the Messages heading on the left side of the screen.

From the Messages screen on the iPhone (or the Messages listing on the iPad on the left side of the screen), tap Edit, and then tap the red-and-white - icon next to a conversation to quickly delete the entire conversation. This removes the content from the device you're using but does not affect the conversation other participant(s) have stored within their respective mobile devices or compatible equipment.

 Tip
While engaged in a conversation via the Message app, tap the Info icon at the top-right corner of the conversation screen. The Details screen appears. From the Details screen, you can initiate a FaceTime, voice, or text message conversation with that person.
You can also use your iPhone or iPad's Location Services (GPS) capabilities to send your exact location to that person. The recipient receives a map that displays your exact location. They can then tap this Maps icon and then tap the Directions to Here option to obtain turn-by-turn navigation directions from their current location to yours.
If you want the recipient to know when you have read their messages after they've been received by you, turn on the virtual switch associated with the Send Read Receipts option. This option is set separately for each person you communicate with via Messages.
Scroll down in the Details screen to see a collection of all images or attachments that have been shared during the entire conversation with that person (that's taken place using Messages).
Tap the Images tab to view the images/photos, or tap the Attachments tab to view other content that's been shared.

Writing Messages by Hand on an iPad
When using any model iPad, instead of typing a text-message when using iMessage with the Messages app, tap the Drawing key that's in the bottom row of the virtual keyboard (between the ".?123" and Hide Keyboard keys). The virtual keyboard disappears, and a white box appears in its place (see Figure 12.14).

FIGURE 12.14
Draw or write something within the white box. Whatever you create will be sent as a graphic to the recipient.
Using your finger or an Apple Pencil (if you're using an iPad Pro), handwrite or draw a message. When you're done, tap Done. What you created within the white box will be transferred to the text message field as an outgoing graphic message. Tap the Send icon to send it, or tap the X icon to delete the message without sending it.

 Note
You can add a typed comment in the message field to send along with your drawing or handwritten note.

While the white box is visible, tap the clock-shaped icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen to see a menu of stock handwritten messages. Tap one to select it. Tap the clock-shaped icon again to make the menu disappear and return to the white box.
As you're viewing the white box, to make the virtual keyboard re-appear, tap the keyboard icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
Muting Conversations
If you start getting bombarded by incoming messages from people who aren't too important to you, it's possible to easily mute those conversations.
To do this, from the Messages screen (or pane) swipe from right to left across a conversation listing, and then tap the Hide Alerts button. Alternatively, open the conversation from the person you want to "mute," and tap the Info (i) icon associated with the conversation. Turn on the virtual switch associated with Hide Alerts.
New incoming messages will still be received and visible within the Message app, but you won't receive any alerts, alarms, or notifications related to messages from that person until you manually unmute the conversation by turning off the Hide Alerts switch.

 Note
When a specific conversation is muted, a moon icon is displayed to the left of a person's profile photo on the Messages screen (iPhone) or along the Messages pane (iPad).

To refrain from receiving alerts, alarms, and notifications from everyone you're communicating with via the Message app, launch Settings, tap Notifications, tap Messages, and then turn off the virtual switch associated with the Allow Notifications option.
To continue receiving notifications without having an audible alert for incoming messages, from the Messages submenu within Settings, tap Sounds and select None.

 Note
If you want to turn off all alerts, alarms, and notifications for all apps (including the Phone app on an iPhone and FaceTime on an iPhone or iPad), turn on the Do Not Disturb feature in the Control Center or from Settings. When you're ready to receive alerts, alarms, and notifications once again (including incoming calls and text messages), be sure to manually turn off the Do Not Disturb feature, unless you have set a schedule for turning Do Not Disturb on and off.

To block someone from calling you or sending you text messages, open the conversation within the Messages app, tap on the Info (i) icon, tap the person's name to view their information screen, and then tap the Block This Caller option at the bottom of the screen.
Alternatively, launch the Phone app (on an iPhone), tap the Recents icon, tap the Info (i) icon associated with the person's most recent call, and then tap the Block This Caller option. The person remains blocked until you manually unblock them by tapping the Unblock This Caller option that now appears at the bottom of the person's Information screen.

 What's New
If you ever need to use just one hand to hold an iPhone and type on its virtual keyboard, there's a new feature that makes this easier. (But you should never do this while driving!)
As you're composing a text message, press and hold down the Emoji key on the virtual keyboard, and then tap the keyboard icon displayed on the right or left side of the pop-up window (see Figure 12.15).
The on-screen keyboard shrinks so all the keys are reachable with just your right or left hand. For example, if you'll be holding the phone in your left hand, tap on the keyboard icon on the left. The shrunken virtual keyboard repositions itself on the left side of the screen (see Figure 12.16).
To make the one-handed keyboard even easier to use (and your iPhone easier to hold), consider sticking an optional Pop Socket ($10, www.popsockets.com) handle on the back of your iPhone or phone case.


FIGURE 12.15
A pop-up menu appears when you press and hold the Emoji key on the virtual keyboard when using any iPhone.

FIGURE 12.16
Make the iPhone's virtual keyboard smaller, and reposition it to the left or right side of the screen, which makes it easier to hold the phone and type with the same hand.







13. Surf the Web More Efficiently using Safari

In this Chapter
 How to use new features in the iOS 11 version of Safari
 How to use Safari Reader
 Using your iPhone as a personal Wi-Fi hotspot

Chances are, if you know how to use a Mac or PC, you already know how to surf the Web using a browser such as Safari, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, or Google Chrome on your computer.
The Safari web browser on your iPhone (see Figure 13.1) or iPad (see Figure 13.2) offers the same basic functionality as the web browser for your desktop or laptop computer, but it's designed to maximize the iPhone or iPad's touchscreen and screen size.

FIGURE 13.1
The main screen of the Safari web browser on the iPhone.

FIGURE 13.2
The main screen of the Safari web browser on the iPad.

 Tip
One the most useful features offered by the iOS 11 version of Safari is the capability to use Split Screen mode and have two independent web browser windows open at the same time on the iPad. It's also possible to use Multitasking mode, and have two apps (such as Safari and another app of your choosing) running side-by-side on your tablet's screen.
To use the Split Screen feature, launch Safari on your iPad, and in the Smart Search field, type the first URL you want to visit (or select it from a saved bookmark).
Next, tap the + icon to open a second browser window, and enter the second URL you want to visit. Two browser tabs are now displayed below the Smart Search field (see Figure 13.3).
Place your finger on either browser tab and drag it down and to the left or right side of the screen. Release your finger, and Split Screen mode launches. At this point, the two browser windows are running independently of each other (see Figure 13.4).
To close one of the browser windows, tap the X icon near the top-left corner of the window you want to close.


FIGURE 13.3
When two browser tabs are open, drag one down and toward the right or left edge of the screen.

 Tip
Using the Handoff function, you're able to begin surfing the Web using Safari on one of your supported Macs or iOS mobile devices, and then pick up exactly where you left off on another, as long as all the equipment is linked to the same iCloud account. (Only iOS mobile devices and Macs released within the past few years offer this capability.)
To turn on the Handoff feature, launch Settings, tap the General option, and then tap the Handoff option. From the Handoff submenu, turn on the virtual switch associated with the Handoff feature. This must be done on each device. Also turn on your device's Bluetooth feature.


FIGURE 13.4
You can view two web browser tabs side by side with Safari's Split Screen mode.

 Note
Tot surf the Web and use the Safari web browser, your iPhone or iPad requires an active Wi-Fi or cellular data Internet connection unless you're using Safari's Read List feature to look at content you've saved for offline viewing.

Customizing Your Web-Surfing Experience
As you'd expect from your iPhone or iPad, surfing the Web is a highly customizable experience. For example, you can hold your device in portrait or landscape mode and, on most websites, you can also zoom in on or zoom out of specific areas or content. To do this, use the reverse-pinch finger gesture (to zoom in) or the pinch gesture (to zoom out), or double-tap a specific area of the screen to zoom in or out. Keep in mind that zooming does not work when you're viewing a mobile-optimized website.
To further customize your web surfing experience, launch Settings and tap the Safari option. The Safari submenu (see Figure 13.5) offers a handful of customizable options. The following sections summarize what each is used for.

 What's New
The Siri & Search feature gives you the option to allow Siri to access and use content from the Internet to better serve as your virtual assistant. To turn on this feature, launch Settings, tap Siri & Search, and then scroll down and tap Safari. Turn on the virtual switch for Search and Siri Suggestions.

Adjusting Search-Related Settings
The Smart Search field is used to enter specific website addresses (URLs) and to find what you're looking for on the Web via a search engine, such as Google, Yahoo!, Bing, or DuckDuckGo. The Search Engine option enables you to select your default (favorite) Internet search engine.

FIGURE 13.5
Customize your web surfing experience when using Safari from within Settings on your iOS device (shown here on an iPad).

 Note
DuckDuckGo.com is a search engine that does not track your web surfing behaviors or activities, so it offers a more private experience. However, you can use Safari's enhanced Privacy features to prevent your web surfing activities from being tracked, regardless of which search engine you're using.


 Tip
It's possible to open a private browsing session by tapping the tab browser icon, and then tapping the Private option (see Figure 13.6). Tap Done to continue surfing (now in Private mode). To indicate you're in Private mode, the Title bar area of the Safari web browser (where the command icons are located) is gray rather than white. When in Private mode, Safari doesn't keep track of the web pages you visit.


FIGURE 13.6
Manually turn on a private web surfing experience by tapping the Browser Tab icon and then selecting the Private option (shown here on an iPhone).

 Tip
When viewing the Tabbed Browser Screen on an iPhone (refer to Figure 13.6), tap the New Browser Window (+) icon to open a new browser window.
If you have the Handoff feature turned on, scroll down this screen to view open browser windows on your iPad or Mac(s) that are linked to the same iCloud account and that also have Handoff turned on.
To turn on the Handoff feature (on an iPhone or iPad), launch Settings, tap General, and then tap Handoff. Turn on the virtual switch for the Handoff feature.

Other settings you can configure for Safari include Search Engine Suggestions, Safari Suggestions, Quick Website Search, and Preload Top Hit:
 Search Engine Suggestions—Automatically offers additional (related) search term suggestions when you enter a website address or search term in Safari's Search field.
 Safari Suggestions—Shows related websites when you perform a search using the Search feature in the iOS 11 version of Safari.
 Quick Website Search—Can be used to search a specific website for a specific term. For example, enter "Wiki New York" into the Search field to access the Wikipedia website and display information related to New York.
 Preload Top Hit—Displays your favorite and most frequented websites when you do a relevant search.
Customizing General Safari Options
The Safari submenu within Settings displays a heading labeled General. Here you'll find additional options for customizing your web surfing experience, including the following:
 Autofill—When turned on, this feature helps you fill in online-based forms by remembering your responses and automatically inserting your information into the appropriate fields. It also pulls information from your own Contacts app entry. Autofill is particularly useful when shopping online.
To customize this option and link your personal contact entry to Safari, tap the AutoFill option, turn on the Use Contact Info option, and then tap My Info to select your own Contacts entry.
You can also set whether Safari remembers usernames and passwords for specific websites you visit, as well as credit card information that you use to make online purchases. Tap the Saved Credit Cards option to add or edit credit card information you have securely stored in Safari for use when making online purchases. This functionality is part of what Apple calls iCloud Keychain.

 Note
Some websites allow you to make purchases using Apple Pay from your mobile device. To do this, you first need to set up Apple Pay. Refer to Chapter 16, "iOS 11 and Apple Pay Security and Privacy Strategies," for more information about setting up and using Apple Pay to make online purchases, and for making purchases from retail stores.

 Frequently Visited Websites—Turn on this feature to display websites you frequent the most often when performing a search, as well as before you enter information into Safari's Search field or into Spotlight Search.
 Favorites—This feature serves as a shortcut for accessing websites you frequently visit and that you have favorited. As you begin typing a website address or website name into the Search field, Safari accesses your Favorites list and auto-inserts the appropriate website URL. When you tap the Search field, a screen with icons representing sites in your Favorites list is displayed. Your Favorites list of websites automatically syncs between your Macs, PCs, and iOS mobile devices that are linked to the same iCloud account. This option now enables you to choose a specific folder where your favorite bookmarks are stored in the device you're using.

 Tip
If you've created custom Bookmark folders when using Safari on your Mac, you can access and manage them from your iOS mobile device. Plus from the Favorites option within the Safari submenu of Settings, you can make one of these custom folders your default.

 Open Links (iPhone only)—Any time a new web page opens as a result of you tapping a link, this feature determines whether the new browser window is opened as the new active browser window or opened in the background as a tabbed browser window.
 Open New Tabs in Background (iPad only)—Any time a new web page opens as a result of you tapping a link, this feature determines whether the new browser window is opened as the new active browser window or opened in the background as a tabbed browser window. How this option works depends on options you have selected on the Safari submenu of Settings.
 Show Favorites Bar (iPad)—When you turn on the virtual switch associated with this feature, your Favorites Bar displays across the top of the Safari screen, just below the row of command icons and the Search field. The default setting for this feature is off because it utilizes some of your onscreen real estate.
 Show Tab Bar (iPad)—When turned on, if multiple browser windows are open in Safari, tabs for each window are displayed along the top of the screen, just below the row of command icons and the Search field. The default setting for this feature is on. This makes it faster and easier to quickly switch between open browser windows.
 Block Pop-Ups—When turned on, this feature prevents a website you're visiting from creating and displaying extra windows or opening a bunch of unwanted browser tabs. The default for this option is turned on because this makes for a more enjoyable web-surfing experience.
Adjusting Safari's Privacy & Security Options
From the Safari submenu in Settings, scroll down to the Privacy & Security heading, and then turn on or off the virtual switches associated with the various options.

 Tip
Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) enhances your security when surfing the Web and handling online tasks (such as online banking or online shopping) from your mobile device. Setting up a VPN is discussed in Chapter 16.

The adjustable Privacy and Security options include the following:
 Prevent Cross-Site Tracking—Cross-site tracking is a technology (called "remarketing") that's used by online advertisers. When you look up or discuss a product or service via a search engine or website or when you're active on social media, what you look up or discuss is remembered. As you continue your web surfing activities, advertisements for what you looked up or discussed continuously appear on other advertising-supported websites. For example, if you look up something do to with new tires for your car, for the next few days (sometimes longer), you see ads related to tires on many different websites and social media services that display advertising. Turning on the Prevent Cross-Site Tracking feature makes it harder for advertisers to customize and target the online ads you see based on your past surfing habits and searches.

 Tip
In addition to turning on the Prevent Cross-Site Tracking, turn on the virtual switch associated with the Ask Websites Not to Track Me feature. This prevents a website's operator from tracking what you see and do on each website you visit.

 Block All Cookies—Some websites automatically remember things about your visit, such as your personal preferences, so when you return to that website, the same information doesn't need to be collected from you again. This data is stored within Safari as a "cookie." To prevent websites from creating cookies and having Safari store them, turn on the virtual switch associated with this feature. When you have this feature turned on, your web surfing experience will be more convenient because websites you frequently visit will remember information about your activities and preferences.

 Tip
The Fraudulent Website Warning feature helps prevent you from getting tricked into visiting a fraudulent website that's designed to replicate a legitimate website.
For example, imagine you receive an email staying there is a problem with your credit card account, and you must click on a specific link immediately to rectify the situation. The email is not from your credit card issuer, however. It's from someone trying to perpetuate online fraud. When you click the provided link, you're sent to a fake website designed to look exactly like the actual website from your credit card company. However, the website's purpose is to collect personal information from you; that information could be used for identity theft, credit card fraud, or to steal your money. Similar scams appear to come from banks and financial institutions, eBay, major airlines, and email service providers.
Turning on this feature does not offer total protection from fraudulent websites or what are called phishing schemes, but it does help to protect you.

 Camera & Microphone Access—Some websites use the microphone and camera built into your iPhone or iPad to help you communicate via video calls or voice-over-IP (Internet-based) voice calls. These apps won't be able to access and turn on your iOS device's camera or microphone unless you turn on the virtual switch associated with this feature. Turning off this feature helps to prevent hackers and online-based criminals from potentially virtually spying on you while you're surfing the Web.
 Check for Apple Pay—If a website you're visiting supports the Apple Pay feature, you'll be notified that you can use Apple Pay for purchases.
Examining Additional Safari-Related Options
After accessing Settings and tapping on the Safari option, as you scroll down within the Safari submenu, you'll discover the following three additional options:
 Clear History and Website Data—Use this feature to delete the contents of Safari's History folder, in which details about all the websites you have visited are stored. Cookies are also deleted.
 Automatically Save Offline—Use this feature to download all articles and web pages you save in Safari's Reading list. Items added to the Reading List are stored within your iCloud account, so you can access them from Safari running on any of your computers or mobile devices that are linked to the same iCloud account, so you can read and refer to them anytime later, even when your iPhone or iPad is not connected to the Internet. Keep in mind that this feature does not store audio or video that's associated with an article or web page you save within your Reading List. See the "Creating and Managing Reading Lists" section later in this chapter for more information.
 Advanced—View details about website-specific data that Safari has collected. You can manually delete this information. You also can enable or disable the JavaScript feature.
Using Tabbed Browsing with Safari
Safari's main screen contains the various command icons used to navigate the Web. On the iPhone, these icons are displayed along the bottom of the Safari screen, while the smart Search field is displayed along the top of the screen.
If you're using Safari on an iPad, the Title bar displays all of Safari's command icons along the top of the screen, unless you're using Split Screen mode, in which case the icons are displayed along the bottom of the screen.

 Note
The command icons offered by Safari include Back, Forward, Bookmarks, Reader (when applicable), Webpage Refresh, Share, Open New Browser Window (+), and the Tab Browser icon.

Immediately below the Title bar, if you have the option turned on, your personalized Favorites Bar is displayed. Below the Favorites Bar, the Tabs bar becomes visible if you have more than one web page loaded in Safari at any given time (and you have this featured turned on).
Switching Between Web Pages on an iPhone
The iPhone version of tabbed browsing involves Safari opening separate browser windows for each active web page. Tap the Tabbed Browser icon located in the bottom-right corner of the Safari screen to quickly switch between open browser windows (see Figure 13.7), because only one at a time can be viewed.

FIGURE 13.7
Safari's Tab view is shown here on the iPhone.

 Tip
When looking at the Tab View screen, if you press the + option for a second or two, a Recently Closed Tabs menu screen appears. You can easily reopen a previously visited but closed browser window by tapping an item listed (which is based on your personal web surfing history).

When you're viewing the Tab View screen, tap the New Browser Window (+) icon to create a new (empty) browser window, and then manually surf to a new website by typing a URL or search term into the Smart Search field, selecting a favorite icon, or selecting a bookmark.

 Tip
When viewing the Tab View screen in Safari, tap the Private option to turn on the Private web surfing mode only for the newly open browser windows. This prevents Safari from storing details about the websites you visit and syncing this information with your iCloud account.

To switch between active (viewable) browser windows that are open, simply tap one of the web page thumbnails displayed. Swipe up and down to scroll through the browser window thumbnails. To close a window (tab), tap its X icon.

 Tip
To access browser windows open on your other computers or iOS mobile devices, scroll down to the bottom of the Tab View screen (on the iPhone) to see listings for open browser windows on your Mac(s) or other iOS mobile devices linked to the same iCloud account. Tap any of these listings to pick up exactly where you left off on that other device.

Tap Done to exit the Tab View screen and return to the main Safari web browser screen. Alternatively, tap any web page thumbnail displayed in the Tab View screen to open that browser window and continue your web surfing experience at the selected web page.
Using Tabbed Browsing on Any iPad
When you tap a link in a web page that causes a new web page to automatically open, a new tab in Safari is created and displayed. Six tabs are shown in Figure 13.8, and each represents a separate open browser window. The right-most tab is the active tab. The Tab bar can display multiple tabs at once. To instantly switch between web pages, tap the desired tab. The website name (or web page title) is displayed in the tab for easy reference.

FIGURE 13.8
On the iPad, open browser window tabs are displayed along the top of the screen. Six tabs are shown here.

 Note
On the iPad, tabs are not displayed if the Show Tab Bar option is turned off from the Safari submenu of Settings. Turning off Show Tab Bar and Show Favorites Bar enables you to save onscreen real estate that can then be used to display more of the web pages you're visiting. Having these features turned on, however, makes switching between browser windows and reloading frequently visited websites faster and more convenient.

As you're viewing a web page, to open another web page, tap the New Browser Window (+) icon near the top-right corner of the Safari screen (between the Share and Tab Browser icons). When you do this, a new tab is created for an empty browser window. This enables you to visit a different web page without closing the web page(s) you're currently viewing.
To close a tab, tap the small x that appears on the left side of an open tab (refer to Figure 13.8).

 Tip
As you're surfing the Web using your iPad, tap the Tab Browser icon in the top-right corner of the screen to display all the open browser windows on each of your other Macs or iOS mobile devices linked to the same iCloud account. Tap any of these preview windows or listings to open that browser window on your iPad and pick up exactly where you left off when using the other computer or device.

Cleaning Up Screen Clutter with Safari's Reader Option
Safari Reader enables you to select a compatible website page (or an article displayed on a website); strip out graphic icons, ads, and other unwanted elements that cause onscreen clutter; and then read just the text (and view related photos) from that web page.
The Safari Reader works only with compatible websites. If the feature is available while you're viewing a web page, the Reader icon (as shown in Figures 13.9 and 13.10) is displayed before that web page's URL on the extreme left side of the Smart Search field.

FIGURE 13.9
An article from AARP.org, without the Reader feature active (shown on an iPad).

FIGURE 13.10
The same article from AARP.org but with the Reader feature active.

 Tip
When using the Reader feature, tap the AA icon on the right side of the Smart Search field in Safari to access a menu that enables you to change the font used to display the text, as well as decrease or increase the size of the text.

Tap the Reader icon a second time to return the web page to its normal appearance.
Creating and Managing Reading Lists
As you're surfing the Web, you might come across specific web pages, articles, or other information that you want to refer to later. In Safari, it's possible to create a bookmark for that website URL and have it displayed as part of your Bookmarks list or as part of your Favorites Bar. Another option, however, is to add a web page to your Safari Reading List. In addition to just storing the web page's URL, Reading List stores the actual content of that page for later viewing (including offline viewing).

 Note
The Reading List feature downloads entire web pages for offline viewing, as opposed to simply storing website addresses that you can refer to later. Although this feature downloads text and photos associated with a web page, it does not download animated graphics, video, or audio content associated with that page.

To add a website or web-based article to your personalized Reading List for later review, tap the Share icon, and then tap the Add to Reading List icon in Safari's Share menu.
To later access your Reading List to view any of the stored web pages or articles, tap the Bookmarks icon, and then tap the Reading List tab. Figure 13.11 shows an example of a Reading List. The Reading List tab looks like eyeglasses.

FIGURE 13.11
Create a Reading List to store links that you want to easily be able to find again and access later.

 Tip
Like your Bookmarks list and Favorites Bar, the items stored in your Reading List automatically sync with your iCloud account and are almost instantly made available on any other computer or iOS device linked to your iCloud account.

Working with Bookmarks
When you tap the Bookmarks icon on an iPad, the Bookmarks menu appears along the left side of the screen. It remains visible until you tap the Bookmarks icon again. On the iPhone, when you tap the Bookmarks icon, the Bookmarks menu is displayed on a new screen in the Safari app.
At the top of the Bookmarks menu are three tabs. The leftmost tab (shaped like a book) is the Bookmarks tab. When you tap it, your saved list of website bookmarks is displayed. The center tab is the Reading List tab. Tap it to reveal your reading list (refer to Figure 13.11).

 What's New
The History tab (represented by the clock icon) enables you to see a listing of websites you've previously visited. Tap any History listing to quickly revisit that web page without manually typing its URL. The most recently visited websites are listed first. As you scroll down, headings for earlier that day and previous days are displayed.
One way to clear (erase) your web surfing history is to launch Safari, tap the Bookmarks icon, and then tap the History tab. Next, tap the Clear tab in the lower-right corner of the History list.

Sharing Web Content in Safari
The iOS 11 version of Safari makes sharing web links and managing web page content extremely easy, thanks to a handful of available options offered by the Share menu. The Share menu (see Figure 13.12), which you access by tapping the Share icon, offers a variety of features for sharing, printing, and managing web page content.

 Note
The options available to you from the Share menu vary depending on several factors, including the content you're viewing as well as whether you have Facebook, Twitter, and other third-party apps installed and set up to work with Safari and iOS 11.


 Tip
If you have the AirDrop feature turned on, when you access the Share menu, the AirDrop option is available. This enables you to wirelessly share content with nearby (compatible) Mac, iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch users. Some older Mac and iOS mobile device models don't support AirDrop.
Refer to Chapter 6, "Sync, Share, and Print Files Using AirDrop, AirPlay, AirPrint, and Handoff," for more information on how to use the AirDrop feature.


FIGURE 13.12
Safari's Share menu offers a handful of ways to store, manage, print, and share web page content.
Also displayed on Safari's Share menu are command icons that allow you to manage the content you're viewing. The following are some of the more commonly used options:
 Copy—Use this command to copy the URL for the web page you're looking at to the virtual clipboard. You can then paste that information into another app.
 Print—Wirelessly print a website's contents to any AirPrint-compatible printer that's set up to work with your iOS mobile device. To print a web page, tap the Print icon. From the Printer Options screen, select the printer you want to use, and then choose the number of copies you want printed. Tap the Print icon at the bottom of the Print Options window to send the web page document to your printer.
 Add to Reading List—Instead of adding a web page URL to your Bookmarks list or Favorites Bar, you can save it in your Reading List for later reference.
 Add Bookmark—Tap this option to add a bookmark to your personal Bookmarks list. When you opt to save a bookmark, an Add Bookmark window appears. Here, you can enter a title for the bookmark and decide whether you want to save it as part of your Bookmarks menu or in your Favorites Bar. You can also create separate subfolders in your Bookmarks menu to organize your saved bookmarks.
 Add To Favorites—Add a listing for the website you're currently viewing to your Safari Favorites list. This list syncs with iCloud and will be updated on all the Macs, PCs, and iOS mobile devices that you have linked to the same iCloud account.

 Note
When using Safari on the iPhone, you can maintain a Favorites list; however, to conserve onscreen space, a Favorites Bar is not displayed across the top of the Safari screen like it is on an iPad. Instead, on an iPhone, the Favorites list is displayed as an additional Bookmark folder when you tap the Bookmarks icon.
When using an iPad, turn off the Show Favorites Bar option (found on the Safari submenu within Settings) to hide the Favorites Bar.

 Add to Home Screen—See the section, "Launching Your Favorite Websites via Home Screen Icons," later in this chapter, for more information on this feature.
 Open in News—Transfer the web content you're viewing in Safari to the News app, where it will be formatted and become viewable like any news article that's accessible from the For You screen.
 Request Desktop Site—Anytime you visit a website using the iOS 11 edition of Safari, if a mobile version of the website is offered, that's the version that automatically loads. A mobile website has been custom formatted to accommodate the smaller iPhone or iPad screen size (compared to a full-sized computer monitor). However, if you'd prefer to switch to viewing the Desktop version of the website, tap the Request Desktop Site icon, and if available, this version of the website loads. You can then use the zoom in and zoom out finger gestures, as well as swipe finger gestures to navigate around the web page.

 What's New
It's now possible to create a PDF from the contents of any web page you're looking at, and then annotate, store, share, or manage that file just as you would any other PDF. To do this, as you're viewing a web page you want to convert into a PDF, tap the Share button, and then tap Create PDF.
You see a preview screen that shows what will become the PDF. Tap the Markup/Annotate icon to write or draw on the PDF. (This feature works particularly well if you're using an Apple Pencil in conjunction with an iPad Pro.) Tap the Share icon to determine what you want to do with the PDF.
For example, you can copy it and then paste it into another compatible app, share it with other people (via text message, AirDrop, email, or social media), or save the file within a cloud-based file storage account, such as iCloud Drive (via the Files app) or Dropbox. Tap the Print button to print the file to an AirPrint-compatible printer that's wirelessly linked to your mobile device.
To save the PDF, tap Done, tap Save File To, and then choose where you want to save it. You can choose a specific folder or subfolder within iCloud Drive, or you can choose the On My iPhone/iPad option to save it locally within the internal storage of the device you're using.

Creating, Managing, and Syncing Bookmarks and User Information
Your iOS device automatically syncs your Bookmarks and related Safari data with your other iOS mobile devices, as well as the compatible web browsers on your primary computer(s).
To activate iCloud sync functionality as it relates to Safari, launch Settings, tap your profile photo/username, and then tap the iCloud option. Turn on the virtual switch associated with the Safari option. This must be done on each of your iOS mobile devices just once.
Once this feature is turned on, your Bookmarks list, Favorites Bar, open browser windows (tabs), Safari Reading List, and iCloud Keychain data are automatically and continuously synced with your iCloud account. Thus, when you add a new bookmark while surfing the Web on your iPad, for example, within seconds that same bookmark appears in your Bookmarks list on your iPhone and on Safari that's running on your Mac.

 Tip
For Windows PC users, if you download the optional iCloud for Windows software (www.apple.com/icloud/setup/pc.html), your Bookmarks and related web browser data on your PC sync with your iOS mobile device(s) and Mac(s), and vice versa. Simply add a check mark to the Bookmarks option displayed in the iCloud Control Panel.
This feature is compatible with the Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Chrome web browsers. When prompted, simply select which web browser you want to sync your Safari bookmarks and data with.

When the iCloud Keychain feature is turned on (on each of your iOS mobile devices and Macs), any time you enter a username and password for a website you visit, Safari stores that information and syncs it with your personal iCloud account. Then, any time you revisit that website on any of your Macs or iOS mobile devices that are linked to the same iCloud account, your username and password for that website are remembered and you're automatically logged in.

 Note
iCloud Keychain also remembers credit card information you use when making online purchases from a website. All usernames, passwords, and credit card details are stored using 256-bit AES encryption to maintain security.


 Tip
Safari supports Apple Pay and enables you to make online purchases when you visit participating websites. Instead of manually entering your credit card details when making an online purchase, select the Apple Pay option, and then place your finger on the Touch ID sensor to confirm the purchase (see Figure 13.13).
To set up this feature, launch Settings, tap the Wallet & Apple Pay option, and then tap the Add Credit or Debit Card option to link one or more of your credit or debit cards to your Apple Pay account.
Be sure to select your default shipping address, email address, and phone number to make the checkout process faster when shopping online.


FIGURE 13.13
Look for the Apple Pay button on the checkout screen when shopping online.
To turn on and begin using iCloud Keychain, launch Settings, tap your profile photo/username, and then tap the iCloud option. From the iCloud Control Panel, tap the Keychain option. Turn on the virtual switch for this feature. Follow the onscreen prompts that walk you through the feature's built-in security precautions.
Next, return to the main Settings menu and tap the Safari option. Tap the AutoFill option, and turn on the virtual switches associated with Use Contact Info, Names and Password, and/or Credit Cards. Also, tap the My Info option and select your own entry from your Contacts app database.

 Note
For your security, online banking, credit card, and financial websites do not support iCloud Keychain. When you visit these websites, Safari might remember your username but you must manually enter your password each time.

When using this feature, it's a good strategy to also activate the Passcode Lock feature of your iOS mobile device to prevent unauthorized people from accessing personal information when using your iPhone or iPad to surf the Web.
Using iCloud Keychain, you no longer need to remember the unique usernames and passwords that you associate with each of the websites you frequently visit. Plus, to make your web surfing experience even more secure, you can use the built-in Password Generator feature to create highly secure passwords for you (which the web browser then remembers).
Launching Your Favorite Websites via Home Screen Icons
A time-saving alternative to creating bookmarks for your most frequented websites is to create a Home screen shortcut icon for each of these websites. When you do this, an icon for that website is displayed on your device's Home screen. When you tap it, Safari launches and the selected website automatically loads.
To create a Home screen icon, surf to one of your favorite websites. After it loads, tap the Share icon, and then tap the Add to Home Screen button.
The Add to Home window appears. It displays a thumbnail image of the website you're visiting and enables you to enter the title for the website (which is displayed below the icon on your device's Home screen). Next, tap the Add option in the upper-right corner of the window.
After you create a Home screen icon for a web page, it can be treated like any other app icon. You can move the icon around on the Home screen, add it to a folder, or delete it from the Home screen.

 Tip
Without manually launching Safari, it's possible to look up and access web content using the Spotlight Search feature built in to iOS 11. Plus, Siri is also fully compatible with Safari. Activate Siri and use verbal commands like, "Launch Safari," "Search the web for [topic]," or "Google [topic]." It's also possible to ask a question and have Siri search the Web for the answer.

Transforming Your iPhone into a Personal Wi-Fi Hotspot
Your iPhone can use a 4G (LTE) cellular data connection to communicate with the Internet. If you have other devices, such as a Wi-Fi Only iPad or another device that uses only Wi-Fi to access the Internet, you can transform your iPhone into a personal (password-protected) Wi-Fi hotspot when public Wi-Fi is not available. When you do this, your iPhone uses its cellular data connection to access the Internet and creates a Wi-Fi hotspot that your other Wi-Fi-only devices can connect to.

 Note
Not all cellular service providers offer this feature. With some providers that do offer the feature, you need to pay extra to have this feature added to your service plan.

If your cellular data provider supports allowing your iPhone to serve as a personal Wi-Fi hotspot, turn on this feature on your iPhone by launching Settings and tapping Personal Hotspot. Turn on the virtual switch associated with Personal Hotspot, and then tap the Wi-Fi Password option to create a custom password you'll use from your other Wi-Fi-only devices to access the Wi-Fi hotspot.
When the hotspot feature is active, access one or more of your Wi-Fi only devices, turn on the Wi-Fi-feature, and select your iPhone's Wi-Fi network (see Figure 13.14). When prompted, enter the Wi-Fi password you created on your iPhone.

FIGURE 13.14
This Wi-Fi Only iPad Pro can connect to the Wi-Fi network being created by the iPhone called Jason R. Rich's iPhone 7 Plus.
The personal Wi-Fi hotspot network name that's used will be the name given to your iPhone. To change the iPhone's name, launch Settings, tap General, tap About, and then tap Name. Enter a name for your iPhone, such as "Jason R. Rich's iPhone 7 Plus."

 Tip
There are three ways to connect a Wi-Fi-only device to your iPhone to use the personal hotspot feature. You can wirelessly link both devices via Wi-Fi, connect a computer with your iPhone wirelessly via Bluetooth, or use the USB cable that came with your iPhone. Plug the USB port end of the cable into the USB port of your computer, and plug the Lightning port end of the cable to the bottom of your iPhone.


 Caution
Using the Personal Hotspot feature of your iPhone quickly depletes the smartphone's battery, so if possible, use this feature when your iPhone is connected to an external power source.
If you have a monthly cellular data usage associated with your data plan from your cellular service provider, using the Personal Hotspot feature consumes some of this allocation. In some cases, even if you have an unlimited cellular data plan, the cellular service provider caps how much data can be used by a personal hotspot, or the provider might limit the number of devices that can link to the personal hotspot simultaneously.


 Caution
Do not use the Personal Hotspot feature while traveling overseas, unless you have an unlimited international cellular data plan. Otherwise, you'll be charged outrageously high international roaming fees.
To avoid these charges, you can purchase and install a local (pre-paid) SIM chip that works in the country you're visiting, or you can use a standalone personal Wi-Fi hotspot device that supports multiple devices, including your iPhone, iPad, or computer. Of course, you can also rely exclusively on public Wi-Fi hotspots to acquire Internet access.
An example of a standalone personal hotspot device that is designed specifically for international travelers is available from SkyRoam (www.skyroam.com). Once you purchase the device (for less than $100), you prepay a flat fee of $8.00 or $9.00 per day for unlimited Internet access in more than 100 countries.








14. Use Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, and Notes

In this Chapter
 Getting acquainted with the Calendar, Contacts, and Reminders apps
 Creating and collaborating with others using the Notes app
 Syncing your app data across all your devices and iCloud

Calendars, Contacts, Reminders, and Notes are four core apps that come preinstalled with iOS 11. Each of these apps provides tremendous functionality to iPhone and iPad users.

 Note
The Calendar app is used to manage your schedule. The Contacts app is designed to maintain a personal database of your contacts. Notes is a note-taking and content gathering/organizing tool, and Reminders is a list-management app that enables you to easily create to-do lists, shopping lists, or other itemized lists that you need to organize, manage, and remember.

These apps have some common key functionality:
 Each app can be set up to automatically sync its data with iCloud, so the content automatically syncs with all your iOS mobile devices and Macs that are connected to that account.
 These apps are designed to seamlessly share app-specific data with each other (as well as other apps). For example, the Mail or Maps app can easily look up an email address or physical address of someone in your Contacts database.
 A version of Calendars, Contacts, Notes, and Reminders is also part of the macOS High Sierra operating system, meaning that fully compatible versions of these apps come preinstalled on all Macs.
 Each of these apps is also available in an online edition. When the apps are set up to sync with iCloud, you're able to use any computer or mobile device's web browser to visit www.iCloud.com to access your data. So, if you forget your iPhone at home and it contains your schedule for the day (in the Calendar app), you can still access this information remotely from anywhere.
 You can set up the Calendar and Reminders apps so alerts, alarms, and notifications related to your schedule and lists are consistently displayed as part of the Today or Recent screen via the Notification Center. (To have the information appear on the Today screen in Notification Center, set up and use the app-specific widget. App-specific alerts, alarms, and notifications are otherwise displayed in Notification Center's Recent screen.)

 Note
The features and functions offered by the Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, and Notes apps are virtually identical on all iOS mobile devices, as well as on the Mac. However, due to varying screen sizes, the location of specific command icons, options, and menus often varies. After you get to know how each app works in general, you can easily switch between the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and the iCloud.com online-based versions of these apps without confusion.

Customizing Each App in iOS 11
With iOS 11, many options are offered within Settings for customizing your experience using the Contacts, Calendar, Reminders, and Notes apps. Launch Settings, and tap the app name to view that app's submenu. Then, adjust each option to customize your experience using that app.
Elsewhere in Settings, you can adjust additional app-specific options related to Contacts, Calendar, Reminders, and Notes. For example:
 To adjust iCloud-specific settings related to these apps, launch Settings, tap your username/profile photo, and then tap the iCloud option. Turn on or off the virtual switch associated with each app (see Figure 14.1) to activate or deactivate iCloud data syncing functionality for with that app.

FIGURE 14.1
The iCloud Control Panel within Settings is used to set up compatible apps to sync app-specific data with your iCloud account.
 To adjust Notification-related options pertaining to these apps, launch Settings and tap the Notifications option. Then scroll down and tap the app name.
 To adjust Location Services options pertaining to these apps, launch Settings, and then tap the Privacy option. Turn on the master Location Services option, and then from the Location Services submenu, tap the app name.
 To adjust which third-party apps have access to information stored in your Contacts database or in Calendar, Reminders, or Notes, tap Settings, select the Privacy option, and then tap each app name in the Privacy submenu.
 To adjust sounds related to each of these apps, launch Settings, tap the Sound option, and then tap the submenu option related to an app-specific setting. For example, tap Calendar Alerts or Reminder Alerts to select the sound you'll hear each time the Calendar or Reminders app generates an alert or alarm.
 To adjust Siri and Spotlight Search-related functionality related to these four apps, launch Settings, tap the Siri & Search option, scroll down, and tap each app's listing.

 What's New
To add accessibility to the Notes app from the redesigned Control Center, launch Settings, tap the Control Center option, tap Customize Controls, and then from below the More Controls option, tap the + icon associated with Notes.
When the Notes option is listed below the Include heading, use the Notes app's corresponding Move icon to reposition the Notes app icon within the Control Center. Figure 14.2 shows the Notes app displayed within the Control Center on an iPhone.
Of course, like any other app, you can also launch the Notes app from the Home screen, from the Dock, from Notification Center (if a Notes-specific alert, alarm, or notification is listed), or from the App Switcher. You can also say, "Hey Siri, launch the Notes app."


FIGURE 14.2
Add Notes to the Control Center for an additional way to quickly launch the app.
Syncing App-Specific Data with Online-Based Apps
To sync your Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, or Notes data with iCloud, Yahoo!, Google, or Microsoft Exchange-compatible software, you need to make a one-time change in Settings for each of your iOS mobile devices, and also on each of your Macs.
Launch Settings, tap your username/profile photo, tap the iCloud option, and then turn the virtual switch associated with Calendar, Contacts, Notes, or Reminders. On a Mac, launch System Preferences, click the iCloud icon, and then add a check mark to the listings for each app.

 Note
By setting up app-specific data syncing for Contacts, Calendar, Notes, and Reminders via iCloud, your data is automatically imported into the online version of these apps that are available via iCloud.com.


 Caution
Unless the iCloud menu from within Settings on each of your iOS mobile devices and the iCloud menu on your Mac(s) is set up the same way—with the same apps turned on—the apps won't sync data correctly across all of your computers and mobile devices.

To set up these four apps to sync with other services, launch Settings, tap the Accounts & Passwords option, and then tap the Add Account option.
From the Add Account submenu, choose the type of account you want to set up (iCloud, Exchange, Google, Yahoo!, AOL, Outlook.com, or Other). Tap the Other option if you use a scheduling, contact management, list management, or note-taking software that's not otherwise listed.
When prompted, provide your log in information for the account you're syncing to. For example, if you want the apps to sync with your Google account, select Google, sign in with the email address associated with your Google account (or your phone number), and then provide your Google account password when prompted.
From the Gmail submenu, turn on the virtual switches associated with Contacts, Calendars, and Notes, if you want your Google account to automatically sync app-specific content with these three apps.

 Note
Depending on the type of account you're setting up your iPhone or iPad to sync with, options for syncing all four apps (Contacts, Calendar, Notes, and Reminders) might not be offered.


 What's New
To automatically sync your Contacts database with your Facebook account, assuming you have your Facebook account linked with your iOS mobile device already, launch Settings, tap the Facebook option, and from the Facebook submenu (see Figure 14.3), turn on the virtual switch associated with Contacts.
Do the same for your Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Instagram, Skype, and other social media accounts that are listed within the Settings menu.


FIGURE 14.3
From the Facebook submenu within Settings, turn on the virtual switch for the Contacts app so your contacts database is shared with your Facebook account.
Getting Acquainted with the Calendar App
With its multiple viewing options for keeping track of the scheduling information stored in it, the Calendar app is a highly customizable scheduling tool. In the Calendar app, any appointment, meeting, activity, or entry that you create and store within the app is referred to as an event.
Because the Calendar app can manage and display multiple color-coded calendars at once, when you create a new event, be sure to choose which calendar it gets stored in. For example, you can maintain separate calendars for Work, Personal, Family, and Travel.
In Calendar, you can also share some or all of your schedule information with colleagues and maintain several separate, color-coded calendars to keep personal and work-related responsibilities—as well as individual projects—listed separately, while still being able to view them on the same screen.

 Tip
It's easier than ever to create an event, such as a meeting, and invite one or more people to it via email from within the Calendar app. The Calendar app keeps track of RSVPs automatically.
To invite people to a single event, as you're creating or editing an event from within the Calendar app, tap Invitees. In the To field, enter the email address for each person you want to invite. (If the invitee is already in your Contacts database, you can simply type that person's name, and the Calendar app inserts the email address automatically.)
The people invited to an event (and those who RSVP) are displayed as part of the event listing within the Calendar app.
Meanwhile, if you receive an email invite from someone else, when you accept the invitation, the event details are added to your schedule in the Calendar app.


 Tip
When you turn on iCloud's Family Sharing feature, a separate color-coded calendar, labeled Family, is created by the Calendar app. This calendar can be accessed by up to five other family members. Thus, your teens can add details about their after-school activities, sports practices, or drama rehearsals, and weekend family events can be posted for all to see. Plus, everyone can keep tabs on upcoming vacation dates.
Although the Family calendar data is viewable by anyone with Family Sharing access, events stored in other calendars remain private, or viewable only by people you invite to see the information.
Read more about iCloud Family Sharing in Chapter 7, "Use iCloud and the Files App."

Controlling the Calendar View
After you launch the Calendar app, choose which viewing perspective you'd like to see. Regardless of which view you're using, tap the Today option to immediately jump to the current date on the calendar. The current date is always highlighted with a red dot.

 Tip
From the Home screen of an iPhone that has 3D Touch capabilities, press and hold your finger on the Calendar app icon to show your next upcoming appointment (event), plus access a shortcut for creating a new event. Tap + Add Event to quickly launch the Calendar app and access the New Event screen.


 Tip
If event-related information is displayed in an incoming email, such as an upcoming airline flight reservation or restaurant reservation, the Mail app displays an Add Event banner near the top of the email. Tap this banner (which includes a tiny Calendar app icon) to import the event details from the body of the incoming email directly into the Calendar app as a new event.

On the iPhone and iPad, the Calendar app opens on the last view option that you were using previously. On the iPad, switching between Calendar views is as easy as tapping the Day, Week, Month, or Year tab displayed at the top center of the Calendar app's screen. On the iPhone, you also have access to a detailed Day, Week, Month, or Year view, as well as a Listing view, which works with the Month or Day view.

 Tip
When the Month calendar view is selected on an iPhone, tap the Listing icon (near the top-right corner of the screen) to display a list of events for the current day (or the day you select). This information is displayed below the month view of the calendar.
When you select the Day view in the Calendar app, the Listing icon shows you all your appointments, hour-by-hour, in a scrollable format that enables you to quickly see your schedule for the previous or upcoming days in addition to the currently selected day.

The Year view shows mini calendars for the entire year. To switch from the Year view to the Month view, tap any month in the Year view.
From the Month view, switch to the Week view by rotating your iPhone from portrait to landscape mode. In other words, hold your smartphone sideways. Also from the Month view, to switch to the Day view, tap a day displayed in the calendar. From the Month view, any day that displays a gray dot in it has event details associated with it.

 Tip
On the iPhone, from the Month or Day view, tap the Listing icon to view a more detailed and scrollable listing for the selected day's events.

The Year, Month, Week, and Day views in the iPhone version of the Calendar app can be switched in a hierarchical order. If you're in the Day view, for example, you can switch back to the Month view by tapping the Back icon (a left-pointing arrow), which is in the top-left corner of the screen.
Whether you're using the Calendar app on an iPhone or iPad, your Calendar view options include the views described in the following sections.
Day View
This view displays your events individually, based on the time each event is scheduled. When using the iPad version of the app, this information is displayed on a split screen. On the left is an hour-by-hour summary of your day, and on the right is a synopsis of the events for that day.

 Note
On the iPhone, the Day view (shown in Figure 14.4) displays a week's worth of calendar dates near the top of the screen. Below that, the selected date is displayed, followed by an hour-by-hour rundown of your events.
On the iPad, the Day display is split into two sections. The selected date, along with a week's worth of calendar dates, is displayed at the top of the screen, followed by a summary listing of appointments and events displayed on the left side of the screen. When you tap an event, details about that selected appointment are displayed on the right side of the screen.

Use the Day view of the Calendar app to see a detailed outline of scheduled events for a single day. Swipe your finger to scroll up or down to see an hour-by-hour summary of that day's schedule.
Swipe right or left along the week's worth of calendar days to see upcoming or past dates and to view another day's schedule. Tap a specific day to switch to that date's Day view.

FIGURE 14.4
The Day view of the Calendar app lets you see your schedule broken down one day at a time in one-hour increments.

 Tip
To quickly find an event, tap the Search icon, and then enter any relevant text to help you find the item you're looking for that's stored in the Calendar app. You can also do this with Spotlight Search, or you can make a verbal request using Siri. In the Search field, enter a date, time, name, business, meeting location, or other pertinent information. Tap a search result to view that event listing in the Calendar app.


 Tip
Displayed in the bottom-right corner of the Calendar screen is the Inbox option (refer to Figure 14.4). If there's a number within parentheses next to the word Inbox, one or more potential event invitations have been sent to you from other people. Tap the Inbox option to view a list of events found in other apps, as well as event invitations from others. Tap Add to Calendar or Ignore for each one.

Week View
The Week view uses a grid format to display the days of the week along the top of the screen and time intervals along the left side of the screen. With this view, you're given an overview of all events scheduled during a particular week (Sunday through Saturday).
Scroll along the dates displayed near the top of the screen to quickly view your schedule for past or future weeks. On an iPhone, to access the Week view, you need to turn your device sideways to view it in landscape mode.

 Tip
To fine-tune any Calendar app view, tap the Calendars option near the bottom center of the screen. A listing of the separate color-coded calendars that the Calendar app is managing is displayed. Tap a listing to add or remove it from the current Calendar view.
When you remove a calendar from the calendar view, this does not delete any data; it simply hides the events that are stored in that particular calendar from the display.

Month View
This view enables you to see a month's worth of events at a time. On the iPhone, tap any single day to immediately switch to the Day view and review a detailed summary of events slated for that day. From the Month view, use your finger to scroll up or down to look at past or future months. On the iPad, use the Day, Week, Month, or Year tabs, located at the top of the screen, to switch Calendar views.
Year View
The Year view enables you to look at 12 mini calendars, with minimal detail displayed.
Entering a New Event
Regardless of which calendar view you're using, follow these steps to enter a new event:
1. Tap the New Event (+) icon in the upper-right corner of the screen. This causes a New Event window to be displayed (see Figure 14.5).
2. The first field in the New Event window is labeled Title. Using the virtual keyboard, enter a title for the event.
3. If a location is associated with the event, tap the Location field, and enter an address or location. Entering information into the Location field is optional. You can be as detailed as you want when entering information into this field.

FIGURE 14.5
Add a new event to the Calendar app from the New Event screen.

 Tip
Many apps integrate and share scheduling information with the Calendar app. If you ask Siri a question related to an event's location, such as "Where is my next meeting?" or "How do I get to my next appointment?" the event's location information is used.


 Note
Many of the fields in the New Event screen are optional; in other words, only fill in the fields that are relevant to the new event you're creating. However, the more information you include, the more useful Maps, Siri, Spotlight Search, and potentially other apps will be later when you want to refer to event information.

4. If the event lasts for the entire day, turn on the All-Day virtual switch; otherwise, to set the time and date the event begins, tap the Starts field. Use the scrolling Date, Hour, Minute, and AM/PM dials to select the start time for your event.
5. After entering the start time, scroll down and tap the Ends option, and again use the scrolling Date, Hour, Minute, and AM/PM dials to select the end time for your event.

 Note
If the new event you're creating repeats every day, every week, every two weeks, every month, or every year, tap the Repeat option, and choose the appropriate time interval. The default for this option is Never, meaning that it is a nonrepeating, one-time-only event.

6. Turn on the virtual switch associated with the Travel Time option to add between five minutes and two hours of travel time to that event by tapping one of the listed options. So, if this event turns out to be one hour away from your previous event scheduled on the same day, one hour's worth of travel time can be added to your schedule. However, if you have a specific location entered in the Location field, your iPhone or iPad can calculate the travel time from wherever you happen to be prior to that event.

 Tip
Because the Maps app tracks real-time traffic conditions and integrates with the Calendar app, you're notified when you need to leave for your next appointment based on the calculated travel time that takes into account current traffic. For this to work, a detailed address for the event must be included in the Location field. You also need to provide a starting location and the mode of transportation you'll be using—driving, walking (when applicable), or public transportation. The Travel Time feature for the event must be turned on.

7. If you're managing several calendars in the Calendar app, tap the Calendar option to select in which calendar the new event will be placed. The default calendar is called Home, but you can change this in Settings.
8. Use the Invitees option to invite one or more other people to the event being created.
9. To set an audible alarm for the event, tap the Alert option. The Event Alert window temporarily replaces the Add Event screen. In the Event Alert window, tap the option for how much advance notice you want before the scheduled event. Your options include None, At Time of Event, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 1 day, 2 days, or 1 week before the event. Once you tap a selection, you are returned to the Add Event screen.

 Tip
A Second Alert option is also available from the Add Event screen. If you want to add a secondary alarm to this event, tap the Second Alert option and then set it.

10. Tap the Show As option to classify how you want an event to appear in your calendar. The default option is Busy. This is information others can see if you opt to share specific calendars with other people.
11. Tap the URL field to add a website address associated with the event.
12. Tap the Notes field to add text-based notes you want to associate with the new event. You can also paste content from other apps into the Notes field.
13. Tap Add to save the event. If you don't tap Add, your event information won't be saved. Tap the Cancel icon to exit without saving any new information.

 Note
As soon as you create a new event, that information syncs with your iCloud account and all other computers and mobile devices that you have linked to that account. If you have the Calendar app set up to sync with another scheduling app or online service, your new data syncs with that app.
This near-instant data synchronization also applies if you delete an event.

Using Siri to Enter New Events
Instead of manually entering event information into your iPhone or iPad using the virtual keyboard, or importing/syncing scheduling data from another computer or device, you always have the option to use Siri. Refer to Chapter 4, "Say It and Make It So Using Siri," for more information.

 Tip
Using Siri, say something like, "When is my next appointment with [name]?" You can also say, "Show me my schedule for Wednesday" or ask, "What's on my calendar for July 7?" to quickly find an event. If you enter information into the Location field as you're creating events, you can later ask Siri, "Where is my next meeting?"

Viewing Individual Appointment Details
From any view in the Calendar app, tap an individual event to display the details related to it. When you tap a single event listing, a new Event Details screen opens (see Figure 14.6). Tap the Edit option to modify any aspect of the event listing, such as its title, location, start/end time, alert, invitees, or notes.
At the bottom of an event listing (scroll down), a map showing the event's location is provided if the Location field has been filled in. Tap this map to launch the Maps app and get detailed, turn-by-turn directions to that event from your current location.

FIGURE 14.6
Detailed information about each event stored in the Calendar app can easily be viewed.
To delete an event entry entirely, tap the red-and-white Delete Event option at the bottom of the Edit window.

 Tip
The Calendar app works with several other apps, including Contacts and Notification Center. For example, in Contacts, you can enter someone's birthday into an entry, and that information can automatically be displayed in the Calendar app on a separate Birthdays calendar.
To display birthday listings in Calendar, tap the Calendars button displayed near the bottom center of the screen in the Calendar app, and then tap the Birthdays option to add a check mark to that selection. All recurring birthdays stored in Contacts appear in Calendar.


 Note
There are many ways to customize the Calendar app beyond choosing between the various calendar views. For example, you can set audible alerts or use onscreen alerts and banners to remind you of events. You can also display Calendar-related information in the Notification Center or on the Lock screen.
Launch Settings and tap the Calendar option to view the Calendar submenu to make adjustments to the way the Calendar app functions.


 Caution
If you're traveling in another time zone but enter a new event that will take place in the future after you return to your home time zone, when entering the Start time for the new event, be sure to tap the Time Zone option and select your home time zone. Otherwise, the time you enter for the new event remains in the time zone you're in and doesn't automatically adjust when you return home.

Using the Contacts App to Keep Track of People and Companies
The Contacts app stores information pertaining to the people in your life, as well as companies you do business with.

 Note
Contacts is a powerful and customizable contact management database that works with many other apps that also came preinstalled on your iPhone or iPad—including Mail, Calendar, Safari, FaceTime, and Maps—as well as optional apps, like the official Facebook and Twitter apps. It's also fully compatible with Siri and Spotlight Search, along with a growing selection of optional third-party apps.

Your personal contacts database might include people you work with, customers, clients, family members, people from your community with whom you interact (doctors, hairstylist, barber, dry cleaners, and so on), your real-world friends, and your online friends from Facebook, for example.

 Tip
When you're using an iPhone with 3D Touch capabilities, from the Home screen, press and hold your finger on the Contacts app icon to view a menu that enables you to see the most recent contacts you've been in communication with, as well as quickly create a new contact entry or view your own entry in the Contacts database (which is referred to as My Info).


 Tip
Be sure to create an entry for yourself in your Contacts database and populate it with as much information as possible, because many other apps will access this information in the future for a variety of reasons.


 Note
As you receive incoming emails, if the sender includes their details in their email and this information is not stored in your Contacts app already, you have the ability to add it. This is also true if the sender updates their contact information and it doesn't match what's stored in the Contacts app. In the Mail app, as you're reading the email, you're given the opportunity to create a new contact or update the existing contact's entry in the Contacts app.
For this feature to work, launch Settings, tap the Contacts option, tap Siri & Search, and then turn on the virtual switch associated with the Find Contacts in Other Apps option.

Determining What Information to Store
Chances are, the contacts database that you rely on at your office or on your computer at home can be synced with your iPhone or iPad, and made available to you using the Contacts app. Of course, Contacts can also be used as a standalone app, enabling you to enter new contact entries as you meet people and need to keep track of details about them using your iOS mobile devices.
The information you maintain in your Contacts database is highly customizable, which means you can keep track of only the information you want or need. For example, in each contact entry, you can store a vast amount of information about a person or company, including multiple phone numbers, addresses, and email addresses. Each field is labeled for easy reference. A Contact entry can include someone's home, work, and cell phone numbers, for example. You can also customize your contacts database to include additional information, such as each contact's photo, as well as detailed and freeform notes related to a contact.
When you're using the Contacts app, your entire contacts database is instantly searchable using data from any field in the database, so even if you have a database containing thousands of entries, you can always find a person or company in a matter of seconds, using a wide range of search criteria. Use the Search field in the Contacts app, the Spotlight Search feature, or Siri to find what you're looking for.
Integrating the Contacts App with Other Apps
After your contacts database has been populated with entries, Contacts works with many other apps on your iPhone or iPad. Here are just a few popular examples:
 When you compose a new email message in Mail, begin typing someone's full name or email address in the To field. If that person's contact information is already stored in Contacts, the relevant email address automatically displays in the email's To field.
 If you're planning a trip to visit a contact, pull up someone's address from your Contacts database, and then quickly obtain driving directions to the person's home or work location from the Maps app. Within the Maps app enter someone's name (or a company name) into the Search field and then tap their displayed address.
 Activate Siri and request directions to any person or company with an entry stored in your Contacts database. For example, activate Siri and say, "How do I get to John Doe's house from here?"
 If you include each person's birthday in your Contacts database, that information can automatically be displayed in the Calendar app and be set up to remind you (in advance) to send a card or gift.
 As you're creating each Contacts entry, include a photo of that person—by activating the Camera app from the Contacts app to snap a photo, by using a photo stored in the Photos app that you link to the entry, or by acquiring profile photos from social media accounts.
 When using FaceTime, create a Favorites list of people you often engage in video calls with, compiled from entries in your Contacts database.
 From the Messages app, access your Contacts database when filling in the To field as you compose new text messages to be sent via iMessage, text message, or instant message. This means that you can simply type the person's name in the To field, as opposed to their cell phone number or iMessage username.
 If you're active on Facebook, you have the option of adding each contact's Facebook username to their Contacts entry. To turn on this feature, from Settings, tap Contacts, tap Siri & Search, and then turn on the virtual switch associated with Find Contacts in Other Apps. Next, return to the main Settings menu, tap Facebook, and turn on the virtual switch associated with Contacts. When you turn on this feature, the Contacts app automatically downloads each entry's Facebook profile picture and inserts it into your Contacts database. This also works with other social media services that are listed within the Settings menu, such as Twitter and Instagram.
When you first launch the Contacts app, its related database is empty; however, you can create and build your database in two ways:
 Sync the Contacts app with your primary contact management application on your computer, network, or online (cloud)-based service, such as iCloud or Microsoft Outlook.
 Manually enter contact information directly into the Contacts app.

 Note
The Contacts app that comes preinstalled with iOS 11 is 100 percent compatible with and extremely similar to the Contacts app that comes bundled with OS X Yosemite, OS X El Capitan, macOS Sierra, or macOS High Sierra on the Mac. Be sure to set up each version of the app to sync with each other via iCloud, so you always have access to your entire Contacts database.

Viewing Your Contacts
On the iPhone, the Contacts screen displays an alphabetical listing of all entries in your Contacts database. Along the right side of the screen are alphabetic tabs, and a Search field is located near the top of the screen.

 Note
If you've used the Contacts app previously and it has been running in the background, the last contact entry you viewed is displayed when you relaunch the app.

On the iPad, near the middle of the screen are alphabetic tabs. A listing of all contacts is displayed along the left side of the screen. When a contact entry is selected, it is displayed on the right side of the screen. Displayed in the top-left corner is a Search field. Use it to find any content stored in the Contacts app. Alternatively, use the Spotlight Search feature or Siri to quickly locate information stored in this app.

 Tip
Tap the Search field to quickly find a particular entry by entering any keyword associated with an entry, such as a first or last name, city, state, job title, or company name. Any content in your Contacts database is searchable from this Search field.
You can also tap a letter tab on the screen to see all entries "filed" under that letter by a contact's last name, first name, or company name, depending on how you set up the Contacts app within Settings.

To see the complete listing for a particular entry, tap its listing from the Contacts screen (iPhone) or Contacts listing (iPad). On the iPhone, a new screen shows the specific contact's information (see Figure 14.7). On the iPad, the selected contact listing is displayed on the right side of the screen.

FIGURE 14.7
A sample contact entry from the Contacts app displayed on an iPhone.

 Tip
Based on the information stored in the Contacts database about a particular person, when you view a listing, displayed just below a person or company's name and photo (if applicable) are up to four active icons: Message, Call, FaceTime (Video), and Mail. The Mail app icon is labeled Mail, Work, or Home, based on how you labeled the email address within the Contacts database.
Tap any of these icons to quickly initiate contact with that person using the method that corresponds to the icon (refer to Figure 14.7).
If an entry does not contain information related to a phone number, iMessage username (or cell phone number), FaceTime (Video) username, or email address, these icons aren't active for that entry.

Creating a New Contacts Entry
To create a new Contacts entry, tap the New Contact (+) icon. The New Contact screen opens.

 Note
As you're creating each Contacts entry, fill in whichever fields you want. You can always edit a contact entry later to include additional information. The more information you enter, however, the more data the Contacts app is able to share with Siri and other apps running on your mobile device.

The New Contact screen displays several empty fields related to the entry, starting with the First Name field (shown in Figure 14.8).
Some fields, including Phone, Email, and Mailing Address, enable you to input multiple listings, one at a time. So you can include someone's home phone, work phone, and mobile phone (iPhone) numbers in the entry, for example. Likewise, you can include multiple email addresses, and/or a home address and work address for an individual.

 Tip
One of the available fields when creating a new Contact entry is labeled Add Related Name. Use this field to add the names of your contact's mother, father, parent, brother, sister, child, friend, spouse, partner, assistant, manager, or other. You can also add your own titles for the Related People field.


FIGURE 14.8
From this New Contact screen, create a new contact and include as much information pertaining to that person or company as you want.

 Tip
You can change the label associated with certain fields (which are displayed in blue) by tapping the field label itself. This reveals a Label menu that offers selectable options for that field. For example, the Label options for the Add Phone field include Home, Work, iPhone, Mobile, Main, Home Fax, Work Fax, Pager, and Other.
When creating or editing contacts, it's important to associate the correct labels with phone numbers, email addresses, and address data. For each phone number you add to a contact's entry, for example, it can include a Home, Work, Mobile, iPhone, or Other label (among others). For many iOS 11 functions that use data from your Contacts database to work correctly (including Siri), it's important that you properly label content you add to each Contacts entry.
If you need to add a label that's not listed by default, tap Add Custom Label at the bottom of the Label window to create your own label. Tap the label title of your choice. A check mark appears next to it, and you are returned to the New Contact screen.

At the bottom of the New Contact screen is the Add Field option. Tap it to reveal a menu containing a handful of additional fields you can add to individual Contacts entries as applicable.

 Note
If there's a field displayed that you don't want to use or display, simply leave it blank as you're creating or editing a Contacts entry.

Each time you add a new mailing address to a contact's entry from within the New Contact screen, the Address field expands to include a Street, City, State, ZIP, and Country field.
After you have filled in all the fields for a particular entry, tap Done. Your new entry is saved and added to your contacts database. It is then synced with your other computers and mobile devices.
Adding a Photo to a Contacts Entry
To the immediate left of the First Name field is a circle that says Add Photo. When you tap this field, a submenu with two options—Take Photo and Choose Photo—is displayed. If the entry already has a photo associated with it, the Edit Photo and Delete Photo options are also displayed. (You're able to do this only when editing a Contact entry.)
Tap Take Photo to launch the Camera app from within the Contacts app and snap a photo to be linked to the Contacts entry you're creating. Alternatively, tap the Choose Photo option. In this case, the Photos app launches so that you can choose any digital image that's currently stored on your iOS mobile device or iCloud account. When you tap the photo of your choice, a Choose a Photo window displays on the Contacts screen, enabling you to move and scale the image.

 Tip
As you're previewing the image, use a pinch or reverse-pinch finger motion to zoom in or out, and then hold your finger down on the image and reposition it within the frame.

After cropping or adjusting the selected photo, tap Choose to link the photo with that contact's entry. The photo you link with an entry is displayed by other apps, like Mail, Messages, and FaceTime, that use the Contacts app data.

 Tip
If you use an iPhone, or FaceTime on your iPhone or iPad, from the Ringtone option in the New Contact screen, select the specific ringtone you will hear each time that particular contact calls you. Your iPhone or iPad has many preinstalled ringtones. From the iTunes Store, you can purchase and download thousands of additional ringtones.
To do this, as you're creating or editing an entry, tap Ringtone, and then tap the Tone Store option. An Internet connection is required to find and purchase additional ringtones.


 What's New
If a particular contact entry represents someone who is extremely important to you, and you want to be alerted if that person contacts you, even if you have the Do Not Disturb feature turned on, be sure to turn on the Emergency Bypass feature.
As you're creating or editing an entry, tap Ringtone and then turn on the virtual switch associated with the Emergency Bypass option.

Editing or Deleting a Contact
To edit a contact, tap its listing from the Contacts screen to display the contact details, and then tap the Edit option. Tap any field to modify it. Delete a field by tapping the red-and-white - icon associated with it, and then tap the Delete button that appears to the right of the entry.
You can also add new fields in an entry by tapping any of the green-and-white + icons and then choosing the type of field you want to add.
When you're finished editing a Contacts entry, tap Done.

 Tip
To delete an entire entry from your Contacts database, as you're editing a contact entry and looking at the Contact screen for that entry, scroll down to the bottom of it, and tap Delete Contact.
Keep in mind that if you have your Contacts database syncing with iCloud or another contacts database, the contact you delete is removed from all your computers and devices that are connected to the Internet within seconds. There is no "undo" option.

Sharing Contact Entries
From the main Contacts screen that displays your list of contact entries, tap the contact listing you want to share. When the contact's entry is displayed, tap Share Contact. Next, choose to share the contact's details with someone else via AirDrop, text/instant message (via the Message app), or email (via the Mail app). For example, if you choose the Mail or Message option, the entire Contacts entry you selected (stored in .vcf format) is automatically embedded in an outgoing email or text/instant message. When you've filled in all the necessary fields, tap the Send icon. Upon doing this, you are returned to the Contacts app.

 What's New
Individual contact entries can be stored as stand-alone files within the new Files app so that later you can share these individual contact files. Access a Contacts entry and tap Share Contact and then tap Save to Files. Choose where you want to save the individual contact entry (in the industry-standard .vcf file format that can be imported into almost any other contacts database). Tap Add to export the entry. The original entry within the Contacts app remains intact.


 Caution
All information within the selected Contacts entry is shared, including notes, home phone numbers, personal email address, and birthday information. If you don't want to share all of an entry's content, do not use the Share Contact feature.

When the recipient receives your email or message and clicks the attachment (the .vcf file), it automatically is imported into their contact management application as a new entry, such as in the Contacts app running on their Mac, iPhone, or iPad.

 Tip
One way to share your current location with a contact is to view that contact's entry and tap the Share My Location option. You can then choose to share your location for one hour, until the end of the current day, or indefinitely.


 More Info
Here are some additional quick tips for using Contacts:
 If someone shares a Contacts entry with you via email, when you're viewing the incoming email on your iPhone or iPad, tap the email's attachment. The Contacts entry that was emailed is displayed in a window. Tap Create New Contact or Add to Existing Contact at the bottom of the window to incorporate this information into your Contacts database.
 As you're creating or editing a contact entry, in the Notes field, enter as much information pertaining to that contact as you want using freeform text. You can also paste content from another app into this field using the iOS's Select, Copy, and Paste commands, and using the App Switcher (or Multitasking mode on an iPad) to quickly switch between apps.
 Every field in a contact entry is interactive when you view it. If you tap a phone number, for example, you initiate a call to that person using the Phone app (iPhone). When you tap an address, you can obtain directions to that location via the Maps app or simply see the address displayed on a map. Tap an email address to compose and send an email to that person (via the Mail app). If multiple options are available, such as to call, FaceTime, or message someone from a phone number, a phone, FaceTime, or message icon is displayed.

Creating and Managing Lists with the Reminders App
Use the Reminders app to easily manage multiple lists simultaneously, and if necessary, add alarms and deadlines to individual list items. Plus, you can be reminded of responsibilities, tasks, or objectives exactly when you need this information, based on your geographic location or a predetermined time and date.
The Reminders app works nicely with Siri, Notification Center, and iCloud, which makes synchronizing your app-related data a straightforward process.

 Tip
When using an iPhone with 3D Touch capabilities, press and hold your finger on the app icon for the Reminders app while you're viewing the Home screen. You see a pop-up menu that enables you to quickly view the last note you worked with, create a new note, create a new checklist, capture and add a photo to a note, or create and add a sketch to a note.


 Tip
Reminders enables you to color-code lists. Tap the Edit button to the right of a list's title, and then tap the Color option. Seven different colors are displayed. Tap your selection. The list title is displayed in the selected color.

Because your iPhone or iPad has Location Services (GPS) capabilities, it always knows exactly where it is. Thus, you can create items in your to-do lists and associate one or more of them with an alarm that alerts you when you arrive at or depart from a particular geographic location, such as your home, office, or a particular store.
In addition, you can set an alarm to warn you of an upcoming deadline. This can be displayed on your device's screen in Notification Center or as separate alerts or banners, depending on how you have the Reminders app configured to work with the notifications options offered by your iPhone or iPad (which is adjustable from within Settings).
As you're setting up an alarm, if you want it to repeat every day, every week, every two weeks, every month, or every year, tap the Repeat option and make your selection. By default, the Never option is selected, meaning the alarm does not repeat.

 Tip
Just as you do for other apps, to set up Reminders to work with Notification Center and display onscreen alerts or banners, launch Settings, tap the Notifications option, and then tap the listing for the Reminders app. You can then customize the settings in the Reminders submenu screen.

Staying Up to Date with Reminders
When you launch Reminders on the iPad, the control center for this app appears on the left side of the screen. On the right side of the screen is a simulated sheet of lined paper.
If you've already been using the Reminders app on another iOS mobile device or Mac that's linked to the same iCloud account, all your lists synchronize with the iPhone or iPad you're currently using. Tap the Add List option in the bottom-left corner of the screen to create a new list from scratch.
When you create a new list from scratch, it is displayed on the right side of the screen using the temporary heading New List. Enter a title for the new list and then associate a color with it. Tap Done when you're ready to begin populating the list with items (as shown in Figure 14.9 on an iPad).
On the iPhone, to create a new list from scratch as you're looking at a list, place your finger near the center of the screen and swipe down. Next, tap the + icon to the right of the Search field. From the Create New screen, tap the Reminder or List option (see Figure 14.10).

FIGURE 14.9
Using Reminders, you can create and manage one or more lists. Each list can have as many separate items as you want.
Select the List option, and then type the name of the list and associate a color with it. Tap Done. You can then begin populating the list with items or repeat this process to create another list.
When viewing a list, tap an empty line of the simulated sheet of paper to add an item or tap the + icon at the bottom of the list. The virtual keyboard appears. Enter the item to be added to your to-do list (see Figure 14.11). Next, tap the Return key on the keyboard to enter another item.

FIGURE 14.10
Designate whether you're creating a reminder or a list.

FIGURE 14.11
Use the keyboard to add items to the list.
After creating a list item, tap its Info icon (the i icon to the right of Chips and Dip in Figure 14.11) to add an alarm, priority, or freeform notes to it.

 Tip
You have the option to set a priority with each list item. Your priority options include None, Low (!), Medium (!!), and High (!!!). (See Figure 14.12.) Although setting a priority for a list item displays that item with one, two, or three exclamation points to signify its importance, adjusting an item's priority does not automatically change its position in the list. You must manually rearrange the order of items on a list.
To do this, while looking at a list, tap the Edit button. Then place your finger on the Move icon (three horizontal lines) associated with the list item you want to move, and drag it up or down to the desired location in the list. Tap the Done button to save your changes.

When you're finished adding new list items, tap Done.

FIGURE 14.12
From the Details screen related to a list item, you can add an alarm, priority, or freeform notes.
To set a date-specific alarm, turn on the virtual switch associated with Remind Me on a Day option, and then tap the Alarm option to set the date and time.
To set a location-based alarm for that item, enter the Details screen by tapping the Info icon, and then turn on the virtual switch associated with the Remind Me at a Location option. Select a location, or enter an address, and then decide whether you want to be alerted when you arrive or when you leave that destination by tapping the When I Arrive or When I Leave tab.
Tap the Notes option to add freeform, text-based notes to it. Use the virtual keyboard to type notes or the Dictation feature to dictate notes. You can also copy and paste content from other apps into this field.

 Tip
One additional feature of the Reminders app is that you can display a separate list associated with each day on the calendar. When you use the Remind Me on a Day option, a date becomes associated with that item. Then, to review upcoming items related to a particular day tap the Scheduled option.


 Tip
At the bottom of every to-do list on the iPad is a Show Completed option. Tap this to display all items from the list you're viewing that have been moved to the Completed list.

Just like the Notes app, Reminders has a Sharing/Collaboration feature. To use it, tap the Edit option for a list you've created, and then tap the Sharing option. From the Share With screen, tap the Add Person option. In the To field, fill in the name or email address of one or more people, and then tap the Add option.
The person or people you opt to share a list with receive a notification, which they need to accept in their version of Reminders.
At that point, any of the collaborators can view or modify the list. The list owner (that is, the person who created and first shared the list) can later revoke access to the list by people who were previously invited.
To delete an item from a to-do list, swipe your finger from right to left across the item. A More button and a Delete button are displayed. Tap Delete to confirm your selection, or tap the More button to reveal the Info menu options. Remember, as soon as you make changes to a list item, if you have iCloud functionality turned on for the Reminders app and have access to the Internet, your additions, edits, or deletions automatically sync with iCloud.
Deleting and Reordering Entire To-Do Lists
If you want to delete an entire list, enter the list and tap the Edit button, and then tap the Delete List option displayed at the bottom of the screen. A warning pops up asking you to confirm the deletion.
On the iPad, another method is to locate the list you want to delete from the column on the left and swipe your finger from right to left across it. When the Delete button appears, tap it. You also have the option of tapping the Edit button, and then tapping the - icon associated with the list you want to erase. In Edit mode, you can change the order of your lists by placing your finger on the Move icon (three horizontal lines) that's associated with a list and dragging it up or down.
To exit Edit mode, tap Done.
Taking Notes or Gathering Information Using the Notes App
In addition to typed notes, the Notes app enables you to create, gather, and manage information, including photos, drawings, and handwritten content.
Use the Notes app to keep track of memos, brainstorm ideas, take notes in meetings or classes, gather content from other apps that you want to store in one place, or for anything else that you'd use a traditional notebook and writing instrument to document.

 Tip
Notes offers the optional ability to password-protect individual notes. Open a note and tap the Share icon. From the Share menu, tap Lock Note (see Figure 14.13). When prompted, create a password for the note, verify it by typing it again, and in the Hint field enter something that will help you remember the password.
Turn on the virtual switch associated with the Use Touch ID option so you'll be able to unlock notes by scanning your fingerprint using the Touch ID sensor that's built in to the Home button.
Keep in mind that if you forget the password you assign to a note, there is no way to recover or unlock it unless you're using a newer iPhone/iPad with a Touch ID sensor, and you previously turned on the Use Touch ID option.


FIGURE 14.13
Protect a note from being accessed by unauthorized people by adding a password lock to it.

 Tip
When using an iPhone with 3D Touch capabilities, from the Home screen, place and hold your finger on the app icon for Notes to open a pop-up window that enables you to view your most recently created or edited note, create a new note, create a new checklist, take a photo and store it in a note, or create a sketch to be added to a note.

In the Notes app are several command icons, which are displayed directly above the virtual keyboard (shown in Figure 14.14 on the iPhone).
On the iPad only, in the top-left corner of the keyboard tap the Undo/Redo icon to reveal additional command icons that enable you to use the Undo, Redo, or Copy/Paste commands.
On either the iPhone or iPad, tap the check mark icon to begin creating and formatting an interactive checklist in your note.

FIGURE 14.14
The Notes app displays special command icons directly above the virtual keyboard.
Tap the Aa formatting option to quickly format text that you're typing into the Notes app. You have the following formatting options:
 Switch between a Title, Heading, Body, or Monospaced formatted text
 Switch among any combination of bold, italic, underline, or strikethrough text
 Create a bulleted, numbered, or - formatted list
 Indent text left or right
Tap the + icon to access a menu with the following options:
 Scan Documents—Use your iPhone or iPad's rear-facing camera to take a photo of printed content. The Notes app scans the document and saves it within a Note. Figure 14.15 shows a document being scanned into the Notes app using this new feature. After the document is scanned, you can crop and straighten the page's edges as needed.

FIGURE 14.15
Using the Scan Documents tool, use your iPhone or iPad's rear-facing camera to scan paper-based documents directly into the Notes app.
 Take a Photo or Video—Use one of the cameras built into your iPhone or iPad to take a photo or shoot a video, and insert that content directly into a note.
 Photo Library—Access the Photo Library (within the Photos app) to import an image from your iPhone, iPad, or iCloud account into a note.
 Add Sketch—Handwrite or draw directly on your device's screen, and save that content within a note. This feature works really well on an iPad Pro when used with an Apple Pencil, although you can use your finger as a virtual drawing and writing tool on any iPhone or iPad. See the "Using the Drawing Tools in the Notes App" section later in this chapter for more information about drawing and writing in Notes.
Using the Collaboration Feature
After creating a note in the Notes app, you have the ability to invite other people to view and modify that note and collaborate in real time. While composing or viewing a note, tap the Collaboration icon (refer to Figure 14.14), and then add people who you want to collaborate with.
You can invite collaborators via Message, Mail, Twitter, Facebook, or other compatible third-party apps. After choosing how you want to invite one or more collaborators, fill in the To field with the name, email address, or iPhone phone number. The Note is already embedded in the message. If you want, type an additional message, and then tap Send. After the collaboration tool becomes active, a Collaboration icon appears to the left of the note's title.
The recipient receives your message and can click the provided Notes link. The note opens in their iOS 11 (or macOS Sierra or later) version of the Notes app (running on their iPhone, iPad, or Mac). Any time a collaborator makes a change to the shared note, the updated version is immediately shared with the other collaborators, assuming each person's iPhone, iPad, or Mac has Internet access. Changes are highlighted in yellow for a few moments, and then they automatically blend with the rest of the note. All collaborators will see, almost instantly, any changes made to the note.
Notes that are shared using the Collaboration feature are stored in the original composer's iCloud account. The collaborators have access to only the shared note (not all of the composer's other notes that are stored in the Notes app).
The person who set up the collaboration feature for a note can revoke anyone's collaboration privileges by tapping the Add Collaborator icon. From under the People heading, tap the person you want to remove from the list of people with collaboration privileges. Next, tap the Remove Access option related to that person.
To quickly remove everyone's access to the Note and turn off the collaboration feature for just that note, tap the Stop Sharing option below the People heading.
Creating and Managing Notes App Folders
Think of the Notes app as a digital notebook. Each note stored in the app is a separate page that can have its own title and content. Individual notes are stored in folders, which are basically virtual notebooks. Each folder can also be custom named.
Begin by creating one or more virtual notebooks (folders) in the Notes app. Do this from the Folders screen (see Figure 14.16) by tapping the New Folder option, choosing where the content should be stored (in iCloud or only on your mobile device), and then typing a title for that folder.

FIGURE 14.16
From the Folders screen, create one or more folders (virtual notebooks) within which you store your individual note pages.
To edit folders already created in the Notes app, access the Folders screen and then tap the Edit option. You can then select and delete entire folders created using the Notes app.

 Note
Notes created using other apps that were synced with or imported into the Notes app can't be deleted or managed from the Folders screen.

Creating Individual Notes
From the Folders screen in the Notes app, tap the folder (notebook) within which you want to create a new note. When the screen for that folder opens, a listing of individual notes stored in it is displayed. If the folder is empty, only command icons are displayed on the screen.
To open and view, edit, or work with an existing note in a folder, access the Folder screen and tap that note's title/listing.
To create a new note from scratch, tap the Compose icon. The first line of text in a note becomes its title. Each time a new note is created, the time and date are automatically recorded and displayed. After typing the title for the note, tap the Return key and start typing your note's content. You can type as much content as you want in each virtual note page. The note page extends infinitely downward.

 Tip
If you're using an iPad Pro, use the Multitasking feature to open the Notes app on one side of the screen and another app on the opposite side of the screen. You can then select content from that other app and drag and drop it (or cut and paste it) directly into the note you're composing or editing within the Notes app (see Figure 14.17).
Using any iPhone or iPad, take advantage of iOS 11's Select, Copy, and Paste commands, to select content from other apps, copy it into the iPhone or iPad's virtual clipboard, and then paste that content into a note within the Notes app.


FIGURE 14.17
When using an iPad Pro, you can drag and drop content between a compatible app and the Notes app, when both are simultaneously open on the tablet's screen.
As you're typing content, use the command icons at the top of the virtual keyboard to help you format the text or add checklists, for example. Tap the Emoji key on the virtual keyboard to add Emoji characters, or tap the Dictation key to use iOS 11's Dictation feature to speak into the app and have what you say translated into text and then imported into the note.
Some apps (such as Safari) offer integration with the Notes app and include an Add to Notes option in the Share menu. Access this feature from a compatible app to export content from the app directly into a note within the Notes app.

 Tip
You can use Settings to adjust a handful of Notes-specific options. Launch Settings and tap on the Notes option. Figure 14.18 shows the Notes submenu within Settings.
For example, to determine whether photo and video content you capture in the Notes app also gets stored in the Photos app, turn on the virtual switch associated with the Save to Photos option.
Because the Notes app is designed to work with iCloud, if you want to be able to store notes locally within your iPhone or iPad (not just in the cloud), turn on the virtual switch associated with the On My iPad Account or On My iPhone Account.


FIGURE 14.18
Customize a handful of Notes app-specific options by accessing the Notes submenu within Settings (shown here on an iPad Pro).

 Tip
To delete the note you're currently working with, tap the Trash icon. The note is deleted from the iPhone or iPad you're using, as well as from your iCloud account.
To retrieve an accidentally deleted note, visit the Folders menu screen and tap the Recently Deleted option. From there you can select one or more accidentally deleted notes and move them into a different folder using the Move command. Tap the Move or Move All option, and then choose which folder the notes should be transferred to.

Moving Notes Between Folders
After notes are created and stored in particular folders, you can manually move them between folders. To do this, access the Folders screen and tap the folder that contains the notes you want to move. Next, tap Edit. Tap the listing for each note you want to move to select it.
After you've selected one or more note listings, tap the Move To option and select which folder you want to move the notes to. At this point, the notes are removed from their current folder and moved into the newly selected folder. Instead of tapping the Move To option, delete the selected notes by tapping the Delete option.
On an iPad, you're also able to press and hold a listing for a note, and then drag it to another location, or copy it into another app by dragging it there.
Creating Interactive Checklists in Notes
Using the checklist tool built in to the Notes app, it's easy to add and format interactive checklists into a note. To do this, place the cursor where you want to insert the list and tap the Checklist icon. The first empty circle is displayed. To the right of this icon, type your first list item, and then tap the Return key. Add second, third, and fourth items, and keep going until your list is complete.
Later, when you tap one of the circles, a check mark is added to it, indicating that the item has been completed. In a note, add as many separate checklists as you want, and each list can have any number of items. The various lists can be surrounded by other types of content.
Remember, with the new Collaboration feature, multiple people can contribute to a list, so those other people can add or delete items from a checklist or mark items as completed.

 What's New
As you're typing text into a note, tap the Table icon to use the Table menu to create or edit a table. This feature allows you to create content that is nicely formatted on the screen. A table can have any number of columns and rows. Once created and populated with content, you can move columns, rows, or individual fields by dragging them with your finger.
You also can Copy and Paste table-related content within the same note, move it into a different note, or export just a table's contents to another app altogether.

Using the Drawing Tools in the Notes App
Tap the Sketch icon to access the Notes app's drawing tools, which can also be used for handwriting on your phone's or tablet's screen using your finger or the Apple Pencil (on an iPad Pro). At the bottom of this screen are several virtual writing/drawing tools, which are are very similar to the Markup/Annotation tools offered by the Files app. You can choose between several virtual drawing instruments.

 Note
On the iPhone, to view all of the Sketch tools and the virtual ink icons, rotate the phone to Landscape mode.

After choosing a virtual writing instrument, tap an ink color. Swipe your finger across the ink colors to view all the available colors, and then tap the desired color. If you're using an Apple Pencil, tap an ink color icon.
Use your finger, an optional stylus, or an Apple Pencil (when working with an iPad Pro) to draw or handwrite on the screen. You can switch ink colors or writing instruments as often as you choose.

 Tip
If you're using an Apple Pencil, the harder you press on the screen, the thicker and darker the virtual ink will be as you're writing or drawing.


 What's New
When you handwrite text into the Notes app using an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, and you later use the app's Search feature or iOS 11's Spotlight Search feature, iOS 11 is typically able to understand your handwriting and find notes that are applicable to the search.


 What's New
To move something you've written or drawn around on the screen, tap the selection tool (which looks like a dotted line) and then draw a circle around the content you want to move (see Figure 14.19). When the dots in the circle become animated, use the Apple Pencil or your finger to drag the selected content to its new location.


FIGURE 14.19
Select and move handwritten or drawn content around within a note by drawing a circle around it.
The content you've handwritten or drawn is automatically incorporated onto the note page you were previously working on, which can also include typed text or photos, for example.
To erase content that you've drawn on the screen, tap the Eraser tool, and then move your finger (or Apple Pencil) on the screen over the areas you want to erase. If you want to delete everything on the screen, however, tap the Erase All option.

 Tip
To undo your last action, tap the Undo icon. To redo something that you just undid, tap the Redo icon.


 Note
A single note can contain multiple sketches that were created separately.

Sharing Notes
As you're viewing a note, tap the Share icon to access the Share menu. From here, you can share the contents of the note via a variety of apps.
The Share menu also enables you to do the following things (refer to Figure 14.13):
 Lock a note (by adding password protection)
 Save the note to a cloud-based account using the Files app
 Print the note
 Find content within a saved note (using the Search tool)
 Adjust the virtual paper style within a note (choose between blank and several different lined or grid formats)
 Create a PDF from the note

 Note
The option for sharing a note from the app's Share menu is different from the Collaboration option that allows multiple people to compose, edit, and view the same note, in almost real time.
The Share options simply give the person you share the note with a copy of the note in its current form. The person doesn't see any edits you make, and you don't see any changes they make unless the note is shared again.
The Collaboration tool differs in that it enables all collaborators to always be working with the most up-to-date version of the note, as anyone makes any changes to it.


 More Info
With each update the Notes app becomes more powerful and versatile, but a handful of other note-taking and virtual notepad apps for the iPhone and iPad offer a broader selection of tools or take a vastly different approach to composing, collecting, and organizing information.
For example, there's Evernote (www.evernote.com) or Microsoft OneNote (www.onenote.com), which work across all computer and mobile device platforms, and allow notes to be synced and shared easily.
Meanwhile, there are dozens of other powerful, third-party, note-taking apps. To find them, launch the App Store and in the Search field type note taking.
If you're an iPad Pro user with an Apple Pencil, search for Apple Pencil Apps, to see a selection of note-taking, writing, painting, and drawing apps, such as GoodNotes 4, Notepad+, PDF Reader Pro Edition, Post-It Plus, Moleskine Journal, and PDF Expert.








15. Be Entertained using the TV, Music, and Itunes Store Apps

In this Chapter
 Playing digital music using the Music app
 Watching TV shows and movies with the TV app
 Acquiring new content from the iTunes Store and Apple Music service
 Getting acquainted with the Health and Home apps

Entertainment has gone digital. When you subscribe to Apple Music, for example, you can access more than 40 million songs and albums using your iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Apple Watch, or Apple HomePod. An Internet connection is required for music streaming, but songs from the Apple Music library can be downloaded and stored on your device for offline listening if you purchase the music outright or you're an active Apple Music subscriber.

 Note
From the iTunes Store, you can buy and download individual songs, entire albums, TV show episodes, TV series seasons, and movies. You also can rent movies from the iTunes Store using the iTunes Store app that comes preinstalled with iOS 11. An Internet connection is required to acquire the content, but then you can listen or view it anytime without Internet connectivity because it's downloaded and stored locally within your iPhone or iPad.
Listen to music from the iTunes Store or Apple Music service using the Music app. Watch TV shows and movies acquired from the iTunes Store using the TV app.

Meanwhile, every month, thousands of people are cancelling their expensive cable television subscriptions and taking advantage of alternative, less expensive options, like the iTunes Store, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and the video-streaming apps from the individual television networks to experience their favorite TV shows and movies—both at home and on the go.
Once you activate a Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime Video subscription (for less than $10 each per month), you'll need the official app for that service to stream or download content (when applicable) to your mobile device.
To stream video content from a specific TV network or other on-demand streaming video service, you need the official app. These free apps are available from the App Store.

 Note
When you have an Apple TV or Apple TV 4K device ($179 to $199, www.apple.com/tv) connected to your HD television set, use iOS 11's AirPlay feature to wirelessly transfer video and audio content from your iPhone or iPad to watch or listen to on your television set (using Apple TV as the conduit).

Getting to Know the Music App
The Music app serves as a full-featured digital music player, enabling you to play music. However, to be able to play music, you first must load digital music files into your iOS mobile device or choose to stream music from the Internet. There are several ways to do this, including the following:
 Purchase digital music directly from the iTunes Store (using the iTunes Store app) on your iPhone or iPad. An Internet connection is required.

 Note
When you activate the iCloud Family Sharing feature, you can share some or all of your iTunes Store digital content purchases with up to five other family members. You decide what content gets shared, and you also have the option of keeping some of your content private. In that case, your music is available only through your iCloud account on your own iOS mobile devices and Macs. Family Sharing needs to be set up only once. See Chapter 7, "Use iCloud and the Files App," or visit www.apple.com/icloud/family-sharing, for additional information.

 Purchase music using the iTunes software on your primary computer (used to connect to the iTunes Store) and then transfer content purchases and downloads to your iPhone or iPad using the iTunes Sync process or through iCloud.
 "Rip" music from traditional CDs, convert it into a digital format using your primary computer, and then transfer the digital music files to your iOS device. For this, the free iTunes software on your computer or other third-party software is required.
 Upgrade your iCloud account by adding the optional iTunes Match service, which costs $24.99 per year, so you can access your entire digital music library via iCloud, whether that music was purchased from the iTunes Store, ripped from your own CDs, or purchased/downloaded from other sources. To learn more about iTunes Match, visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204146.
 Shop for and download music from another source besides the iTunes Store, load that music into your primary computer, convert it to the proper format, and then transfer it to your iPhone or iPad using the iTunes Sync process, or use a specialized app to experience that content.

 Note
The Apple iTunes Store offers the world's largest collection of digital music that's available for purchase and download. This includes more than 40 million songs and albums, such as the latest hits, new music from the biggest bands and recording artists, as well as music from up-and-coming and unsigned artists/bands. You can also find classic songs and oldies from all music genres.

 Apple Music subscribers (who pay $9.99 per month) can stream most of the iTunes Store's music collection and listen to it on an unlimited, on-demand basis. Subscribers also can temporarily download much of the music for offline listening.
Meanwhile, if you want to stream and watch unlimited and free videos from YouTube, use the official (free) YouTube app available from the App Store.

 More Info
For a $35 monthly fee and no long-term contract, you're now able to subscribe to YouTube TV (https://tv.youtube.com). With this service, you can stream unlimited live and on-demand programming from more than 40 popular TV channels and networks using the YouTube TV app.

Remember, streaming content requires no internal storage space within your iPhone or iPad, but you do have to have a continuous Internet connection. Although the apps offered by the various streaming video and music services are free, a monthly subscription fee is charged by most of these services. This fee, which is typically less than $10.00 per month, enables you to stream as much content as you want, on an unlimited basis, during each month you're a paid subscriber.

 Note
When you stream content from the Internet, it gets transferred from the Internet directly to your iOS mobile device, for example. However, your iPhone or iPad does not save streamed content. Streaming content from the Internet requires using a specialized app, which is provided by the source of the content.

Discovering the Apple Music Service
You can use a free three-month trial subscription to the Apple Music service, but you'll ultimately need to pay $9.99 per month for an ongoing individual subscription. Apple Music is accessible from the Music app.

 Note
An Apple Music Family Plan (for up to six people) is priced at $14.99 per month, and the new College Student Plan is priced at $4.99 per month.

Apple Music enables users to stream (and in some cases temporarily download) almost any music available from the iTunes Store, on an unlimited, on-demand basis. In addition, exclusive music from independent bands, artists, and musicians is offered, and you're allowed to access playlists that have been compiled by other users and Apple's music curators.

 Note
Music content you experience via Apple Music is streamed from the Internet, not purchased. One benefit to this on-demand aspect of the listening experience is that songs from Apple Music can be incorporated into your personal playlists and temporarily stored on your mobile device even if you don't own them. Plus, you can stream music to your Apple HomePod or listen to it on your television's speakers via Apple TV (or Apple TV 4K).

Another useful feature of Apple Music is that you can quickly select one or more artists, songs, albums, or music genres that you love, and the service recommends similar music based on your personal tastes. This is a great tool for discovering new, up-and-coming artists and bands, or for previewing new music from some of your favorite artists or bands.

 More Info
Learn more about Apple Music by visiting www.apple.com/music.


 Tip
When you tap the For You icon displayed at the bottom of the Music app's screen, one useful feature is that the Music app compiles custom playlists for you, based on your music preferences and listening history. This happens automatically every week.
Tap the New Music Mix or Chill Mix banner at the top of the screen (see Figure 15.1). The New Music Mix is a playlist of 25 songs from new, up-and-coming, and well-established artists.
When viewing a playlist (see Figure 15.2 on an iPad Pro), tap +Add to add it to your Favorite Library, and then tap the iCloud icon to download the entire playlist (if you're an Apple Music subscriber).
Alternatively, scroll down to choose which songs you want to add to your Favorites list or download. To do this, tap the + icon associated with specific song listings from the playlist. Tap the More icon (...) to manage the new playlist, just as you would any other playlist. You also can purchase individual songs or the entire playlist with a single tap. Tap on a song, playlist, or album's price icon to purchase it from the iTunes store, although this is not necessary if you're an Apple Music subscriber.


FIGURE 15.1
Every week, the Music app automatically compiles custom playlists for you.

Using the Music App: A Quick Tutorial
Aside from enabling you to experience the Apple Music service, the iOS 11 edition of the Music app continues to serve many other purposes for experiencing music content. For example, it enables you to play songs or albums that are stored within your iPhone or iPad and that you own. You can also use the app to create, manage, and play custom song playlists.
The Music app is designed to give you total control over your music-listening experience. When you launch the iOS 11 edition of the Music app, along the bottom of the screen are a handful of command icons (see the iPhone version in Figure 15.3). Tap any of these icons to manage and experience music via the Music app or Apple Music.

FIGURE 15.3
The Music app offers a selection of command icons displayed at the bottom of the screen.
Here's a quick summary of what each command icon is used for:
 Library—Access any music that you own (or have downloaded, if you're an Apple Music subscriber) and that's stored within your mobile device or your iCloud account. On the iPhone, after you tap the Library option, you can sort your music collection by Playlists, Artists, Albums, Songs, or Downloaded Music (just tap the appropriate option; see Figure 15.4). Scroll down to see the selection of newly acquired music under the Recently Added heading.
On the iPad, tap the Library command icon at the bottom of the screen, and then tap the pull-down menu option in the top-left corner of the screen to re-sort the music.

FIGURE 15.4
View and sort the music that you own (or have downloaded) onto your iPhone or iPad by tapping the Library command icon.

 Note
When you tap Downloaded Music, only music that is currently stored in your iPhone or iPad is displayed as being available to listen to.


 Note
Regardless of which option you choose to sort and display your available music within Library, when you tap a listing, that music's Information screen is displayed. From here, you can select and play that music, access the More (...) menu, quickly find more music from that artist/band, or obtain suggestions for similar music that you might like.
When music is stored in your iPhone or iPad, play that music by tapping its listing, whether or not your mobile device has Internet access.
If you see an iCloud icon associated with the music, the music is available to you, but it isn't stored in your mobile device. With an Internet connection you can stream the music (by tapping the music title) or download the music to your mobile device (by tapping the iCloud icon associated with the song or album.)


 Tip
When viewing the Library menu on an iPhone or iPad, tap Edit to choose additional sorting options, including Video, Genres, Compilations, and Composers. Add a check mark only to the sorting options you want displayed (see Figure 15.5). Use the Move icon (the three lines) associated with each listing to reorganize the menu order, and then tap Done to save your changes.


FIGURE 15.5
Customize how music stored within your iPhone or iPad will be sorted and displayed.
 For You—Based on past music purchases, your music-listening habits while using the Music app, and information about your musical tastes that you provide to the app (by tapping the Love or Dislike icons as you listen to music, for example), the Music app recommends music you might be interested in and provides collections of curated playlists. An Internet connection is required. Scroll toward the bottom of the For You screen to access Connect Posts, which are public postings from the artists/bands you've selected as your favorites. These posts include behind-the-scenes photos, text messages, and, in some cases, video clips.

 Tip
The first time you use the Music app or the For You feature, provide the app with information about your personal music tastes. From the Tell Us What You're Into screen (see Figure 15.6), tap the floating circles that represent each of the music genres you enjoy (pop, R&B, classical, country, and so on). Tap Next to continue.
From the Choose Your Favorites screen, tap some of your all-time favorite recording artists or bands. Tap More Artists to see a larger selection, or tap Add an Artist to manually enter a specific recording artist or bands you love. After choosing your favorites, tap Done.


FIGURE 15.6
The first time you start using Apple Music in conjunction with the Music app, you're prompted to select your favorite music genres as well as your favorite recording artists and bands.

 Note
To customize your public profile, which is accessible to people you share your music or playlists with, tap the For You icon, and then tap the Profile icon. Tap your name at the top center of the Account window and edit how you want your full name to appear. In the @nickname field, you can add a public nickname for yourself using alphanumeric characters and the underscore (_).
Tap the profile photo icon to add a profile photo of yourself. Tap Done to save your changes. From the Account menu, you're able to update your favorite artists/bands list, start sharing music and playlists with your friends, add more curated playlists, redeem an iTunes Store gift card, and manage your Apple ID account.


 Tip
When viewing the For You section of the Music app, tap any music selection, curated playlist, or music listing to begin streaming that music (if you subscribe to Apple Music); otherwise, only music you own will be accessible.
As you're viewing the For You music selection screen, tap a song title to jump to and play that song. Tap the Add (+) icon to add that track to your Library and download it to your mobile device so you can play it offline (for as long as you subscribe to Apple Music).
When any song is playing, from the Now Playing screen, tap the song's More (...) icon to access a menu (see Figure 15.7) that enables you to add the selected (and playing) song to your Library (or remove it), create a custom Radio station based on the song, or add the song to a Playlist. You can also select the Play Next, Play Later, or Share Playlist option.


 Tip
When listening to music via the Music app, tap the song listing's More (...) icon, and then tap the Love (heart-shaped) icon to indicate you really like the music you're listing to (see Figure 15.7). Alternatively, you can tap the Dislike icon to indicate you don't like the song. Rating songs regularly helps the Music app and Apple Music service get to know your music preferences, so it can more accurately recommend music you'll like in the future.


FIGURE 15.7
These options help you manage the music available to you and share your thoughts about the music you're hearing.
 Browse—This tool (shown in Figure 15.8) enables you to seek out new music, new playlists, music videos, and new albums, again based on your music preferences. After tapping the Browse command icon, choose from options including New Music, Playlists, TV & Movies, Top Charts, or Genres. Tap any of the album thumbnails or music listings to play the music that's being promoted. You'll discover the selection of music and curated playlists changes regularly.
 Radio—This streaming music service enables you to listen to (stream) customized, online radio stations that feature music based on your preferences and listening habits. Choose a recommended station (see Figure 15.9), or scroll down and choose from a wide range of options to explore the programming that's offered. Tap the Beats 1 option to tune in to this 24/7 live global broadcast produced by Apple. To use this free feature, a continuous Internet connection is required.

FIGURE 15.8
Use the Music app's Browse tool to discover music that will appeal to you, based on your personal preferences and past listening habits.

FIGURE 15.9
Choose from hundreds of streaming radio stations, based on the type of music you want to hear at any given moment.

 Note
With the Radio option, you can choose a station to listen to based on an artist, album, or music genre you enjoy; however, you can't select the actual music that is played or choose the song order. However, from the Now Playing screen or mini-player, you can skip a song (press the Fast Forward button) or tap the More (...) icon to access a menu that allows you to manage the currently playing song.


 Tip
Listening to a streaming radio station can be an interactive experience. From the Now Playing screen, tap the More (...) icon to create a new station based on the currently playing song selection, share the song with someone else, see the lyrics from the song that's playing (available for a growing selection of songs), or tap the Love or Dislike icon. From the main Now Playing screen, you always have the option to tap Fast Forward to skip to the next song, which is listed under the Up Next heading.
Tap any displayed album title or band/artist's name to view more information, see additional music from that performer, or learn about similar performers.

 Search—Apple's music collection is continuously expanding. Whether you're looking for a particular song, album, artist, band, or composer, tap the Search icon, and then type any search word or phrase (including song lyrics) in the Search field to find what you're looking for. A continuously updated Trending Searches list is displayed, so you can see what other people are searching for.

 Tip
Apple Music and the Music app work seamlessly with Siri. So, if there's a song you want to hear, simply activate Siri and say, "Play [song title]" or "Play music from [a band or artist's name]" or "Play [album title]." Assuming the requested music is part of Apple's extensive digital music library, the song or album begins streaming to your iPhone or iPad and plays within seconds, assuming an Internet connection is available.

Taking Advantage of the Now Playing Screen
Any time music is selected or playing in the Music app, the mini-player controls are displayed near the bottom of the screen, just above the app's command icons on an iPhone (see Figure 15.10) or in the lower-right corner of the screen on an iPad.

FIGURE 15.10
Use the mini-player to control the selected music in the music app or quickly access the Now Playing screen.
The mini-player includes Play/Pause and Fast Forward icons; and depending on the source of the music, there might also be a Rewind icon (if you're streaming music, rewind isn't an option). The song title and album artwork are also displayed. To switch to the Now Playing screen (see Figure 15.11 on an iPhone) or pane, tap the mini-player with your finger.

FIGURE 15.11
The Music app's Now Playing screen on an iPhone.
The Now Playing screen/pane displays album artwork, the title of the song being played, the title of the album the song is from, the artist/band, a time slider, a volume control slider, and command icons. On an iPad, the Now Playing options are displayed in a pane along the right side of the screen.

 Tip
Scroll down the Now Playing screen (iPhone) to access the Shuffle and Repeat icons. Tap the Repeat icon to continue repeating the same song. Tap the Shuffle icon to play music from the selected album or playlist in a random order.
Keep scrolling down to view the song's lyrics (if they're available for the song you're listening to). Tap the Hide option to hide the lyrics.
At the bottom of the Now Playing screen is the Up Next heading, which displays what music will be played next from an album, streaming radio station, or playlist, for example.
To close the Now Playing screen and return to the mini-player view, tap the downward-pointing Close icon at the top center of the screen (iPhone) or the top center of the Now Playing screen (iPad).

Tap the Music Output icon displayed at the bottom-center of the Now Playing screen (refer to Figure 15.11) to change the speaker source. In Figure 15.12 you can see the Music Output menu and a volume slider. Tap a displayed option to switch between the iPhone/iPad's internal speaker(s), Apple TV, Apple HomePod (if applicable), AirPods, or Bluetooth/AirPlay speakers or headphones that are wirelessly linked to your smartphone.

FIGURE 15.12
Re-route music playing on your iPhone/iPad's internal speakers to wireless speakers or headphones that are linked with your mobile device.
Using Control Center's Music Controls
Once music is playing (or streaming) on your iPhone or iPad, there's no need to keep the Music app open. You can exit the app and return to the Home screen (or access the Dock or App Switcher), and then begin working with another app. The music that's playing (or streaming) continues to play, even after you exit the Music app. At this point, you can reopen the Music app at any time or take advantage of the Music Controls that are accessible from Control Center (see Figure 15.13). The Music app controls in Control Center include the name of the song that's playing, the artist, and the Rewind, Play/Pause, and Fast Forward icons.

FIGURE 15.13
Take charge of music that's playing on your iPhone or iPad using these Music controls accessible from Control Center.
Creating Custom Playlists Using the Music App
Playlists are used to create a custom selection of songs. If you're an Apple Music subscriber, you can create a playlist from any music that's part of Apple's vast and ever-growing music collection. You can also share playlists with other people and acquire curated playlists from Apple's music experts or your favorite artists/bands.
However, if you're not an Apple Music subscriber, the music you can add to playlists is limited to music stored on the mobile device you're using (or music stored within your iCloud account that you own).
Thanks to iCloud, when you create a playlist, it almost instantly syncs between your iPhone, iPad, and all other computers and compatible devices (including the Apple Watch) linked to your iCloud account. Thus, all your playlists are always accessible when and where you want to experience them.

 Tip
When playing a playlist comprising music stored on your iPhone or iPad, no Internet connection is required. However, if the music is being streamed from your iCloud account or via the Apple Music service, you need a continuous Internet connection (unless you first download each song selection in the playlist).

Creating a Playlist on an iPhone
Follow these steps to create and save a custom playlist using the Music app on your iPhone:
1. Launch the Music app on your iPhone.
2. Tap the Library command icon.
3. From under the Library heading, tap the Playlists option.
4. From the Playlists screen, tap + New Playlist.
5. Enter a custom title for the playlist in the Playlist Name field (see Figure 15.14).

FIGURE 15.14
Fill in the Playlist Name and Description fields, and select an optional photo/graphic for your playlist.
6. In the Description field, type a short description of the playlist. For example, type "Favorite Song Compilation" or "Workout Music."
7. Tap the Artwork icon to import any image that you want to associate with that playlist. You can either take a photo using the iPhone's or iPad's camera or select a photo already stored on the device. (If you don't add your own artwork, artwork is created for you using album art from music featured in your playlist.)
8. Turn on the virtual switch associated with the Public Playlist option if you want to share this playlist with others.
9. Tap + Add Music.
10. From the Library screen, locate the music you want to add. Select the Artists, Albums, Songs, Videos, Genres, Compilations, Composers, or Downloaded Music option to determine how your available music options are sorted.
11. If you select Songs, for example, all the songs currently stored on your iPhone or accessible via your iCloud account are displayed in alphabetical order by artist. Each song has an Add (+) icon to the right of its listing. Tap this icon to add the song to your playlist.

 Note
If you selected Artists or Albums, for example, after tapping the Add Music option, a list of artists whose music you have stored on your iPhone or iPad, or a list of albums (or partial albums) you have stored on your iOS device, is displayed. Tap a listing to view individual song titles, and then tap the Add icon associated with each song you want to add. If you select Artists, initially a list of that artist's albums is displayed. Tap an album to reveal individual songs.

12. One at a time, add as many separate songs, from as many different artists or albums as you desire, to the playlist you're creating. Tap Done when you've finished compiling the list of songs to be added to your playlist.
13. A summary screen for your playlist is displayed (see Figure 15.15). To the right of each song listing is a Move icon (the three lines). Place your finger on any of these icons and drag it up or down to rearrange the order of the songs.
14. Tap Done to save your newly created playlist.
15. Along with the playlists that are already available in the Music app, such as My Top Rated, Recently Added, Recently Played, and Top 25 Most Played, your new playlist is displayed when you tap the Library command icon, and then tap the Playlists option. You will likely need to scroll down to view it.
16. Tap the playlist listing to access that playlist.
17. Tap any song listing within the playlist to begin playing it.

FIGURE 15.15
Press any song's Move icon and drag it up or down to rearrange the order of songs.

 Tip
To edit the contents of a playlist, from the playlist screen while a playlist is being played, tap Edit. Alternatively, while a song from a playlist is playing, access the Now Playing screen, and then tap the More (...) icon to remove the currently playing song from the currently selected playlist.
To delete a playlist, tap the Library icon followed by the Playlists option, and then tap the More icon associated with the playlist title. From the More menu, tap the Delete from Library option, and, when prompted, confirm your decision by tapping the Delete Playlist option.


 Tip
Regardless of what you're doing on your iPhone, you can begin playing a playlist, or any song, by activating Siri and issuing a command like, "Play [playlist title] playlist." You can also ask Siri to play a particular song, or music from a specific artist, for example.

Creating a Playlist on an iPad
To create a Playlist using the iPad, begin by launching the Music app on your tablet; then tap the Library option. Next, tap the Library pull-down menu in the top-left corner of the screen, and tap the Playlists option.
Continue by tapping the New option near the top-right corner of the screen. Follow steps 5 through 17 of the previous section.
Customizing the iTunes Store and Music Apps
To customize some of the features associated with the iTunes Store and Music apps, launch Settings and tap the iTunes & App Store option.
From below the Automatic Downloads option, turn on the virtual switch associated with Music if you want songs you purchase on other computers or mobile devices that are linked to the same iCloud account to automatically be downloaded to the iPhone or iPad you're currently using. If this feature is turned off, you always have the option of manually downloading that music.

 Tip
If you have a preset cellular data monthly usage allocation, turn off the virtual switch associated with Use Cellular Data. This prevents you from automatically downloading content from the iTunes Store using a cellular data connection, which would otherwise quickly use up your monthly data allocation.

Then, from the main Settings menu, tap the Music option within Settings (see Figure 15.16). One at a time, turn on/off the virtual switches associated with each customizable option, or when applicable, tap an option to customize features from a submenu.

FIGURE 15.16
Customize a handful of features and functions that are associated with the Music app from within Settings.
Streaming Music via the Internet
In addition to the Music app's Radio feature (see the "Discovering the Apple Music Service" section earlier in this chapter), there are many free and subscription-based streaming music services that you can enjoy from your iPhone or iPad. To use one of these services, such as Pandora, iHeartRadio, Amazon Cloud Player, or Spotify, for example, you need to download and install the app for that service, set up an account, and, if applicable, pay for a subscription.
In addition, virtually every radio network and local radio station in the world, as well as SiriusXM Satellite Radio, has a proprietary app that allows you to stream live programing from the Internet directly to your iOS device. An AM, FM, or satellite radio receiver is not required, but you do need a continuous Internet connection.
Using the TV App to Watch TV Shows, Movies, and More
The TV app allows you to manage and watch video content you've downloaded from the iTunes Store (including movies you've rented), but the app also links with other streaming video apps and services so you can view alternative programming selections. If you have Apple TV (or Apple TV 4K), you can stream videos from your iOS device to your home theater system.
Along the bottom of the TV app are four command icons that enable you to find, watch, and manage video content (see Figure 15.17).

FIGURE 15.17
The Watch Now screen of the TV app (shown on an iPad Pro).
These are the command icons:
 Watch Now—Tap this option to view a selection of recommended TV shows and movies that are available through the purchases you've made through the iTunes Store, the services you subscribe to, and the TV network apps you have installed on your mobile device. Scroll down to browse by category, see what's trending, and discover what's new within the iTunes Store. Tap any TV show or movie listing to begin watching it via the TV app. In some cases, an alternate app from a specific TV network or streaming services will be launched by the TV app in order for you to watch selected content.
 Library—Access TV shows and movies that you've acquired from the iTunes Store and that are stored within your iPhone or iPad. This includes rented movies. Tap the Library pull-down menu to sort and display content (see Figure 15.18). Options include Recently Added, TV Shows, Movies, and Downloaded. Downloaded shows only content that's currently stored on your iPhone or iPad and does not list any content stored within your iCloud account. Tap a listing to view that TV show or movie.

FIGURE 15.18
Tap the Library icon, followed by the Library pull-down menu option to choose the type of video content you want to access from the TV app.
 +Store—From within the TV app, access the iTunes Store to acquire new TV show episodes, entire TV series seasons, or movies (which you can purchase or rent). Scroll down to see a listing of compatible TV network and cable TV channel apps that work in conjunction with the TV app. When you download and install any of these apps, you're able to watch programming from that network or service. In some cases, a subscription fee applies.

 Note
All TV and cable network-specific apps are free to download and install. In some cases, you can stream and watch programming for free. Some of these apps allow you to download certain programming for later (offline) viewing. For premium cable TV and streaming services, you might have to pay a monthly fee to access the content. For example, to use the HBO NOW, HBO GO, or Showtime app, a paid subscription to that premium cable service is required.


 Tip
After tapping on the +Store icon, scroll down and tap the Free Episodes button. This displays a selection of TV episodes and featurettes that are available to be downloaded for free from the iTunes Store. All other TV show and movie content from the iTunes Store needs to be paid for on an a la carte basis. (There is no monthly subscription fee).

 Search—Tap this icon to access a Search field and seek out TV show or movie programming based on any keyword, such as a title, actor's name, or genre.

 Tip
To customize the TV app, based on what optional TV network, cable network, and streaming video services apps you have installed, launch Settings and tap on the TV option.
Turn on the virtual switches associated with the optional apps you want the TV app to be able to work seamlessly with.
Tap on the Clear Play History option to delete the listing of TV shows and movies you've previously watched using the TV app.
Tap on the iTunes Videos option to choose the playback quality and preferred download quality for content acquired from the iTunes Store.

Watching Video Content Using the TV App
After tapping the Watch Now or Library command icon, select the content you want to watch. If you acquired it from the iTunes Store and then downloaded and installed it onto your mobile device, tap the Play icon to begin playing the selected TV show or movie (see Figure 15.19).

FIGURE 15.19
Select content listed within the TV app and then tap the Play icon to begin watching it.
If you acquired the content from the iTunes Store, but it is stored within your iCloud account (rather than directly on the device you're using), first tap the iCloud icon to download the content (an Internet connection is required). Then you can watch the programming at your leisure.
When content is being streamed via the Internet to your mobile device, tap the Play icon upon choosing what you want to watch.

 Note
Remember, you need Internet access when downloading content to be stored within your mobile device. After that content is downloaded, you don't need an Internet connection to watch it.
When you're streaming content from the Internet, a continuous Internet connection is required. In most cases, either a Wi-Fi or cellular data connection will work. Some video streaming services, however, require a Wi-Fi Internet connection.


 Caution
Streaming HD video requires extensive data consumption. If you're streaming content using a cellular data connection and you have a monthly cellular data allocation imposed by your cellular service provider, you will quickly use your data allocation.

When you're playing video content, you can hold your iPhone or iPad in either portrait or landscape mode. However, when you position your iOS mobile device sideways and use landscape mode the video window is significantly larger.
Depending on the source of the video content as you're watching it, the location and appearance of the on-screen controls varies. However, you'll typically see a Play/Pause icon, Fast Forward and Rewind icons, a time slider, a volume control slider, a closed captioning on/off icon, and a Picture-in-Picture icon (if you're using a compatible iPad model). The on-screen icons disappear after the video has started playing. To make them re-appear, tap anywhere on the screen.
Tap Done to exit the video you're watching and return to the previous TV app menu screen.

 Tip
If you're watching a purchased movie that you acquired from the iTunes Store, below the Play, Rewind, and Fast Forward controls you might see additional tabs that enable you to access movie-related "extras" that would otherwise be made available as part of the DVD or Blu-ray version of the movie. Tap any of these tabs to access the bonus content.


 Caution
When traveling on airplanes with Wi-Fi service, keep in mind that streaming video services are typically blocked and do not work. So, to watch video content, you need to acquire it first, and then download it to your mobile device before the flight.


 Note
Some cable TV and satellite provider apps now allow certain programming to be downloaded and watched offline. A growing number of these apps also now offer the ability to stream live programming.
For example, if you have a TiVo Bolt or TiVo Bolt+ digital video recorder (www.TiVo.com) connected to your television set for recording your favorite shows, most of that programming can be downloaded to your mobile device and later watched offline, or streamed from your TiVo to your mobile device when an Internet connection is available.
The ability to download and store some TV show and movie content is also offered by the Amazon Prime Video streaming service and Netflix.

Taking Advantage of Picture-In-Picture on an iPad
If you're using one of the newer iPad Air, iPad mini, or iPad Pro models to watch video content using the TV app, you have the option to use the Picture-in-Picture feature. After you start playing a TV show or movie, tap the Picture-in-Picture icon. The video window shrinks and displays Enlarge, Play/Pause, and Close icons in it. Tap the Play icon to continue playing your video in the smaller screen, or tap the Pause icon to pause it.
As the video is playing, place and hold your finger on the video window to move it around in the iPad's screen. You can then launch another app and use that app as the video continues playing in its smaller window.
To adjust the size of the Picture-in-Picture window, place two fingers in the window and perform a reverse-pinch finger gesture.

 Note
Other popular apps used for streaming video content, such as YouTube, HBO GO, Netflix, Amazon Video, and Hulu, also support the Picture-in-Picture feature, but the appearance and location of the Picture-in-Picture icon, or the method for activating this feature, varies. For example, when the Netflix app is playing a video, press the Home button to activate the Picture-in-Picture feature and also access the Home screen so you can launch another app.


 Note
If you pause a video and then exit the TV app, when you relaunch the TV app you pick up exactly where you left off watching the video.

Renting Movies from the iTunes Store
If you have rented movies from the iTunes Store (as opposed to purchasing them), to access these movies, launch the TV app and tap the Library icon. When the Recently Added or Downloaded option is selected from the Library menu, your rented movies are listed below the Rentals heading (see Figure 15.20).

FIGURE 15.20
Access movies rented from the iTunes Store by tapping the Library icon within the TV app.
When you rent a movie from the iTunes Store, it remains on your device (and accessible from your iCloud account) for 30 days before it automatically deletes itself, whether or not you have viewed the content.

 What's New
When you rent a movie from the iTunes Store, once you press Play to begin watching it, that movie now remains available to you for a 48-hour period. In the past, the window within which to watch the movie was only 24 hours.
In addition, when available, a 4K HDR resolution version of the movie will be made available to you, which will look even better on the iPhone X or an iPad Pro's screen. The rental fee for most 4K HDR resolution movies is $5.99. When looking at movie descriptions within the iTunes Store, look for the 4K icon to determine if a movie is available in this higher resolution format.

However, after you press Play in the TV app and begin watching rented content (or you begin watching the rented movie on a Mac or Apple TV device that's linked to your iCloud account), you have access to that movie for 48 hours before it deletes itself. During that 48-hour period, however, you can watch and rewatch the movie as often as you'd like using any of your iOS mobile devices, Macs, or Apple TV devices that are linked to your iCloud account.
The first time you tap Play to watch a rented movie, you're prompted to confirm your choice. This starts the 48-hour clock and allows the rented movie to begin playing.
Using the iTunes Store App to Make Purchases
The iTunes Store app (see Figure 15.21) comes preinstalled with iOS 11 and is used to acquire music, movies, TV shows, and ringtones. Your iOS mobile device requires Internet access for this app to work. For smaller-sized files, such as songs, albums, or ringtones, a cellular data connection is sufficient. However, for larger-sized files, such as TV show episodes and movies, you must use a Wi-Fi Internet connection to download the content.

FIGURE 15.21
Use the iTunes Store app to purchase music, TV shows, and movie content and acquire free music and video-based content.

 Note
Like the App Store, from the iTunes Store you can view detailed descriptions and reviews of content before purchasing (or renting) it. You can also preview the content or watch a movie's trailer(s). Tap the Details tab to read a description and access previews, or tap the Reviews tab to see star-based ratings and read reviews.
The process for purchasing content from the iTunes Store is virtually identical to using the App Store, so refer to Chapter 5, "Find, Buy, and Use Third-Party Apps," for more information.

On the iPhone, displayed along the bottom of the iTunes Store screen are five command icons: Music, Movies, TV Shows, Search, and More (...). Tap the More (...) icon to access the Tones (Ringtones), Genius, Purchased, and Downloads options.

 Note
The iTunes Store app can also be used to browse and purchase individual songs, entire music albums, or curated music collections. Tap on the Music icon at the bottom of the iTunes Store app screen to access the vast music collection offered by the iTunes Store. To purchase music, tap on the price icon associated with a song, album, or music collection. Like the App Store, the Music area of the iTunes Store sorts music by genre (pop, rock, country, etc.) and categories (like New Music, Best of the Week, and Pre-Orders), making it easier to find.

On the iPad, six command icons are displayed along the bottom of the screen, which from left to right are Music, Movies, TV Shows, Top Charts, Genius, and Purchased. The Search field is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen.
To purchase or rent movies, tap the Movies icon. For TV shows (either individual episodes or entire seasons of a series), tap the TV Shows icon. Use the Search feature to quickly find available audio or video content using keywords.

 Tip
After you tap the More (...) icon on the iPhone, tap Purchased to view all past purchases from the iTunes Store. As content is downloading, you can view the progress of that download by tapping the Purchased icon.

When you make a purchase from the iTunes Store, all charges are automatically billed to the credit or debit card you have linked with your Apple ID or offset against any credit your account might have from redeemed gift cards.

 Tip
You can redeem an iTunes gift card and add the credit to the Apple ID account used for making online purchases from the iTunes Store, App Store, or iBook Store. When you select the Redeem option, you can scan a physical gift card using the camera built in to your iOS mobile device, so you don't have to manually type the long redemption code.

When you make a purchase from your iPhone or iPad, it immediately gets downloaded to that device and, at the same time, gets stored in your iCloud account. The online storage space required for purchased iTunes Store content is provided free of charge; it doesn't count against the 5GB of free online storage space your iCloud account comes with. The content can then be downloaded and experienced on your other Macs and iOS mobile devices that are linked to the same iCloud account.
When shopping for TV show episodes to purchase and watch using the iTunes Store app, tap the TV shows command icon. Shows are displayed by series name. The search results display the TV show by season number and by available episodes.

 Note
Purchasing most single TV episodes from the iTunes Store costs $1.99 (standard definition) or $2.99 (high definition). A discount for acquiring a complete season of a TV series is offered.
The price to purchase movies varies, but the rental price is typically $3.99 (standard definition) or $4.99 (high definition).
Most individual songs available from the iTunes Store cost between $0.69 and $1.29, and album prices vary.

In addition to purchasing one TV show episode at a time, the iTunes Store gives you the option of purchasing the entire season all at once, at a discounted rate, plus you can choose between high definition (HD) or standard definition (SD) video quality. The HD versions of TV shows have much larger file sizes associated with them, and take up much more internal storage space in your device, but they look much better when you watch them.
To save money, purchase an entire season of your favorite show's current season. This is called a Season Pass. Then, when a new episode airs each week and becomes available from the iTunes Store (about 24 hours later), it can be downloaded to your iOS device and made available to you via iCloud using a Wi-Fi Internet connection. You'll also receive a weekly email, plus Notification Center alerts from Apple telling you when each new episode in your Season Pass is available.

 Note
All episodes of a TV series' available past season(s) can be acquired at the same time.

When you shop for TV episodes from the iTunes Store (via the iTunes app), they're commercial free and available to watch whenever you want. They're also permanently accessible via your iCloud account to be downloaded to any computer, iOS device, or Apple TV device that's linked to the same iCloud account. Once an episode is downloaded to your iPhone or iPad, you no longer need an Internet connection to watch it.
Getting Acquainted with the Health App
One of the apps that come preinstalled with iOS 11 on all iPhones is called Health. On its own, this app does very little, unless you manually input health and fitness-related data into the app, which it will then store and track.
However, when your iPhone is wirelessly paired or connected with compatible health, medical, or fitness equipment, the Health app becomes a powerful tool for tracking, analyzing, managing, and sharing fitness, health, sleep, nutrition, weight loss, and medical data.
The Health app is designed to work seamlessly with the Apple Watch (which has a built-in heart rate monitor and pedometer). Many third-party companies have begun offering HealthKit-compatible equipment that works in conjunction with the Health app. This includes heart and blood pressure monitoring devices, blood sugar monitoring devices, sleep monitors, weight scales, and all sorts of fitness equipment. One example is a portable EKG device from a company called AliveCore (www.alivecor.com). The device, which is priced at $99.00, connects wirelessly to an iPhone. A monthly subscription fee is required to make full use of the device.
To learn more, visit www.apple.com/ios/health.

 Note
The Health app is also being used by iPhone owners to participate in organized medical research being conducted by top-ranked medical schools, hospitals, and medical research companies around the world. Research pertaining to Parkinson's disease, autism, concussions, melanomas, heart disease, postpartum depression, and sleep health are examples of research that's currently underway.
To participate in a medical research study via your iPhone, you need to download and install a propriety app that works in conjunction with the Health app. To learn more, visit www.apple.com/researchkit.

On its own, the Health app can be used to store emergency information, including your name, age, allergies, medication list, blood type, height, and weight. This information can become accessible to doctors and medical professionals in an emergency. To enter this information in the app, launch the app and tap Medical ID. Tap Edit, and then enter your personal and medical information as requested. Be sure to enter the names and phone numbers of people you would like contacted in case of an emergency in the Emergency Contacts section.

 What's New
Emergency SOS is a feature built into iOS 11 that works in conjunction with the Health app. On older iPhones, when you quickly press the Side button five times in a row in quick succession, you see a counter and the Emergency SOS slider on the screen. When the counter reaches zero, the phone automatically contacts the people within your Emergency Contacts list. To initiate the call(s) immediately, swipe the slider to the right.
On the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, or iPhone X, press and hold the Side button simultaneously with the Volume Up or Volume Down button until the Emergency SOS slider and the countdown icon are displayed. When the timer reaches zero, the phone automatically calls the emergency contact(s). To make this happen immediately use your finger to drag the Emergency SOS slider to the right.
To set up this feature (which only needs to be done once), first enter emergency contact information into the Health app. Next, launch Settings and tap the Emergency SOS option. From the Emergency SOS submenu (see Figure 15.22), turn on the virtual switch associated with Auto Call.


FIGURE 15.22
After you set up the Emergency SOS feature, it's available to you anytime it's needed.

 Tip
From the Health app, you're able to sign up as an organ donor through an organization called Donate Life. To do this, launch the Health app, tap the Medical ID icon, and then scroll to the bottom of the screen. Tap the Sign Up with Donate Life button, and follow the on-screen prompts.

Discovering What the Home App Can Do
One of the most exciting uses of the iPhone (and iPad) is the ability to use it as a wireless and programmable remote control for various "smart" devices and appliances in your home. Over the past few years, third-party companies have released a wide range of "smart products," and many more continue to be introduced. Following are some of the product categories:
 Light bulbs and light fixtures
 Door locks
 Garage door openers
 In-home security systems
 Kitchen appliances (including refrigerators and convection ovens)
 Smoke, carbon monoxide, and air quality detectors/monitors
 Thermostats
 Video door bells
 Video surveillance and baby/pet monitors
 Washers and dryers
 Programmable and remotely controllable electrical outlets
When you purchase a "smart" device that you want to control from anywhere using your Internet-connected iPhone or iPad, you need to download and install the proprietary app that comes with the "smart" equipment. In other words, you'd use one app to control your home's lighting, and another to control the thermostat, for example. However, the Home app that comes preinstalled with iOS 11 is designed to work seamlessly with the apps that are designed to work with all "smart" equipment that's HomeKit-compatible.

 Tip
For "smart" equipment or devices to work with the Home app, look for the HomeKit logo on the product's packaging. Some smart equipment functions perfectly using an Internet-connected iPhone or iPad with a product-specific app installed, but it won't work in conjunction with the Home app.

The Home app allows you to control multiple smart devices, of different types and from different manufacturers, from a single app. Using the app, you can program settings that you can activate with a single icon tap, or you can set up automations so smart devices function based on specific times or your current location.

 Note
When you're in your home, to control smart devices from your iPhone or iPad, the mobile device must be linked with your in-home wireless network via Wi-Fi. When you're out and about (anywhere in the world), most of these smart devices can be controlled or programmed from your mobile device when it's linked to the Internet via a cellular data or Wi-Fi connection.


 More Info
For information on how to use the Home app, visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204893 or consult with the owner's manual for the smart equipment you've purchased.








16. iOS 11 and Apple Pay Security and Privacy Strategies

In this Chapter
 Setting up and using the Passcode feature
 Unlocking your iPhone or iPad using the Touch ID sensor
 Setting up and using Apple Pay
 Employing additional security and privacy strategies

Every day, people rely on their iPhones or iPads to store a vast amount of highly personal information that they wouldn't necessarily want friends and family, much less cybercriminals to see or have access to. With each new version of the iOS operating system, new and more advanced security features are added to keep unauthorized people from accessing your mobile device and to keep private the information you store within your device.
There are two important things you need to consider when it comes to iPhone and iPad-related security.
 It's your responsibility to turn on and use the majority of the security features that are provided to you. If they remain turned off, or they're not set up properly, they simply won't work.
 Human error, not the technology you use, is the most frequent cause of security breaches when it comes to securing your personal information, protecting yourself against identity theft, and keeping yourself from becoming a victim of online-based fraud or crime.
This chapter helps you turn on and properly set up some of the most useful security and privacy features offered by iOS 11 on your iPhone or iPad. The chapter also includes strategies you can implement to ensure your private information stays private and the content you choose to share is shared only with the appropriate people.

 What's New
If you're an iPhone X user, you can take advantage of the new Face ID feature to unlock your phone, verify a purchase, or use Apple Pay, rather than using Touch ID to scan your fingerprint.
Face ID uses the phone's TrueDepth camera system on the front of the device to recognize your face. To use Apple Pay, for example, double-click the side button on the phone to activate Apple Pay and then look at your iPhone X's screen.
It is still necessary, however, to set up and occasionally use the Passcode feature when working with an iPhone X.

Setting Up the Passcode Feature
The first time you turn on a new iPhone or iPad, part of the setup procedure involves you creating a six-digit passcode that you use to unlock your iPhone or iPad each time you turn it on or wake it up from sleep mode. To keep unauthorized people from picking up and using your mobile device, set up and turn on this feature when prompted to do so.

 Note
When the passcode feature is turned on, anytime your iPhone or iPad is turned on or woken up from sleep mode, you're required to manually enter the passcode you've created to unlock and use your mobile device (as shown in Figure 16.1 on an iPhone).
If you also turn on the Touch ID option, instead of manually entering the passcode, you're able to use the Touch ID sensor built into the Home button of your device to scan your fingerprint and unlock your iPhone or iPad from the Lock screen. Refer to Chapter 2, "Customize Your iPad or iPhone" for directions on how to customize the Lock and Home screen of your mobile device. iPhone X users can use the Face ID feature to unlock their phones.


FIGURE 16.1
With the Passcode feature turned on, anyone who turns on or wakes up your iPhone or iPad needs to enter the correct passcode to unlock the device and begin using it.
When you set up your iPhone or iPad, you see the Create a Passcode screen, which prompts you to create and enter a six-digit passcode. Make sure you create a code that you'll remember, but make it something that won't be obvious to people who know you. (In other words, don't use your birthday, anniversary date, spouse's birthday, pet's birthday, or child's birthday.)
Alternatively, tap Passcode Options to choose a different method of securing your device:
 Create Alphanumeric Code—Create a passcode using numbers and letters rather than just numbers. For maximum security, choose a code that includes at least eight characters, incorporates numbers and letters, and uses upper- and lowercase letters. Again, don't choose something obvious, such as the word "password" (which is the most common password that people choose when given the option to create a password).
 Custom Numeric Code—Create a numeric passcode with any number of digits. You're not limited to four or six digits.
 4-Digit Numeric Code—Create a passcode that uses just four digits. Yes, it'll be easier to remember, but a shorter passcode is also potentially easier for someone else to figure out.
 Don't Use Passcode—Turn off the passcode feature altogether. When you do this, your device doesn't need to be unlocked, so anyone can pick up your iPhone or iPad and begin using it immediately. Deactivating the passcode feature is not recommended!

 Tip
If you suspect someone has discovered your passcode, change it by launching Settings, tapping Touch ID & Passcode, entering your existing passcode, and then tapping Change Passcode. You're prompted to enter your old passcode and then required to create a new six-digit passcode and enter it twice.
Changing your passcode at least once a month is a good added security measure.
From the Passcode Lock submenu screen within Settings (see Figure 16.2), also tap Require Passcode and make sure the Immediately option is selected. This ensures that anytime your iPhone or iPad is turned off or goes into sleep mode, when it's turned back on, the passcode is required to unlock the device.


 Tip
After you've activated the Passcode feature, also turn on the Erase Data feature. If an unauthorized person steals your iPhone or iPad and fails to enter your current passcode 10 times in a row, your mobile device automatically erases itself, ensuring that the person who has taken possession of your mobile device can't access your personal information, data, photos, and files.
To turn on this feature, launch Settings, tap Touch ID & Passcode, and then scroll to the bottom of the Passcode Lock submenu screen. Turn on the virtual switch associated with the Erase Data option (refer to Figure 16.2). This only needs to be set up once.
As an added precaution, if you have the Find My feature turned on and your iPhone or iPad is lost or stolen, you also have the option of remotely erasing the content of the device. Read Chapter 7, "Use iCloud and the Files App," for more information.


FIGURE 16.2
The Passcode Lock submenu screen within Settings on an iPad Pro.
Setting Up the Touch ID Sensor to Unlock Your Phone
The first time you turn on and set up your new iPhone or iPad (with the exception of the iPhone X), you're prompted to set up the Touch ID sensor to be able to scan your fingerprint. When you scan your fingerprint, you can use it to unlock your device instead of entering a password. You can also use your fingerprint to authorize Apple Pay purchases.

 Note
The Touch ID sensor is only built into the iPhone 5s or later phone models, the iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, and all iPad Pro models.


 Tip
During the setup process, if you have an iPhone or iPad that includes the Touch ID feature, it's a good strategy to scan and store the fingerprint from both of your thumbs, as well as your index finger(s). This allows you to easily reach the Home button with any one of these fingers to unlock the device or authorize a purchase.

Even if you turn on the Touch ID sensor and store your fingerprint, you can still unlock the mobile device using the passcode that you've created and stored. Your fingerprint scan is stored internally within your iPhone or iPad, within a separate chip. It's never shared with Apple or third-parties.
When the Touch ID screen is displayed, tap Continue to scan your fingerprint. When the Place Your Finger screen appears, follow the on-screen prompts to place your finger on the Home button and then lift it repeatedly.
Next, you see the Adjust Your Grip screen. Tap Continue. You're prompted to repeat the process using the same finger while holding the iPhone or iPad slightly differently. Again, follow the on-screen prompts. When the Complete message appears, your fingerprint is securely stored within your mobile device.
After the initial setup process is complete, you can always add fingerprints for yourself or for other people whom you trust to use your mobile device by following these steps:
1. Launch Settings.
2. Tap the Touch ID & Password option.
3. Enter your passcode when promoted.
4. Under the Fingerprints heading of the Passcode Lock submenu (refer to Figure 16.2), tap the Add a Fingerprint option to add a new fingerprint and then follow the on-screen prompts.

 Note
If you're an iPhone X user, instead of setting up Touch ID to recognize your fingerprint, you set up the Face ID feature, so the front-facing camera can use face recognition to confirm your identity in the future.


 Tip
To rename or delete a stored fingerprint, tap Settings, tap Touch ID & Passcode, and then under the Fingerprints heading tap the stored fingerprint you want to modify. You can rename the fingerprint (such as Thumb-Right Hand, Thumb-Left Hand) or tap Delete Fingerprint to erase that fingerprint from your mobile device. Once you do this, that fingerprint no longer works with the device's Touch ID sensor.


 Tip
iOS 11 allows you to determine what a successful fingerprint scan using the Touch ID sensor can be used for. The three options include unlocking your iPhone/iPad, authorizing Apple Pay purchases, and authorizing iTunes Store, App Store, or iBook Store purchases. To turn on or off any of these options, launch Settings, tap Touch ID & Passcode, and then turn on or off the virtual switch associated with each option below the Use Touch ID For heading.

Adjusting the Lock Screen Settings
When you first turn on your iPhone or iPad, or wake it up from sleep mode, the first thing that appears is the Lock screen. Depending on how you set up your device, the device has either limited or no functionality until you unlock the device by successfully entering the correct passcode or using the Touch ID sensor built into the Home button.
To determine what functionality is possible from the Lock screen without first unlocking the device, launch Settings, tap Touch ID & Passcode, and then from the Passcode Lock submenu screen (refer to Figure 16.2), scroll down to the Allow Access When Locked heading. You can turn adjust the virtual switches for the following eight options:
 Today View—When turned on, upcoming events stored in the Calendar app for the current day, immediately pending items from the Reminders app, as well as other apps that manage your schedule and appointments are automatically displayed on the Lock screen.
 Recent Notifications—When turned on, alerts, alarms, and notifications generated by any apps on your mobile device that were created while your iPhone or iPad was turned off or in sleep mode are displayed on the Lock screen.
 Control Center—When turned on, you can access the Control Center (and most functionality offered by the Control Center) from the Lock screen without first unlocking the device. Keep in mind that when this feature is enabled, anyone who happens to pick up your device can access the Control Center tools from the Lock screen.
 Siri—When turned on, from the Lock screen, you can access Siri and issue verbal questions or commands without first unlocking the iPhone or iPad. Some Siri functionality, such as the ability to make calls, is restricted unless the phone is first unlocked.
 Home Control—When turned on, you can control smart devices in your home (using the Home app) without first unlocking your iPhone or iPad.
 Return Missed Calls—If someone calls you via a voice call to your iPhone, or a video (or voice) call via FaceTime on your iPhone or iPad, but you don't answer, a notification of the missed call is displayed on the Lock screen (if you have Notifications for the Phone and FaceTime apps set up to display on the Lock screen). Turn on the Return Missed Calls feature to launch the Phone or FaceTime app and return the missed call without first unlocking your iPhone or iPad.
 Reply with Message (iPhone Only)—Anytime you receive an incoming call on your iPhone, you have the option to respond to the caller with a stock text message. For example, the message might say, "I am driving and can't talk," or "I'm in a meeting and will call you later." If you want to be able to send these instant replies from the Lock screen without first unlocking the iPhone, turn on this feature.
 Wallet (iPhone Only)—If you have Apple Pay set up, or you store other types of membership or customer loyalty cards within the Wallet app of your iPhone, enable this feature to be able to quickly open the Wallet app from the Lock screen by double-pressing the Home button. Keep in mind that with this feature enabled an unauthorized person might be able to open the Wallet app, but because his fingerprint is not stored within your phone, he won't be able to authorize any purchases or view the account numbers for the debit or credit cards you have stored within the Wallet app.

 Tip
The apps installed on your iPhone or iPad, along with a handful of core iOS 11 features are able to generate alerts, alarms, and notifications to get your attention. Based on how you set up your mobile device, this information can automatically be displayed on the Lock screen, which means that anyone who happens to be looking at your device's screen can see this information.
In addition to the controls offered from below the Allow Access When Locked heading of the Passcode Lock submenu within Settings, you can also adjust the Notifications option(s) related to individual apps.
To do this, launch Settings, tap the Notifications option, and then tap each app listed below the Notification Style heading. If you do not want Notifications for the selected app to be displayed on the Lock screen, be sure to turn off the virtual switch associated with the Show On Lock Screen option.

Taking Advantage of iOS 11's Restrictions Features
If you have kids, you might sometimes allow them to play a game, listen to music, watch a movie, or access their social media account(s) from your smartphone or tablet. However, you might want to prevent your kids from accessing any other content stored within your device, making online purchases, or using apps that you haven't approved. You might also occasionally want to allow adult family members or friends to use certain features of your mobile device while keeping everything else private.
The way to do this is to utilize iOS 11's customizable Restrictions features (which are also sometimes referred to as Parental Controls). To set up Restrictions, launch Settings, tap General, and then tap Restrictions. Tap the Enable Restrictions option. When prompted, create a four-digit passcode. Keep this code private. In other words, do not allow your kids (or the other people who use your iPhone or iPad) to discover this code. When prompted, enter the same code a second time to confirm it.

 Caution
If you forget the Restrictions code, there is no way to recover it and regain full access to your mobile device. You need to erase your device, set it up as a new device, and then manually restore apps and data. If you restore from a backup that was created after the Restrictions feature was activated, when you restore your device, the Restrictions are restored and remain active.

The master Restrictions feature is now enabled. Scroll down the Restrictions submenu screen (see Figure 16.3), and turn on or off the virtual switch associated with each option. When a feature or option is turned on, the other person using your iPhone or iPad is able to use that app or feature. When the virtual switch is turned off, the other person using your mobile device doesn't have access to that app or feature. For example, if you want someone else to be able to use your iPhone or iPad only to take pictures using the Camera app, turn on the virtual switch associated with Camera, but turn off all the other virtual switches.

FIGURE 16.3
The Restrictions submenu screen within Settings allows you to determine exactly what someone can do while working with your mobile device.
Scroll down on the Restrictions submenu screen to the Allowed Content heading to control what types of content other users can access while using your iPhone or iPad. For example, you can prevent your kids from listening to podcasts or music with explicit lyrics or watching TV shows or movies (from the iTunes Store) that have specific ratings. You can also prevent them from visiting websites featuring adult content or using Siri for anything that involves explicit language. Tap each listing below the Allowed Content heading and select adjustments that you're comfortable with based on the age of the person who will be using your mobile device or your relationship with them.
Under the Privacy heading of the Restrictions submenu, you can adjust specific iOS 11 and app-related functions that you want to prevent other people from using, such as the ability to access or edit your Contacts app's database, your Calendar, content within the Reminders app, or the digital photos stored within the Photos app.
In the Allow Changes section of the Restrictions submenu are additional iOS 11-related functions that you can prevent others from altering. At the bottom of this menu are Game Center-related options (which relate to online multiplayer games) that you can prevent other people, such as your kids, from adjusting. For example, you can allow them to play an online multiplayer game, but only with "friends" whom you have preapproved.
Once all of the Restrictions options are adjusted, only a person who knows the four-digit Restrictions code you created has full access to your iPhone or iPad (so don't share that four-digit code with others!). Other people are limited in terms of what they can do while using your device, based on the Restrictions you've imposed.

 Tip
To turn off the Restrictions feature, launch Settings, tap General, tap Restrictions, tap Disable Restrictions, and, when prompted, enter the four-digit Restrictions Passcode you created.


 Note

Customizing iOS 11's Privacy Settings
One of the great things about iOS 11 is that the apps installed on your iPhone or iPad are designed to interact with and seamlessly share data with each other, and, at times, share information with websites or third parties. However, you have some control over which apps access what information and how that information is shared.
To adjust Privacy-related settings, which includes when and how your iPhone or iPad is able to share your exact location using its built-in GPS capabilities, launch Settings and tap the Privacy option.
On the Privacy submenu (Figure 16.4), there are a dozen main features that you can control, starting with Location Services. Location Services manages the GPS capabilities built into your iPhone or iPad. When Location Services is turned on, your iPhone keeps continuous tabs on your exact location. The location information can be used or shared automatically with apps based on permissions you've granted from the Privacy submenu.

FIGURE 16.4
The Privacy submenu screen within Settings on an iPad Pro.

 Tip
From the Privacy submenu within Settings, tap Location Services and then turn on the virtual switch associated with the Location Services feature at the top of submenu. Then scroll down and adjust which compatible apps will be able to access your location information.

iOS 11 and all of the various apps installed within your mobile device use location information many different ways. The Maps app relies on Location Services to figure out where you are at any given moment and provide accurate, turn-by-turn directions that lead you to your intended destination. The Camera app can use Location Services every time you snap a photo to store the exact location (along with the time and date) where the photo was taken (and can later use this information to organize your images).
When you add a meeting or event location to the Calendar app, your iPhone or iPad can determine how long it will take you to reach your next appointment location, based on your current location, and then suggest the best time to leave (after determining current traffic conditions). If you use the Uber app to call for a ride, it uses Location Services to automatically pinpoint your exact pickup location.

 Caution
One thing to be cautious of is using Location Services in conjunction with social media services, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or SnapChat. As you create a posting or publish a photo online using your mobile device, by default, these services are typically set up to share your exact location as part of your post. This is great if you're on vacation and want to share with people where you are, but it can be a security risk if you're posting public messages (that strangers can see) from your home, office, school, or hotel room.
Make sure you understand which apps and iOS 11 features are using the GPS capabilities built into your mobile device. You can check this either from the social media apps you use to manage your accounts or from the Location Services submenu within Settings.

In addition to Location Services, there are other privacy settings that you can adjust for individual apps. Go to Settings and tap Privacy. Then tap each option on the Privacy submenu to determine which apps or online services have access to specific information. For example, if you tap the listing for the Contacts app, you see that apps like Instagram, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Skype, and SnapChat are able to access your personal Contacts database and use information from your Contacts entries. To terminate permission for specific apps to access your Contacts database, tap the Contacts listing from the Privacy menu and then turn off the virtual switches for the listed apps that you don't want to be able to access your Contacts database.
Making Payments from Your Mobile Device
If you're making purchases through the iTunes Store, the App Store to acquire paid apps, or the iBook Store, anytime you approve a purchase, payment is made either using the credit card or debit card you have linked with your Apple ID account or a prepaid iTunes gift card. You need to set up payment information associated with your accounts.
Adding or Updating Payment Details for Your Apple ID
No matter how many Apple devices you have, you need only one Apple ID account. To add or update the debit/card card information associated with your Apple ID account, launch Settings, tap the iTunes & App Store option, tap your Apple ID username near the top of the iTunes & App Store submenu, and then tap the View Apple ID option in the Apple ID pop-up window.
You're prompted to provide your Apple ID password or sign into the account by scanning your fingerprint via the Touch ID sensor. Tap Payment Information. Choose to use a credit or debit card or to link your Apple ID with a PayPal account (a new option added in iOS 11). If you selected the credit/debit card option, in the appropriate fields, provide your card number, expiration date, and the card's CVV security code, along with your first and last name and your billing address. Tap Done when you've filled in the required fields.

 Tip
You can also manage your Apple ID, look up a forgotten password, change your password, and update payment information from any computer's web browser. Visit https://appleid.apple.com to do this.

After payment information is linked with your Apple ID, anytime you want to make a purchase from one of the Apple stores, you can approve the purchases simply by providing your Apple ID password or using your device's Touch ID when prompted.
Setting Up Apple Pay
Apple Pay is an electronic payment service that can be linked with a participating debit or credit card so you can use it in a secure way to make online purchases, as well as purchases from tens of thousands of retail locations across the United States and in a growing number of countries around the world.
There are several reasons why using Apple Pay is more secure than making a purchase using a traditional (plastic) debit or credit card. The merchants don't see your name or receive your actual credit/debit card number, expiration date, security code, or card PIN. The card issuer processes the payment using an encrypted code. Also, a purchase can be authorized only by you via Apple Pay using the Touch ID sensor to scan your fingerprint. In other words, even if someone steals your device, they can't access your card details or use the card without your fingerprint scan.
Meanwhile, if your traditional (plastic) credit or debit card is stolen, the thief could use that card to make purchases until you call the card issuer and report the missing card. Unauthorized use of a credit/debit card by someone else, and potential identity theft, is a much lesser threat when you use Apple Pay.
The process for setting up Apple Pay for a particular debit or credit card varies based on the participating bank or financial institution that issued your card. To activate the Apple Pay service on your mobile device, launch Settings, tap the Wallet & Apple Pay option, and then tap the Add Credit or Debit Card option.

 Note
To use Apple Pay, your iPhone or iPad must be signed into an active iCloud account.

Follow the on-screen prompts to link your credit or debit cards, one at a time, with Apple Pay. Start by tapping the Continue button from the Apple Pay introduction pop-up window (shown in Figure 16.5). Then, as you're making a purchase, select which card you want to use, and authorize the purchase by scanning your fingerprint via the iPhone or iPad's Touch ID sensor (build into the Home button). iPhone X users simply need to look at their phone's screen at the appropriate time to authorize a purchase.

FIGURE 16.5
When linking a credit or debit card with Apple Pay, you can either scan your card using the iPhone or iPad's built-in camera or manually enter your card information when prompted.

 Note
Many of the more recently released iPad Pro and iPad mini models support Apple Pay but only when you use it to make online purchases from supporting websites or when you're making in-app purchases. You cannot currently make Apple Pay purchases at retail stores using any iPad.

After you store information about at least one compatible credit or debit card in the Wallet app, use the app to make purchases/payments using Apple Pay at participating retail stores, when making in-app purchases (in compatible apps), or when making online purchases (from participating websites).
In a retail store, instead of handing a retail store's cashier your plastic debit or credit card, you simply need to hold your iPhone close to the cash register or credit card swiper, launch the Wallet app, select the debit or credit card you want to pay with (or use the app's default card that you preselect), and then place your finger on the iPhone's Touch ID sensor to authorize the purchase and make your payment (see Figure 16.6).

FIGURE 16.6
Select the credit or debit card you want to use (or use what you've set as your default card), and then place your finger on the iPhone's Touch ID sensor (Home button).

 More Info
Not all debit or credit card issuers (banks and financial institutions) currently support Apple Pay, although the list of supporting card issuers in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia-Pacific countries is growing rapidly. To determine whether your card issuer supports Apple Pay, enter your debit or credit card information into the Wallet app, or visit https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204916.
To view an up-to-date list of retail stores, supermarkets, restaurant chains (and fast food establishments), pharmacies, and hotels, for example, that currently accept Apple Pay, visit www.apple.com/apple-pay/where-to-use-apple-pay.


 Note
If you're using Apple Pay to make a debit or credit card purchase at a retail store, you might be required to enter the PIN associated with the card or provide a signature to complete a transaction. This varies and is determined by your financial institution, the retailer where you're making the purchase, and the amount of the purchase.

Adding Card Details to the Wallet App
To add one or more credit or debit cards to the Wallet app, which is a process you need to do only once per card, tap the + icon to the right of the Apple Pay heading when you launch the Wallet app (see Figure 16.7). The phone must have Internet access to proceed.
Tap Next in the top-right corner of the Add Card screen. The rear-facing camera of your iPhone becomes active. In a well-lit area, position your plastic credit or debit card within the onscreen frame, and your iPhone automatically scans the card and imports your name and card number into the Wallet app. Confirm the displayed information and tap Next.

 Tip
To manually enter credit or debit card details instead of scanning the card, tap the Enter Card Details Manually option displayed at the bottom of the screen.


FIGURE 16.7
The Wallet app is used to manage your debit and credit cards that you link with Apple Pay, as well as membership cards and customer loyalty cards from participating companies and organizations, like AAA and Starbucks.
You see the Card Details screen; enter the Expiration Date and CVV security code from your card. At this point, the verification process varies based on the card issuer. Follow the onscreen prompts to complete the verification process.

 Note
Some card issuers require you to call the customer service number on the card verification screen to activate your card in the Wallet app for use with Apple Pay.

After the credit or debit card has been verified and activated by your card issuer, a digital version of that card (that displays only the last four digits of the card number) is displayed in the Wallet app. You're now ready to use that credit or debit card to make Apple Pay purchases. If you want to add additional cards to the Wallet app, repeat this process for each card.

 Note
If you have an Apple Watch linked with your iPhone, after adding a new credit/debit card to the Wallet app, you're asked if you want the new card to be activated on the Wallet app in your smartwatch as well.


 Tip
There are two ways to set the default card, which is the one preselected each time you launch the Wallet app.
 Place your finger on one of the virtual cards displayed under the Apple Pay heading, hold your finger down on the screen, and drag that card's graphic to the top of the pile. A message is displayed stating that the card you selected and placed at the top of the pile is now your default card.
 Launch Settings, tap the Wallet & Apple Pay option, and then tap the Default Card option below the Transaction Defaults heading. Be sure to customize the Shipping Address, Email, and Phone Number fields as well.

Once you have one or more credit or debit cards stored in the Wallet app, when you're ready to make a payment at a retail location, launch the Wallet app and select the card you want to use by tapping the graphic for a card displayed below the Apple Pay heading.
When prompted by the cashier, hold the iPhone up to the cash register or credit card swiper, and then place your finger on the iPhone's Touch ID sensor for a few seconds to authorize the payment. If you're an iPhone X user, press the iPhone's Side button twice to activate Apple Pay, and then look at your smartphone's screen to use the face recognition feature.

 Note
When making an in-app or online purchase, you're prompted to confirm an Apple Pay payment by placing your finger on the phone's Touch ID sensor.

Once a purchase is finalized, a confirmation message is always displayed on your iPhone's screen.

 Tip
There are three ways to launch the Wallet app on your iPhone:
 Tap the Wallet app icon from the Home screen.
 From the Lock screen, quickly double-press the Home button, without first having to unlock the phone, to manually launch the Wallet app. Be sure to turn on the virtual switch associated with the Double-Click Home Button option, which is in Settings, Wallet & Apple Pay.
 Customize the Control Center to include the Wallet app icon, and launch the Wallet app from the Control Center. Launch Settings, tap Control Center, tap Customize Control, and then under the More Controls heading tap the + icon associated with the Wallet app. Once the Wallet app is listed under the Include heading, use the move icon displayed to the right of the listing to customize the app icon's placement within the Control Center.
To delete or edit a credit or debit card stored in the Wallet app, launch Settings, tap the Wallet & Apple Pay option, and then tap the listing for a card that appears below the Cards heading. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and tap Remove Card.

To change the Billing Address associated with the card, tap the Billing Address option.
Using the Wallet App to Manage Reward Cards, Membership Cards, and More
A growing number of retail stores and organizations that have iPhone apps also allow users to manage their reward or membership cards from the Wallet app. For example, Dunkin' Donuts, Walgreen's, Panera, and AAA were among the first companies and organizations to support the Wallet app for this purpose. To use this functionality, it is often necessary to also install the app from that company. Following are some other uses for the Wallet app:
 Most of the major airlines enable you to store Frequent Flier membership cards in the Wallet app and also manage digital versions of upcoming flight boarding passes.
 Ticket services, such as Ticketmaster and Live Nation, enable you to store digital tickets you purchase online in the Wallet app and present those tickets at the event.
 Many movie theater chains allow you to prepurchase movie tickets and store them in Wallet, and those that have reward programs also support the Wallet app to store membership card details, so you can view, manage, and redeem reward points earned from within the app.

 Tip
To add membership or reward card details from participating companies and organizations into the Wallet app, launch the app and tap the + icon next to the Passes heading. Next, scan the plastic card into the Wallet app by tapping the Scan Code to Add a Pass option.
Alternatively, import the appropriate information directly from the store or organization's own iPhone app. Directions for how to do this are supplied in the compatible app.

After you set up Apple Pay to work with the Wallet app and begin storing compatible company/organization reward and membership cards in the app, you'll quickly discover that not only is Apple Pay more secure than making a purchase using a traditional, plastic credit/debit card, but the checkout process is typically faster, and you can dramatically slim down your actual wallet.

 More Info
To learn more about how Apple Pay and the Wallet app work, visit www.apple.com/apple-pay.


 Tip
To delete a card that's stored in the Wallet app, view that card with the app and then tap the Info (i) icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen; then tap Delete.

Employing Additional Security and Privacy Strategies
Setting up the Passcode and Touch ID features to unlock your iPhone or iPad are easy security steps you can take to help protect the content that's stored within your mobile device. The following are additional security-related strategies you can implement to further protect yourself, your identity, your financial transactions, and your activities when using an iPhone or iPad.
Create and Use a Virtual Private Network
If you'll be surfing the Web, engaging in online shopping, handling online banking, or sending/receiving emails from your mobile device that's connected to a public Wi-Fi hotspot, one of the easiest ways you can add a strong added layer of protection between yourself and cybercriminals is to install and use a virtual private network (VPN) app on your mobile device. You turn it on anytime you're connected to the Internet—especially from a public Wi-Fi hotspot. A VPN can work with any type of Wi-Fi or cellular data connection, however.
In some cases, your home or work Internet service provider may provide a VPN, in which case you can configure it to work with your iPhone or iPad. To do this, launch Settings, tap General, and then tap VPN. Tap the Add VPN Configuration option and enter the required information that's been provided by your Internet service provider (ISP).
Alternatively, you can acquire a VPN app for your mobile device from the App Store. To find one, launch the App Store app, tap the Search icon, and type VPN or Virtual Private Network in the Search field. In many cases, VPN apps are offered for free, but you have to pay a monthly or annual fee for the service. Payment is made via an in-app purchase.
After you've installed a VPN app, it configures itself to work with your mobile device, and you can leave it on all the time, if you choose. You also can manually turn it on and off based on where you're surfing the Web and what online activities you'll be engaged in.

 Note
Norton Wi-Fi Privacy (https://us.norton.com/wifi-privacy), priced starting at $4.99 per month, is just one example of an auto-configuring VPN service that works with the iPhone and iPad.

Adjust the Privacy and Security Settings for Safari
In addition to activating a virtual private network when surfing the Web or handling online activities from your iPhone or iPad, be sure to manually customize the Privacy settings associated with the Safari web browser. Launch Settings, tap Safari, and then scroll down to the Privacy & Security heading.

 Note
Read Chapter 13, "Surf the Web More Efficiently Using Safari," for more information about Safari's Privacy and Security settings. If you plan to use another web browser on your iPhone or iPad, such as Google Chrome or Firefox, be sure to manually adjust the privacy and security settings associated with the web browser you use.
For example, from the iOS version of the Chrome web browser, tap the Menu icon in the top-right corner of the screen and then select the Settings option. From the Settings menu, tap the Privacy option and adjust the various settings as you deem necessary. Also tap the Content Settings option and adjust those settings as well.

Turn Off Airdrop When You're Not Using It
As you learned from Chapter 6, "Sync, Share, and Print Files Using AirDrop, AirPlay, AirPrint, and Handoff," you can wirelessly share certain app-specific content with other Mac and iOS mobile devices using AirDrop. However, if you have AirDrop's Everyone setting active and you leave AirDrop turned on, when you're out and about in public, total strangers could potentially send you files, photos, or content without your permission.
As a safety precaution, turn off AirDrop until you're ready to use it, and then turn the feature off when you're done. The easiest way to do this is by tapping the AirDrop icon in the Control Center. You can then select one of three options: Receiving Off, Contacts Only, or Everyone (shown in Figure 16.8). Choose the Receiving Off feature when you don't need to be using AirDrop.

FIGURE 16.8
Select the Receiving Off option when not using AirDrop.
Don't Use Carplay with Your iPhone in Other People's Cars
CarPlay, which enables your iPhone to link directly with a vehicle's infotainment system, is a powerful feature that makes using your iPhone while driving much safer. This is a very useful feature if you link your iPhone with your own vehicle. However, because every car manufacturer utilizes CarPlay differently, do not use this feature to link your iPhone with someone else's car or a rental car.
In some cases, as soon as a CarPlay link is established, content from various apps installed on your iPhone, including Contacts, Calendar, Music, and Messages, is transferred, synced, and stored within the car's infotainment system. If this syncing process happens within a rental car, and you return the car without manually resetting the CarPlay feature within the vehicle, your entire Contacts database could be accessible by people who rent that vehicle in the future.

 More Info
For more information about the CarPlay feature, how to set it up, and how to use it with your vehicle, refer to the owner's manual for your vehicle, check with your dealership, or visit www.apple.com/ios/carplay.
To determine which vehicle makes and models support CarPlay (the list is always expanding), visit www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models.

Don't Ever Share Your iCloud Password
Many of the apps that come preinstalled with iOS 11, along with an ever-growing selection of third-party apps, now sync and share data with your free iCloud account. Because so much personal—and potentially private—information, documents, data, files, content, and photos are being stored in the cloud, it's important to protect your iCloud account password information and not share it with anyone.
In most cases, your iCloud account username and password is the same as your Apple ID username and password. You should get into the habit of changing this password at least once per month, or more often if you believe your account password has been compromised.
As you learned from Chapter 7, "Use iCloud and the Files App," in addition to manually storing data, documents, files, and photos within iCloud Drive (which is part of your iCloud account), you can set up iCloud to create and maintain a complete backup of your iPhone or iPad, plus sync app-specific data relating to Photos, Mail (your iCloud email account only), Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Notes, Safari, News, Home, Game Center, Siri, iCloud Keychain, iBooks, Maps, and other popular apps.
While Apple and iOS 11 strongly encourages iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and HomePod users to use iCloud, this is not a requirement. You can select which iCloud features to turn on. To do this, launch Settings, tap your profile photo/Apple ID username, and then tap the iCloud option to access the iCloud Control Panel.
From below the Apps Using iCloud heading, turn on the virtual switches for apps and features you want to use iCloud for. For features you don't want to use, turn off the virtual switches. Figure 16.9 shows the iCloud Control Panel within Settings on an iPad Pro.

FIGURE 16.9
Determine which iCloud features you'd like to turn on and utilize from the iCloud Control Panel.

 Note
For all content to sync between all of your iOS mobile devices and Mac(s), the iCloud Control Panel settings need to be set up exactly the same way on each computer and device, and they need to be linked to the same iCloud account.


 Caution
You can also access online versions of several popular iOS 11/Mac apps by visiting www.icloud.com. When you sign in using your Apple ID/iCloud username and password, the online editions of the apps are populated with the latest version of your app-specific data.
Especially if you're accessing iCloud.com from a computer that's not your own, be sure to sign off from the website when you're done using it. To sign out from the iCloud website, click your username/profile photo in the top-right corner of the browser window, and then click Sign Out.


 Tip
To change your Apple ID/iCloud password, from your iPhone or iPad, launch Settings, tap your Apple ID username/profile photo, and tap Password & Security. When promoted, enter your current Apple ID/iCloud password, and then tap the Change Password option. Follow the on-screen prompts. Alternatively, from any computer's web browser, visit https://appleid.apple.com.

Turn On the Find My Feature
One of the iCloud features you should definitely turn on right away, if you haven't already done so, is the Find My feature. As long as this feature is turned on, and your iPhone or iPad is powered on and connected to the Internet, you have the ability to track the exact location of your device if you lose it or it's stolen. This feature only needs to be turned on once, and it only works when it's turned on, so make sure to do so before your device gets lost or stolen.
To turn on the Find My feature, launch Settings, tap your Apple ID/iCloud username/profile photo, tap iCloud, and then scroll down within the iCloud Control Panel and tap Find My iPhone or Find My iPad. Turn on the virtual switch for the feature. From this submenu screen, turn on the virtual switch associated with the Send Last Location feature.
When turned on, if your iPhone or iPad battery is about to go dead, one of the last things the device does is transmit its exact location to your iCloud account, so you can access it using the Find My feature.
If you wind up needing to pinpoint the location of your lost or stolen iPhone or iPad, lock down the device, remotely erase its content, or handle a variety of related tasks, you have two options. From any computer's web browser, visit www.icloud.com/#find, and sign into the website using your Apple ID/iCloud username and password, or from any other iOS mobile device, use the optional (free) Find My app, which is available from the App Store.
Don't Use iCloud Keychain, Unless You're the Only Person Using Your iPhone or iPad
If you're the only person who uses your iPhone or iPad, and you have the Passcode and Touch ID (or Face ID) features turned on, iCloud Keychain is an extremely convenient feature to use because it automatically stores and remembers the usernames and passwords for the majority of websites you visit. The information is synced across all the computers and mobile devices that are linked to the same iCloud account.
For security reasons, iCloud Keychain does not remember passwords for online banking and online finance-related websites, but for online shopping websites you frequent, the app securely stores and remembers the credit card information you use when making purchases from specific sites.
The downside is that if more than one person uses your iPhone or iPad, iCloud Keychain allows others to automatically sign into websites as you, which is why you should turn off the feature if you allow others to use your mobile device.

 Tip
To turn on/off iCloud Keychain, launch Settings, tap your Apple ID username/profile photo, tap iCloud, and tap the Keychain option in the iCloud Control Panel. Turn on or off the virtual switch associated with this feature.
If you use multiple Apple computers and mobile devices, tap the Advanced option and also turn on the Approve with Security Code option. Now, when you activate iCloud Keychain on your other computers or mobile devices for the first time, you're required to enter an iCloud Security Code that you've set. With this feature enabled, even if someone hacks your Apple ID and password, they still need the iCloud Security Code to activate or access your iCloud Keychain information, which is stored as a standalone encrypted file within your online-based iCloud account.

Turn On iCloud's Two-Factor Authentication
During the initial iPhone/iPad setup process, after you enter your Apple ID and related password (which is also your iCloud username and password), you're prompted to turn on Two-Factor Authentication, which is an optional feature. When the feature is turned on, anytime you enter your Apple ID and password for the first time on a new computer or mobile device, you're required to verify your identity with a six-digital authentication code that is automatically displayed on one of your other computers or mobile device's screen that is linked to the same Apple ID account. The code can be sent to your iPhone as a text message or email. To grant access to your iCloud account from the device you're using, enter the six-digit code that's sent to you.
In the future, you're prompted for a new six-digit verification code if you sign out of your iCloud account from a device, erase your device, or opt to change your Apple ID/iCloud password.
Be Careful with Shared Online Content
You already know that iOS 11 and many of the apps you'll be using with your iPhone or iPad store, sync, and allow you to share data, documents, photos, and/or files with your online-based iCloud account, or with another cloud-based file storage/file sharing service.
Using the new Files app or the official Dropbox app (if you have a Dropbox account), for example, you're able to share individual files, or entire folders or subfolders, that are stored online with specific other people. After you share a file, folder, or subfolder with someone else (or with multiple people), those other people have access to that content from their own computer(s) and/or mobile device(s) until you revoke their access.
As a cloud-computing user, it's your responsibility to keep track of which files, folders, and subfolders you're sharing with other people and to grant or revoke access to content as you deem necessary. It's also your responsibility to ensure that you populate folders or subfolders that you opt to share with the correct data, documents, files, content, or photos. Human error is the greatest cause of people accidently being granted access to information they shouldn't be given access to because the user accidently drag and drops, copies and pastes, or somehow transfers specific files or content into the wrong folder or subfolder.

 Caution
Each time you opt to share content using the Files app, or any other cloud computing app, double-check that you've selected the correct files to share and that you've placed them into the correct folder (or subfolder) to be shared. Next, confirm that the file(s), folder(s), or subfolder(s) are set up to be shared with the correct people.
If you often use a particular file-sharing tool, you might want to get into the habit of reviewing your entire cloud-based account once per day, once per week, or, at the very least, once per month, to double-check that all files are stored in the correct places and that you have not accidently granted access to the wrong people to access specific content or files they were not intended to see or have access to.

Don't Worry About "Ransomware" or Viruses on Your iPhone or iPad
One of the great things about working with an iOS mobile device is that it's extremely difficult, if not almost impossible, for a hacker or cybercriminal to remotely install a virus onto your iPhone or iPad. That's the good news!
The bad news is that some more creative hackers have discovered ways to trick iPhone and iPad users into thinking their mobile device has been infected by malware or ransomware. If this happens to you, do not call the phone number that appears on your screen, and do not agree to pay a fee to have the "virus" removed from your smartphone or tablet.
In the majority of cases, the hackers are manipulating the Safari web browser and locking it up, but there is almost always an easy (and free) way to fix the problem. If you run into this type of problem, call AppleCare+ (800-275-2273 or 800-MY-iPHONE), or visit any Apple Store. An Apple Genius should be able to correct the issue quickly.

 More Info
You can find step-by-step directions for how to deal with ransomware pop-ups and web pages on an iPhone or iPad on Apple's website at https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-8071.

Always use Common Sense
Compared to older versions of iOS running on older model iPhones and iPads, iOS 11 running on newer model smartphones and tablets offers more advanced security tools and built-in protections than ever before, which makes it easier to protect your mobile device, data, content, files, photos, and identity.
In addition to the technology-based tools and resources at your disposal, however, always use common sense! In other words, never give out your Apple ID username and password, your iPhone/iPad passcode, or any other usernames and passwords to other people, especially strangers.
Meanwhile, before you start using any cloud-based service to share private or sensitive information, make sure you understand how the service works and how to customize the various privacy, permission, and security settings.
When you're using social media—like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat, LinkedIn, Pinterest, or any other online service—be sure to manually set up the privacy and security settings to a level you're comfortable with. By default, these services are typically set up so when you establish your account, everything about your account, and everything you publish online, is public.
Take the time to determine who you want to see your online postings and photos and adjust the settings of your various social media accounts (using the mobile apps for each account) accordingly. Then as you communicate with your online friends, particularly people you've never met in person, never share too much personal information about yourself.

 Caution
When using any social media service, never provide personal information, such as your Social Security number, driver's license number, account password, debit or credit card details, or too much information about your private life, with people you communicate with online.
If you opt to share "private" photos with other people, keep in mind that with a single tap of the Share button, the person you've shared your private photos with can easily make them public or distribute them to whomever they want. This can all be done from a mobile device, so use common sense about what you share online, whether you're participating in a public forum or communicating with someone privately using social media, email, or the Messages app.

17. Customize Your Reading Experience with the iBooks and News Apps

In this Chapter
 Using iBooks to access the iBook Store and shop for eBooks and audiobooks
 Reading eBooks and listening to audiobooks using the iBooks app
 Customizing your information-gathering and reading experience with the News app

Thanks to Apple's iBooks app, you can easily acquire and read eBooks, listen to audiobooks, plus view PDFs on any iOS mobile device (or Mac).
If you have a Mac, iPhone, or an iPad, iBooks uses iCloud to sync your eBook, audiobook, and PDF library (and related eBook and audiobook bookmarks) between computers and iOS mobile devices that are linked to the same iCloud account. As a result, all your compatible content is available to you, regardless of which Mac or iOS device you're using. You can begin reading or listening on one device, and then pick up exactly where you left off on another.
Anything having to do with shopping for, downloading, installing, and then reading or listening to eBooks or audiobooks (that have been acquired from the Apple's iBook Store) is handled with the iBooks app.
The iBooks app has four main purposes:
 It's used to access Apple's online-based iBook Store. From iBook Store, you can browse an ever-growing collection of eBook titles (including traditional book titles from bestselling authors and major publishers that have been adapted into eBook form). Although some eBooks are free, most must be paid for.

 Tip
As with purchases from the iTunes Store or App Store, eBook and audiobook purchases made from iBook Store are charged to the credit or debit card associated with your Apple ID. You can also pay for iBook Store purchases using prepaid iTunes gift cards.

 It's used to transform your smartphone or tablet into an eBook reader. iBooks offers many features that make reading eBooks on your iOS device a pleasure. For example, when you stop reading and exit the iBooks app (by pressing the Home button), the app automatically saves the page you're on using a virtual bookmark, and then later reopens to that page when you restart the iBooks app. (Similar functionality is offered when listening to an audiobook. The app automatically remembers where you paused the playback.)

 Note
You are allowed to install copies of your eBooks and audiobooks on all computers and devices that are linked to the same iCloud account, so you do not have to purchase the same content multiple times.

 It's used to acquire and listen to audiobooks. To find and purchase audiobooks, access iBook Store, tap the Featured or Top Charts icon, and then tap the Audiobooks tab to see a listing of available audiobooks. Tap the Categories option and then choose an audiobook category to narrow your search, or use the Search field to find the title you're looking for.
 It can be used to import, view, and manage PDFs that are sent to you via email or text message, that you import from a cloud-based service (using the Files app, for example), or that you create using an app installed on your mobile device, such as Safari, Notes, or Microsoft Word.

 What's New
When viewing any web page with Safari, to create a PDF from it, tap the Share menu and then tap the Create PDF icon. To export the PDF to iBooks, tap the Share icon again, but this time tap the Copy to iBooks icon.

Customizing iBooks Settings
To customize settings related to iBooks, launch Settings and tap the iBooks option (shown in Figure 17.1 on an iPad Pro). There are a variety of options you can adjust by turning on or off the virtual switches associated with each feature.

FIGURE 17.1
Use Settings to customize a handful of options related to the iBooks app.

 Tip
At any time, an eBook's content can be updated by the book's author or publisher. By turning on the Online Content option in Settings, your iPhone or iPad can update eBooks you've already acquired if new content becomes available. Alternatively, from the iBooks app, tap the Purchased icon, and then tap the Updates option. Tap the Update button associated with each book that's listed to download that free update.

iBooks enables you to store and manage a vast library of eBooks, audiobooks, and PDFs on your iOS device. How much content you can store within the device is limited only by the storage capacity of the device itself. Plus, all your iBook Store purchases automatically are saved to your iCloud account. Thus, from your iCloud account, you can easily redownload eBook and audiobook titles you've previously purchased when you want to access a particular title that is not currently stored on your device.

 Tip
To save internal storage space, only keep eBooks or audiobooks you're actually listening to stored locally within your iPhone or iPad. The rest are stored in the cloud (via iCloud), and you can access them anytime you want as long as an Internet connection is available.

Organizing Your Personal Library
When you launch iBooks, the main My Books screen is displayed (shown in Figure 17.2 on an iPad Pro). If it's not displayed, tap the My Books icon at the bottom of the screen. You see the thumbnails of the eBook and audiobook covers in your digital library.

 Note
Audiobooks display a headphones icon in the lower-left corner of the cover image thumbnail.


 Note
With the Blurb photo book service, you can create custom printed photo books using your digital images, you can pay a few dollars more to create an iBooks-compatible eBook. Visit www.blurb.com for more information.

Tap the Collections menu near the top center of the screen to determine which titles are displayed. In Figure 17.2, the menu is labeled as All Books, which is the currently selected option. Other categories include Books, Audiobooks, or PDFs.
Select the All Books option to display all content currently stored on your mobile device.

FIGURE 17.2
Tap the My Books icon at the bottom of the iBooks screen to see your virtual bookshelf, which displays your library of eBook and audiobook titles.

 Note
When you have not yet opened a newly acquired eBook in iBooks or audiobook, a blue-and-white New banner displays on its cover thumbnail on the Library screen. If you've only downloaded the free sample for a book, a red-and-white Sample banner is displayed as part of the eBook's cover thumbnail.


 What's New
If a book in your library is part of a series, tap the thumbnail to see the thumbnail for the next title in the series. That thumbnail is labeled with a blue-and-white Next banner in the corner (see Figure 17.3).


FIGURE 17.3
iBooks displays the next eBook or audiobook in a series.
To view all content you've acquired, including titles stored in your iCloud account but not currently stored on your actual iPhone or iPad, tap the Purchased icon, select Books or Audiobooks option, and then tap the Not on This iPhone (iPad) tab. Titles in this list have an iCloud icon, which indicates they're not currently loaded on the device (see Figure 17.4). Tap the iCloud icon to download them to the device you're using.
To change how the eBooks and audiobooks are displayed on the Library screen, tap the View icon (located in the top-left corner of the screen). This allows you to toggle between the virtual bookshelf view and a listing view. The listing view displays each book's title and author, along with a tiny thumbnail of the cover artwork. When viewing the list view, tap the Bookshelf, Titles, Authors, or Categories tab at the top of the screen to quickly re-sort your titles.
Tap the Collection menu (displayed at the top-center of the screen) to manually sort your eBook, audiobook, or PDF library into separate collections, each of which can have a custom name (see Figure 17.5)

FIGURE 17.4
Quickly view all eBooks or audiobooks you've purchased and that are stored within your iCloud account but aren't stored on your device.

FIGURE 17.5
Tap the Collections menu to create new collections or sort your content library by collection type.
To create a new collection, tap + New Collection on the Collections menu (refer to Figure 17.5). Next, create a custom name for the Collection, and tap Done when you're finished typing.
After you've created additional collections, you can move content into a specific collection and organize titles in that collection. To move an eBook, audiobook, or PDF into a specific collection, return to the main Library screen and tap the Select option. Next, tap one or more thumbnails that you want to transfer from the default All Books collection into a specific collection. As each eBook, audiobook, or PDF is selected, a blue-and-white checkmark icon appears in the lower-right corner of its thumbnail.
Tap the Move icon, and when the Collections menu opens, tap the name of the collection you want to move the selected content into.

 Note
When you transfer PDFs into the iBooks app, those files are automatically placed in a specific collection, called PDFs.

To delete eBooks stored on your iPhone or iPad (but keep them in your iCloud account), from the Library screen, tap the Select option (refer to Figure 17.2), tap the content thumbnails you want to delete, and then tap the Delete option.

 Tip
An Internet connection is needed to load eBooks or audiobooks into the iBooks app from iBook Store or your iCloud account. However, after content is loaded into the app, you no longer need an Internet connection to actually read an eBook or listen to an audiobook.

Navigating the iBooks App
Along the bottom of the Library screen on an iPhone are five command icons (see Figure 17.6). Here's how to use several of these options to find the eBooks or audiobooks you're looking for from Apple's online iBook Store:
 My Books—Tap this icon to access the Library screen and view your personal content collection. Place your finger near the center of the screen and swipe down to make a Search field appear at the top of the screen. Use this tool to find any eBook or audiobook in your library by typing a keyword, title, search phrase, or author's name.
 Featured—Access the iBook Store and browse through books that Apple considers to be "featured" titles. An Internet connection is required.

FIGURE 17.6
Use the command icons at the bottom of the screen to find different types of content.

 Tip
After tapping the Featured button, scroll to the bottom of the screen to access the Apple ID [your username] button, the Redeem button, and the Send Gift button. Tap the Apple ID button to manage your Apple ID account. Tap the Redeem button to redeem iTunes gift cards and add credit to your Apple ID account. Tap Send Gift to send someone you know an eBook as a gift. You must know the recipient's email address to do this.

 Top Charts—Tap this option to display the bestselling eBooks or audiobooks in the iBook Store. Near the top of the screen, Books, Audiobooks, and Top Authors tabs are displayed. Tap the Books tab to discover multiple charts, including a chart for Paid eBooks and Free eBooks. Tap the Audiobooks tab to search for audiobooks. Tap the Top Authors tab to view an alphabetical listing of popular authors who have books available from iBook Store.
 Search—Tap the Search option to reveal a Search field, within which you can type any book title, author name, keyword, or search phrase that helps you locate a specific book. Tap any listing to view the description for that book.
 Purchased—Tap this option to quickly find and reload any eBook or audiobooks you've previously purchased or to update existing content (if applicable).
On any model iPad, there are six command icons (see Figure 17.7). The NYTimes icon enables you to browse the Fiction and Nonfiction bestsellers list from The New York Times.

 Note
These same The New York Times charts are available on the iPhone. To access NYTimes charts, tap the Top Charts option, and then scroll down to the New York Times Fiction or New York Times Non-Fiction heading. Then tap the See All option to view the complete chart.


FIGURE 17.7
The command icons on the iPad screen include options to access The New York Times bestseller lists and lists of books by top authors.

 Tip
When accessing the Featured, NYTimes, Top Charts, or Top Authors section of the iBook Store on any iPad, the Search field is in the top-right corner. On the iPhone, tap the Search command icon at the bottom of the screen to access the Search field.

The My Books, Featured, Top Charts, and Purchased command icons at the bottom of the iPad screen serve the same purpose as they do when you're using the iPhone version of iBooks.

 Tip
You can customize what you see after you tap the Top Charts icon to show titles from a specific category or genre. To choose a specific Top Chart listing, first tap the Categories option and select a specific category.


 Note
You can download and read eBooks acquired from sources other than the iBook Store using iBooks; however, the eBooks must be a compatible file format. The iBooks app works with PDFs (or eBooks in PDF format), as well as eBooks created in the industry-standard ePub format.

Navigating the iBook Store
When you're looking for something specific in the iBook Store, use the Search field to enter an eBook title, author's name, subject, or keyword that's associated with what you're looking for. Entering a specific book title reveals very specific search results. However, entering a keyword related to a topic or subject matter reveals a selection of content suggestions that might match what you're seeking.
Tap any listing to reveal a more detailed description of a particular eBook or audiobook. As you review a description, look carefully at its ratings and its written reviews.
Learning about Content from its Description
A typical eBook or audiobook listing includes the book's cover artwork, its title, and the author. An eBook or audiobook's description, however, is divided into several sections. Tap the Details, Reviews, or Related tab to view all information pertaining to a specific book.

 Note
Using iBook Store to shop for eBooks is similar to using the App Store to acquire apps or using the iTunes Store to acquire TV shows, music, or movies. Each title has a detailed description screen, ratings and reviews, and a sample of the content, which you can download for free into the iBooks app. Figure 17.8 shows a typical eBook description screen.


FIGURE 17.8
Read a detailed description of an eBook or audiobook before making your purchase and downloading it.
Use the Share icon at the upper-right corner of an eBook or audiobook's description to share details about the content with others. In the Share menu, there is also a Gift button. Tap this to purchase and send the eBook as a gift for someone else. To send a gift, you need to know the recipient's email address.

 Tip
You can preview an eBook or audiobook before paying for it. As you're looking at a book's description, tap the Sample button to download a free sample of that book. The length of the sample varies. It is usually between a few pages and a full chapter. For audiobooks, you can listen to a sample (usually several minutes' worth of material) prior to making a purchase.

Tap the Reviews option to access the iBook Store Ratings chart, which showcases the book's average star-based rating and how many ratings the book has received. You can also see this average star-based rating broken down by how many stars (from one to five) the book has received from your fellow iBook Store customers. Below the star-based ratings are more detailed, text-based reviews written by other iBook Store customers.
Purchasing an eBook or Audiobook
To quickly purchase and download an eBook or audiobook, tap its price button (which displays the price of the content). After you tap a price button, confirm your purchase decision by entering your Apple ID password; then the download begins. If your iOS mobile device is equipped with a Touch ID sensor, approve your acquisition using a fingerprint by placing your finger on the Touch ID sensor. If you're using an iPhone X, you use the Face ID feature by looking at the phone's screen when prompted to confirm the purchase.
If you're downloading a free eBook, the button label is Free rather than a price. Tap Free and then tap the Get Book button.
It typically takes about 30 seconds to download a full-length eBook to your iPhone or iPad, depending on the speed of your Internet connection and the size of the eBook's digital file. (Downloading an audiobook takes a bit longer, due to its larger file size.) As soon as the content is downloaded and ready to read or listen to, the book's front cover artwork is displayed as part of the Library screen in the iBooks app.
Customizing Your eBook Reading Experience
To begin reading an eBook you've acquired and downloaded, from the Library screen, tap a book cover thumbnail to open the eBook.
While reading eBooks, you can hold the iPhone or iPad in portrait or landscape mode. Then, as you're reading, tap anywhere on the screen to make the various command icons and buttons appear (see Figure 17.9).

 Tip
Tap the Library button to automatically save your location in an eBook and return to the Library screen.

Tap the Table of Contents icon to display an interactive table of contents for the eBook you're reading. Then tap any chapter number or chapter title to immediately jump to that location in the book. Or, near the top center of the Table of Contents screen, tap the Bookmarks option to see a list of manually saved bookmarks you have previously set as you were reading that eBook. Tap the Notes tab to review the notes you've manually added to pages as you were reading.

FIGURE 17.9
A sample eBook page (on an iPad Pro) with the iBooks command icons displayed.

 Tip
Whenever you tap the Back (<) option while reading an eBook (refer to Figure 17.9), or press the Home button to return to the device's Home screen, your current location in the book is automatically bookmarked and saved.
You also can manually add a virtual bookmark to as many pages in the eBook as you want. To do this, tap the Bookmark icon (refer to Figure 17.9) in the top-right corner of the screen. When you tap the Table of Contents icon and then tap the Bookmarks tab, you can see a complete list of manually placed virtual bookmarks in the eBook so you can return to any of those pages quickly.

To exit the Table of Contents screen and return to reading your eBook, tap the Resume option.
Three command icons appear to the right of the eBook title. Tap the AA icon to reveal a pop-up window (see Figure 17.10). It offers a screen brightness slider and a small and large A button, which are used to instantly decrease or increase the font size in the book you're reading.

FIGURE 17.10
Customize the look of each page by choosing a font, font size, and theme.
Tap the Fonts button to change the text font, or tap one of the Themes buttons (the colored circles) to change the theme used to display the text (and the background color) for the eBook you're reading. Choose the theme that is best suited for the lighting available and is also visually pleasing to you.
Turn on the virtual switch associated with Scrolling View if you want to view an eBook as a single, vertically scrolling document rather than in the format where you virtually turn the pages.

 Tip
If you turn on the virtual switch associated with Auto-Night Theme, your iPhone or iPad measures the ambient light in the area where you're reading, and then automatically turns on the Night theme if you're reading in a dark or dimly lit area.

Tap the Search icon (refer to Figure 17.9) to display a Search field. Use this feature to locate any keyword or search phrase that appears in the eBook you're currently reading.
As you're reading (unless you have the Scrolling View feature turned on), turn the page by swiping your finger from right to left (horizontally) across the screen to move one page forward, or swiping your finger from left to right to back up one page at a time.

 Tip
To turn the page, you can also tap the right side of the screen to advance or the left side of the screen to go back. However, if you have the Both Margins Advance option activated (which you can do in Settings), tapping either margin advances to the next page.

At the bottom of the screen is the page number in the eBook you're currently reading, as well as the total number of pages in the eBook. The number of pages remaining in the current chapter is displayed to the right of the page number (refer to Figure 17.9).

 More Info
As you're reading an eBook, hold your finger on a single word to see a selection of available reading tools: Copy, Lookup, Highlight, Note, Search, and Share.
Use your finger to move the blue dots on either side of the word to expand the selected text to a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or entire page.
Tap the Look Up tab to look up the definition of a selected word. (Internet access is required to use this feature.)
Tap the Highlight tab to highlight the selected text. You can choose the color of your highlights, or you can underline the selected text by tapping the yellow circle icon that's above the word. Tap the white circle (with a red line through it) to remove highlights, or tap the Note icon to create a new note.
When you tap the Highlight option, you're given the option to choose a highlight color. The last highlight color you selected determines the color of the sticky note that appears when you tap the Note option. This enables you to easily color-code your highlights and notes.
If you tap the Note tab on an iPad, a virtual sticky note appears on your device's screen, along with the virtual keyboard. Type notes to yourself about what you're reading. When you're finished typing, tap anywhere on the screen outside the sticky note box.
When you're using an iPhone and you tap the Note tab, the sentence related to the selected word is displayed. Below it, you can type text using the virtual keyboard. Tap Done to save the note.
On both the iPhone and iPad, a sticky note icon appears in the margin of the eBook. You can later tap this icon to read your notes or annotations.
Tap the Search tab to enter any word or phrase and find it in the eBook. A search window appears below the Search field. References to each occurrence of your keyword or search phrase are displayed by chapter and page number. Tap a reference to jump to that point in the book.

Listening to Audiobooks Using the iBooks App
After you've purchased and downloaded an audiobook, the thumbnail is shown on the Audiobooks Collections screen. To begin listening to the audiobook, tap its thumbnail.
A new screen opens to show the audiobook thumbnail and various controls. The Play/Pause icon is displayed below the image (see Figure 17.11). Tap Play to begin playing the audiobook; the button changes to the Pause button, which you can tap to pause the playback. Tap the Rewind 15 or Fast Forward 15 buttons to rewind or fast forward the playback by 15 seconds.

 Note
When you pause an audiobook or exit the iBooks app, a bookmark is automatically saved so you can continue listening from where you left off. Your place is maintained whether you resume listening on the same device or use another Mac or iOS mobile device that's linked to the same iCloud account.


FIGURE 17.11
Use the audio playback controls offered by the iBooks app when listening to audiobooks.
Tap the Playback speed (1x) icon to change the playback speed from normal speed (1x) to .75x, 1.25x, 1.5x, or 2x. Tap the moon-shaped Sleep Timer icon to access the Sleep Timer menu and set the audiobook to stop playing after a certain amount of time. A variety of options (from 5 minutes to 1 hour, plus a custom time option) are available.
Tap the Share icon to share details about the audiobook you're listening to with other people. Tap the Table of Contents icon to see an interactive chapter-by-chapter table of contents for the book. To go to a specific chapter, tap its listing.
Tap on the Back (<) button to return to the Library screen.

 Tip
Once an audiobook begins playing, you can exit the iBooks app while the audio continues playing. To pause the audiobook playback while using another app, relaunch the iBooks app from the Home screen, App Switcher, or Dock, or access the Music controls with Control Center. Alternatively, use the "Hey Siri" feature, and say, "Hey Siri, pause the audiobook."

Using Other Reading Apps
Although Apple has worked out distribution deals with many major publishers and authors, the iBook Store does not offer an eBook edition of every book in publication.

 Tip
In some cases, eBook titles are available from Amazon.com or Barnes & Noble (BN.com) but not from the iBook Store. Or if Amazon.com, BN.com, and iBook Store offer the same eBook title, the price for that eBook might be lower from one of these other online-based booksellers.
So, if you're a price-conscious reader, it pays to shop around for the lowest eBook prices. Just because you're using an iPhone or iPad does not mean you must shop for eBooks exclusively from the iBook Store.

Perhaps you previously owned a Kindle or Nook eBook reader before purchasing your iPhone or iPad and have already acquired a personal library of eBooks formatted for that device. If you want to access your Kindle or Nook library from your iPhone or iPad, download the free Kindle or Nook Reading apps from the App Store.
These apps prompt you for your Amazon or Barnes & Noble account information to sync your purchased content to the app. To purchase new Kindle- or Nook-formatted eBook titles, you must visit Amazon.com or BN.com using Safari or your primary computer. After you make your purchase, your eBooks can be automatically synced to the Kindle or Nook app on your device.

 Note
If you enjoy audiobooks, Audible.com (which is owned by Amazon) offers the largest selection of audiobook content in the world. Download the free Audible app to listen to audiobooks acquired from Audible.com. Visit www.audible.com to set up an account, and then purchase or acquire audiobooks from this service.

Staying Informed Using the News App
The News app that comes preinstalled with iOS 11 is a powerful yet easy-to-use information and news gathering tool.
Apple has teamed up with some of the world's leading newspapers, magazines, and news organizations, as well as bloggers, website operators, online publications, and content providers, to offer a single app that gathers articles together and formats them into a highly personalized, nicely formatted digital publication that provides only articles, information, and news that covers exactly the topics you're interested in.
Best of all, this personalized digital news feed is updated and available 24/7, and it is completely free. The app takes a few minutes to initially set up, but after this process is completed, the News app gathers content on your behalf from various sources and presents it to you on your iPhone's or iPad's screen. (An Internet connection is required.)
You can customize the News app in several ways:
 You can "subscribe" to specific publications and read selected articles published by those sources for free.
 You can select topics of interest to you and have the News app gather information related to those topics from many different sources.
 You have the option to choose keywords or phrases. The app then gathers articles and news stories that contain those specific search terms.

 What's New
Apple now has a team of Apple News Editors who create a Spotlight feature that provides a daily, curated collection of news and articles that covers a wide range of topics. To read these articles, tap the Spotlight icon at the bottom of the News app's screen.
You can also have this collection of Spotlight articles emailed to you as a free daily briefing. To subscribe, tap the Spotlight icon, scroll to the bottom of the page, and tap Sign Up to Get News in Your Inbox. When the pop-up window appears, tap the Sign Up button.

The News app works with iCloud, so after you set up the app to personalize your news feed, the content the app collects automatically syncs across all your iOS mobile devices and Macs. (Your Mac must have macOS Sierra or macOS High Sierra installed to work with the News app.)
Each time you launch the News app and tap the For You icon, the date and local temperature is displayed at the top of the screen, followed by headings that allow you to access Top Stories and Trending Stories, as well as news related to topics you've expressed interest about. The news topics are sorted by topic.

 Tip
The News app requires Internet access to collect articles and content. However, you can manually select articles to be saved for offline viewing at your convenience.
To save an article, tap the Share icon, and then tap the Save icon that's displayed within the Share menu (see Figure 17.12). On the iPhone, the Share icon is along the bottom of the screen; on an iPad, it's in the top-left corner. Then the Save icon appears within the Share menu.
When you want to access your saved articles, launch the News app and tap the Saved icon, which is in the bottom-right corner of the screen. A listing of your saved articles is displayed. Tap an article's listing to read it, or swipe from right to left across the listing and then tap the Delete button to delete it.


FIGURE 17.12
Tap the Share icon followed by the Save icon to store articles for later review.
Customizing the News App
Launch the News app from the Home screen, and then invest a few minutes in customizing the app. From the Welcome to News screen, tap the Get Started option.
From the Pick Your Favorites screen, scroll through the displayed list of news organizations, newspapers, magazines, websites, and other content providers and choose those you're interested in by tapping their respective thumbnails. Choose at least one of the displayed options, which include CNN, ESPN, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal.
Tap the Continue option. Based on your initial selections, the For You screen is formatted with content of interest to you. However, using additional tools in the app, you can further customize the content you are presented with on an ongoing basis. Tap the Following icon at the bottom of the screen to further customize the app.

 Tip
Get alerted of breaking news stories by adjusting the Notifications options for the News app. One way to do this is from within the News app; tap the Following icon. Then scroll to the bottom of the screen and tap the Manage Notifications option.
From the Notifications menu within the News app (see Figure 17.13), tap the virtual bell icon associated with specific channels and content providers the app is following on your behalf. To be alerted of important (general) news, tap the bell icon associated with News Editors' Picks or News Top Stories.
To determine how these notifications will be presented to you, launch Settings, tap the Notifications option, and then tap the News option. Turn on the virtual switch associated with Allow Notifications, and then determine the form those notifications will take (such as audible alerts or onscreen Banners or Alerts).


FIGURE 17.13
Receive an audible alert and notification on your iPhone or iPad when breaking news articles are published.
Navigating the News App
Along the bottom of the News app screen on both the iPhone (shown in Figure 17.14) and iPad are five command icons. Here's a summary of what each tool is used for:
 For You—Tap this icon to read your personalized digital publication (news feed) that's continuously updated with content of direct interest to you. Articles are collected in real time from a wide range of online-based sources and content providers.

FIGURE 17.14
Use the command icons at the bottom of the screen to navigate the News app.
 Spotlight—Read a curated collection of articles compiled daily by the Apple News Editors.
 Following—Based on specific topics and content categories, discover new sources and content providers that you're interested in having the News app follow for you. New sources and content providers are continuously being added, as are specific topics available in each main content category. From the Following screen (see Figure 17.15), tap the + Browse icon for a source listing to add it to your For You feed.
 Search—In the Search field, enter a topic, subject matter, keyword, name, company name, industry, hobby, area of interest, or anything else you want the News app to gather articles about on your behalf.
 Saved—As you read specific articles in the For You news feed, if there's an article you want to save for later reference, tap the bookmark-shaped Save icon associated with it to save that article for offline viewing.

FIGURE 17.15
From the Following screen, choose which news sources, topics, and channels you want displayed within your customized For You news feed.

 Note
Using your iPhone's or iPad's Internet connection, the News app gathers content on a continuous basis and displays the most current information first. As newer content becomes available, older content disappears from your news feed, unless you manually save specific articles.

Reading Articles
After setting up the News app, launch it whenever you have time to browse or read the collected articles in your personalized news feed. To do this, tap the For You icon. All the articles collected by the app are displayed on a single screen in a digital newspaper-style format.
Each article listing in your feed includes a headline, cover photo (when applicable), the first sentence or two from each article, the source of each article, and when it was published (see Figure 17.16). Articles are sorted by category (such as Science Fiction).

FIGURE 17.16
Your news feed (shown here on the iPhone) is populated with article listings that the News app collects for you.
To read an article in its entirety, simply tap its preview listing. Otherwise, keep scrolling down to view all the articles in your current news feed. Keep in mind, your news feed is updated continuously as new content is published. The articles toward the top of your news feed are the most current.

 Tip
To view, add to, or modify your collection of Favorite topics and content sources, tap the Following icon. If you want to delete a source (so the News app stops following it for you), tap Edit, and then tap the - icon displayed to the left of the listing for the source you want to remove.

Expanding Your Collection of Sources and Content Providers
At any time, to discover new sources and content providers that the News app can follow on your behalf or to add new topics of interest, tap the Following icon, tap the + Browse button, and then scroll through the list of publications and content providers.
When you come across one or more sources that you want the News app to begin following, tap its listing. The heart-shaped icon in the top right of the thumbnail turns red. Tap Done to add the selected news sources to your For You news feed.

 Tip
To find articles, content, or news stories based on a specific keyword or phrase, tap the Search icon. In the Search field, type the word or phrase that relates to what you're looking for.
From the listing of search results, tap the Add (heart-shaped) icons associated with the articles of interest. Search results are sorted into sections labeled Top Result, Stories, Channels, and Topics.
After selecting any of the search results for the News app to follow, tap Done. Now, when you tap the For You icon, your news feed is updated with content from the added sources.


 Note
A topic is content about a specific subject matter that you're interest in, regardless of the publisher. A channel is content offered by a specific publisher or content producer, such as The New York Times, CNN, or 9to5Mac.


 Tip
When you're reading an article in the News app, tap the Share icon associated with the article to share that article with others or export it to a compatible app. You also can add it to your Safari Reading List for offline viewing later (refer to Figure 17.12).

Subscribing to Digital Editions of Newspapers and Magazines
Instead of using the News app to read select content from newspaper and magazine publishers, you can download the proprietary app for that publication from the App Store. Then you can purchase complete single issues or a subscription to that publication to download and read all content from the digital edition of the publication.
Launch the App Store and, in the Search field, enter the name of any newspaper, magazine, or digital publication to find, download, and install the proprietary app available for it.
After downloading and installing the publication's free app, launch that app and use in-app purchases to acquire individual issues or a paid subscription.

 Tip
The Texture app (available from the App Store) allows you to pay a flat monthly fee (as low as $6.99 per month) for unlimited access to current and past digital issues of more than 200 popular, consumer-oriented, and special interest magazines.
The optional Zinio app boasts that it has become the world's largest magazine newsstand. From this app, you can purchase individual issues (or ongoing subscriptions) to the digital editions for more than 6,000 magazine titles, plus read selected articles for free. Single issue prices for magazines range from $0.99 to $9.99 each.
