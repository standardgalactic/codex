INTRODUCTION
T
oday, I'm going to show you how to make these really sweet little puff flowers.
You can see I've already made a couple here:

They make really nice embellishments for hats or any sort of project but you can also join them together just as they are and make a scarf or blanket or anything like that but I will do a separate course on how you can join them together but this one will just be how to make the flowers themselves. 
So, you're going to want two different colors of yarn obviously you can use any colors that you like. 
I'm just going to use this yellow and pink.








 How to Crochet Simple Puff Flowers Step by Step
Step 1
So, you're going to want to start off with a slipknot 

And as always, if you're not sure how to do that, then just nip and check out my Crochet Beginner Series book 1 & 2, there's a nice tutorial there for you. 
So, we want to start with a chain of four, so yarn over and pull through.
That's 
1,
2,
3 and
4 








 Step 2
So, we want to close this up now into a circle. So, the very first stitch just here before your Slipknot 








 Step 3
You would want to insert your hook into that stitch and then we'll go into slip stitch. 








 Step 4
So, you want to yarn over and pull through both of those loops and that is created now a small circle for us to work our stitches into. 








 Step 5
So, you want to chain one and then we're going to do 12 double crochets into this center circle.

Now, remember that's UK double, in the US this is your single.







 Step 6
So, you want to go into the middle of the circle that we've just created. You're going to insert your hook into the center of that circle 








 Step 7
Then you're going to yarn over and pull up and you'll have two loops on your hook, yarn over pull through both. 








 Step 8
Then again into that center circle, yarn over and pull up yarn over, that's one. 

Yarn over and pull through both and that's two. 

And let's say you want 12 altogether, you would want to carry on doing that... 







 Step 9
So, I've just made my 12th and final double crochet and we're now going to join this round together 








 Step 10
We did a chain one at the beginning which is just here on the side of this stitch. 








 Step 11
We're going to ignore that and we're going to go straight into the top of that very first double crochet that we did just here








 Step 12
You would want to insert your hook into the top of that stitch, making sure that you get the V across the top there and slip stitch 








 Step 13
Yarn over, pull through both loops on your hook chain one 








 Step 14
We are going to snip off this color and then you just would want to pull that out and pull it tight. That is our center circle done ready to start our petals.

Now if you've worked in your tail and around the center as you went, you can snip that off now, if not then just weave it in around that center circle very quickly. It just gives you one less end to think about and get in the way when you're doing your petals.







 Step 15
So, I'm going to attach my new color now and I'm going to do it just into the stitch where we finished off. I'm going to join my new color into that very last stitch that I did before I finished off; that stitch just there next to that knot








 Step 16
I'm going to grab my new color and I'm going to pull that in the yellow color through my stitch.
I'm just going to just tie on just in a single nut and then I'm going to hold both of those ends to the left and I'm going to work them in as I go around 








 Step 17
So, I'm going to put my hook straight into that stitch again and grab the yarn and pull it up and now we're ready to start our petals.








 Step 18
You'd want to start by chaining 3 so 1, 2 under the ring and so that is going to count as the first part of our puff stitch. 








 Step 19
To start the puff stitch, you'd want to yarn over and you're going to insert back into that very same chain space that we've just come up from and you'd want to keep this nice and loose. You don't want to be holding anything too tightly and you're going to grab that yarn and pull it up and you want to pull it up to reach the height of your chain 3.

These are going to be very long stitches. So, that now is counting as two stitches, our chain three and our first loop for our puff stitch. 








 Step 20
Yarn over, go back into that same space again yarn over and pull up. Again, you want to pull nice and tall so that now is counting us three stitches into that very first space and then we want to move across now into the top of the next stitch which is this stitch just here after the knot 








 Step 21
We're going to do three parts of our puff stitch in that stitch so you going to yarn over and insert into that next stitch 








 Step 22
Yarn over, pull up again nice and tall, so that's one. Yarn over, go back into that same space that we just went into, yarn over and pull up, that's two and one more. So, yarn over back into that same chain space yarn over and pull up nice and tall and that's three 








 Step 23
You then want to yarn over and turn your hook right down so that it's facing your thumb here 








 Step 24
and then you're going to pull it through all of those stitches and then you want to chain two times 








 Step 25
Then we're going to move into the next stitch long which is this stitch just here, you'd want to pop your hook into that stitch and you want to do this bit quite tightly you want to yarn over and slip stitch so you're going to pull through both of those loops 








 Step 26
So, now straight out of this next stitch that we're into you want to chain three and you're going to start your next petal in the exact same way 








 Step 27
So, we've done the chain three which counts as the very first part and then you want to yarn over and go back into that very same space, yarn over and pull up nice and tall and one more into this stitch, yarn over and pull up nice and tall. You remember you do your chain three and two parts of your puff stitch all into one stitch and then three in parts of the puff stitch into the next stitch, so we're going to yarn over and insert into the next chain and then pull up. That's one, back into the same space that's two, back into the same space again and pull up and that's three 








 Step 28
So, you've got your chain three and two parts of your puff stitch in one space and then three parts of your postage in the next and then again yarn over and pull through all of those loops chain two and then go down into the next chain which is just here and do this bit quite tightly you're going to do a slip stitch; so, yarn over pull through both of those loops and then again








 Step 29
You're going to start your next petal. I'll do this next one with you and then I will leave you to do the next three on your own. Again, I'm still working those ends as I go around but I will snip them after the next petal. 
So, chain three and then those two parts of your puff stitch so yarn over, insert and back into that same space, yarn over and pull up nice and tall, yarn over insert back into the same space and again pull up nice and tall and then you're going to move a cross into your next stitch and do the next three parts of your puff stitch; that's one, two and three then yarn over pull through all of those loops chain two 








 Step 30
Before I slip stitched down this third petal, I'm just going to snip off those two ends and then I'm going to go into the next stitch as normal and slip stitch to pull that petal down and then I am ready to start my next petal by doing the chain three. So, if you want to pause or rewind, I will meet you just as you finish off the sixth pattern. 








 Step 31
So, I've completed my sixth petal just here and I've done my chain two and I've got one chain left just there, so you want to slip stitch down into that final chain and then you could finish off here if you want to but I don't like that, I can see that yellow part of the last chain 








 Step 32
So, I'm just going to slip stitch again but across into the base of that first petal that we did, so I'm just going to insert my hook at the base of that petal and slip stitch once again and then chain one to fasten up pull that through and then just pull that nice and tight. 








 Step 33
We've snipped off all of the other ends that we've done, so we just need to fasten in this end here, pop my yarn on my needle and I'm just going to go along the base of the petal and pull that through and then on the base of the next petal as well








 Step 34
I'm just going to slip off and now obviously this is the back of your puff petal. It does look really sweet just on its own obviously but when you turn it over you can see the effect that you get with those stitches on the other side which looks really pretty 








 CONCLUSION
So, that is it for the puff flower crochet for beginners.
I will do another little tutorial to show how to make a Six Petal Crotchet Flower soon.
You can create some other sort of project, you could do a table runner or scarf. 
I really hope that you enjoyed this puff flower tutorial and if you did, please remember to give me a 5-star rating and a good comment. 
That's it for this one and I will see you for another one very soon.
Bye for now
