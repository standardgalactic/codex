Preface








The purpose of this book is to provide a survey of the available literature and other resources on the topic of women in the Third World and to provide sources for further research. The vast range of literature and resources available offers many opportunities to learn more about women in the Third World, their lives, and the challenges many of them face in their daily lives. A tremendous amount of growth in knowledge and research has occurred in this field in recent years, especially since the United Nations declared 1975 as International Women's Year and the years 1975 to 1985 as the International Decade for Women. This document provides a resource for students, writers, and researchers as well as professionals in the field.








While much progress has been made in alleviating many of the problems that women in the Third World face, many areas still exist in which improvements can be made. International laws, as well as many national laws, prohibit various forms of discrimination against women, but in reality, discrimination still exists. For example, although an amendment to the Childhood






 












Page xiv




Marriage Act in India in 1978 raised the minimum age at which a girl could be married to 18 years, in practice many girls younger than 15 are married. In 1951, the International Labour Organization adopted the Convention Concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value. This convention calls for equal pay for equal work for both men and women. But, today, women in most countries do not earn the same as men for similar work. Laws passed at the national or international level cannot always change well-established traditions or change the attitudes of many people.








The Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 focused the attention of the world, for a short period of time, on the condition of women throughout the world. Thousands of women converged on Beijing, as well as on Huairou, where the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Forum on Women was held. Thousands more searched the media for news of the events and surfed the Internet to keep posted on the activities of the conference. Attention was focused on how many women, especially in developing countries, fight for survival on a daily basis, spending much of their time gathering food, hauling water, and maintaining a household, and on their resilience in the face of these challenges.








The growing number of NGOs signals greater interest in improving the lives of women and at the same time indicates the vast amount of work that still needs to be done to help women achieve equality in life. The fundamentalist movement is gaining ground in many Muslim countries, where hard-won rights for women are being rolled back. Countries ratify international conventions agreeing to adhere to the resulting provisions but do not change their national laws to comply. Work must continue for women to gain equal rights as human beings and to have a chance at improving their standard of living. This book reviews current knowledge and resources in order to help the reader understand the issues concerning this important and timely topic.








This book, like other books in the Contemporary World Issues series, provides a balanced survey of the resources available and a guide to further research on the topic of women in the Third World. Chapter I reviews the literature concerning women in the Third World, including aspects of education, health, the family, work, and politics. Chapter 2 provides a chronology of the significant events in the recent history of women in the Third World. Chapter 3 offers biographical sketches of women who have played or are currently playing key roles in some aspect of






 












Page xv




the field of women in the Third World. Chapter 4 provides statistical information on the status of women in the Third World and excerpts from key, relevant United Nations documents and other international legal documents concerning the treatment and status of women in the Third World. Chapter 5 provides a directory of representative private and public organizations, associations, and government agencies involved in working with women in the Third World in a variety of areas, including education, health, family planning, and development. Some organizations help develop programs and some provide financing for women-owned enterprises. In Chapter 6, books that focus on women in developing countries are annotated; the literature varies from popular accounts to descriptions of primary research and provides a wide perspective on the many issues of importance to women in the Third World. Chapter 7 includes an annotated list of nonprint resources, including films and videocassettes as well as relevant sources of information that can be found on the Internet.

1 Introduction and Overview








The United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women held in 1995 in Beijing focused renewed attention on the status and condition of women throughout the world. In many countries, women find themselves discriminated against, denied basic human rights, and considered second-class citizens. This chapter provides an overview of women in developing countriestheir status, the conditions in which they live, and many of the social, political, and economic forces that affect them.








First, we need to define what we mean by the ''Third World." This term has come to mean less developed countries, or countries with relatively low per capita incomes, short life expectancies, and high rates of illiteracy. The economies of these countries are generally agriculturally based. "First World" countries are considered to include industrialized, democratic countries, such as the United States, Canada, the European countries, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and other countries that are not considered communist. "Second World" countries are countries that are part of the communist bloc, and include Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the former Soviet Union, China, and Cuba. "Second World" countries are part of the communist bloc and originally included the Soviet






 












Page 2




Union, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, China, and Cuba. Today, many of the countries of the former Soviet Union may be considered "Third World" or developing countries, depending on whether or not they have remained communist.








Third World versus First World Women








Women in the more developed countries often find themselves better off than their counterparts in the developing world. Of course, life for most people, both men and women, in developed countries is better than in developing countries. But women throughout the world may be discriminated against to some degree, and this discrimination is not confined to developing countries.








We also must keep in mind that women in the developed countries are not the only ones who have made great strides. Probably the best-known example is that of women in politics. Women have been elected to lead their countries in India and Pakistan (two Third World countries), as well as in Israel and Britain, while no woman in the United States has held this position. In another example, two women were named to Nicaragua's supreme court in 1982, while the first woman to sit on the United States Supreme Court was named to the Court only one year earlier, in 1981. As we study the conditions of women in the Third World, we must keep in mind that this information should be understood in its proper perspective, that is, in relation to the relative position of women in other, more developed countries and to the condition of men in Third World countries.








Women in the Third World often criticize women in Western democracies for their cultural imperialism, their way of coming into these developing countries and deciding what is wrong with the culture and lives of people there. These Western women (and men) apply Western theories and models to conditions and situations that they find in developing countries, often without a comprehensive understanding of the culture in which these conditions exist. When I talked with young women in India about arranged marriages, I could not understand their acceptance of their situations. One young (21 years old), college-educated woman told me that this is the way it is done in India and she willingly accepts her fate. She did not appear unhappy, even though her husband was many years older than she was, and






 












Page 3




over time I realized that she would make the best of this situation. Because we had different concepts of marriage, our expectations were different. She was comfortable with her culture's expectations and practices. It is easy to judge a situation based on our own knowledge and experiences; what we must do is put ourselves in these women's shoes and understand their perspective. Scholar Beverly Mack reports on this attitude of acceptance in an article in the Washington Post:








A Hausa woman growing up in her [Nigerian] culture understands the demands made on her and is prepared to deal with them on her own terms. She knows there are certain social expectations to be met: marrying according to parental choice, bearing children and obeying the head of the household. The fulfillment of these obligations gives a devoted woman a sense of security in knowing she has complied with the expectations of both her God and her community.... Polygamy ... offers periodic relief from domestic responsibilities as wives take turns preparing the household's meals, doing laundry and attending to their husband in roughly three-day cycles. Thus co-wives experience a situation in which domestic chores ideally are shared among congenial companions. Of course this is not always the case; in any large household there are complaints about unequal work loads and jealousy among co-wives. (Mack 1984)








Western attempts to study the problems of Third World women also create resentment on the part of those women studied, who complain that Western researchers come in with a grant and a tape recorder, ask questions, and then fly home to write their reports in the relative comfort of their own lives. Often, careers are boosted by these studies but little or nothing is provided to help improve the welfare and lives of the people who are studied. Many researchers ask questions that are meant to elicit intimate details of the lives of these people, but most have no idea of the extent to which this intrusion affects those involved. Outsiders who have little understanding of local culture come in and study polygamy, purdah (the seclusion of women from the public, practiced by Muslims and some Hindus), veiling, dowry (in India, the money and/or goods that a bride's family brings to her husband and his family), brideprice, and child marriages and






 












Page 4




condemn these practices based on Western beliefs and traditions. Little if any attempt is made to understand these practices within their cultural context before totally condemning them. Many people in the Third World can not understand this type of behavior and resent the implication that their societies are primitive and problematic while Western societies are good and have no problems.








Research conducted today is often more sensitive to the cultures of other people, but we still have a way to go in understanding the many problems that women face within their cultural context. Every society has certain roles that it expects men and women to play; the following section briefly examines the role of gender in society.








Gender Roles and Inequality








Sex roles are behaviors that are determined by the biological differences between women and men, such as pregnancy, lactation, erection, and ejaculation. Gender roles are behaviors that are determined by the social and cultural context in which people live and how they define femininity and masculinity. Gender stratification is defined as "the differential ranking and rewarding of women's and men's roles" (Eitzen and Zinn 1991, 300). All societies use gender as a primary means of determining the division of labor and the provision of rights and responsibilities for citizens. Gender roles are not the same in countries throughout the world. Most countries, however, assign roles in domestic and family areas to women and in political and public areas to men.








Some sociologists believe that male dominance is universal, that is, found in every culture throughout society. They believe that some form of patriarchy is found in all cultures. Others believe that sexual differentiation is found in all societies but that females are not always the ones that are considered of lower status (Rogers 1978; Eitzen and Zinn 1991).








Women's roles vary across cultures. Their status within each society is determined by institutional factors such as family, politics, religion, and economic systems within the culture as well as by the level of power, prestige, and control over property that they have. The power and influence of women may change as they age, with added prestige provided to elderly women in some cultures. Within cultures, women's roles and positions also vary. Women in the upper classes of all societies






 












Page 5




enjoy many advantages that women in lower classes within the same culture are denied.








Women have both reproductive and productive roles in most societies. Their reproductive role is usually undervalued by most people; it includes biological reproduction (bearing children, rearing children, and maintaining the household) and social reproduction (maintaining the status quo in their society). Productive work includes all activities that generate income or have some sort of exchange value. Most societies do not see reproductive work as productive, that is, having any economic value. As a result, the value of women is considered to be less than that of men because value is usually measured in terms of economic value.








The issue of gender is one of the basic sources of division and definition in a particular society. It determines who is considered a citizen, who is allowed to vote, who is allowed to own land. Gender defines men and women according to the social relationship between them. Approaches to development in terms of gender are concerned with the ways that such relationships are socially constructed.








Patriarchy








Patriarchy is defined as the "principle of male dominance that forms both a structural and ideological system of domination in which men control women" (Chow and Berheide 1994, 14). It is not a static condition or universal in its characteristics. The specific forms that patriarchy may take vary by class, race, and age. Patriarchy is most commonly seen and studied in relation to its role in the family. In the patriarchal family, men have the power to determine the status, privileges, and roles of women and children within the family. This power is also reinforced by traditional gender role belief systems. Hartmann (1976) believes that "patriarchy, as an independent system of domination preceding capitalism, influences the particular forms the sexual division of labor takes in the family as well as in the waged labor economy. Household work, childcare, emotional support, labor, and home-based production are examples of how the family serves as locus of control and how men benefit from women's labor, paid or unpaid, at home" (Chow and Berheide 1994, 15).








Patriarchy can be both public and private. Private patriarchy generally is practiced in the family environment, while public






 












Page 6




patriarchy is that practiced by the state and within the economy. Patriarchy influences the role of women in the economy in countries around the world. A search of the literature concerning the international division of labor demonstrates a relationship between capitalist accumulation on a world scale and patriarchal family structures and how these factors shape women's place in the global economy's division of labor as well as in the family household (Beneria and Stimpson 1987; Mies 1986; Chow and Berheide 1994). Jiggins sees the influence of patriarchal approaches to politics and international affairs as creating a dangerous and unbalanced world:








It is a world that counts weapons of destruction as economically productive and women's domestic work as economically valueless. It is a world governed by the public decisions of men who choose to solve problems by force. It is a world in which women and children form the majority of the poor, the displaced, and the hungry. Such a world is not sustainable. (Jiggins 1994, 41)








International relations theory and practice has primarily been developed by men who have based their theories on their own knowledge and experience as men. Women are often left out of this equation, and as a result, their impact on society is not considered or valued. The remainder of this chapter focuses on specific issues of concern to women in Third World countries.








Education








Education is recognized as an inalienable right for every person by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Both have been adopted by the United Nations and its member nations (see Chapter 4 for excerpts of these documents). Most countries recognize the importance of providing education to their citizens. Education enhances citizens' economic, political, social, and cultural development and provides benefits to the community and nation as well. Studies have shown that women who are well educated have more control over their lives, including reproduction, and have fewer children than women with no education (Jejeebhoy 1995).






 












Page 7




In developing countries, many citizens do not receive an education that will make them literate, that is, able to read and write and understand the written word. Lack of teachers, school facilities, and transportation to get to school, as well as the cost of schooling, the need to help out at home, and the view that education is not important are some of the many reasons. Researchers have estimated that 95 percent of the world population that is illiterate is living in developing countries (Ballara 1991; UNESCO 1990). Women are more likely to be illiterate in these countries than are men.








Education can provide the impetus to break down stereotypes that exist in a society toward women and their status in society. Throughout the literature concerning women and their status, especially in the Third World, the words education and empowerment can be found. An education empowers a woman, raises her self-esteem, and offers her options in her life. More than any other factor, education is believed to be the key element in improving the lives of women throughout the world. For young girls who are married and enter a world of restriction, seclusion, or other isolation from family members and friends, the ability to read and write connects them with the outside world. In many situations, an education provides status to a woman in her family and in the community.








Families usually feel a need to educate their sonsthat boys need an education to be able to go out into the world, get a good job, and support a family. However, for young daughters in developing countries the need is not so easily understooda young girl will eventually get married and have a family and her primary work will be at home taking care of her husband and childrenand therefore many families see little need for educating their daughters. They see this as a waste of time and money, for the girls can stay home and help their mothers take care of the housework and care for the other siblings in the family. Young girls also participate in income-generating activities, such as sewing, weaving, and farming activities. Many women agree that an education is not as important for girls as it is for boys. Understanding and changing these attitudes is a difficult task for all advocates of universal education.








For many young girls, especially in developing countries, their informal "education" begins by teaching them that boys have more status and privileges than they do, that boys are better and more important. According to a study of female children in Nepal conducted by the United Nations Children's Emergency






 












Page 8




Fund (UNICEF) (1992), researchers found that the process of socializing girls starts early, teaching them that boys are superior to them and that they must accept their situation as natural and normal. The researchers found that "not only are girls and women socially and ideologically unequipped to retaliate against (or even question) the implicit and explicit injustices to which they are subjected, but that, in the absence of alternative models of role and conduct, they actually espouse and propagate the dominant social and cultural values that militate against their gender group" (page 32).








Girls in rural areas of Third World countries are less likely than girls in urban areas to go to school. Families living in rural areas are less likely to have access to a school and may also have a more pressing need to keep children, especially girls, at home to help with child care and subsistence activities. Families living in urban areas are more likely to have access to schools and income to pay for their children's education and are more likely to understand the importance of an education.








Lack of an education affects young girls and women in other ways. For example, many studies have shown a relationship between a lack of an education and teenage pregnancies, unemployment, crime, and health problems (King 1990; King and Hill 1993). For many women's advocates and development workers in developing countries, other problems and needs take precedence over the provision of education. These include food shortages, poor health care, lack of health care facilities, lack of housing or inadequate housing, and lack of employment opportunities.








For married women, as they start families the desire for an education is often lessened by a number of factors, including lack of time, pregnancy, child care, fatigue, agricultural activities, and income-generating activities. Cultural patterns also play a role. In many countries, parents believe that they must educate their sons because they are the ones who will later be required to marry, start a family, and even support their parents in old age. Girls will marry and join their husband's family, thus providing nothing to their birth parents. Religious traditions may encourage girls and women to stay at home, raise a family, and take care of their husbands, thus discouraging the desire for an education. Other factors preventing the education of females are male teachers, classes of mixed gender, distances between home and school, and lack of transportation. Women's learned behaviors, such as submissiveness to male authority, shyness, lack of self-confidence, and isolation from social activities, also contribute to this situation.

More and more researchers are recognizing the important role that women play in economic development activities. The Demographic and Health Survey (1990) conducted in 28 countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, and Arab countries in 1990 found a positive relationship between women's education and social and economic development. They also found that family size decreased as the education level of women increased. The use of family planning methods also increased with an increase in women's educational levels.








The relationship between women's educational level and the health of themselves and their families also has been studied. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) (1989) issued a report on the state of the world population. Studies conducted in 46 countries throughout the world indicated that raising the number of educated women by 1 percent was three times more effective than raising the number of physicians by 1 percent. Ballara (1991) reports on a study conducted by the Research Triangle Institute that examined the enrollment of girls in primary and secondary schools in 80 developing countries. These researchers found that an increase of 70 percent in the enrollment of girls in primary schools as well as in secondary schools could result in lowering infant mortality rates by as much as 40 per 1,000 live births. Caldwell (1979) studied educational levels and child mortality in Nigeria and found that educated women have lower rates of child mortality and tend to be more familiar with doctors and health facilities and use them more frequently. The Demographic and Health Survey (1990) reported a positive relationship between prenatal care and a woman's level of education. Educated women also are more likely to understand the importance of taking their children to see doctors when they are sick.








The relationship between women's educational levels and their participation in the labor force is strong. The Research Triangle Institute study reported on by Ballara (1991) found that a 70 percent increase in the number of girls receiving a primary and secondary education will lead, over time, to an increase in women's participation in the labor force. As women's educational levels increase, the number of self-employed women also increases.








Nongovernmental organizations have instituted programs to encourage literacy among women and girls to improve their lives as well as their position in society. The YWCA of India combines literacy training with classes in health, employment, and social and legal training. Each of the YWCA's programs includes






 












Page 10




activities in handicrafts, sewing, soap production, and book-binding. The Associated Country Women of the World offers literacy programs in Ecuador, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Zaire. The United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) also have initiated literacy programs for women.








Education is one of the most influential factors in providing advances for women. The more education a woman has, the better off she is. Education provides the knowledge that women need to promote their health, well-being, economic status, family relations, development options, and political rights. The lives of women are enriched by education.








Family Relations








Preference for Males








Even before young women are engaged and married, they understand the place they hold in their families and society. From the time they are born, many girls do not hold an honored place in their families. Many families, especially in developing countries, prefer boys over girls. Girls are biologically stronger than males in their early years, and they are estimated to have a mortality rate lower than males (1 to 1.15) (Royston and Armstrong 1989). However, according to data from the 1983 World Fertility Survey (UNFPA 1989), mortality rates for girls are 1.5 times higher than boys in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, 1.4 times higher in Bangladesh, and 1.3 times higher in Colombia. Many families believe that boys require and deserve more food and better quality food than girls, which may lead to higher mortality rates among girls.








Boys are expected to become wage earners to support their own families as well as to provide support to their parents in old age. In many developing countries, the extended family is still common, with the male usually bringing home his bride to live in their own home or in the home of his parents. The bride helps her husband's mother and father with many of the household chores, especially if she does not have her own job. The preference for males also often extends to access to health care and education. Families are more likely to provide their sons with all available health care and with an education. Girls are seen as providing service to their families, by staying home and helping






 












Page 11




their mothers with housework, child care, and income-generating activities if available.








Marriage








Most women throughout the world are expected to marry at some time in their lives. In many Third World countries, women are seen as property, having value to their birth families only when they are married off, preferably at an early age, and the family receives money or goods for their ''purchase." The wife in many families is expected to care for the husband and to bear children, preferably boys. Throughout the Third World, women bear the burden of taking care of the home; their tasks may include tending the family's garden, caring for live animals that the family may have for future needs, gathering fuel for cooking, gathering water for drinking, cooking, and bathing, caring for the children, and caring for and supporting the husband. In many cases, women are also expected to find paying work to help support the family.








In many Third World countries, arranged marriages are still a common practice. In these cases, parents make all arrangements to find a wife or husband for their child. The prospective bride and groom have no say in the wedding and often do not even have a chance to meet their future spouse until the day of the wedding. Some families are beginning to allow marriages based on love, that is, marriages in which the boy and girl choose each other. As more girls are allowed to go to school, enter college, and find jobs, the opportunities expand for them to find their own mate. However, many families still require the approval of the parents, who are determined to ensure that their sons marry properly.








In some Third World cultures, girls are engaged when they are still very young, even 11 or 12 years old. They will be married when they are older, but they will have no choice in the matter. Some young girls are matched with older men. Especially in Middle Eastern countries, but also in Asia, older men like to marry young virgins.








In India, once a girl marries, she frequently goes to live in her in-laws' home. Her family loyalties are expected to change from her birth family to her new family. Emotionally, economically, and legally, a girl is property that is transferred to another family (Calman 1992). The Indian government passed the Child Marriage Restraint Act in 1929 that set a minimum age of marriage for






 












Page 12




males at 18 years and for females at 14 years. In 1949, the minimum age for females was changed to 15 years. In 1978, the minimum ages for females was raised to 18 and for males to 21 years. Despite these laws, the 1961 census found that in over one-third of all the districts in India the average age of girls at marriage was below 15 years. The 1971 census revealed that in rural India 14 percent of girls between the ages of 10 and 14 years were married, and in urban areas the figure was 4 percent. The Committee on the Status of Women in India was frustrated that the census did not ask for information on the marriage of girls younger than 10 years because committee members had met many girls younger than 10 years who were already married. In 1986, the health minister of Uttar Pradesh revealed that there were villages in the state in which all girls over the age of 8 years were married, because, as the villagers explained, the dowry expected for an 8-year-old girl was much less than for a girl past puberty (Calman 1992).








In Islamic societies, polygyny, the practice of men having multiple wives, is allowed. The Koranthe holy book of the Islamic faith, which contains the words of God as they were given to the Prophet Mohammedallows men to take up to four wives in specific circumstances, and many men consider this permission to marry more than one woman whenever they want. In Malaysia, Mohamed Saad Mehmad, Perlis state's Islamic religious department director, claimed at a seminar in 1991 that women should allow "their husbands to take second, third or fourth wives as a way of preventing extramarital affairs and alleviating the problem of unmarried women" ("Malaysia: States Differ on Approach to Polygamy" 1991, 18).








Behavioral Restrictions








In several Islamic countries, women's behavior is severely restricted. The practice of purdah, a Persian word meaning "curtain," is an institutionalized system that requires women to cover their bodies and faces and to remain in seclusion from the rest of society. Purdah has three major parts: women are physically separated with their own living space, they are socially segregated from all but their immediate kinship circle, and they must cover their bodies and their faces whenever they appear in public places. Purdah keeps women secluded and isolated from the rest of society by confining them to the surroundings of their home, family, immediate kinship circle, and neighborhood (Dankelman






 












Page 13




and Davidson 1988). In other cultures, women are not so severely restricted but still do not have full freedom.








Health Care








All women face a variety of health problems. During pregnancy women can experience vitamin deficiency, high blood pressure, miscarriage, and anemia. Lack of prenatal care endangers the lives of both the mother and the child. Contraceptives may pose their own risks but lack of access to contraceptives may create unwanted pregnancies and result in children that cannot be adequately cared for. Abortion services are not always available. Maternal mortality is higher in developing countries than in developed countries, often because of lack of access to medical care, numerous pregnancies, and overwork. The practice of female genital mutilation in many societies can lead to several health problems, including excessive bleeding, painful menstruation, painful sexual intercourse, and death for some young girls. Sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), threatens the health and lives of many women, including those forced into prostitution. During war and internal conflicts, women often are raped by soldiers.








Knowledge of health care issues that affect them as well as access to health care is severely lacking for women in developing countries. Access to health care may be limited for several reasons, including lack of infrastructure, lack of services for referral, poverty, unavailability of midwives, the lack of acceptance of traditional birth attendants by community maternal health programs, lack of information about health care and the need for it, lack of self-esteem, and the position of the woman in the family and her ability to make her own decisions concerning health care.








Medical facilities, hospitals, and clinics, as well as medical staffphysicians, nurses, midwives, and traditional birth attendantsare lacking. If facilities are not located in the same village or town, women need transportation to get to these facilities; many do not have access to cars or bicycles, are not on a bus route, or do not have the money to spend on transportation. Some women do not have the time to go to the doctor or other medical practitioners; they cannot get time off from work or cannot leave their children alone. Some do not have money to pay for medical services. Some women live in rural areas that do not provide easy access to medical facilities. The climate in some






 












Page 14




countries may affect women's ability to get to health care facilities. Lack of communications, e.g., telephone service, also plays a role in women's ability to gain information concerning their medical conditions or to make appointments.








If midwives or traditional birth attendants (women from the local village who are untrained in modern medicine) are not available, maternal and child mortality levels may increase. For example, in Matlab, Bangladesh, maternal mortality decreased by 68 percent over three years when midwives staffed two health clinic sites (Fauveau 1991). Midwives in Ghana were trained in advanced lifesaving techniques and midwifery skills and, as a result, mortality has been reduced significantly. Midwives have developed good supportive relationships with community and traditional practitioners in Ghana, which has contributed to improved maternal and child health. These cooperative, mutually respectful relationships among all health care workers are critical to the success of health care programs. According to Okafor (1991), traditional birth attendants and midwives have a poor working relationship in many parts of Nigeria, which has led to inadequate services being provided to pregnant women.








The sex of the health care provider also plays a role in whether or not a woman will seek health care. For example, most doctors in Egypt are male; custom dictates that women, once past puberty, should not be seen by any male other than a close relative. Even in an emergency situation, many women must get their husband's permission to seek treatment. A woman's reputation could be ruined if she seeks out a male doctor for treatment of any kind; many will question her purity and accuse her of sexual misconduct (el Saadawi, 1980; Krieger 1991). Islamic married women in Cameroon cannot be touched by a male without the husband's permission. Women interviewed in one study claimed that they would rather die than seek medical care without their husband's approval (Alexandre 1991).








Lack of knowledge concerning the human body and the need for health care in certain circumstances also limits the ability of women to seek help. In some cases, women do not recognize their or their child's need for medical attention. Sometimes women deny, or refuse to acknowledge, their pregnancy in its early stages, when prenatal care may be critical to the health of the mother and of the fetus. Sometimes men do not want to know that their wives are pregnant again, especially if birth control is not available or not encouraged for religious reasons.








Some women do not seek medical care because they have






 












Page 15




been taught to believe that suffering is women's lot in life. They accept overwork, back pain, reproductive tract infections, and chronic fatigue as a part of life. Women often deal with life crises by putting the needs of their families first, while putting their own needs last (Moser 1991).








In other cases, traditional beliefs and practices also may preclude a woman from seeking medical attention, especially during pregnancy. Women may believe that it is not necessary to seek help when pregnant, that local midwives will take care of everything during birth, or that certain foods will help, or hinder, a pregnancy.








Nutrition








Because most women put in long hours and have many roles, as wife, mother, and income earner, they are vulnerable to malnutrition. Poverty also influences a woman's nutritional status. Separate studies conducted by Anderson (1991) and Senapati (1991) showed the heavy workload of women in India to be strongly associated with low weight. The nutritional status of women when they are pregnant is especially important. The World Health Organization has estimated that each year 20 million babies are born with low birth weight and 90 percent of this group are born to women living in developing countries (Kramer 1987).








The men and boys in a family often are fed before the girls and the women because boys and men are perceived as more valuable and therefore deserving of as much food as they need to stay healthy and satisfied. According to a report on maternal health by the government of Lesotho (1990), the major factor leading to the poor nutritional status of women is the "tradition of feeding men and boys before women and girls, [where] the nutritious foods are served to male members of the families and females would then have the leftovers" (page 5). A study of rural Bangladesh found that girls were three times more likely to be malnourished than boys (Chen, Huq, and D'Souza 1981). A UNICEF (1986) study determined that in 45 developing countries, mortality rates for girls ages one to four are higher than for boys in 43 of these countries, often as a direct result of malnutrition.








As a result of numerous pregnancies, low food intake, and high work demands, women are not able to meet the nutritional needs of their bodies. They may experience deficiencies of specific vitamins and minerals or a condition of chronic malnutrition may exist. Women tend to suffer from anemia as a result of






 












Page 16




iron deficiency, or iodine deficiency, or stunted growth as a result of lack of protein and calories. As women age, their health may deteriorate as a direct result of poor nutrition throughout their lives.








According to some researchers, pregnant women may not eat certain foods due to myths and superstitions. Women in some African, Asian, and Middle Eastern countries may be prohibited by local taboos from eating certain foods, including eggs, milk, and occasionally even fruits and vegetables (Acasadi and Johnson-Acasadi 1990). Pregnant women may have a deficiency of iron and become anemic, which may lead to infections and problems with the health of the fetus. Four of the major causes of maternal mortality are related to poor nutrition: hemorrhage, infection, obstructed labor, and eclampsia (Koblinsky, Timyan, and Gay 1993).








Women's occupational health is also at risk in many Third World countries. While few statistics are available to determine the size of the problem, many health hazards do exist. For example, women working in agriculture may be exposed to dangerous pesticides and other chemicals used to enhance crop size. Women working at home may be exposed to eyestrain and more serious vision problems as a result of close production work. Poor lighting may contribute to this problem. Many countries do not have safety laws that protect workers from common dangers in the workplace, including exposed wiring, lack of fire protection equipment such as sprinkler systems, and crowded conditions without adequate exits. Locked doors have proven deadly in several developing countries; fires have started somewhere in the building and women have not been able to get out of the building in time.








Contraceptives








Family planning programs provide individuals and families with the ability to safely regulate and control their fertility. In many countries, government policies and laws determine the availability of contraceptives to the general population. These policies and laws may be based on the need to reduce population growth, since many countries are currently concerned over the growing number of people being born in their countries, which puts heavy pressure on social and economic institutions.








Contraceptives challenge the belief that men have the right to control women's fertility and sexuality. In areas where contra-






 












Page 17




ception resources are available, the level of education that a woman has achieved influences her willingness to use contraceptives. The more education a woman has, the more likely she is to use some form of birth control. Educated women are more likely to understand the way contraceptives work and their side effects, and are less likely to be inhibited about discussing their use with their husbands and actually using them (Jejeebhoy 1995).








Even where family planning policies are in effect, some countries prohibit the advertising of services, prevent trained medical personnel from distributing contraceptives, or in some other way prohibit the use of contraceptives. In some countries nurses are not allowed to insert intrauterine devices (IUDs) or distribute oral contraceptives. If women do not have the consent of their husbands or if adolescent girls do not have the permission of their parents (rarely given), contraceptives are not provided. In many developing countries, the decision to use contraceptives is often made by the husband. The prevailing belief in these countries is that a woman's fertility is the property of the husband; the husband is the only one who is allowed to determine whether or not to use birth control and what type to use. For example, a study of men's attitudes and practice regarding family planning in Sudan discovered that men are the ones to decide contraceptive use and were also responsible for procuring the contraceptive (Khalifa 1988).








The cost of contraceptives may be a factor in whether or not a woman uses them. Other problems include the availability of contraceptives, the distance one has to travel to procure them, the poor quality of services provided in procuring them, fear of negative health consequences and side effects, limited choice of method, and the cost of restocking the supply.








One program that is often cited as a highly successful program in supplying contraceptives is the Bangladesh Women's Health Coalition. This program provides a wide variety of contraceptives in an environment supportive of women and their needs. The coalition offers a wide variety of other health care services of interest to women and provided by women paramedics, including gynecological exams, prenatal care, immunizations, early termination of pregnancy, treatment of early childhood diseases, and referrals to hospitals for sterilization. In Ghana, the Ghana National Family Planning Program provides services to rural areas using mobile family planning teams in association with village-based primary health care workers and the Maternal and Child Health






 












Page 18




Centers. Services are provided by both women and men, after staff members discovered that in one area almost one-half of the clients were men. Staff members found that men appeared to be more consistent users of contraception and were effective as advocates for family planning (Bouzidi and Korte 1990).








In Nigeria, more than 33,300 family planning service sites exist, but service availability varies widely and there is a limited selection of methods (Kiragu, Chapman, and Lewis 1995). The 1992 Nigeria Family Planning Facility Census found that chemist shops and patent-medicine stores are the most common providers of family planning services (56 percent), while clinics provide 11 percent, and hospitals, health centers, and maternity homes each provide about 7 percent. Fifteen percent of the sites in Lagos and 60 percent of the sites in Benue state report having difficulties in obtaining contraceptive supplies. Counseling services are provided by 41 percent of the sites, while only 4 percent offer informational pamphlets or brochures.








Abortion








Abortion is one of the most controversial topics today throughout the world. Many countries outlaw abortion because it goes against the particular religious beliefs of the country. Other countries allow abortions when the life of the mother is in danger or when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. In developed countries as well as in developing countries, discussions and policies concerning abortion are usually controversial.








Induced abortion is probably the oldest and maybe the most widely used form of fertility control (Royston and Armstrong 1989). According to Jacobson (1990), approximately 55 million pregnancies are terminated each year by induced abortions. Approximately one-half of these abortions are illegal and occur in developing countries, while the other half are legal abortions performed in the developed countries, China, and India (Population Crisis Committee 1989). Physical results of unsafe abortions include hemorrhage, uterine perforation, cervical trauma, and even death of the woman. Other costs include psychological trauma, guilt, expense, and the stigma associated with having an abortion.








Unsafe induced abortions are the leading cause of female mortality. These are the most preventable maternal deaths. Abortions by themselves are not responsible for women's deaths; abortions that are unsafely performed are the cause of death. According to Hogberg (1985), deaths per 100,000 legal






 












Page 19




abortions range from 0.1 in developed countries to 6.0 in developing countries.








According to Dixon-Mueller (1990), approximately one-third of all people in the Third World live in countries in which abortion services are either prohibited or severely limited, usually to cases of rape, incest, or saving a woman's life. In these countries, some women who find themselves pregnant often go to extreme measures to terminate a pregnancy. Abortion policies vary from country to country. Each country's policy is influenced by several factors, including religion, birth rates, and population policies. Countries with large numbers of Muslims or Roman Catholics tend to restrict or prohibit abortion. Countries may watch their birth rates and, as they drop, institute laws restricting abortion. For example, low birth rates in Czechoslovakia led to the government's 1973 decree restricting access to abortion services. On the other hand, as birth rates increase, countries may adopt more liberal abortion policies. Countries such as China and India, with major population increases that have a major impact on society, have liberalized their abortion laws in the wake of unprecedented population growth.








In Bangladesh, under the Penal Code of 1960 induced abortion is allowed only to save the mother's life. This law was waived in 1972 for women who were raped during the War of Liberation. In Nigeria, abortion is a criminal offense for both the woman and the person performing the abortion. The only exceptions made are to save the woman's life (Okabue 1990). However, these laws are rarely enforced and many women crowd Nigerian hospitals suffering from incomplete or problematic abortions or other complications (Ladipo 1989).








In India, abortion was illegal until the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971, except in cases in which the life of the mother was in danger. Rapid population growth in India had threatened the country's political stability, economic growth, and social progress. In 1991, its population according to the 1991 Census was 844.3 million people; some estimates push it over the one billion mark by 2001 (Chandrasekhar 1994). Family planning activities have been encouraged throughout India, but were hurt by the coercive methods of Sanjay Gandhi, the son of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. As a result of his negative activities, the name of the Ministry of Family Planning was changed to the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Today, over 6,500 medical institutions, including district hospitals, clinics, and private medical centers, provide abortion services. However, many of these institutions are located






 












Page 20




in urban areas, serving only 25 percent of the total population. Access to abortion services in rural areas is still very limited.








Maternal Mortality








Women's work is often devalued or considered of less value than men's work. This belief often leads to gender discrimination in the distribution of basic resources including food and health care and may lead to early death. Women often die from many of the same causes as men, but one gender-specific cause of maternal mortality is childbirth. Hemorrhage, obstructed labor, infections, hypertension, and complications from induced abortion are the major causes of maternal death during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Maternal deaths in Third World countries account for a high proportion of all deaths of women in their reproductive years. Maine (1991) found that one of five deaths among women in their childbearing years in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Egypt were related to pregnancy. This compares with one of 200 deaths in the United States.








Female Circumcision








Often referred to as female genital mutilation, the practice of female genital circumcision has seen increased attention in recent years. Even in the United States, many states have attempted to outlaw the practice by families from countries in which it is practiced, considering it a form of child sexual abuse. Physical complications from this "surgery" are often severe, and may include hemorrhage, tetanus, blood poisoning, and shock from the pain of the operation. In a study of the practice in Sierra Leone, Hosken (1988) found that 83 percent of all women who were circumcised were treated at some time in their lives for problems related to the circumcision.








Female circumcision may take several forms. The least damaging form is referred to as mild sunna, which consists of slitting or removing the prepuce of the clitoris. A modified sunna consists of the partial or total removal of the clitoris. A clitoridectomy consists of the removal of part or all of the clitoris and part or all of the labia minora (and is also referred to as sunna in the Sudan). Infibulation or pharaonic circumcision is the most radical form of circumcision and consists of a clitoridectomy, the removal of the labia minora, and the removal of the inner layers of






 












Page 21




the labia majora. The remaining edges of the labia are sewn together to form a bridge of scar tissue over the opening to the vagina (Lightfoot-Klein 1989).








Young girls in many countries in Africa and a few countries in Asia undergo female genital circumcision. In many rural parts of Africa, traditional midwives often perform the circumcision, although barbers and male priests are also known to perform it. Antiseptics and anesthesia, according to Lightfoot-Klein (1989), are generally not used. In urban areas, doctors, nurses, or midwives perform the procedure and are known to use anesthesia and antiseptics.








According to common belief, circumcision continues today primarily because it has always been doneit is the custom of many cultures. Reasons for continuing the practice include the protection of women from unwanted sexual intercourse; the protection of women from their own sexuality, from an uncontrolled sexual appetite; to keep young girls virgins; to enhance fertility; to enhance femininity; to keep married women faithful; and to keep women from masturbating. Perdita Huston talked with several women in the Sudan about the practice of circumcision and the events of their own circumcision. Huston describes her discussions with these women:








The views these women expressed seemed somewhat ambivalent. Although they all voiced liberal ''theories" on women's rightsand behaviorthey nevertheless showed a surprising willingness to perpetuate in practice the very customs they condemned. They said that virginity should not be considered importanteven arguing that it would be better to have relations with a man before marriage, in order to know him well. Moreover, although they said they believed the practice of circumcision to be harmful and useless, when I asked if they would circumcise their daughters, they all said, "Yes, I will have to." Clearly these women did not yet dare to act according to their expressed convictionsa reflection of how entrenched the custom of circumcision, particularly, remains in their part of the world. (Huston 1979, 51)








Long-term effects of circumcision include loss of any sexual feeling, chronic urinary tract infections, painful intercourse, pelvic infections, and severe scarring that can result in hemorrhaging






 












Page 22




during childbirth. Women often must be cut open on their wedding night and when giving birth in order to make sexual relations and childbirth possible.








The movement to prevent female circumcision began in African countries in the 1960s and continues today. Many women's groups are working to eliminate this practice. The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children as well as many professionals, including physicians and nurses, gather information concerning female genital circumcision and advocate for an end to this practice. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child calls for an end to harmful social and cultural practices. The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development as well as the Convention on the Rights of the Child also condemn traditional practices that may negatively impact the health of children.








Sexually Transmitted Diseases








Sexually transmitted diseases, including gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and AIDS, affect both men and women throughout the world. In developing countries, these diseases can cause even more problems than in the more developed countries. Many women in developing countries do not seek timely medical attention for many reasons. These reasons include unavailability of doctors or nurses, especially in rural areas; poverty; lack of time; cultural inhibitions; problems in communicating with male doctors; and feelings of shame over their conditions (Koblinsky, Timyan, and Gay 1993).








For some women, the inability to deny sex to their husbands creates an additional vulnerability to sexually transmitted diseases. In many countries, men are allowed, even expected, to seek sex outside of their marriage. If they contract a sexually transmitted disease, they are often unaware of their infection and eventually transmit the infection to their wives. Activities such as prostitution also contribute to women contracting sexually transmitted diseases.








Prostitution








Prostitution has become big business in many countries. In recent years, it has become international in scope. In the past, several






 












Page 23




southeast Asian countries were known as places in which women could be found for "rest and recreation" activities for foreign military personnel. Today, these countries and several others have expanded these services to include wealthy businessmen and tourists as clients; men traveling alone are creating a new market for prostitutes. Developing countries often encourage these activities, either openly or quietly behind the scenes, because the foreign currency benefits the countries' economies. Some researchers have found that prostitution in the entertainment industry is no longer confined to Asia and South Korea. Kenya, Senegal, and Brazil are now included in the sex tour circuit, countries in which rich businessmen often come for the express purpose of prostitution and other sexual activities (Cincone 1988).








Women involved in prostitution may be participating voluntarily or may have been coerced into this activity. For example, in Thailand, poverty impels rural parents to sell their daughters into prostitution for the survival of the family. In their eyes, economic reality justifies this practice. The government in Thailand has openly encouraged tourism, and Thai officials declared 1980 the Year of the Tourist. Deputy Prime Minister Boonchu Pojanasathian suggested to local governors that they could help the national tourism campaign by "developing scenic spots in your provinces while encouraging certain entertainment activities which some of you may find disgusting and embarrassing because they are related to sexual pleasure" (Holden et al. 1983, as quoted in Turshen and Holcomb 1993, 137).








In South Korea, a coalition of 24 women's organizations called on the government to take action against the growing practice of women being kidnapped and sold into prostitution to meet the needs of the growing entertainment industry. A study conducted in 1989 estimated that over 400,000 businesses in the entertainment field provided prostitutes to their customers, and that between 1.2 and 1.5 million women were participating as prostitutes. This number represents approximately 20 percent of South Korean women between the ages of 15 and 29. Prostitution is big business in South Korea, providing an estimated $5.7 billion to the economy, which is approximately 5 percent of the country's gross national product (Seoul YMCA 1989).








Prostitution places women in danger. The most common danger is from sexually transmitted disease, including gonorrhea, syphilis, and AIDS, but physical violence also endangers women. Male sexual aggression may lead to beatings and other






 












Page 24




physical harm. In Bangkok, a study sponsored by the United Nations found that two-thirds of women in Bangkok were afraid of being raped or physically assaulted while walking on the city's streets. The researchers found that hospital statistics of rapes and assaults supported this fear (Buendia 1989).








Sterilization








In recent years, attention has been drawn to the issue of sterilization of women. Some countries have been found to sterilize women of childbearing age in order to prevent them from having children. Joselina da Silva, a Brazilian organizer, believes that, in her country, approximately "46 percent of sexually active women between sixteen and fifty-four are now sterilized; the great majority of them are between sixteen and twenty-four years old" (da Silva 1991, 41).








Violence against Women








Throughout the world, women are threatened with violence, including violent acts committed against them by their husbands. In many developing countries, women are expected to obey their husbands and the husbands often have permission to discipline and control their wives in whatever ways they see fit. In Bangladesh, Stewart (1989) found that the murder of wives by their husbands accounted for 50 percent of all murders in the country. Almost 75 percent of all women murdered in Papua New Guinea were killed by their husbands (Bradley 1988).








Many women have died in India as a result of the practice of dowry. The practice of the woman's family providing a dowry to the husband has been prohibited by law since 1961. However, the practice itself, along with bride-burning or dowry deaths has grown in recent years. Many experts believe that providing dowry serves the purpose of elevating the economic status of the husband and his family. When the husband decides that his wife's family has not provided him with enough of a dowry, he may resort to burning his wife alive. Police often have a difficult time proving that the woman was intentionally murdered, primarily because the husbands often make the death look like a cooking accident. Official reports for all of India reported 4,835 dowry deaths throughout the country in 1991, although the Ahmedabad Women's Action Group estimates that over 1,000






 












Page 25




women in Gujarat alone may be burned alive each year (Kelkar 1991).








Rape may be one of the most underreported crimes against women throughout the world. The stigma and shame that is often associated with rape appears universal. Estimates in developing countries are believed to be even less accurate than in developed countries because the report rate in developing countries is even lower than in developed countries. Even in developing countries, statistics indicate that most women who have been raped know their assailant. In countries that highly value a woman's virginity, including many Asian, Middle Eastern, and African countries, women who have been raped have lost all value. Fauveau and. Blanchet (1989) studied rape in Bangladesh and found that "even when women are victims, a premarital sexual relation is said to spoil something intrinsic in their physical and moral person.... Their ruined reputation cannot be amended" (Koblinsky, Timyan, and Gay 1993, 178). Women are driven to suicide, beaten, or murdered as a result of the dishonor that they have brought upon their families.








In some countries, rape is used as a weapon against the women of one's enemies. Within Pakistani society, Ahmed (1992) writes that "feuds are settled through rapes. Men avenge themselves on each other by raping each other's mothers, wives, daughters and sisters. A brave adversary is supposed to break down under the grief and dishonor of the violation of his womenfolk. At times, women are gang raped, then paraded naked in the streets to show to the society that terminal revenge has been taken" (page 36).








In many countries, marital rape is not considered rape. In India, in the early 1980s, many women's groups demanded that forced intercourse by a husband with his wife without her consent should be considered rape. However, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 1983 states that "sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape" (Calman 1992, 121). Women have a difficult time leaving violent husbands, no matter what country they live in. In many developing countries, it is virtually impossible. For many of these women, returning to their birth families is not an option. The women's parents may have died or may be living with a son or economically dependent on a son and have no room and no economic resources to provide to the woman. In some cases, parents may talk to their son-in-law about his violent behavior and request that he stop. According to Lateef (1992), for many, "marriage






 












Page 26




is meant to be permanent and women's suffering within marriage is taken for granted" (page 197).








Women and Work








In the formal world of work, women face discrimination and multiple challenges. Access to jobs may be limited within certain cultures that restrict the position of women. The general economic conditions of the area in which they live affect women's standard of living and ability to find work outside the home. Women often earn less than men in many occupations. Women are usually found in lower level jobs than men. Changing economic policies have affected women and their position in the economy of many Third World countries. Women's lack of access to assets such as land and other forms of collateral hurt their ability to get loans to start businesses. However, in many areas, despite the many restrictions faced by women, women are increasing their participation in the workforce and assuming a greater economic responsibility for their families.








Women have traditionally had trouble obtaining credit from banks and other lending institutions. In many Third World countries women have not been allowed to own property; husbands or fathers have had control of property. Therefore, women have been unable to provide any form of collateral to back up a bank loan. However, by the 1980s, some institutions had begun to realize that women are usually excellent credit risks. Nongovernmental organizations and several small business lenders have demonstrated that providing loans to women entrepreneurs is good business. The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, the Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA) Cooperative Bank in India, and Banco Solidario in Bolivia have pioneered efforts to provide loans to poor women who have no collateral.








The Grameen Bank provides services to poor landless women in Bangladesh. More than two-thirds of all villages in Bangladesh are covered by this bank, which provides banking and other financial services as well as skills development. Formed by the Self-Employed Women's Association of India, the SEWA Cooperative Bank has one main office, with mobile credit officers. The bank works with rural credit groups and provides individual loans and group lending to rural associations. The Banco Solidario is a commercial bank that offers a variety of services, financial as well as nonfinancial, to clients.

Women's World Banking (WWB) is a global network of over 50 institutions that provides credit, savings, and business services to women. The network offers technical assistance and the local affiliates provide direct financial services to their clients. FINCA International is another affiliate network of nongovernmental organizations in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. Affiliates provide credit through village banks; the main offices provide loan capital and technical assistance. The World Council of Credit Unions, located in Washington, D.C., is a network of 17,000 credit unions in 67 developing countries. Another affiliate network is Friends of WWB/India, an NGO with a national network of grassroots NGOs that provide financial services to poor rural women. The organization offers technical assistance and loan support to NGOs and organizes credit and savings groups.








Agricultural Activities








Women play a major role in the agricultural activities of many Third World countries. Governments are beginning to recognize this role that women play in the local economy. In Kenya, a national agricultural extension system, recently studied by Barbara Herz (1989), specifically targets women in addition to men. Extension agents in Kenya have reported that over half the farmers they meet with are women. This experience has influenced extension efforts in other African counties, including Cameroon, Somalia, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe.








In many Third World countries, women participate in cash crop production more than men. In sub-Saharan Africa, employment is divided generally along gender lines. Women are responsible for providing food; this includes food production and agricultural activities. In the past, men were responsible only for clearing the land for farming. Today, men, for the most part, work in nonagricultural jobs or in agricultural jobs not located on the farms (Joekes 1987). Women in Nicaragua play a large role in coffee and cotton production. Women in Nigeria outnumber men in cocoa, coffee, rice, maize, grain, and cassava production. However, land rights pass down through the male line and current systems of land registration continue this practice. The land is allocated to the men; women are excluded from the legal title (Joekes 1987).








In Asia, many women are involved in rice farming activities, especially at the production and postharvest phases. Their roles






 












Page 28




vary widely, depending on economic, religious, and social factors within each country. Women can benefit from technological advances in agriculture as long as they have some control over the income received, and this varies from country to country. In Java, women are allowed to own land and control household finances, while women in Bangladesh have little input or control over agriculture-related decisions (Stoler 1977; Abdullah and Zeidenstein 1982).








Industry








Industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in developing countries. Women in many developing countries have found employment in export-oriented industries, including garment and circuit board production. In Bangladesh, the export garment business opened up 500,000 jobs for young women (UBINIG 1991). Even though pay is low, hours are long, health hazards exist, and job security is nonexistent, many women move from rural areas specifically to take these jobs. Many women find that employment frees them from many social and cultural traditions and oppression.








Women have increased their participation in industry in recent years. Their participation often reinforces sexual stratification in the labor market. Unless training and other incentives are provided to women, they will continue to remain in low-paying, dead-end, and often hazardous jobs. The mechanization of tasks may also reduce the number of women employed in this sector, unless other industries move in to provide new jobs. When women participate in wage labor, especially rural women, they are often vulnerable to discrimination, primarily in areas of lower wages. Many employers also find that rural women are usually more docile and less likely to complain about working conditions, low wages, or other problems with their jobs.








In addition to employment in industrial facilities, many industries work from small workshops and women work in their own homes. Wages are usually lower in these cases, women receive fewer fringe benefits, and job security is still nonexistent.








Services








Women participate heavily in several service sectors, including community services, such as health, education, and social welfare;






 












Page 29




commerce; and domestic service. Tourism is a major employer of women in many developing countries. Informal activities account for a larger percentage of female employment than employment in the formal sector in most Third World countries. Many reasons for this participation exist. The informal labor market is usually easier to enter, in part because it usually requires fewer skills than the formal market. Informal work can be done at home or at times of the day that enable women to take care of their families and work at the same time. Cultural patterns and expectations about women and work also make it easier for women to enter the informal labor market.








Outwork, or subcontracting work that can be done in the home, is becoming more popular for women, especially in Third World countries. Employers are able to cut costs and avoid paying benefits to many of these workers. Women who work these jobs provide their own toolsfor example, sewing machinesand can set their own hours, as long as they meet quotas set by their employer. The drawbacks for women include low wages, little or no benefits, and no formal organization or union to protect rights.








Women in many countries are beginning to see the benefits of organizing among themselves. One of the best-known groups is India's Self-Employed Women's Association, established in 1972 by a group of garment vendors, head-loaders, and vegetable sellers. SEWA has organized over 40,000 women workers in Gujarat and five other states in India, helping them to get licenses, organize industrial and service cooperatives, and obtain legal help. Women members receive assistance in obtaining loans and banking services. The group also advocates for women's rights (Bhatt 1989).








Structural Adjustment Programs








During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the International Monetary Fund instituted "structural adjustment programs" designed to help debtor nations "balance their import and export accounts, cut government spending, and repay their international loans" (Kahne and Giele 1992, 20). In some countries, structural adjustment policies have been harmful influences on women's work and the well-being of children and families. Unemployment has risen, with women losing the most jobs; education, health, and other social programs that were funded by the government have lost funding or have suffered reduced funding; and, in some instances, women's access to land and credit has decreased.






 












Page 30




In Africa, structural adjustment programs require reductions in government spending, which often hurt women as well as men. Spending on infrastructure and social programs is frequently cut, and since women and children compose the majority of the poor in any society, they are hurt the most. When governments cut back on spending on infrastructure, such as building and maintaining roads and providing telecommunications services, ease in transporting goods to markets suffers. In Africa, where many women are in agriculture, these policies make it even more difficult for rural areas to succeed in business. Health care services also suffer, as well as education. In a study on structural adjustment programs, Cornia, Jolly, and Stewart (1987) found that reductions in spending on social programs are detrimental to children. These programs also affect women as they attempt to care for their children without any support from the government.








Politics and the State's Role in the Status of Women








Patriarchal policies are often promoted by governments; these policies reinforce gender inequality. Afshar (1987) describes how state policy influences the public and private lives of its citizens and can have a definite impact on women's lives. She specifically explains how, in Iran, the fear of women's sexuality as well as the perception of women as disruptive agents and dangerous to the state led to legislation that secluded women in the home. Afshar believes that, in this way, the state justifies the benefits that men receive as a result of controlling women.








Population Policies








Population policies, or lack of policies, of individual countries provide an opportunity to understand how individual governments treat women, what governments perceive as women's functions in life, and how women are treated and cared for. In recent years, population policies have been adopted or expanded by many countries. These countries recognize the need to examine the effect that family planning programs have on general fertility levels as well as the effect they have on individuals.








Population policies vary from country to country and change over time within countries depending on the focus of the






 












Page 31




government at the time the policies are adopted. For example, in 1967, the government of Iran adopted its first population control policy. Based on an increasing growth rate, the government legalized induced abortion during the first trimester as long as the husband approved. Contraceptives were provided by the Ministry of Public Health through a network of family planning clinics, and contraceptive use was advocated by the national women's associations and other interested organizations. Efforts were also made to improve women's status within the family structure and in the more public areas of work. When the Shah of Iran fell from power, a conservative Islamic government took over and these family planning activities and programs were dismantled. The government lowered the minimum age for marriage and encouraged early and universal marriage; all family planning activities were opposed by the government. Major problems of overpopulation in Iran eventually led to the adoption of a national birth control policy (Hoodfar 1992).








Several international conferences have focused recently on human rights and population. Participants are searching for ways to define reproductive rights so that these rights are accepted across all cultures. Currently, population policies generally have a broader focus that looks at these policies in their larger social context. The health aspect of reproduction, specifically as it affects women and children, is included. Population policies are seen as only a part of a country's overall development policy. The status and condition of women and their lives are now seen as directly relevant to a country's fertility policies. Reproductive health is a prime focus in these policies.








Female Refugees








Over 20 million people are refugees throughout the world, most from developing countries. They have fled their own countries because of persecution, civil wars, and human rights violations. The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees defines a refugee as a person who








owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection






 












Page 32




of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. (quoted in Martin 1991, 1)








The majority of refugees are women and children. Women bear the burden of caring for their children, preparing meals, and dealing with new living arrangements, either in a refugee camp or in a new and strange environment. The role of the woman rarely changes, while her husband's role changes more drastically. The husband may not be able to find productive work or support his family. Women often find themselves responsible for maintaining the traditional culture as well as for supporting the family.








Many organizations are working to help refugee women manage their lives. In a refugee settlement in Zaire, female coordinators are elected by the camp population to help coordinate activities, including distribution of food and other goods, and ensure that women receive adequate care. These coordinators provide basic health education, help pregnant women find prenatal care, and encourage parents to have their children vaccinated. In refugee camps along the border between Thailand and Cambodia, the Khmer Women's Association provides similar services. The association uses social workers to identify needs and problems within the camps and participates in discussions concerning policies and procedures within the camps and the impact of these policies on the women living there. Trainers teach a variety of classes, including basic literacy skills and sewing and weaving. Day care is provided for the children of women enrolled in classes (Martin 1991).








Women refugees need protection from being returned to their country of origin, from armed attacks against them, and from illegal detention; women refugees also must be protected from physical and sexual abuse and exploitation. Women who are separated from their husbands while fleeing often find themselves vulnerable to sexual assault and rape. Once raped, many women are no longer accepted by their familiesthey are seen as having lost their virginity, their marital dignity, and their value and as an embarrassment to their families.








In order to help rebuild their lives, refugee women often seek income-generating activities, especially when they have been separated from their husbands, they are not married, or their






 












Page 33




husbands have died. According to Martin (1991), several steps should be taken to help women improve their economic status. These steps include ensuring that these women have equal access to programs designed to improve self-sufficiency; ensuring the full participation of women in designing programs; placing a high priority on integrating refugee women into all development plans; monitoring projects to ensure they provide sufficient income for survival; and providing technical assistance to agencies that are implementing economic development projects.








NGOs have played a large role in helping refugee women find support and protection in their new homes. The NGO Working Group on Refugee Women is a coalition of interested persons from approximately 100 NGOs worldwide. This group keeps its members informed of developments in the field, organizes meetings that coincide with the executive committee meetings at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and in 1988 convened an international meeting that focused on ways that refugee women's issues could be addressed by the international community.








Women's Rights as Human Rights








Long before the phrase ''women's rights are human rights" was prominently used at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, social reformers, writers, philosophers, and others were writing about human rights and the lack of rights available to most women. In 1792, Mary Wollstonecraft, a British feminist, wrote Vindication of the Rights of Women, in which she challenged the prevailing attitudes of the day concerning human rights. Both liberals and conservatives at the time advocated for rights for men but did not think that women needed these same rights. Later, in 1869, John Stuart Mill wrote The Subjection of Women in which he advocated equal opportunities for women and suggested ways to eliminate the basic causes of women's oppression. Today, even though many international documents exist to protect women and their rights (see Chapter 4), women in many areas of the world are not aware of their rights or are denied these rights by common practice or by law. In many cases, women are not aware of the fact that they have certain rights or how to gain access to information on how to gain their rights.








In many countries, a woman's status in her social environment is based on the number of children she has. Women's rights






 












Page 34




too often focus only on issues concerning motherhood and child-rearing, which often diverts attention from other areas in which women face discrimination. This is not to say that motherhood is not important; childbearing and child-rearing are highly valued in most societies. But most women's rights advocates believe that equal rights for women should go beyond motherhood and raising children. According to Tomasevski (1993) "protection of motherhood is compensation to those women who perform a socially valued function, it is not granted them merely because they are women" (page 17).








Issues that relate to motherhood include access to family planning services as well as to abortion services. In all cases, access to family planning should include access to information and services for both men and women. In many cases, family planning services have focused on women, thus perpetuating the view that because women bear children and men do not, women should be the only ones concerned with issues related to family planning. According to most experts in the field, men must be included in this area; their absence only reinforces the often irresponsible behavior of fathers toward their children (Tomasevski 1993; Dixon-Mueller 1993; Sen, Germain, and Chen 1994).








Many international conferences and documents have examined human rights in relation to family planning. The 1968 Teheran Conference on Human Rights declared that parents, not just fathers, have the right to determine the number and spacing of their children. The World Population Plan of Action of 1974, the International Conference on Population held in 1984, the Amsterdam Declaration of 1989, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (Article 16e) all affirmed the rights of both parents to determine the number and spacing of their children.








For women living in Islamic countries, the concept of women's rights is not the same as human rights. According to AnNa'im (1995), "Where as human rights are, by definition, universal in that they are owed to all human beings by virtue of their humanity without distinction on grounds of gender or religion, the concept of rights under shari'a [the law of God according to the Islamic faith] is fundamentally premised on these distinctions. That is to say, there are different rights for Muslim men, Muslim women, and non-Muslims under shari'a, rather than equal rights for all, regardless of gender or religion" (page 57).

Role of International Conferences and Conventions








Women came from all over the world to attend the 1985 Nairobi Conference during the UN Decade for Women. Stories of the determination of women from rural areas in developing countries inspired all attendees and many women who were not able to attend. In a small town in western Kenya, Elizabeth Wanjara came by bus; her fare was paid for by eight local women who expected her to return and report to them what she found out:








Elizabeth Wanjara heard about the Decade for Women Conference on a transistor radio at home in the town of Bungoma in western Kenya, 450 miles from [Nairobi]. With eight local women, she saved up by selling honey and knitting sweaters and bought herself a bus ticket. Mrs W. doesn't know exactly how old she is or how many grandchildren she has. She speaks only her tribal Kiswahili dialect and cannot read or write. But she knows exactly why she came to Nairobi. "I have to go back to all the women in my place and tell them how we can be ourselvesno longer just have babies and have babies dying." (Sciolino 1985)








The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1979 and entered into force in 1981 following ratification by the twentieth country (see Chapter 4 for excerpts from this document). By 1989, almost 100 countries had agreed to follow its provisions. By 1993, 120 nations had ratified it. This convention elaborates on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by affirming women's rights to individual freedoms and to social entitlements as an expression of the equality of men and women. Rights are introduced that specifically concern women, such as right to maternity leave and benefits and the prohibition against dismissal of a woman from her job due to pregnancy. The convention also acknowledges the need for special and temporary affirmative action measures to redress wrongs against women. Finally, the convention focuses on the obligation of states to modify all existing discriminatory social and cultural patterns in order to eliminate practices that treat women as inferior beings.






 












Page 36




In order to improve the lives and status of women in Third World countries, more countries must agree to follow the provisions of many of the conventions established by the United Nations and the International Labour Organization. International conferences are enabling more women to know of and understand the rights they have, as women and as human beings. As the number and influence of NGOs throughout the world grows, more and more women will be encouraged to help themselves and help their communities grow and prosper.








Many development NGOs and governmental agencies understand the importance of integrating women into the development process. According to Joekes (1987), "for true economic recovery to occur, women need to be well integrated into the development process. Urban women should be better prepared to work in the modern sector, and rural women should have the opportunity to increase their efficiency as food producers" (page 139). But integrating women into this process changes many aspects of society, including "social and political structures, the distribution of wealth, and cultural mores. It is, in short, revolutionary in its implications" (Franda 1979, 8). According to Fredland (1992), communities thrive when women are included at the decision-making level and in implementing aspects of development activities. She believes that because "life in the villages depends on the work of women in the home and family, in the fields, and at the market, it is important to give attention to the specific needs of women if constructive development is to occur'' (page 194).








Many steps are being taken today to improve the lives of women in the Third World. Governments as well as NGOs are realizing the important contributions that women make to society and are acting accordingly. Women's lives have improved in many areas, but work still must be done in other areas, especially for women living in Islamic countries, where their activities are still severely restricted. Many women in Third World countries are currently benefiting from literacy programs, provision of health care facilities, and programs that involve women in economic development. More and more women are becoming involved as activists and advocates in programs that focus on gaining the rights to which women are entitled and on improving their status and lives.

2 Chronology








The history of the status and rights of women in Third World countries is rich in detail beginning in early history. Because so many events affecting women have occurred throughout history, this chapter focuses on more recent history. Most of the events listed here occurred after 1974, although several items are included from before 1975 to provide a perspective on women's activism and concern for women and their lives in the Third World. References at the end of this chapter provide additional sources of information concerning important dates in women's history.

The group will eventually prepare an international treaty on the Nationality of Married Women (1933) and the Declaration of Lima in Favor of Women's Rights (1938). The group encourages "member government to establish women's bureaus, to revise discriminatory civil codes and to take their demands to the LN [League of Nations] in Geneva" (Winslow 1995, 4).

The conference is the largest consciousness-raising event held on this subject and advances women's claim to full citizenship. The conference is significant because it marks the beginning of the bringing together of two distinct agendas: the women's agenda, defined and developed by the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), and the larger political agenda of the United Nations. Delegations from 133 nations and representatives from 8 UN agencies, 12 UN programs, and 192 NGOs in consultative status attend the Conference on International Women's Year.

Delegates come from 29 European countries, 33 Asian countries, 44 African countries, and 33 countries in North, Central, and South America, Australia, and New Zealand. Over 700 journalists from 48 countries also attend. Nine commissions meet for three days to focus on specific areas of concern to women; these areas include equality of women in society; women and work in industry and agriculture; women and development; the family and society; the education of women; women and the struggle for peace, detente, and international security; women and the struggle for national independence and international solidarity; the effect of mass media, literature, and art on the attitude of public opinion toward women; and cooperation and joint action of women of the world and of governmental and nongovernmental organizations and the United Nations for the realization of the aims of International Women's Year.








The Committee on the Status of Women in India publishes their findings in a report, Towards Equality. This government report examines the ways in which the status of women affects the lives of women. For example, the report notes that from 1901 on the ratio of females to males in the population has declined. In 1901, there were 972 females for every 1,000 males; by 1971 the number of females had declined to 930 per 1,000 males. The strong preference for sons, the effect of childbearing on women, and the general neglect of women all have an impact on these statistics, according to the report. Other customs examined include patrilocality, the practice of a young woman moving to the home of her husband once she is married. This practice forces a woman to change her loyalty from her own birth family to the family of her husband; the implication of the practice is that a woman is considered property and her feelings and her connections to her own birth family are not considered important.








1976

Many estimate that as many as 30 million girls have been circumcised to some extent. Most participants are health officials of countries in which female circumcision is practiced. The conference participants unanimously condemn circumcision as a practice that is disastrous to the health of women in these countries that cannot be defended on either medical or humane grounds.

In Uruguay, the Women's Institute is established within the Ministry of Education and Culture to promote policies that help women improve their status and lives.








Women from Latin America and the Caribbean meet in Taxco, Mexico, to discuss major issues of concern to them. The 1,500 participants include women from government ministries, nongovernmental organizations, and Catholic feminist organizations. Lively discussions lead to little agreement on many issues. Women represent different classes, ages, and regions, and agreement on local issues is difficult. Many participants want to focus on major gender issues and leave local issues out of the discussions.








In Costa Rica, the fifth International Women and Health Conference is held.








1988
The Korean Women's Association United, a coalition of 24 women's organizations in South Korea, holds a news conference to announce the launching of a crusade against trafficking in women and to focus attention on the increasing number of women who are being kidnapped off the streets and sold into prostitution.

1989
The International Conference on the Implications of AIDS for Mothers and Children is held in Paris, France. Two conclusions are reached at this conference concerning women and children with AIDS. First, AIDS prevention programs for women and children do not exist in most countries.

1990
Recognizing the importance of education, especially in developing countries, the United Nations declares International Literacy Year. International, national, and regional activities are encouraged to promote literacy throughout the world.

The South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation declares the Year of the Girl Child, recognizing the detrimental attitudes of many parents toward their daughters. The association claims that the common and widely held preference for male children encourages the neglect and exploitation of female children, robbing these children of their self-esteem. Males receive the majority of resources as they are growing up, including food, parental attention, health care, and education, while females are treated as second-class citizens both as children and later as adults. The association believes that this attitude must change to eliminate gender discrimination from all aspects of society.








The Permanent Working Group on the Situation of Women in the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) suggests that more women professionals should be hired at UNHCR.

Family responsibilities should be equitably shared by both parents.








At the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly, which consists of representatives of all members of the World Health Organization, a call is made to implement international policies that focus on improving women's health. The group recognizes that although recommendations have been made throughout the years to improve the health of women throughout the world, little progress has actually been made.








The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development is held in Rio de Janeiro. Participants focus attention on women as managers of natural resources and as the moving force for sustainable development and on the need for planners to recognize women's role in development when creating development projects. Experts at this meeting blame the growing population in Rwanda on husbands who refuse to let their wives use birth control pills because of the belief that pills weaken women, making them unable to work in the fields.

1993
In June, at the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, Austria, the women's caucus demands that violations of female human rights be examined when UN Treaty Committees meet to monitor and enforce the provisions of their treaties. Women's rights are finally seen as an important component of international human rights. But at the meeting, many Muslim governments who had supported the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 withdraw their support, believing that universal human rights is a Western concept, that Muslim societies should not be judged by these Western concepts, and that Islam can provide the basic elements of a fair society, including women's basic rights.








The Canadian government grants refugee status to a female Saudi national on the basis of gender-related persecution. The woman's advocates argue that her basic human rights to life, liberty, and security of the person are threatened because she does not accept the restrictions imposed on her by Saudi society. Her freedom to work, study, or dress as she wants is restricted, along with her freedom of movement in and out of the country. In addition, government policy, as well as public attitudes, led to her persecution, since she was subjected to violence whenever she walked down the street without covering her face.








The United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopts the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women. The Declaration defines violence against women as "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life." The declaration states that acts of violence against women include

1994
The International Conference on Population and Development is held in Cairo, Egypt. Participants agree that population and development policies should focus on women's equality, empowerment, reproductive rights, and sexual health. Attendees state that women must be empowered and their status improved in order for them to realize their full potential in the areas of economic, political, and social development. Empowering women is also an important goal in and of itself. As women achieve status, opportunities, and social, economic, and legal rights equal to men, human health and well-being will be enhanced. At the conference the Muslim governments join forces with representatives from the Vatican to oppose human rights for women.








The Inter-American Development Bank forms a Task Force on Women in response to requests by the bank's Professional Women's Network. The task force analyzes

The First International Conference on Dowry and Bride-Burning convenes at Harvard Law School. The conference organizers focus attention on the practice of dowry-related violence toward women in India. The National Crimes Bureau of India reports that there were 5,817 dowry deaths in 1993 and 5,199 deaths in 1994, although the Supreme Court of India estimates that up to 15,000 women die each year from dowry disputes. All of these deaths occur despite the fact that the Indian government, in 1961, enacted the Dowry Prohibition Act, prohibiting the practice of dowry. The conference suggests practical ways that dowry and bride-burning can be eliminated, such as providing residential training centers and apartment complexes for abused women.

3 Biographical Sketches








Throughout history women have played major roles in politics, social activism, health care, education, and other areas that contribute to their local communities, nations, and at an international level. Thousands of women have participated in major United Nations conferences and have contributed to the movement to improve women's status and the fight for equal rights throughout the world. This chapter provides short biographical sketches of individuals who play or have played a key role in one or more of the above-mentioned areas. But the women included here are only a few of the many women actively involved in working to improve women's lives. At the end of the chapter, a list of resources is provided to direct the reader to sources of information on the many thousands of women advocates, educators, and politicians.








Aminah Al-Said (b. 1914)








Born in Cairo, Egypt, Aminah Al-Said is a writer and advocate for women's rights. Her father, a doctor, believed that daughters should be educated along with sons. Karimah Al-Said, her sister, was a teacher who in 1965 became the first female minister of education in the Egyptian government. In

1935, Aminah was among the first small group of women to attend and graduate from Cairo University.








She became the editor of Hawa, a weekly women's magazine that has the largest foreign circulation of all Arabic papers. The first woman elected to the Egyptian Press Syndicate Executive Board, Al-Said is a member of the Supreme Board of journalism, president of Dar al Hilal Publishing House, and a popular participant in international conferences. She delivers many lectures on the status and lives of Arab women and helps audiences throughout the world understand the differences between Arab women and Western women.








Aduke Alakija (b. 1921)








A well-known Nigerian lawyer, Aduke Alakija attended primary and secondary school in Lagos, Nigeria, and continued her secondary education in the United Kingdom. After studying medicine at Glasgow University, she changed her major to social science and attended the London School of Economics. While attending Cambridge, she started the West African Students' Union. She returned to Nigeria to work as a welfare officer, but when she realized she needed to be better prepared to fight for women's rights, she returned to England to study law. She joined the Nigerian delegation to the United Nations in 1961 and spent five years as a delegate. She has been a trustee of the Federal Nigeria Society for the Blind and the International Women's Society; she was an adviser to the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, the first black African female director of Mobil Oil, and a president of the International Federation of Women Lawyers. She received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Columbia University in 1964.








Corazon Aquino (b. 1933)








Corazon Aquino was president of the Philippines from 1986 until 1992. She was born in Luzon to one of the important landowning families of her country. Her family was active politicallyher father was a congressman, and both of her grandfathers were senators. Growing up in a Catholic family, Aquino was educated at Catholic schools in Manila and the United States. She received her B.A. from Mount St. Vincent College in New York City and then returned to the Philippines to attend law school at Far Eastern University.






 












Page 77




In 1954, she left law school after one year to marry Benigno 'Ninoy' Aquino, Jr., a successful young journalist. Soon after they were married, Benigno left journalism for politics. When Ferdinand Marcos came to power in the Philippines in 1965 and declared martial law in 1972, many politicians and activists were arrested by the Marcos regime, including Benigno Aquino. During the seven years that her husband spent in prison, Corazon became an activist, changing from a shy wife raising their five children to her husband's major link to the outside world.








In 1979, Benigno was released from prison and traveled to the United States for medical treatment; in 1980 he settled with his family in Newton, Massachusetts. In 1983, Marcos decided to allow elections the following year and Benigno flew home to the Philippines. Moments after his plane touched down, he was assassinated. Corazon flew home, buried her husband, and began her political career. She worked for anti-Marcos candidates and, in 1985, when many of these politicians won election to the National Assembly, people realized that Corazon was an effective leaderher ability to mobilize people was clear evidence of this ability. People started calling on her to run for president; the movement for her to run for president gained momentum, and she was elected president in 1986.








Aquino believed she should continue her husband's fight for democracy. She called for a new constitution that would set additional limits on presidential power. The military made many attempts to gain control; seven of these attempts led to the deaths of over 150 people. Aquino continued to fight for what she believed would most benefit her country's citizensfreedom and democracy. She initiated military reform, appointed many women to high government positions, and appointed three women to the Philippine Supreme Court. She also focused attention on helping nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and cooperatives organize. She continues to work with NGOs and other organizations since leaving office in 1992.








Aung San Suu Kyi (b. 1945)








Aung San Suu Kyi is known throughout the world for her work in human rights and her fight for democracy in Burma (now referred to as Myanmar by its military leaders). Her father, Bogyoke Aung San, was a legendary Burmese hero. Her education focused on politics, philosophy, and economics at St. Hugh's College, Oxford University. In 1967, she received a B.A. in English






 












Page 78




from Oxford. She became a researcher for the United Nations in 1968 and worked in the New York office.








In 1972, she married Michael Aris, a scholar of Tibetan civilization, and they moved to Bhutan. She worked in the foreign ministry as a researcher on United Nations affairs. In 1973, she and Michael returned to England and she gave birth to their first son, Alexander. Their second son, Kim, was born in 1977. She cared for the children while her husband taught at Oxford University and became increasingly interested in learning more about her father, whom she never really knew because he was assassinated in 1947. Aung San went to Japan as Visiting Scholar at the Centre for Southeast Asian Studies at the University of Kyoto and continued her research on her father while there. She moved again in 1986, to Simla, India, where she joined her husband and became a researcher for the Indian Institute of Advanced Study.








Returning to Burma in 1988, she became involved in pro-democracy demonstrations and decided to enter politics, quickly becoming the symbol of the fight for democracy. The opposition hurriedly moved to silence her by disqualifying her candidacy, claiming that she could not run because she had married a foreigner. The authorities placed her under house arrest in 1989. During this eleven-month period, Aung San traveled throughout the country, urging her people to be courageous and to support democratic reform. Despite her name's absence on the ballot, her party, the National League for Democracy, won in a landslide victory, but the ruling army council refused to honor the election results.








In 1991, she won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in human rights and the European Parliament's Andrei Sakharov Human Rights Prize. The Nobel Prize committee recognized her as ''the leader of a democratic opposition that employs nonviolent means to resist a regime characterized by brutality" (Schlessinger and Schlessinger 1996, 173). She was released from house arrest in 1995 but continues to be harassed by government forces. Many of her supporters are frequently arrested by the current military government. She currently serves as the secretary-general of the National League for Democracy in Burma and continues to fight for human rights and for democracy in her country. In September 1996 the authorities accused her of working with the United States to foment unrest.

Sirimavo Bandaranaike (b. 1916)








As president of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party since 1960 and prime minister of Sri Lanka, Sirimavo Bandaranaike has participated in politics for many years. She was prime minister and minister of defense and external affairs from 1965 through 1970; a member of the Senate until 1965; leader of the opposition party from 1965 through 1970; and prime minister, minister of defense, and minister of foreign affairs, planning, economic affairs and plan implementation from 1970 to 1977. Her husband was prime minister of Ceylon from 1956 through 1959.








She was born into a wealthy family that was actively involved in politics. Sent to a Catholic school in Colombo, she married Solomon Bandaranaike, an Oxford-educated lawyer and politician, after her graduation. He was elected to the House of Representatives, served as minister of health and local government, and became prime minister in 1956. Following much unrest in the country as a result of proposals to replace English with Sinhalese as the national language and to make Buddhism the national religion, he was assassinated in 1959. When the Sri Lanka Freedom Party asked Sirimavo to campaign on their behalf, the party won 75 out of 151 seats in the House of Representatives and, as party leader, she was appointed prime minister. During her second term, Ceylon became the Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and cut off all political ties to Great Britain. She ran for president in 1986 but did not win. In 1989, she won a seat in the National Assembly at the age of 73. In 1994, her daughter, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga (see separate entry), became the new prime minister of the country.








Ela Bhatt (b. 1936)








Ela Bhatt is a well-known politician and women's organization executive in India who is a founding member and chairperson of the executive committee and board of directors of Women's World Banking (see Chapter 5). She is also the founder of the Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA), which is one of the most successful organizations for economic empowerment of self-employed women in India. In 1989, she became the first woman appointed to the Planning Commission in India. Prior to this, Bhatt was a member of the Indian Parliament, a member of the Union Planning Committee, chairwoman of the Global Video Network, a member of the National Committee on Self-Em-






 












Page 80




ployed Women and the advisory committee of the All-India Weavers' Foundation. Mrs. Bhatt's many awards include the Right Livelihood Award and the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership. Her publications include Profiles of Self-Employed Women, published in 1975.








She understands the importance of helping women organize. She sees increasing levels of self-esteem among women who have organized to improve their lives and how these women learn to work together despite their differences (Snyder 1995). SEWA has helped women in many ways. Individual cooperatives have been organized, including groups of artisans' dairy workers, traders, and vendors. A wide variety of support services such as the SEWA Bank, health care, legal aid, housing assistance, child care, and affiliations with international labor groups are provided.








Benazir Bhutto (b. 1953)








Born at Pinto Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, to her father's second wife, Benazir Bhutto was born into politics. Raised as a Sunni Muslim, Benazir's parents were progressive thinkers and allowed her to do more than most girls in Pakistan were allowed to do. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1973 and completed a second B.A. in philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford University. Staying on one more year to study international law and diplomacy, she was elected president of the Oxford Union in 1976, becoming the first Asian woman to serve as president. Following her graduation in 1977, she returned to Pakistan to work in the office of her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the prime minister of Pakistan.








Her father was overthrown in a coup in July 1977 by General Zia and kept under house arrest for several weeks. Later charged with conspiracy to murder at least one of his political opponents, her father was found guilty along with four codefendants and sentenced to death by hanging. He and his codefendants were hanged in 1979. Earlier, in 1978, Benazir's father had encouraged her to travel through the Northwest Frontier Province and the Punjab to encourage support for the Pakistan People's Party. She traveled throughout the country and was arrested, along with her mother, several times while her father was in prison.








Moving to London to escape the wrath of General Zia, Benazir continued to lead the Pakistan People's Party in opposition to Zia and his policies. Over the next several years, Benazir trav-






 












Page 81




eled back to Pakistan and, along with other party members, was arrested, confined to her home, and generally harassed by the Zia government. When General Zia was killed in a plane crash in August 1988, Pakistani president Ishaw Khan asked Benazir to become prime minister and form a new government. She became the first woman to lead a modern Muslim nation as well as the youngest head of state in the world.








She promised to deal with the serious drug problem throughout the country as well as growing ethnic violence, poverty, other social problems, and problems between India and Pakistan. She established women-only police stations in response to widespread rape and torture of women prisoners. Many people note her failure to take on the repressive Hudood Ordinance although she promised to eliminate it during her campaign. This ordinance specifies punishment for adultery, rape, fornication, and prostitution; rape may be considered as adultery or fornication if there are not four male witnesses to testify that the woman was raped. Women are not allowed to testify, and these crimes are punishable by death. She was not able to overturn this ordinance. In elections held in early 1977, Bhutto was turned out of office.








Ester Boserup (b. 1910)








Ester Boserup is a noted Danish rural economist. She received her Ph.D. in economics from the University of Copenhagen. In 1970, she wrote what is now considered a classic text, Women and Economic Development, which caused most experts in the field of economic development to rethink their ideas concerning development, especially the roles that women play in development activities. For this book, Boserup gathered and analyzed data from official statistics and research. She provided clear and concise evidence that women played a crucial role in economic development, although their contributions usually were uncounted when measuring national economic productivity. She was one of the first experts in the field of development to believe that women had not been included in capitalist development activities and programs and that their exclusion widened an already wide gap between women's and men's economic power.








Boserup has been a member of the United Nations Expert Committee of Development Planning, the Scandinavian Institute of Asian Studies, and the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW). In 1972

She married Pedro Chamorro Cardenal in 1950, the publisher of the newspaper, La Prensa, which openly criticized the government of General Somoza. Throughout the 1950s, Pedro was repeatedly arrested and jailed for his opposition to the government. He was banished in 1957 and he and his family escaped to Costa Rica and stayed there for several years. Pedro and the family returned during a period of amnesty in 1960 and he continued his vocal opposition to the regime of Somoza's sons, Luis Somoza Debayle and Anastasio Somoza Debayle. He was assassinated in 1978; most people believed his murder was ordered by the government. His murder ignited the final rebellion against the Somoza regime.








Violeta Chamorro took over the task of publishing La Prensa after her husband's death. She oversaw the attacks against the Somoza regime and endured bomb threats at the newspaper. She contributed money to the Sandinista National Liberation Front that focused on overthrowing the corrupt Somoza regime.

She later became a psychiatrist, and her book, Women and Sex (1972), caused a great deal of controversy because it openly discusses chastity and the taboos that women face in Arab society. She called for radical changes in the position of women within the family and as wage earners. She had been Egypt's director of public health but lost this position following the publication of her radical views; highly placed political and religious authorities called for her dismissal. She has written seven novels and five nonfiction books, including The Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World (1979), which describes her horrifying personal experience with female genital circumcision and examines the price that Arab women pay for being seen as second-class citizens and the property of their husbands. In 1981, she was imprisoned at the notorious Qanatir prison with several other women on the order of President Anwar Sadat because she was publishing a feminist magazine (Confrontation) and stirring up protest among women. She was released in 1982 and started the Pan-Arab Women's Organization.

Page 88




and broadcasting by Lal Shastri, who succeeded her father as prime minister. After Shastri's death in 1966, Gandhi was elected leader of the Congress Party and became prime minister of India.








Her years as prime minister were often stormy. Congress Party members split the party over opposition to her policies and Gandhi called for a general election in 1971. She traveled throughout the country campaigning for public support and won an overwhelming majority of votes. The country experienced economic difficulties in 1974 and she declared an emergency rule, following demonstrations throughout India. She imprisoned political adversaries and censored the press, outraging many Indians because of these actions. Although she released many prisoners from jail and lifted the press censorship before elections were held in 1977, voters removed her from office. By October 1977, she was charged with official corruption and jailed briefly.








In 1978, she ran for office in a rural district in South India after forming her own party, Congress-I Party (Ifor Indira) and was elected to Parliament. During national elections in 1980, she was swept back into power, with her party gaining two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. Many Indians forgave Gandhi for her excesses while in office, believing that she was the best the country had to offer. She became a forceful speaker and advocate for Third World countries, while trouble again mounted at home. During 1983 and 1984, she sent government troops to stop disturbances in the Punjab, and these troops destroyed the large Sikh temple. Two of her Sikh bodyguards assassinated her in New Delhi in June 1984 in retaliation for the destruction of the temple. Her son Rajiv followed in her footsteps and was sworn in as prime minister of India.

Wangari Maathai (b. 1940)








Known around the world for her environmental and human rights activities, Wangari Maathai was born in Nyeri, Kenya, and raised in a farming community. Her parents were subsistence farmers from the Kikuyu tribe. After winning one of the many scholarships awarded to Kenyans by the Kennedy administration, Maathai attended Mount St. Scholastica College in Kansas, where she received a B.A. in biology in 1964. She earned her M.S. from the University of Pittsburgh, the first woman in all of eastern and central Africa to earn an advanced degree. In 1971, she earned a Ph.D. in biology from the University of Nairobi. She later became the first woman to hold an associate professorship at the University of Nairobi and was the first woman invited to chair a department there.








During her husband's campaign for a seat in Parliament, she realized the problems that people in the lower economic class face in finding a job and supporting their families. Following her husband's election, she started an employment agency to help people find work either cleaning the homes of wealthy people or planting trees and shrubs. She believed that planting trees would help stop desertification and soil erosion and support beautification.






 












Page 94




Even though her agency was not successful, she continually was committed to finding ways to involve Kenyans in preserving the environment.








In 1977 Maathai succeeded in persuading the National Council of Women of Kenya to support her cause. First known as the Save the Land Harambee, the group soon became known as the Green Belt Movement (GBM). On World Environment Day in 1977, her group planted seven trees in a small Nairobi park, gained the public's attention, and eventually grew to a large, influential organization. The group has the support of the United Nations, several European governments, and hundreds of individual donors throughout the world. She has written several books about the movement, including The Green Belt Movement (1985) and The Green Belt Movement: Sharing the Approach and the Experience (1988).








During her early involvement in the Green Belt Movement, her husband filed for divorce, in large part, because he had never gotten used to the fact that she held a Ph.D.African women are supposed to be dependent and submissive, not better than their husbands. During the divorce hearing, her husband accused her of adultery, the judges believed him, and she stated that the judges were "either incompetent or corrupt" for believing him. She was found in contempt of court and sentenced to six months in jail but served only three days after making an apology to the judges. She then decided to run for Parliament but was not allowed to run because of a technicality. In the meantime, she had resigned her position in the university in order to run for Parliament and the university refused to allow her to resume her duties.








In 1989, the Kenyan government wanted to construct a large, 62-story building in Nairobi's Uhuru Park that would include hotels, theaters, the newspaper, and a television station. This project, projected to cost $200 million, would have forced the country to take on more debt, not an economically sound idea, according to Maathai. She proposed a public debate on the construction and many people supported her efforts. These supporters, despite harassment, were successful in their efforts to stop the project.








She has continued to play an active role in politics. She is a member of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy, and she established the Tribal Clashes Resettlement Volunteer Service to encourage the government to stop inciting tribal violence. She has won many awards, including the Woman of the Year Award

Rigoberta MenchÃº Tum (b. 1959)








Rigoberta MenchÃº is an internationally known civil rights activist who works for the rights of the Mayan and Aztec people of Guatemala. Born in Chimel, Guatemala, she witnessed the brutality of government forces toward her people, the QuichÃ© Mayan Indians. She has tirelessly traveled throughout the world to bring attention to the plight of Guatemala's indigenous people who have been persecuted by the landowning class and the military. Human rights organizations estimate that the number of indigenous people killed during the 33-year civil war has exceeded 15,000 people. MenchÃº traveled the country with her father, activist Vincente MenchÃº, who was a founding member of the Peasant Unity Committee (CUC), until he was tortured and killed by the Guatemalan security forces. Her mother and younger brother were also tortured and killed. In 1981, she escaped to Mexico.








MenchÃº won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992 for her work in human rights. The Nobel Prize Committee cited MenchÃº as a "vivid symbol of peace and reconciliation across ethnic, cultural, and social dividing lines." The committee noted that "by maintaining a disarming humanity in a brutal world, Rigoberta MenchÃº appeals to the best in us. She stands as a uniquely potent symbol of a just struggle" (Schlessinger and Schlessinger 1996, 174). She is the youngest person and the first indigenous person to win the Nobel Peace Prize. In a book about her life, I, Rigoberta MenchÃº: An Indian Women in Guatemala, she describes many of her civil and human rights activities. She currently lives in Mexico and continues her human rights activities on behalf of native peoples.








With her prize money, she set up the Vincente MenchÃº Foundation, with headquarters in Mexico City and branch offices in Guatemala City and Berkeley, California, in honor of her father. The foundation advocates for human rights and education for indigenous people. It helps Indian street children and the widows of murdered political prisoners.

Fatima Mernissi








Fatima Mernissi is a well-known Moroccan sociologist and feminist and the author of several publications; she is best known for her classic Beyond the Veil: Male-Female Dynamic in Modern Muslim Society (1975, 1987, revised edition).

She has reinterpreted classical Islamic texts from a feminist perspective and supervised publication of a series of books on the legal status of women in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. In 1992, she wrote Islam and Democracy: Fear of the Modern World in which she argues that the Islamic faith has been used and compromised by Arab leaders to control their countries and prevent democratic reforms. These rulers have distorted Islamic beliefs to fit their needs and have abused human rights by suppressing democratic reforms. In 1994, she wrote Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood (published in England as The Harem Within: Tales of a Moroccan Girlhood), which recounts her childhood growing up in a harem. Life was repressive and boring, and she and the other women and girls in the harem were restricted in what they could do and where they could go. Her latest publication is Dreams of Trespass (1994), a collection of interviews she conducted during the mid-1970s. This collection provides incredible insight into the lives of Moroccan women. Mernissi is currently a professor of sociology at Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco.

Page 102




Union. She and Saiza Nabarawi started the open feminist movement in Egypt by taking off their veils at the Cairo train station as they returned from an international feminist conference. Shaarawi and the union advocated for women's rights and the integration of urban women into public life. They wanted changes in the personal status laws, equal access to secondary and university education, expanded professional opportunities in business, and support systems for working mothers to provide child care; they advocated for the end to legalized prostitution. Union members lobbied the government for these and other changes.








She also founded Egyptian Women, a journal published in both Arabic and French that described the goals of the Women's Union to its readers. In 1935 and 1939, Shaarawi attended the international women's conferences. In 1944 she helped organize the All Arab Federation of Women.

She has been a member of various Finnish government committees on matrimonial legislation, protection of children, social benefits for children, citizenship education, and international development. She has been a member of the Council of the Human Rights Institute in Strasbourg, France, since 1969.








As an attorney, she founded and operated her own law office in Finland from 1943 to 1972; at the same time she was actively involved in United Nations activities. SipilÃ¤ retired from her post of assistant secretary general of the UN's Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs (CSDHA) in 1980. She played a major role in planning the 1975 International Women's Year (IWY) Conference in Mexico City. CSDHA administered the IWY Trust Fund and its Branch for the Advancement of Women acted as the secretariat for the Commission on the Status of Women. Before taking the post at CSDHA, SipilÃ¤ served as international president of Zonta International, a professional women's organization.








During International Women's Year, she appealed to governments to set aside prejudices of race, sex, language, or religion in order to confront problems affecting everyone. She traveled






 












Page 103




extensively to government capitals around the world to build understanding and interest in International Women's Year. In 1981, she founded the Finnish National Committee on UNIFEM, which consisted of 400 individual and 30 organizational members.








Margaret Snyder (b. 1929)








Margaret Snyder has been involved in women's development activities for many years and is the founding director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Dar es Salaam and was honored at Makerere University in 1993 for her valuable contributions to the advancement of women in agriculture and education. She has recently been a Visiting Fellow in International Studies at Princeton University.








Snyder has long been involved in development policies and women's issues in Africa. As a regional adviser for the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, she initiated their Women's Programme, led the Voluntary Agencies Bureau, and cofounded the African Training and Research Centre for Women. She is also a cofounder of Women's World Banking, an organization that provides loans and other business services to women through a network of affiliate organizations (see Chapter 5). Her publications include Farmers and Merchants: Some Observations on Women and the State in Africa; Politics, Poverty and Participation: A History of Women's Leadership in Development; and Women: The Key to Ending Hunger.

Page 104




Trustees of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), the Federation of African Women Entrepreneurs, and the Africa Regional Coordinating Committee for the Integration of Women in Development. She has participated in many academic and governmental conferences. With Margaret Snyder, Tadesse wrote African Women and Development: A History in 1995.








Mother Teresa (b. 1910)








Born Agnes Gonxha Bejaxhia in Skopje, Macedonia, Mother Teresa entered the Roman Catholic order of the Sisters of Our Lady of Loretta in Ireland at the age of 18 years. After training in Ireland and India, she took her vows. As Sister Teresa, she joined the Loretta nuns in Calcutta in 1929 and taught high school for 20 years. Moved by the incredible suffering she saw on the streets of Calcutta, she received what she saw as a sign from God telling her to leave the Sisters of Loretta and devote her life to working and living with the poor people living on the streets.








The pope allowed her to leave the convent, and in 1948 Mother Teresa started her lifelong ministry among the poor. She and those working with her became the new order of the Missionaries of Charity in 1950. Other women who joined Mother Teresa took four vowsof poverty, chastity, obedience, and service to the poor. Mother Teresa believes that by serving the poor she and her sisters are serving Christ. Since founding her order, the work has spread to 50 Indian cities and more than 25 countries. In 1952, Mother Teresa founded the Nirmal Hriday (Pure Heart) Home for Dying Destitutes in Calcutta. She has written a book about her life, Gift from God, published in 1975.








She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work in helping the poor. In choosing her, the Nobel Prize Committee said that ''this year, the world has turned its attention to the plight of children and refugees, and these are precisely the categories for whom Mother Teresa has for many years worked so selflessly (Schlessinger and Schlessinger 1996, 174). In 1985 she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from the United States.








While many people marvel at the work she has done and her dedication to her cause, some critics do not understand her firm opposition to abortion and to all types of artificial birth control. Many feminists have been alienated by her views of the role of women, especially in India. She has urged women to build stable






 












Page 105




and strong families and to allow "men to do what they are better suited to do" (Wasson 1987, 1048).








Begum Khaleda Zia (b. 1945)








Begum Khaleda Zia is the prime minister of Bangladesh. She also serves as the minister for establishment, information, and mineral resources and is leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. She attended primary and secondary school and then married Zia-ur Rahman when she was 16 years old. He was a captain in the Pakistani army at the time of their marriage. He would later serve as the country's president from 1977 until 1981 when he was assassinated while in office. H. M. Ershad came to power, martial law was declared, and political parties were abolished. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party continued to exist, and Khaleda Zia led her party as chairwoman in 1984. Khaleda Zia was at the center of the fight to end martial law and restore free elections, participating in strikes, street protests, and mass demonstrations. During this time, she was placed under house arrest several times. Ershad resigned his position in 1990, elections were held in 1991, and Khaleda Zia became prime minister. She has focused her attention on population control, mass literacy, compulsory primary education, fighting poverty, and extending electricity to rural areas.








She has been criticized by many women for her silence on women's issues, especially the conditions of women working in the garment industry. Over two million women work in appalling conditions in sweatshops. She has also been criticized for her unwillingness to fight the growing Islamic fundamentalist movement in her country. Also, her country has not ratified the United Nations Conventions that guarantee equal political, marriage, and pay rights to women.

4 Facts and Statistics








This chapter presents basic facts and statistics of interest concerning women and their lives and status in the Third Worldstatistics describing major aspects of women's lives such as education, family, health, violence toward women, work, politics, migration, and female refugees. The chapter includes excerpts from major international agreements and United Nations documents that protect or extend certain rights to women and young girls.








The Status of Women in the Third World








The lives and status of women are improving in many areas of the world. However, in many areas and in many individual situations, women are still discriminated against and refused basic human rights and still find their lives difficult and often dangerous. Women throughout the world, not just in Third World countries, find themselves denied an education, denied a job, and discriminated against in a number of ways. In Third World countries, as in many other countries, women in upper socioeconomic classes are better off than women in lower






 












Page 108




classes. Statistics provide a general indication of what women in developing countries face in their daily lives, although the reader must keep in mind that these statistics do not describe all women in all situations. Also, the range of opportunities open to women must be examined within each individual country. For example, in some western Asian countries, while higher education for women is the norm, few women in these countries participate in politics or in the labor force (except for unpaid family labor). With these caveats in mind, this section offers statistics to provide a better picture of what life is like for women in developing countries.








Education








The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines a person as literate if he or she can read and write a short description of his or her daily life and understand this description. According to this definition, many people in developing countries are illiterate, in contrast with developed nations, where literacy rates are over 90 percent for both men and women. Further, in all developing countries, as in most developed countries, literacy rates for men are higher than for women.








Over the past few decades, basic literacy rates for women, as well as for men, have increased in many parts of the world. Many countries have passed legislation that requires equal access to education for both boys and girls, schools are being built in many rural areas, and traditional attitudes that girls should not be educated are slowly changing. In the developing world, most countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, and in eastern and southeastern Asia have increasing literacy rates for women. However, some countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East have seen declines in literacy rates.








In 1990, literacy rates for women between the ages of 15 and 24 in Third World countries ranged from a low of 7 percent in Burkina Faso to a high of over 98 percent in Chile, Uruguay, Brunei, and Thailand. For women over the age of 25, literacy rates ranged from less than 10 percent in Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Nepal, Yemen, and Papua New Guinea to over 90 percent in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and the Philippines (United Nations 1995).








Literacy rates for men are at least 25 percent higher than for women in many countries, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. These countries include Benin, Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau,






 












Page 109




Mozambique, Togo, Tanzania, and Morocco, as well as India, Nepal, Syria, and Yemen (United Nations 1995). In many developing countries, women are not expected to receive an education, and many people do not believe that girls should be educated. Countries in which the literacy rate is 25 percent or less for women include Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nepal, Pakistan, and Yemen (United Nations 1995).








Literacy rates for older women and women living in rural areas are generally lower than for women living in urban areas, because widespread education for girls has only recently been encouraged in most developing countries and is found more often in cities than in rural areas. For example, in 1990 in Honduras, the literacy rate for women was over 90 percent in urban areas and 70 percent in rural areas; in Mali, the rate is over 40 percent in urban areas and only 10 percent in rural areas; and in Iraq the rate is over 90 percent in urban areas and in rural areas closer to 65 percent (United Nations 1995).








Sex ratios of girls to boys in secondary school enrollment vary from region to region and country to country. In eastern and southeastern Asia secondary school enrollments are almost identical for girls and boys. In western Asia and northern Africa slightly more boys than girls are enrolled in secondary schools. However, boys greatly outnumber girls in secondary schools in sub-Saharan Africa (68 girls per 100 boys) and southern Asia (60 girls per 100 boys). A positive sign is that in the past 20 years girls have been gaining ground in most developing countries. For example, in 1970 in southeastern Asia the ratio was approximately 65 girls per 100 boys; by 1990 the ratio was approximately 92 girls for every 100 boys (United Nations 1995).








Many researchers have found a strong relationship between education and fertility rates; higher literacy rates among women are strongly related to lower fertility rates (Jejeebhoy 1995). Literacy rates for women were under 50 percent in Africa and southern Asia in 1990 and fertility rates were over five births per woman. Women in Latin America and southeastern Asia have literacy rates over 80 percent with overall fertility rates of less than four births per women.








In higher education, women outnumber men in the social science and health fields but are outnumbered by men in science, engineering, and law. This applies to women in developing countries as well as women in the more developed regions. For example, in 1990 in Latin America the ratio was 254 women per 100






 












Page 110




men in liberal arts, and only 74 women per 100 men in science and engineering and 80 per 100 men in law. In eastern and southeastern Asia in 1990 there were 164 women per 100 men in liberal arts, 274 women per 100 men in medical and health fields, but only 73 women per 100 men in science and engineering (United Nations 1995).








Population and Family








Although there are more men in the world than women, the ratio of elderly women to elderly men is increasing, as is the proportion of elderly women in the general population. Women live longer than men in almost every country.








In general, if no deliberate measures are taken to reduce the number of births, especially female births, the sex ratio is biologically stable. There are between 93 and 96 female births for every 100 male births. In some countries in Asia, the sex ratio varies from this norm; in India in 1988/1989 there were 91 girls born per 100 boys; in the Republic of Korea there were 88 girls born per 100 boys; and in Pakistan 92 girls were born per 100 boys (United Nations 1992b). In Pakistan, the ratio in 1982 was 98 girls per 100 boys and 92 per 100 boys in 1988/1989; for some reason the ratio is dropping. Boys may outnumber girls for several reasons: from parents who see no need to report the birth of a daughter, since girls aren't important in many societies, to the more serious desire for sons, which may lead to female infanticide or the use of new technology to determine the sex of the fetus with resulting sex selective abortion if the fetus is female.








Household size decreased significantly between 1970 and 1990 in many developed regions, in Latin America, and in eastern and southeastern Asia. The average household size dropped to 3.7 in eastern Asia, 4.9 in southeastern Asia, and 4.7 in Latin America. Other areas have seen increases in household sizefrom 5.4 to 5.7 in northern Africa. Higher household size indicates higher fertility rates and/or the prevalence of extended families living together (United Nations 1992d).








Throughout the world, women marry at an earlier age than men, but the age at which both women and men marry varies among regions. Between 10 and 12 percent of women between the ages of 15 and 19 are married in northern Africa, South America, central and southeastern Asia; this compares with between 1 and 3 percent of men the same ages. Between 16 and 17 percent of women between the ages of 15 and 19 are married in western






 












Page 111




Asia and Central America; 29 percent of this group is married in sub-Saharan Africa; and in southern Asia 41 percent of women between 15 and 19 are married. The highest rate for men in the same age group is 9 percent in southern Asia. Individual countries and smaller regions may have higher rates; for example, over 50 percent of women between the ages of 15 and 19 are married in west Africa (United Nations 1995).








Differences also exist between urban and rural areas. Rural women generally marry at a younger age than urban women. The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), a project sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development, has conducted national sample surveys on fertility, family planning, and maternal and child health. Results from these studies indicate that women in rural areas consistently marry at a younger age than women in urban areas (United Nations 1985). For example, the researchers found that 25 percent more women in rural areas were married at a younger age than urban women in sub-Saharan Africa, 34 percent more in Latin America, 42 percent more in northern Africa, and 45 percent more in Asia (United Nations 1995).








A relationship also appears to exist between lack of education and early age at marriage for women. The DHS study found that in over 67 percent of the countries studied, women with no education were twice as likely to marry before the age of 20 as those with a primary school education. The study found that statistics for women in Egypt were the most extreme: 77 percent of women with no education were married by the age of 20, while only 13 percent of those women with at least a primary school education were married by the age of 20 (United Nations 1992a).








In many countries women find themselves living at some point in their lives without a partner and father for their children. Many reasons for this pattern existpolygynous unions in which the husband has more than one wife and spends times with each wife; visiting unions in which the male partner visits from time to time; or male partners who may need to migrate to other areas within the country or to other countries in order to obtain work.








The majority of women in most countries become mothers at some point in their lives. In some regions, many women start giving birth to children while they are still teenagers themselves, while in other regions the majority of women give birth to children when they are 21 years or older. Generally, women start having children when they are still teenagers most often in countries






 












Page 112




in which women are seen primarily as wives and bearers of children. Traditions in these countries support the idea that a woman's only role is as a wife and mother and that women do not generally need to receive an education or enter the job market. Women tend to marry at a later age and also tend to have smaller families in countries in which women are seen as more than wives and mothers, in which they receive an education, and in which they are encouraged to enter (or at least not discouraged from entering) the job market.








In developed countries, the use of contraceptives was fairly widespread by 1980 and did not grow significantly over the following ten years. However, in developing countries, the use of contraceptives was not widespread by 1980. Following the growth of organizations encouraging the use of contraception, growing numbers of women in developing countries began to use contraceptive devices. For example, in eastern Asia 79 percent of the population used some type of contraceptive by 1990, 58 percent in Latin America, 42 percent in the rest of Asia, but only 18 percent in Africa. This compares with 72 percent in developed areas of the world (United Nations 1994b).








Sterilization is the most widely used method of contraception for women in developing countries. One-third of the women and one-tenth of the men in Asia choose this method, while 21 percent of the women and only 1 percent of the men in Latin America choose sterilization. The intrauterine device (IUD) is the most popular method in eastern Asia and is used by 31 percent of women (United Nations 1995). Statistics on the prevalence of abortion as a method of birth control are difficult to find, primarily because abortion is illegal in many countries.








Over the past 25 years, the number of births per woman has declined throughout most of the world. In the developed countries, it currently averages 1.9 births per woman. Women in eastern Asia also have a low number of births per women2.3 births; women in countries in sub-Saharan Africa average 6.1 births per woman, although the rate is lower in Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mauritius, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe (United Nations 1995). The current number of births per woman in Latin America is 3.2, in eastern Asian countries, 2.3, and in southern Asia, 5.3 (United Nations 1995).








Fertility rates are lower among women living in urban areas and among educated women. Women living in urban areas are more likely to have access to information concerning contraceptives, have contraceptives available to them, and not have a need






 












Page 113




for more children to help work on the farm and in the home. Women living in cities also have more opportunities to find work and thus to postpone having children.








Adolescent fertility has also declined recently in many countries. Countries in northern Africa have seen a small decline, as have countries in Latin America and eastern and western Asia, and rates have generally fallen in southeastern and southern Asia, although rates for adolescents in India and Pakistan have increased (United Nations 1995).








Health








Women generally have a longer life expectancy then menin the developed nations often six to eight years longer. In the Third World, the differences are not as great. For example, women can be expected to outlive men by only three years in Africa and four to five years in the rest of the developing countries, except for southern Asia, where the life expectancy for women and men is about the same (about 58 years). However, in Bangladesh and Nepal men outlive women by one year (United Nations 1992e).








In most countries life expectancy is increasing, although it has dropped significantly for both men and women in two sub-Saharan countries because of AIDS. In Uganda life expectancy has dropped for women from 48 to 43 years and for men from 46 to 43 years. According to a report from the Population Division of the United Nations Secretariat, these two countries will continue to see decreases in life expectancy. Other sub-Saharan countries will also begin to see either a decrease or no increase in life expectancy; these countries include the Central African Republic, the Congo, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zaire, and Zimbabwe (United Nations 1994a).








In many developing countries, statistics on infant and child mortality are scarce and unreliable. In countries in which there is a strong preference for sons over daughters, reliable data may not be available. In developed nations, the ratio of female to male infant deaths is 0.8, or 8 female deaths for every 10 male deaths. Where statistics are available in developing countries, girls enjoy a similar advantage. However, one study on child mortality in developing countries reports that 17 out of 38 developing countries showed higher rates of infant mortality for girls than for boys. Highest rates were for Egypt, with a ratio of 1.4, or 14 female deaths for every 10 male deaths, and Pakistan, with a ratio of 1.6 (United Nations 1995).






 












Page 114




For adolescent girls, the greatest risks to reproductive health include sexually transmitted diseases, early motherhood, unwanted pregnancy, and unsafe abortion. Many girls, especially in developing countries, do not have access to information related to reproductive health and do not have access to health services. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adolescent girls have a 20 to 200 percent higher risk of dying from pregnancy-related causes than older women. The younger the girl is when she becomes pregnant, the higher the risk of complications or maternal death (World Health Organization 1989).








Abortion, especially unsafe abortion, also has higher risks for adolescent girls. Studies have been conducted in the Congo, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, and Zaire that examine hospital records of women seeking treatment as a result of complications for abortion. These studies have found that between 38 and 68 percent of all women seeking care for these complications were under the age of 20 years (United Nations 1995).








Adolescent girls in several developing countries are also at risk for developing complications from female genital circumcision (or female genital mutilation, as many people refer to this procedure). In a survey of 300 women living around Mogadishu, Somalia, researchers found that almost all women undergo the severest form of circumcision, infibulation. The researchers found that approximately 40 percent of the women experience severe and significant immediate complications from this procedure and another 40 percent experience long-term complications (United Nations 1995).








According to the WHO, more than 16 million adults and 1 million children have been infected with HIV. Women represented 40 percent of the estimated cases of HIV infection in 1994. By the year 2000, the number of women infected with HIV will equal the number of men, according to WHO estimates. Between 10 and 15 million new infections are expected by 2000, primarily in developing countries (World Health Organization 1994). Women, especially in developing countries, are becoming infected in greater numbers than men. Over one-half of people infected in Africa are believed to be women, while between one-third and one-fourth of those infected in Asia are expected to be women. Female sex workers are at particularly high risk of infection, especially in parts of India, urban areas of Burma, and in Thailand. By the year 2000, over 8 million people in Asia may be infected with HIV (United Nations 1995).








In recent years, heterosexual activity has increasingly caused the spread of HIV. Women are becoming infected in growing numbers. Young women are most susceptible. According to a






 












Page 115




United Nations Development Program review of studies concerning HIV in two Asian and three African countries, young women between the ages of 15 and 25 account for 70 percent of the women who contract and later die from HIV. Women between the ages of 15 and 25 are twice as likely as men to contract HIV. Approximately 25 percent of young women who become pregnant in Rwanda before they reach the age of 17 years will contract HIV (Reid and Bailey 1993).








Pregnancy and childbirth increase risks to women's health. Each year over 150 million women become pregnant. Prenatal care is critical to protecting the health of both mother and child. Availability of prenatal care varies widely throughout the world, including Third World countries. For example, prenatal care is widely available in southern Africa, eastern Asia, and Latin America, with 70 percent or more of women covered. Prenatal care is available to 54 percent of the women in western Asia. However, in other areas of the world coverage is available to less than half the women who become pregnant. Only 49 percent of the women in northern Africa and 35 percent of the women in southern Asia and in southern Asia have access to prenatal care (World Health Organization 1993).








Women who have access to trained medical personnel while they are pregnant and while giving birth have a higher survival rate than women who do not. More women die during pregnancy and during childbirth in regions of the world that have few trained maternity care personnel than in areas where trained medical personnel are available. In developed regions most women (99 percent) give birth attended by some type of trained medical person. Women in developing countries are much less likely to give birth with any trained medical staff in attendance; only 55 percent of births in developing countries occur with a trained attendant, and only 37 percent take place in hospitals or clinics. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 40 percent of births occur with a trained attendant and only 31 percent do in Southern Asia. Women in Latin America are more likely to have a trained attendant while giving birth; in Central America, 74 percent, and in South America 76 percent of births occur with a trained attendant (World Health Organization 1993).








Maternal mortality rates also vary from one area of the world to another. In developed regions, in 1988, there were 26 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. In developing regions, the rate varied from 120 per 100,000 live births in eastern Asia to almost 700 deaths per 100,000 live births in sub-Saharan Africa (World Health Organization 1991).






 












Page 116




According to the WHO, 20 million unsafe abortions are performed throughout the world each year and over 70,000 women die each year as a result of these unsafe procedures. Women in South America have the highest incidence of unsafe abortionapproximately 41 per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 49 undergo unsafe abortions. For women in eastern and western Africa, the rate is also high, with 30 unsafe abortions per 1,000 women. Asia has the lowest rate among developing regions, with 12 unsafe abortions per 1,000 women (United Nations 1995).








Violence toward Women








The most common form of violence against women is domestic violence, in which either a husband or intimate partner abuses a woman. According to studies conducted in 10 countries, between 17 and 38 percent of women have been physically assaulted by an intimate partner (United Nations 1995). Most studies concerning domestic violence in developing countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia have reported rates of up to 60 percent or more of women being assaulted by an intimate partner. Other studies report that women can also be the aggressorsbut these attacks are usually less frequent and less serious (United Nations 1989).








Rape and sexual assault are more difficult to measure, especially in developing countries, although experts believe that sexual assaults occur in greater numbers than statistics would suggest. Studies concerning rates of sexual assault in select urban areas in 14 developing countries found rates of 10 percent or more over five years in six countries. Highest rates reported were 22 percent in Kampala, Uganda; 17 percent in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; 15 percent in Buenos Aires, Argentina; 14 percent each in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea; and 10 percent in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Del Frate, Zvekic, and van Dijk 1993). In a study of 133 postgraduate, middle- and upper-class students in India, researchers found that 26 percent reported that they had been sexually abused by the time they were 12 years old. Researchers in Kingston, Jamaica, found that among 450 schoolgirls between the ages of 13 and 14, 13 percent had experienced an attempted rape; half of these occurred before the girls reached the age of 12 years (United Nations 1995).








In 1949 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others. But despite the






 












Page 117




convention's efforts, this practice continues in many areas throughout the world. An estimated two million women are involved in prostitution in India; one-fifth of them are under 18 years of age, according to the Commission on Human Rights Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery (United Nations 1995). The commission also believes that between 5,000 and 7,000 young girls come from Nepal and are sold into brothels each year. According to Asia Watch and the Women's Rights Group, at least 20,000 women and young girls work in brothels in Thailand (Human Rights Watch 1993). In a report to the International Organization for Migration, the government of the Philippines (1994) estimates that the number of Filipina women, often between the ages of 16 and 23 years of age, migrate to other countries as entertainers. The authors of the report believe that most of these women have been tricked into working as prostitutes or in some other sex-related business.








As the demand for cheap domestic labor grows throughout the world, women will continue to migrate from poorer to richer countries in search of work. According to the Asia and Pacific Development Centre, between 1 and 1.7 million foreign women are currently estimated to be working as domestic workers in Asian countries. Often these women are illegal, undocumented immigrants lured to foreign countries with the promise of work as domestic servants or in the entertainment field. Many of these women end up being forced into prostitution. Others are abused in other ways. Employers may take away their passports, withhold their salaries with the claim that the women owe them money, or physically or sexually abuse them.








The plight of Asian women working as maids and cooks in Kuwait has received attention recently. According to a report by Middle East Watch (1992), these women endure abuse, confinement, and debt bondage. For a period of 12 months, beginning in May 1991, the report estimates that 1,400 Filipina domestic servants as well as hundreds of maids from India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka sought safety in their countries' embassies in Kuwait. The report claims that other women were arrested by police while attempting to run away from their employers; in many cases these women were returned to their employers by the police. Investigation by Human Rights Watch/Middle East (formerly Middle East Watch) in 1993 and 1994, as well as later updates, determined that while most domestic workers in Kuwait are not abused by their employers, a significant number are abused in some way, including rape, physical assault, mistreatment, debt






 












Page 118




bondage, and illegal confinement. Kuwaiti labor law excludes domestic workers from the law's protection, so these women have little recourse, except to escape from their employers and find some way to return home (Human Rights Watch 1995).








Another form of violence against women is the rape of women during war. Estimating the numbers of women raped during war is difficult. For example, the number of women raped in the former Yugoslavia has never been known or accurately measured. According to an investigation conducted by the European Community (n.d.), 20,000 women were raped. According to the United Nations Commission of Experts (United Nations 1992c), 800 victims were identified. A team of physicians estimated that 11,900 rapes occurred, based on the number of pregnancies as a result of rape and on a formula predicting the chances of becoming pregnant (Swiss and Giller 1993).








Work and Economic Activity








Women work in both paid and unpaid work. Most women, especially in Third World countries, work at home, taking care of the household and the children. In addition to these duties, women may be involved in other labor. In poor agricultural regions, women are the primary growers and preparers of food, gatherers of fuel for cooking, and collectors of water, among other tasks. With all this work, women are still responsible for caring for the family. In other regions, women may find paid employment, either working for someone else or working at home in some entrepreneurial activity. In most of these cases, they are still responsible for household and family care.








Research has shown that when women have access to and engage in paid work activities, they gain a measure of self-reliance and self-esteem. They also contribute to the economic well-being of their families. Unfortunately, when women work in unpaid labor activities, their contribution to society is largely uncountedhardly even acknowledged. Most countries gather statistics on those economic activities that add value to the society, usually without considering that care of the family and the home contributes economically to society.








In studies of housework and other activities in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, researchers found that women and girls spend between 3 to 5 more hours per week than men in unpaid subsistence activities, including gathering fuel, carrying water, and growing and processing agricultural products for their families'






 












Page 119




use. These 3 to 5 hours are in addition to the 20 to 30 hours more per week that women spend in unpaid housework activities. Studies found that women spend between 31 and 42 hours each week in maintaining the household, while men spend only between 5 and 15 hours (United Nations 1995).








Many women throughout the world find that they must find paid employment in order to help support their families. In the developing world, only 30 percent of the women in western Asia engage in paid economic activity; women in countries in central Asia had the highest participation rate of paid activity (58 percent).








For women, participation in paid economic activity is higher in rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa and most of Asia than in urban areas. In rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, 50 percent of the women participate in economic activity, compared with 35 percent in urban areas. In southern Asia 27 percent of the women participate in economic activity and in western Asia 15 percent participate. Women in Latin America find better opportunities in the cities than in rural areas, with 34 percent working in urban areas and 21 percent in rural areas. In northern Africa, 19 percent of the women work in urban areas while 12 percent find work in rural areas (United Nations 1995).








When examined by industry type, more men work in industry than women, although women are well represented in agriculture and services. However, the majority of women participating in economic activity in Latin America work in the service sector (75 percent), while the majority of working women (75 percent) in sub-Saharan Africa work in the agricultural sector. In Asia, women are represented throughout the agriculture and services sectors, with the fewest in industry. For example, in southern Asia 55 percent of the working women are involved in agricultural activities; 20 percent are in the service sector. In western Asia 23 percent are in agriculture, only 14 percent in industry, and 61 percent in services (United Nations 1995).








When jobs in formal wage employment are difficult to find, people look to the informal sector to find work. In most African countries, more than one-third of women who are economically active outside of agriculture work in the informal sector, ranging as high as 62 percent in Gambia and 72 percent in Zambia. In Asian countries, women's participation in the informal sector varies widely from country to country. Economically active women in western Asian countries participate at the rate of 10 percent while 65 percent of the women in Indonesia participate.






 












Page 120




Women in Latin America participate less actively in the informal sector, with less than one-third of all economically active women participating (United Nations 1995).








In all countries in the developing world, but also those in developed regions, women earn less than men for doing the same job. For example, in 1990, in the area of manufacturing in the countries studied, women earned only 50 percent of what men earned in the Republic of Korea, 54 percent of what men earned in Swaziland, up to 88 percent in Sri Lanka, 94 percent in El Salvador, and 97 percent in Burma. In many cases, women in developed nations do not fare much better. For example, in Japan women earned only 41 percent of what men earned, 68 percent in the United Kingdom, 77 percent in New Zealand, and 89 percent in Norway (United Nations 1992e). These differences exist despite the fact that many countries have enacted equal pay laws. Many countries have also endorsed several United Nations Covenants that deal, at least in part, with equal pay for equal work, such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention Concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.








Along with the right to work and the right to equal pay, many women also are concerned with maternity benefits. These benefits are provided for women in many countrieswomen are allowed a certain amount of time off work before and after they give birth and a certain percentage of their pay while on leave. Most countries in Africa, except Swaziland, provide maternity leave, ranging from 30 days in Tunisia to 15 weeks in the Congo. Women in these countries receive between 50 and 100 percent of their current salary. In Latin America maternity leave ranges from ten weeks in Honduras to four months in Costa Rica, with pay usually at 100 percent of the salary. Women in Asia generally receive between 25 and 100 percent of their salary and receive 10 weeks of maternity leave (United Nations 1995).








However, for many women, the place of work does not provide maternity benefits, primarily because they work at unpaid labor in the home, in agriculture, or in the informal sector. In many countries, women have little access to child care, so when they give birth, they may have trouble going back to work because there is no one to care for their children. Many women are forced to quit working to care for their children unless an older child stays home to care for the infant, other family members live






 












Page 121




in the home or nearby and can provide child care, or extended family members are available.








Power and Politics








One measure of the power that women have (or do not have) is the number of women who hold positions of power in their own governments. Few women have held ministerial or senior level positions; only 24 women have been elected as heads of state or government, and half of these have been elected since 1990. By 1994, ten women were leading their governments. Women serving as presidents include
 Vigdis Finnbogadottir in Iceland
 Mary Robinson in Ireland
 Violeta Chamorro in Nicaragua
 Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in Sri Lanka








Women prime ministers include
 Khaleda Zia in Bangladesh
 Eugenia Charles in Dominica
 Gro Harlem Brundtland in Norway
 Sirimovo Bandaranaike in Sri Lanka
 Tansu Ciller in Turkey
 Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan








Other women presidents have included
 Isabel Martinez de PerÃ³n in Argentina (19741976)
 Lidia Gueiler Tejada in Bolivia (19791980)
 Ertha Pascal-Trouillot in Haiti (1991)
 Corazon Aquino in the Philippines (19861992)
 Milka Planinc in Yugoslavia (19821986)








Other women prime ministers have included
 Sylvia Kinigi of Burundi (1993)
 Kim Campbell of Canada (1993)
 Edith Cresson of France (19911992)
 Indira Gandhi of India (19661977)
 Golda Meir of Israel (19691974)
 Hanna Suchocka of Poland (19921993)
 Maria de Lourdes Pintasilga of Portugal (19811985)
 Agathe Uwilingiyimana of Rwanda (19931994)
 Margaret Thatcher of the United Kingdom (19791990) (United Nations 1995)






 












Page 122




Over half of the countries that these women have led or are leading are developing nations. (See Chapter 3 for short biographies of many of these women.)








Women have made some progress in reaching top government positions. For example, between 1987 and 1994, the number of countries in which women held no top positions dropped from 93 to 59. Only 3.3 percent of the world's cabinet-level ministers were women in 1987, but this number grew to 5.7 percent in 1994. At the subcabinet level, the number of countries in which women served here grew from 15 countries in 1987 to 23 in 1995. As one United Nations document noted, ''Women's higher representation at ministerial and subministerial levels is usually tenuous, however. Most countries with women in top ministerial positions do not have comparable representation at the subministerial level" (United Nations 1995, 151).








Countries in the Third World in which more than 15 percent of ministers or subministers are women in 1994 include Bhutan, the Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho, Niger, SÃ£o TomÃ© and Principe, Seychelles, Zimbabwe, Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.








Areas of government throughout the world in which women are most often found are the ministries of social welfare and law and justice. In developing nations, the highest percentage of women in social ministries occurs in sub-Saharan Africa (13 percent), South America (12 percent), eastern Asia (4 percent), southeastern Asia (5 percent), central Asia (9 percent), and western Asia (4 percent). The field of law and justice is the field with the highest percentage of women in northern Africa (17 percent). In Central America, women are split evenly between the social and the law and justice fields (15 percent each) (United Nations 1995).








Even though the Charter of the United Nations expressly refers to equal rights of women and men by saying that the "United Nations shall place no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs," few women have participated at this level. Only 2 of the 49 people elected to preside over the General Assembly have been women: Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit of India in 1953 and Angie Brooks of Liberia in 1969. At the fourth session in 1949, only 4 percent of the delegates to the General Assembly were women. By 1994, that number had increased to 20 percent. Regions with the highest participation were from the Caribbean (29 percent) and Latin






 












Page 123




America and the developed regions (2224 percent). The delegations with the fewest numbers of women were from eastern Europe (5 percent) and southern and eastern Asia and Oceania (89 percent) (United Nations 1995).








Migration








Urban areas in many countries are rapidly expanding, with more and more people moving to the cities to find work and improve their lives. When women move away from their traditional rural communities to cities, they usually gain greater freedom to participate in many activities, including educational activities and work. These opportunities frequently alter gender and family relations. In many cases, however, women are more restricted than men in their ability to move from one area to another. In Latin America more women than men live in urban areas, but in Africa and Asia, because women are more restricted in their movements, men outnumber women in urban areas (United Nations 1995).








Statistics are difficult to find concerning women who migrate from one country to another country. Because many men migrate to other countries in search of work, the women who travel with them are counted only as dependents. The United Nations conducted a study on the international migration of women and found that "so pervasive is the idea that most international migrants are men that the sex of migrants is often unrecorded or, if recorded, the information is not used to prepare tabulations for publication" (United Nations 1996, 1).








Many women who migrate to another country find work in their new country. Residents in some countries actively seek foreign women to work as maids, housekeepers, and nannies for their children. In some cases, these women are taken advantage of by their employersthey are paid less than minimum or fair wages, they may be threatened with being sent home if they don't comply with their employer's wishes, or employers may ask or demand sexual favors of them.








Women as Refugees








The experiences of refugee women are of particular concern to many persons working in this field. Women are particularly vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse, including rape. According






 












Page 124




to statistics gathered in 1993, men outnumber women among refugees in most areas of the world, except in Africa where women outnumber men (102 women per 100 men). For all refugees, there are 91 women per 100 men. Regionally, there are 89 women per 100 men in Latin America and 75 per 100 in Asia and the Pacific (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 1994). Some sources estimate the total number of refugees throughout the world at 20 million (Martin 1991).








International Agreements








The Charter of the United Nations and the International Bill of Rights are two documents that provide a forceful statement on women's rights in the international arena. The International Bill of Rights includes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The UN Charter is the first international document to specifically mention equal rights of women (and men). Relevant passages of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are provided below.








Several other international agreements are also excerpted in this section. The Convention Concerning Maternity Protection extends protection to agricultural and nonindustrial workers and to those women earning wages while working at home. The Convention Concerning the Employment of Women on Underground Work in Mines of All Kinds protects women from being forced to work in positions requiring them to work underground. The Convention Concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value obligates those countries ratifying it to work to eliminate wage discrimination based on sex. The Convention Concerning Night Work of Women Employed in Industry sets standards by which women can work at night. The Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention works to eliminate all discrimination in employment. The Convention against Discrimination in Education prohibits educational discrimination, including all phases and aspects of education.








Concerning women and marriage, the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage, and Registration






 












Page 125




of Marriages ensures the free consent of all parties to a marriage, requires states to legislate a minimum age for marriage, and sets up a system of official registration for marriages. The Convention on the Nationality of Married Women addresses the many problems that women face when they marry men whose nationalities are different from their own. States ratifying the Convention on the Political Rights of Women are required to allow women to vote, stand for election, and hold public office.








The Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others as well as the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women of Full Age focus attention on curbing the forced prostitution of women and girls. Finally, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women is the most comprehensive international treaty. It brings the female half of the world into the focus of human rights concernsthe legal status of women and their reproductive rightsand is an attempt to increase understanding of the influence of culture and tradition on restricting women's enjoyment of their fundamental rights.

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979)








The States Parties to the present Convention,
Noting that the Charter of the United Nations reaffirms faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women,

Considering the international conventions concluded under the auspices of the United Nations and the specialized agencies promoting equality of rights of men and women,








Noting also the resolutions, declarations and recommendations adopted by the United Nations and the specialized agencies promoting equality of rights of men and women,

Concerned that in situations of poverty women have the least access to food, health, education, training and opportunities for employment and other needs,








Convinced that the establishment of the new international economic order based on equity and justice will contribute significantly towards the promotion of equality between men and women,








Emphasizing that the eradication of apartheid, of all forms of racism, racial discrimination, colonialism, neo-colonialism, aggression, foreign occupation and domination and interference in the internal affairs of States is essential to the full enjoyment of the rights of men and women,








Affirming that the strengthening of international peace and security, relaxation of international tension, mutual co-operation among all States irrespective of their social and economic systems, general and complete disarmament, and in particular nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control, the affirmation of the principles of justice, equality and mutual benefit in relations among countries and the realization of the right of peoples under alien and colonial






 












Page 156




domination and foreign occupation to self-determination and independence, as well as respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, will promote social progress and development and as a consequence will contribute to the attainment of full equality between men and women,








Convinced that the full and complete development of a country, the welfare of the world and the cause of peace require the maximum participation of women on equal terms with men in all fields,








Bearing in mind the great contribution of women to the welfare of the family and to the development of society, so far not fully recognized, the social significance of maternity and the role of both parents in the family and in the upbringing of children, and aware that the role of women in procreation should not be a basis for discrimination but that the upbringing of children requires a sharing of responsibility between men and women and society as a whole,

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Policy on Refugee Women








Introduction








1. The Executive Committee has adopted four general conclusions relating specifically to refugee women:








 During its thirty-sixth session in 1985, the Executive Committee adopted conclusion No. 39, entitled "Refugee Women and International Protection," in which it stressed the need for UNHCR and host governments to give particular attention to the international protection of refugee women.








 At its thirty-eighth session in 1987, the Executive Committee in its "General Conclusions on International Protection" noted that refugee women had protection and assistance needs which necessitated special attention in order to improve existing protection and assistance programmes, and called on all States and concerned agencies to support the efforts of the Office in this regard. It also recognized the need for reliable information and statistics about refugee women in order to increase awareness about their situation.








 In 1988, at its thirty-ninth session, the Executive Committee adopted a conclusion entitled "Refugee Women" which elaborates further on the special vulnerability of refugee women and the particular problems that they face, notably in the area of physical security, and noted the need to promote the participation of refugee women as agents as well as beneficiaries of programmes on their behalf. The conclusion also stressed the need for "an active senior-level steering committee" on refugee women to coordinate, integrate and oversee the assessment, reorientation and strengthening of existing policies and programmes in favour of refugee women, whilst ensuring that such efforts were culturally appropriate and resulted in the full integration of the women concerned. There was also emphasis on the necessity for public information on the issue of refugee women and the need for the development of training modules on the subject, in order to increase awareness of the specific needs of refugee women and the practical means of addressing these needs.








 At its fortieth session in 1989, the Executive Committee adopted a conclusion on refugee women reiterating concern about physical safety and sexual exploitation. It also called for a policy framework for the next stages in mainstreaming women's issues within the organization with particular attention to the need for female field workers to facilitate the participation of refugee women. It reaffirmed the conclusions of the thirty-ninth session regarding refugee women, called for expanded training and the development of a methodology to systematically address gender issues in refugee programmes.

 In addition to the Executive Committee conclusion, UNHCR, as a United Nations agency, is obliged to implement the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women. Both the above noted conclusions and the strategies reflect the international community's recognition that programmes which are planned or implemented without the consultation or participation of half the target population (the women) cannot be effective and could, inadvertently, have a negative impact on their socio-economic situation. This paper draws together the various Executive Committee conclusions and applicable United Nations resolutions into a policy framework for future action aimed at improving the situation of refugee women.








2. UNHCR's unique functions of providing protection to refugees and helping find durable solutions to their problems imply specific obligations with regard to programmes for refugee women who represent, with their dependents, over 80 percent of the beneficiaries of UNHCR's assistance programmes. The present paper sets out the policy framework for the elaboration of an organizational work plan for the integration of refugee women into programming and project activities. The Office's international protection activities on behalf of refugee women are considered in more detail in a separate paper, document EC/SCP/59, which also discusses some of the considerations in the area of protection and assistance on which the formulations of the present paper are based. The Executive Committee's conclusions on this paper will be incorporated into the organizational work plan.








3. The present paper introduces, in Part III, the underlying principles of the policy. These are the integration of the resources and needs of refugee women into all aspects of programming, rather than creating special women's projects, and the need for each staff member to ensure that this takes place in his or her area of competence. In Part IV, the paper outlines the organizational goals for refugee women, that is, the activities which UNHCR is required to carry out in this connection under its mandate. In Part V are outlined the policy objectives, that is, the interpretation of the organizational goals at the policy level. Finally, Part VI sets out the operational objectives of the policy, that is, a series of activities at the project level to ensure the practical implementation of the policy. These objectives are based on the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and the conclusions adopted by the Executive Committee since its thirty-ninth session.








II. General








4. The policy set out in this document is premised on the recognition that becoming a refugee affects men and women differently and that effective programming must recognize these differences. Furthermore, to understand fully the protection needs and assistance resources of the refugee population, and to encourage dignity and self-sufficiency, refugee women themselves must participate in planning and imple-






 












Page 166




menting projects. Socio-cultural and economic roles can, to a great extent, determine the pattern of such participation. Traditional roles are often disrupted and then either undermined or reinforced by the refugee situation. It is, therefore, essential that organizations working with refugees recognize that special initiatives must often be taken to ensure that all refugees have the opportunity to contribute to the activities planned for them.








III. The Basic Principle: Mainstreaming/Integration








5. It is the intention of UNHCR to integrate the resources and needs of refugee women in all aspects of programme planning and implementation. This does not mean that separate 'women's' projects are to be initiated or added on to existing general programme activities. Nor does it mean that responsibility for this process will rest with one work unit. It is the responsibility of each staff member to ensure that it takes place within his or her area of competence. The following terms and definitions are useful in understanding this concept.








What are programmes or projects which mainstream/integrate refugee women?








6. Any intervention, emergency, mid- or long-term, will have a different impact on men, women and children. Protection and assistance programmes or projects which mainstream/integrate refugee women are based on an explicit recognition of this fact. In activities which mainstream refugee women, action is taken to enable refugee women to participate and make a positive contribution.








7. Planning for such projects includes more than women's social role as daughter/wife/mother. It highlights a woman's economic role as income-earner for herself and her family, producer and/or manager of food, provider of fuel and water, and her religious, cultural and political activities. These roles, and, even more importantly, the change in these roles created by the refugee situation are frequently overlooked by planners. Consequently, interventions which do not take these factors into consideration may be inappropriate to women, tend to isolate them from mainstream project activities, further reinforce their dependency, and force them into unaccustomed social or economic roles.








8. The concept of mainstreaming refugee women arose from a better understanding of the implications of the division of labour between women and men. A programme which integrates refugee women will have taken into consideration factors influenced by the male/female roles in a society and included these in the planned activity with a view to benefiting the whole target population, not marginalizing a portion of it. Refugee women are emphasized because, inadvertently, planners have often overlooked them. Until needs assessment and par-






 












Page 167




ticipation of all segments of a target group are integral to good planning, attention must be consistently drawn to refugee women. This will ensure that they are included in mainstream activities, not made peripheral to them or segregated into ''women's projects."








Projects that focus on refugee women as a target group are not necessarily mainstreaming/integrating projects.








9. The provision of goods to refugee women, that is, when women are passive recipients of shelter or food aid, is not in itself integrating refugee women. Neither is the provision of services to refugee women and their families necessarily an integrating activity. However, the provision of goods and services to refugee women may be part of a project or programme which mainstreams or integrates women. For example, if women as well as men are consulted on the type of shelter required and the resources available to set up and maintain this shelter, then they have been integrated in the overall project. If women are asked about traditional diet, food preparation, and participate in the distribution and allocation of food, then they have been integrated into this activity.








10. By interpreting UNHCR's policy and operational objectives, the meaning of mainstreaming in a project becomes clearer. For example, projects may:








 identify constraints to women's participation related to project delivery procedures;








 respond to the initiatives of refugee women to improve their own situation;








 make available appropriate technologies that alleviate time and energy demands on refugee women;








 collect statistics indicating the male/female breakdown of the population and prepare baseline case studies in order to identify and to eliminate unintentional discrimination in delivering goods and services and thereby improve planning of future activities.








11. In its broadest sense, a UNHCR programme or project which mainstreams refugee women should attempt to:








 achieve greater involvement of refugee women both as participants and beneficiaries in the social and economic activities of the project;








 increase their status and participation in the community/society;








 provide a catalyst through which they can have access to better employment, education, services and opportunities in their society;








 take into account the particular social relationship between the refugee women and their families.








Underlying these broad definitions is the assumption that refugee women are participating or should participate at all levels of project and programme development, from the initial identification of resources and needs to the evaluation stage.

IV. Organizational Goals








12. The organizational goals of UNHCR regarding refugee women are:








a) to provide protection appropriate to their specific needs;








b) to identify an appropriate durable solution;








c) to provide assistance which will encourage the realization of their full potential and encourage their participation in preparing for the durable solution.








V. Policy Objectives








13. The policy objectives which support the overall organizational goals are








a) to recognize that refugee women represent, either as single women or with their dependents, approximately 80 percent of UNHCR's target population and that programmes can be effective only if they are planned with an adequate understanding of, and consultation with, this group;








b) to ensure that the specific protection needs and the legal rights of refugee women are understood and that adequate measures are taken to respond;








c) to support the efforts of refugee women by recognizing their needs and resources and ensuring their participation in UNHCR's protection and assistance activities;








d) to ensure that the differing needs and resources of refugee women and refugee men are considered in programme activities and, where necessary for cultural or social reasons, undertake special efforts to develop specific activities to ensure women benefit equally from programmes;








e) to place particular emphasis on strategies to protect and assist refugee women, recognizing that becoming a refugee can result not only in an unaccustomed social role such as becoming a single head of household or being without extended family support but also in [a] substantially increased physical workload in building and maintaining the future of the entire family;








f) to ensure that refugee women are equitably represented in resettlement programmes;








g) to encourage staff members of UNHCR and implementing partners to ensure that the integration of refugee women's resources/needs takes place in his/her area of competence.








VI. Operational Objectives








14. Operational objectives provide the basis for the development of appropriate activities and work plans to support implementation of UNHCR's Policy on Refugee Women. These are:






 












Page 169




a) to develop mechanisms to ensure that the resources and needs of refugee women are addressed in all stages of programme (protection and assistance) planning, management and evaluation systems;








b) to cooperate with implementing partners, other United Nations institutions, governments and development agencies with a view to benefiting from their experience in women in development activities and, where appropriate, adapting these to UNHCR's specific programming requirements, sharing with them the long-term development implications specific to the situation of refugee women and appropriate methods of incorporating their specific needs and resources into programming activities;








c) to develop communication strategies to call attention to the situation of refugee women of the public, NGOs, other United Nations agencies, donors, and host countries;








d) to develop specific plans for each organizational work unit within UNHCR which will encourage and facilitate consultation and participation of refugee women, and serve as a means of monitoring 0and maintaining this consultation and participation;








e) to develop training courses for staff of UNHCR and implementing partners to assist them in identifying opportunities for increased participation of refugee women in their areas of competence;








f) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of protection and assistance programmes by ensuring that adequate attention is given to the needs and resources of all members of the target population;








g) to review and, where necessary, amend existing policies to ensure that they adequately take into consideration the situation and participation of all members of the target population;








h) to improve data collection and needs assessment in order to have a more accurate representation of the refugee population in order to target programmes more effectively to specific social groups;








i) to ensure that there are adequate female field staff to work with refugee women, and, accordingly, to review staffing and recruitment policies to ensure that there is an equitable representation of female staff and that this is adequately reflected in appointments, posting and promotion activities by UNHCR.








j) to review present operational activities and identify means of improving them in order to facilitate participation of refugee women, and achieve a greater understanding of their needs and resources.

5 Directory of Organizations








The total number of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) throughout the Third World is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands (Fisher 1993). Some sources estimate that women's and women-related organizations worldwide number in the tens of thousands. NGOs are organizations that provide development, relief, education, and advocacy services in countries throughout the world. Two types of NGOs are grassroots support organizations (GRSOs) and grassroots organizations (GROs). GRSOs, usually national or regional in focus, are groups that provide development assistance and international funding to GROs at the local level. Fisher (1993) estimates that there are between 30,000 and 35,000 active GRSOs in the Third World, many of them providing services to women.








This chapter describes organizations, listed alphabetically, that are involved in working with women in the Third World. Some of these groups operate at the international or regional level, some are national in scope, and some provide services in local communities. Several governments have established women's bureaus to serve the particular needs of women. The organizations mentioned here are but a small part of the

A steering committee consists of representatives of active caucuses and regional coalitions; all caucuses and regional coalitions are required to recruit and involve women's organizations and to encourage member organizations to assign persons with a gendered perspective to leadership positions within the group. A guiding principle of the campaign is that affected women and men should participate fully in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of all aspects of World Bank and IMF projects, policies, and programs. The campaign believes that the World Bank and IMF must address the issue of gender and gender bias in their work, that many of the decisions of these institutions often affect women and men in different ways, and that women have been more negatively impacted than men in these decisions. The campaign works to change these attitudes of the World Bank and IMF.

Women play an important role in the economic development process of their countries. In this book, Afshar has collected the views of many experts in the field of women in development. A woman's position is based on her gender and on the economic and political organization of the country in which she lives. This book explores the myths and realities that shape women's lives in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, using case studies from China, India, Iran, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and Vietnam that describe constraints on women farmers in southern Africa, rice production in Malaysia, agricultural collectives in Vietnam, institutional credit in India, and women in manufacturing in India.

Many governments in the Third World encourage the domesticity of women and want to keep women working at home. Legislation passed by these governments is usually directed at controlling women and their fertility and encouraging continued subordination. Afshar has brought together the writings of several researchers in the field of gender and development to examine the position of women in Africa and Asia. Specific policies of African and Asian governments concerning women and sexuality, fertility, health, and paid employment are discussed. Individual chapters focus on fundamentalist views of women in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Ghana, and Iran; family and state in the industrialization of Malaysia; gender and population in China; state responses to needs of males and females in British India; and midwifery, childbearing, and the state in rural north India. The final section discusses women and handicraft production in North India, sexual division of labor in the Israeli army, controlling

Anker, Richard, and Catherine Hein, eds. 1986. Sex Inequalities in Urban Employment in the Third World. New York: St. Martin's Press. 378 pages. Index. ISBN 0-312-71341-X.








This book is a result of a research program on women's roles and demographic change sponsored by the International Labour Organization (ILO). The contributors include a variety of experts in the field of gender and development and include sociologists, economists, and social psychologists. The editors' goal is to examine the inequalities between males and females in nonagricultural employment within Third World countries. While the nonagricultural component of the economy is not large in most developing countries, this component is often the fastest-growing segment of the economy in many of these countries. Therefore, the ways in which women are treated differently from men are an important indication of the ways they are still seen and treated in many of these countries. Some of the issues the editors focus on include "the degree to which employment markets are segregated on the basis of workers' sex; inequalities in earnings between male and female workers; differences in recruitment, hiring, firing and promotion practices for men and women; [and] the effect of family responsibilities on career development and worker productivity" (page 1).

Economic reform and subsequent benefits and losses for people within individual countries vary between men and women. The editors of this volume found that women have been, overwhelmingly, the losers in countries undergoing economic transformation; it does not matter whether the country's economy improved, stagnated, or worsened. The authors found that "women's relative losses have been manifested in different ways, but in every country examined in this volume, economic transformation has led to fewer gains or greater losses for women" (page 2). Part 1 focuses on Eastern Europe and examines women's positions in East Germany, Poland, Romania, and Russia. The economic status of






 












Page 232




women in less-developed countries is described in Part 2, which covers Zambia and sub-Saharan Africa; China, Singapore, and South Korea; and Chile, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Government economic reforms, employment conditions, industrial restructuring, rural-urban interfaces, and political reforms are examined.

The education of women and young girls can play an important role in the economic development, improved health, and improved living conditions of all citizens. Ballara focuses on the impact that literate women and girls can have in key areas of development and reviews the necessary conditions that must be met for literacy programs to succeed. The book examines the links between various factors that affect gender-specific illiteracy, looks at the effect of women's and girls' illiteracy on society and on the development process, describes various approaches that countries and individual programs have taken to improve levels of women's literacy, provides an understanding of the problems that illiterate women and girls face, and supplies the reader with information on how to prepare teaching materials to support literacy activities. The author hopes to encourage individuals and groups to discuss and develop solutions to the problems facing illiterate women and girls. Appendices offer a guide to education and action activities and questions as well as a list of organizations that are working to reduce illiteracy among women and girls.

Historical and current trends related to economic crises in Latin America are described. The importance of understanding how access to income and resources influences decision making and state and national policies is discussed. The relationships among income, economic crisis, and the well-being of families are described.

This book is one of the classic works on women in development. Boserup believed that women played an important role in their local and national economy and in this book she examined the role that women play in economic development throughout the world. As the field of agriculture became modernized and many families migrated to urban areas, the role of women in the economy expanded. If women are restricted in their productive activities, area economies suffer. Boserup points out the patterns of






 












Page 234




women's participation in the economy and explains the significance of these patterns in relation to development theory and policy. In Part I, work patterns in the village are examined, including male and female farming systems, the economics of polygamy, loss of status under European rule, and the casual worker. Part II examines work patterns in larger towns and includes discussions of women's work in the men's world, industry from the hut to the factory, the educated woman, and women in the urban hierarchy. The movement of the population from village to urban area is discussed in Part III and includes discussions of the lure of the towns, urban job opportunities for women, the unemployment scare, and the design of female education. Appendices provide many tables that offer statistical information to back up the earlier discussions.

Bullock, Susan. 1994. Women and Work. Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Zed Books. 160 pages. List of organizations, selected bibliography, index. ISBN 1-85649-117-X.








The role of women in the workforce has been examined by many researchers in recent years. Most researchers agree that women have always played an important role in the economy of communities as well as nations. Most often, their contribution has been minimized because much of their work is nonpaying. Bullock examines women's participation in the workforce, highlighting the ''ideology and structures that limit and undervalue women's participation in the world of work" (page vii) and explores the steps that women themselves are taking to overcome this subordination. Individual chapters discuss issues related to general employment trends, women's employment trends, variables that affect women's productive and reproductive work, the role of women in agriculture, women in the informal sector of work, the ways that women are being integrated into the global workforce, the impact of industrialization, the positive and negative effects of education and training programs, international labor standards and other programs to encourage equal opportunities and treatment of women at work, and the ways that grassroots organization can contribute to strengthening the power of women.

In 1995, an internal review at the World Bank examined all bank projects between 1967 and 1993 and found that only 615 out of 4,955 projects (12 percent) included at least minimal attempts to specifically address the needs of women. In this study of the World Bank, the authors examine the bank's potential role in helping to break the cycle of deprivation that many women experience. Specific initiatives and projects are examined that focus on improving the lives of women throughout the world. The authors believe that the World Bank can and should work on ways to improve women's lives, and the book examines the ways that the bank can contribute to that improvement. Projects that have had a positive impact on women are examined, areas of relative neglect on the part of the bank are described, and several critical issues and challenges that face the bank are identified.

Chhachhi and Pittin have assembled the work of several researchers and activists in this book concerning a variety of women's and labor issues that are similar throughout the world. Contributors focus on the "methods, strategies and forms of organization elaborated by working women to confront the state, capital and patriarchy in the context of industrialization" (page 1). Currently accepted social and economic theories concerning development are examined. The relationship between the experiences of women workers and the restructuring of the world economy is explored. The relationship between capital and patriarchy is discussed. Three major sections focus on reconceptualizing industrialization and organization, trade unions and new organizational strategies, and organizing from home and community Individual chapters focus on efforts to organize working women, Philippine trade unions, women organizing for change in Caribbean free zones, organizing women factory

Cook, Rebecca J., ed. 1994. Human Rights of Women: National and International Perspectives. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. 636 pages. Index. ISBN 0-8122-3261-5.








Cook examines the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1979 and its impact on women's lives. She discusses the ways in which the convention can be used effectively to help women achieve "equality, protection, and individual dignity" (pages ixx). Human rights law, feminist studies, and political science and how these can help women in the Third World alleviate the social inequities, legal discrimination, and economic disadvantages they often face are examined. Challenges to the human rights of women, international and regional approaches, national approaches, and strategies to guarantee human rights of particular significance to women are discussed.








Counts, Dorothy Ayers, Judith K. Brown, and Jacquelyn C. Campbell, eds. 1992. Sanctions and Sanctuary: Cultural Perspectives on the Beating of Wives. Boulder, CO: Westview Press. 268 pages. Index. ISBN 0-8133-7897-4.








The editors have gathered an experienced group of anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and other professionals to provide an intriguing examination of wife-beating and battering throughout the world. Through primarily anthropological accounts of their experiences, the contributors provide valuable information concerning the ways in which other societies view family violence, especially violence toward women. Individual chapters focus on the question of whether wife-beating has an evolutionary origin; men, women, and interpersonal aggression in an Australian aboriginal community; how! Kung women cope with men; wife-beating in Papua New Guinea; preventing violence against women in Belize; men's rights and domestic violence in Ecuador; variations of wife-beating in India; domestic violence among Indo-Fijians; wife abuse and the political system in Iran; wife abuse in the context of development and change in Taiwan; and cultural contexts of domestic violence versus Western social sciences.

This extensive resource grew out of a conference of the same name held at the University of Michigan's College of Architecture and Urban Planning in 1992. The conference emphasized the importance of shelter for women's development in a multicultural and international context. The book is organized around nine major themes: (1) shelter policy; implications for women's development; (2) the structure of legal interventions; (3) shelter and women in crisis; (4) women's participation in the production of shelter; (5) shelter and income opportunities; (6) women and shelter-related services and infrastructure; (7) nontraditional living arrangements beyond the nuclear family; (8) design and creation of shelter for women; and (9) shelter options for elderly women.








Dixon-Mueller, Ruth. 1993. Population Policy and Women's Rights: Transforming Reproductive Choice. Westport, CT: Praeger. 289 pages. Bibliography, index. ISBN 0-275-94504-9.








This book is written by a "feminist demographer ... who is passionately committed to the idea that a woman's ability to decide whether, when, if, and with whom to have sex and have children is a fundamental component of her rights as a woman and of her human dignity" (page xi). Dixon-Mueller has organized the book into four parts. Part One, Women's Rights as Human Rights, provides the basis for the discussion of population policies and women's rights that follows and includes the evolution of concepts of human rights in Western thought, identification of women's rights, and women's sexual and reproductive rights. Part Two, The Politics of Feminism and Birth Control/Population Control, examines birth control and population control as social movements. Part Three, Women's Rights, Women's Lives, looks at the conditions of women's lives and women's sexual and reproductive choices, using research findings from surveys and ethnographic research in developing countries. Part Four, Toward a Feminist Population Policy, suggests recommendations for a comprehensive policy agenda, based on the understanding that women's needs vary around the worldand their perception of their needs vary as well. These suggestions take into account the variety, depth, and breadth of women's experiences throughout the world.

Dwyer, Daisy J. and Judith Bruce, eds. 1988. A Home Divided: Women and Income in the Third World. Stanford: Stanford University Press. 290 pages. References. ISBN 0-8047-1485-1.








The authors discuss how women are perceived as having a less important role than men in generating and controlling family income. They describe the distinctive ways that men and women have access to money and other economic resources and the impact that this access has on the way they see their family and its survival. The goals that men and women have are often determined by institutionalized inequalities. This book examines the impact of reproductive failure in rural South Asia, sexual stratification in Taiwan, earning and managing money in Indonesia, women's contribution to household maintenance in South India, budgeting and financial household management in Egypt, methods of budgeting in Africa, income allocation and marriage options in Zambia, agrarian reform in Honduras, and patterns of money allocation and women's subordination in Mexico City.








El Saadawi, Nawal. 1980. The Hidden Face of Eve. Translated and edited by Dr. Sherif Hetata. London: Zed Press. 212 pages. ISBN 0-905762-51-7.








This book is the first book by Nawal el Saadawi (see Chapter 3) to be published in English. She describes her experiences growing up as a woman in an Islamic world. Topics discussed include sexual aggression against female children, prostitution, marriage, divorce, sexual relationships, and her own experience with female genital circumcision. Her experiences and relationships are described in relation to the larger societal context, specifically the chauvinist interpretation of Islam rather than the earlier egalitarian promises of Islam. This book is one of the first to vividly portray the oppression of women in Egypt and other Middle East, Islamic countries. By writing and publishing this book and others similar in focus, Nawal el Saadawi took a brave step in informing the world about the status and treatment of women; she made many enemies because of her views, including those in positions of power within the Egyptian government.

Page 240




The history of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) is detailed in this fascinating account of the women's peace movement. Started in 1915 by a group of women from twelve countries who wanted to end all wars and stop the violence associated with war, WILPF continues to be a force in today's violent world. Foster describes the history of the organization, the women who founded it, and those who continue the antiwar activities to the present day. The author has convincingly captured their enthusiasm, their strong sense of peace and justice, and their attempts to bring peace to the world. She profiles 18 women involved in WILPF, including Mildred Scott Olmsted, a Quaker who was a founding member; Inga Thorsson, a politician from Sweden; Yvonne See, a French poet involved since World War II; Fujiko Isono, a Japanese scholar involved in WILPF for over 40 years; Ida Harsloff; Anissa Najjar; Kay Camp; Edith Ballantyne, known by many as the backbone of the organization; Ruth Gleissberg; Else Pickvance; Janet Bruin; Betty McIntosh; Marie-Therese Danielsson; Harriet Otterloo; Carlota Lopes da Silva; Irene Eckert; Olga Bianchi; and Angela Gethi.

experience have been excluded from the theory and research related to international relations. "This exclusion has resulted in an academic field excessively focused on conflict and anarchy, and a way of practicing statecraft and formulating strategy that is excessively focused on competition and fear" (page 5). Grant and Newland chose writers and chapters for this book that represent research that is focused specifically on international relations and that is concerned with integrating women into the development process. Topics discussed include the origins of gender bias in international relations; the masculine bias found in the work of Hans Margenthau, a well-known influence in the field of international politics; the influence of socialist nations in promoting feminism; British thinking concerning women and international relations before World War II; the role that women play in economic development; the evolution of the growth of NGOs focusing on women in development; contradictions in feminist approaches to the issue of women in development; and the challenges of incorporating women and international relations into academic fields of study.








Henderson, Helen Kreider, with Ellen Hansen, eds. 1995. Gender and Agricultural Development: Surveying the Field. Tucson: University of Arizona Press. 161 pages. References, index. ISBN 0-8165-1542-5.








Women play a major role in agriculture in developing countries. This book discusses the major issues concerning women in development and agricultural planning. The editors show that women are prime actors in agriculture in developing countries and that materials on gender-related agricultural issues should be incorporated into development planning, research, and training activities. Henderson presents "various analytical approaches to gender issues in agriculture and indicates further resources for obtaining appropriate data" (page 120). The book is divided into two major parts: the first focuses on agricultural systems and the second on applying gender-related approaches to development activities. Topics discussed include the gender division of labor, time allocation, access to land, income-generating activities, credit, appropriate technology, agricultural extension, out-migration, livestock management, water management, and agroforestry.

After five years of gathering evidence of the epidemic levels of violence against women and increasing sexual discrimination throughout the world, the Human Rights Watch has published this excellent report of what is happening to women around the world. The report focuses on the role that governments play in perpetrating, encouraging, condoning, and tolerating several types of abuse against women, including rape as a tactic of war and political repression; trafficking of women into forced prostitution; custodial violence against women; abuses against women workers; domestic violence; sexual abuse of refugee women; and human rights violations that are related to reproduction and female sexuality. Specific actions that governments and the international community can and should take to eliminate violence against women are provided.

At the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994, the Programme of Action reaffirmed everyone's right to an education and gives particular attention to women and female children. Education is a key factor in quality of life and in empowering women. In this study, Jejeebhoy reviews current literature that is available from a variety of disciplines and regions of the world. The ways in which education affects women's lives and autonomy and the links between education and reproductive behavior are examined. The role that education plays in affecting a woman's age at marriage, specifically how education delays marriage, is explored. The fertility-enhancing effects of education are discussed. The ways in which education improves infant and child survival, family size preference, fertility regulation, and contraceptive practices are examined. The implications of these relationships for policyrnakers, families, and communities is discussed.

Kahne and Giele and the impressive group of contributors to this book. In addition to the economic factors that play an important role in determining women's status within economic development, other noneconomic factors are analyzed. These factors include demographic factors, the social and cultural context in which women live and work, the political environment, and the level of economic development within each country. Specific chapters focus on women's work and women's lives in ten different countries or regions of the world. These chapters include topics on women in the economies of sub-Saharan Africa; development and changing gender roles in Latin America and the Caribbean; women, employment, and social change in the Middle East and North Africa; women and work in communist and post-communist central and eastern Europe; interaction of women's work and family roles in the former USSR; women's labor market experience in the two Germanys; women's work and lives in Great Britain; women's place in Japanese society; women and the welfare state in the Nordic countries; and work and family policies in the United States. Kahne, in the conclusion, pulls everything together and discusses the several common features in women's roles and status throughout the world.








Kelly, Gail P., ed. 1989. International Handbook of Women's Education. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. 657 pages. Bibliography, index. ISBN 0-313-25638-1.








This is an excellent sourcebook on women and education throughout the world. Individual chapters focus on a specific country and include information on the history of women's education in that country, ideological and religious beliefs, cultural and political traditions, enrollment patterns, content of women's education, and outcomes of education for women in the workforce, the political system, and the family. Contemporary government policies that attempt to correct inequalities in education are provided. Because gathering information from every country would be a monumental task and require years to gather, the editor has chosen 23 countries that represent "a range of political, social and economic systems; levels of industrialization and wealth; historical contexts; and dominant ideologies about women's proper place" (page xii). Industrial nations include the United States, Japan, France, the German Democratic Republic, Great Britain, Sweden, the Soviet Union, and Canada. Poland, China, and Vietnam are included.

Finally, Liswood provides a short description of each country represented in this book by these women, including population statistics and descriptions of the economy, politics, and attitudes toward women.








Lubin, Carol Riegelman, and Anne Winslow. 1990. Social Justice for Women: The International Labor Organization and Women. Durham: Duke University Press. 329 pages. Index. ISBN 0-8223-1062-7.








The International Labor Organization (ILO) was established in 1919 as an intergovernmental organization dedicated to promoting social justice as a precondition for universal peace. The ILO was one of the first organizations to promote the equality of women with men; one of its objectives is to promote the principle that men and women should receive equal pay for comparable work. This book examines the history of the ILO, the militant women, primarily in the U.S. and British labor movements, who played a prominent role in the early days of the ILO, the ILO's major activities that affect women, and the ILO's interaction with national and international women's movements. The role of the ILO in the United Nations Conference on International Organization is explored, along with the effect of emerging new women's organizations on the ILO's programs for women.

Momsen, Janet H. 1991. Women and Development in the Third World. New York: Routledge. Index. ISBN 0-415-01695-9.








All societies have a clear division of labor by sex, and modernization and a restructuring of traditional economies have changed this division of labor. Women have borne the brunt of these changes, including an increase in women's dependent status and in their workload. Momsen provides ten case studies to demonstrate the ways that women have been affected. Topics include the sex ratio in South Asia, migration, female-headed households, biological reproduction, education, housing, gender differences in time budgets, women in the plantation sector, women as rural traders, female marginalization, gender divisions of labor, barriers to women's participation in the urban modern sector, women in industry, women in the service sector, contemporary problems of development, community management, and development policies for women. Case studies focus on Bangladesh, Lesotho, Singapore, Trinidad, Sri Lanka, Peru, Colombia, Malaysia, Korea, and Kenya.

Page 248




Momsen and Townsend explore the growing understanding of the relationship between geography and gender. No matter what the country, the socioeconomic class, or individual variations, the subordination of women is found in the study of the geography of gender. In this book, case studies from a variety of Third World countries are presented. An overview of the major issues in the study of gender in developing countries is provided. The sex ratio in South Asia, women as caretakers of health in Nepal, and malnutrition in Bangladesh are described as they relate to individual survival. The work of rural women and nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa, women farmers in Nigeria, the heavy burdens and few privileges of women in Tanzania, and peasant women in Bolivia's Lake Titicaca are discussed. The many aspects of women in the labor force are examined, including women and migration in Lesotho, rainforest colonization in Colombia, and female labor mobility in Thailand. Industrial changes and the division of labor are illustrated with descriptions of family structure and female labor in Mexico, gender and industrialization in Brazil, and women's issues and men's roles in Sri Lanka. Finally, the direction that research on gender issues is taking is described in chapters that focus on rural energy and the role of women, agricultural modernization in India, women's role in integrated development in Egypt, the feminization of agriculture in the Caribbean, structural change in the Malay family, and women workers and the creation of demand.








Moser, Caroline O. N. 1993. Gender Planning and Development: Theory, Practice and Training. New York: Routledge. 285 pages. Notes, bibliography, index. ISBN 0-415-05620-9.








Many current approaches to development and women in the Third World are beginning to focus on gender and development rather than women and development. Gender and development examines the social relationship between men and women and develops policies and programs based on these relationships while women in development activities have more often focused on the biological differences between men and women. The first part of this book discusses feminist theories, women in development theories, and gender and development theories and their relationship to gender planning. Fundamental misconceptions and assumptions are examined that have led development planners to exclude women from the development process or to discriminate against them. Some of these assumptions are related to fam-






 












Page 249




ily structure and division of labor within the household. The relationship between different economic development models and policy approaches concerning women in the Third World are discussed. In Part 2, characteristics of and major issues in the field of gender planning are discussed. Procedures for implementing gender policies, programs and projects, training strategies, and the political agenda of women's organizations are examined. An appendix offers a gender-planning training methodology.








Nelson, Barbara J., and Najma Chowdhury, eds. 1994. Women and Politics Worldwide. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. 818 pages. Index. ISBN 0-300-05407-6.








This book provides an excellent overview and resource material concerning women and their involvement in politics throughout the world. The editors found that "in no country do women have political status, access, or influence equal to men's. The sweep of women's political subordination encompasses the great variety of cultures, economic arrangements, and regimes in which they live" (page 3). Women and the extent of their political involvement were studied in 43 countries, which represent a variety of political systems, regions of the world, and levels of economic development. The first chapter presents an overview of major issues concerning women's status and involvement in politics and covers topics such as international forces that affect women's participation in politics, including economic and religious forces; a global review of women's issues concerning violence, safety, reproductive rights, abortion, maternal and child health, access to education, employment, health care, and credit; and reasons for excluding women from politics, including patriarchy and fraternalism. A discussion is presented concerning the research design, the history of this project, and problems encountered in collecting data on women's experience. The next section, and the major portion of the book, offers chapters on each of the 43 countries and includes information on women's experiences in politics from the early 1960s to the early 1990s.

but that "women's voices have been 'silenced' indeed by cultural, social, economic, or political factors" (p. vii). This book provides versions of many of the papers presented at an international colloquium in 1993 organized to examine the global status of women. Topics covered include the positive effect on the world's agenda that women's voices can bring, a women's organization in El Salvador that sponsors women-owned and operated projects, gender-sensitive research strategies for planning development activities based on experience in the Philippines, a comparison of two rural women's organizations in Nigeria, and the problems faced by female development workers trying to fit into the male power structure. A section on cultural expectations contains articles concerning the problems women face in attempting to live up to social and cultural expectations in Nigeria, Muslim women in Malaysia working to improve their lives, and the effect that a patriarchal system has on the value placed on women's work. Finally, a section on struggling with stereotypes focuses on Hispanic female politicians trying to break the stereotypes of Hispanic women as fragile, the role of female journalists in the Philippines, female foreign news correspondents from developing countries who report from Washington, D.C., and the inability of news magazines to fairly represent women and their activities.

This book is a result of a study prepared for the World Institute for Development Economics Research (WIDER), which was established in 1984 by the United Nations University as its first research and training center. It grew out of the need for an accurate assessment of the role of cultural traditions in determining the quality of life for community residents and the justice in such traditions. A case study on women's right to employment in India and Bangladesh as a matter of survival poignantly illustrates the problems that women face in trying to survive in an impossible situationMetha Dai, a widow with two young children living in Rajasthan, India, is prohibited by her caste from working outside her home, but no one else will help feed her and her children. If she works, her in-laws will likely beat her and her children. Part II focuses on theoretical and methodological

foundations and issues in studying women and development issues and dealing with cross-cultural standards of justice. In Part III, concrete issues of justice are discussed, including topics on the inequalities between the sexes in different cultural contexts, the issue of law and its impact on women, the question concerning the effect of women's emotions on their capabilities, and the value of gender identification. The final section presents an account of women's inequality in China, Mexico, and India and a discussion of the value of traditional gender roles in Nigeria.

Ostergaard, Lise, ed. 1992. Gender and Development: A Practical Guide. New York: Routledge. 220 pages. References, index. ISBN 0-415-07131-3.








Understanding the role that gender plays in economic development is necessary to creating effective programs in economic development. This book discusses the reasons why using a gender perspective can lead to successful development efforts. Differences in the roles and opportunities afforded men and women in developing countries pervade all aspects of life in these countries. This book helps the reader understand the importance of gender by examining the concept of gender, traditional data-gathering methods that have distorted the economic role of women in development, gender-related issues that affect women in agriculture, employment, housing, and transportation; access to health and medical services; diversion of income and management of household resources; and guidelines on incorporating gender awareness in programs for economic development in developing countries.

The general condition of a country's economy has an impact on the well-being of women in that country. Rowbotham and Mitter have gathered the input of other scholars and researchers to examine this relationship and the ways that "gender relations interact with other social relationships" (page xi). Specific case studies are used to demonstrate the impact that government policies and market forces have on the lives of women, especially poor women. They show the growing ability of women to organize at the grassroots level to gain economic benefits. Specific topics discussed include an overview of organizing women in the Bombay cotton textile industry (19191940); women in free trade zones in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka; the Nineteenth of September National Union of Garment Workers in Mexico; the Self-Employed Women's Association of Gujarat, India; the growth of women's economic associations and networks in

Many researchers believe that women play a crucial role in economic development and as agents of change within their countries. Economic development requires a significant improvement in the socioeconomic status of women in many countries. This book examines the current socioeconomic status of women, the impact that economic changes have on women, and steps that many countries are taking to empower women in the economic development process. The editors present an overview of discrimination and changes in the status of women in relation to economic development. Individual chapters focus on women and development in Taiwan, China, Malaysia, Japan, South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa (Tanzania), Finland, Europe, the United States, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Australia.








Sachs, Carolyn E. 1996. Gendered Fields: Rural Women, Agriculture, and Environment. Boulder, CO: Westview Press. 205 pages. Bibliography, index. ISBN 0-8133-2519-6.








In Gendered Fields, Sachs works to incorporate an understanding of rural women into general feminist theory, which often focuses on the experiences of "white, Western, upper-middle-class, urban women" (page 3). Several questions are answered in an attempt to understand the lives of rural women. The answers to these questions focus on the relationship of women to the natural environment, the forms that patriarchal relations take in rural areas, the effect that global economic restructuring has on rural women, and the strategies that rural women employ to improve their lives. Feminist theory, rural women's connections to the land, women's work with plants and animals, women's roles on family farms, and global restructuring, including the impact of the growing amount of finance capital, industrial reorganization, and changes in the structure of labor markets, are examined.

Sen, Gita, Adrienne Germain, and Lincoln C. Chen, eds. 1994. Population Policies Reconsidered: Health, Empowerment, and Rights. Boston: Harvard University Press. 280 pages. Index. ISBN 0-674-69003-6.








Contributors to this volume come from the fields of social activism, ethics and law, demography, social sciences, and health sciences to provide the reader with a comprehensive examination of population policies and family planning programs throughout the world. Chapters discuss current debates on population policies and are organized into four sections. Section One reexamines premises that population policies have historically been based on, including population and ethics; sexual and reproductive health and rights; women's rights versus population control; development, population, and the environment; and population, well-being, and freedom. Section Two, on human rights and reproductive rights, looks at the ways that human rights can be honored in population policies and reproductive and sexual rights. Gender and empowerment is the focus in Section Three, which includes a discussion of the meaning of women's empowerment; women's burdens; women's status, empowerment, and reproductive outcomes; and gender relations and household dynamics. The final section looks at reproductive and sexual health: individual chapters focus on reproductive and sexual health services; a reproductive health approach to the objectives and assessment of family planning programs; reaching young people; fertility control technology; and financing reproductive and sexual health services.

Sen, Gita, and Rachel C. Snow, eds. 1994. Power and Decision: The Social Control of Reproduction. Boston: Harvard University Press. 348 pages. Index, acronyms. ISBN 0-674-69533-X.








Sen and Snow have gathered a multidisciplinary group of researchers, in fields as diverse as economics, political science, public health, biology, sociology, pharmacy, and the law, to discuss the social implications of reproduction. Women's reproductive rights have improved in many countries over the last several years, with the acceptance of family planning activities in most of the United Nations member states, the improvement in contraceptives and their acceptance in many countries, and increasing advances in treating infertility. Divided into two major sections, this book covers policies and politics of reproduction and the new technologies in reproductive science. Topics concerning policies and politics include the feminist challenge to social policy concerning reproduction; the working world, day care, and other impacts on working mothers; the experiences of Thai women; religious doctrine and reproductive options in Islam; feminist policies and reproductive rights in Brazil; and abortion policies in Canada and the United States. The discussions of the new technologies include in-vitro fertilization, contraceptive vaccines, the use of Norplant, and improvements in diagnostic technologies. The authors explore how these new technologies can be used by women, their families, health professionals, communities, and societies to promote humane values. This is examined with the understanding ''that these technologies themselves are not neutral tools being used or abused by society. Rather, they are chosen, designed, evaluated and promoted by select (and often different) political communities, and they manifest the values and interests of those communities" (page 148).

Sparr, Pamela, ed. 1994. Mortgaging Women's Lives: Feminist Critiques of Structural Adjustment. Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Zed Books. 214 pages. Index. ISBN 1-85649-101-3.








In the early 1980s many developing countries were unable to find commercial banks willing or able to lend them money for development projects. Many of these countries found themselves in economic difficulty and were forced to seek help from institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. These institutions required that loan recipients correct many of their problems, such as severe inflation, stagnating output, trade deficits, and government budget deficits, through the application of structural adjustment policies. These policies allow market forces to operate freely. This book focuses on the impact that structural adjustment policies have had on women in developing countries. The editor explains what structural adjustment is and how it has affected women in general. Individual chapters provide analyses of structural adjustment policies and their impact on women in Ghana, Egypt, Turkey, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Nigeria, and Jamaica. The final chapter suggests areas for further research, the direction that advocacy programs should take to improve the role of women in development activities, and relevant policy issues that should be discussed and resolved in order for women to benefit economically.








Steady, Fillomina Chioma, ed. 1993. Women and Children First: Environment, Poverty, and Sustainable Development. Rochester, VT: Schenkman Books. 475 pages. Bibliography. ISBN 0-87047-064-7.








Many of the chapters in this book are based on papers presented at the symposium "Women and Children First: The Impact of Poverty and Environmental Degradation on Women and Children," held in May 1991 in Geneva, Switzerland, as a prelude to the 1992 Earth Summit (also known as the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development), held in Rio de Janeiro. Part I explores the nature and scope of women, poverty, and development issues and examines women as managers, protectors, and victims of the environment. Part II looks






 












Page 257




at unsustainable development, including issues of hunger and malnutrition, problems of environmental degradation and poverty, consumption patterns of developed countries and their impact on developing countries, and women's roles, population issues, poverty, and environmental degradation. Managers and conservers of natural resources are the focus of Part III, examining African women's indigenous knowledge in managing natural resources, case studies of African women, and the importance of water and water policies in preserving life. Part IV discusses environmental degradation and poverty and includes chapters on women migrant workers; women, children, and childhood diarrhea in an Egyptian village; and leather tanning in India. Problems of development and environmental security are presented in Part V, and Part VI discusses the fate of children. Part VII examines actions taken by women and children to improve their lives and their environment, including the energy crisis, ensuring access to clean water, and case studies from Costa Rica concerning population and natural resources. Finally, Part VIII presents recommendations that came out of the symposium and the 1992 Earth Summit.








Tinker, Irene, ed. 1990. Persistent Inequalities: Women and World Development. New York: Oxford University Press. 302 pages. Bibliography, index. ISBN 0-19-506158-6.








Tinker and her colleagues provide an excellent historical and political overview of the field of women and economic development. Following an introduction, Ester Boserup provides a current examination of economic change and the role of women by summarizing global trends caused by modernization. In an examination of the politics of women in development, chapters in Section I identify the goals and approaches of advocates, practitioners, and scholars in this field; focus on gender and justice in economic development; provide feminist perspectives on women in development; offer gender perspectives on technology and education; and examine why the socioeconomic impact of export industries set up by multinationals in Third World countries has been so great. Section II examines intrahousehold distribution and control, including gender and cooperative conflicts, the impact of the value of women's time on food and nutrition, and the methods by which patriarchal perceptions of obligations and behavior are imposed on women in Asia. The focus of Section III is on challenging patriarchy, and individual chapters examine the

Women and their human rights have been ignored at all levels of government in countries throughout the world. In providing an overview of this problem and what is being done to focus attention on helping women attain equal rights, this book is an excellent educational tool to help women and their organizations apply existing human rights standards and procedures. Tomasevski emphasizes the differences that exist between the women's agenda and the human rights agenda throughout the world. In trying to stimulate activism on the grassroots level, the author provides suggestions for education and action activities and for legally fighting for women's rights. Individual chapters focus on the history of women's rights; education for empowerment; challenging unequal rights; outlawing and eliminating discrimination; redressing inequalities; protecting the most vulnerable, including refugees, those imprisoned, and the disabled; equal rights for all; and guidance for action.

Adepoju, Aderanti, and Christine Oppong, eds. 1994. Gender, Work and Population in Sub-Saharan Africa. Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann. 245 pages. Bibliography, index. ISBN 0-435-08953-6.








The ways in which women's work has been perceived, examined, and recorded by statisticians, economists, and policymakers are explored in this book. The many contributors examine the culturally prescribed roles of women (and men) and the ways in which these roles affect employment and population issues and policies. Economists, statisticians, and policymakers are encouraged to study the role of women in economic development within the context of the family and kinship systems of the country in which they live. Issues discussed include high mortality and fertility rates, migration for employment, agricultural policies and women producers, women's participation in the labor force, women's economic contributions, gender-sensitive statistics, childbearing and child-rearing practices, work and fertility, family planning, breastfeeding and birth spacing, and the grandmother's role in the household.

Afkhami has gathered together a strong, knowledgeable group of scholars and activists to write about issues concerning Muslim women's search and fight for their rights as humans. Many of the contributors participated in the Washington Dialogue, a conference held in Washington, D.C., in 1994 that focused on religion, culture, and women's human rights in the Muslim world. In Part One, contributors focus on the politics of gender in Muslim countries, reflections on Islam as religion and state, the dichotomy between religious and secular discourse in Islamic societies, the muted voices of women interpreters, the role of women's groups in initiating dialogue on women's issues, and rhetorical strategies and official policies on women's rights. Part Two offers selected cases of women and violence in Muslim countries, including the ambiguity of shari'a and the politics of rights in Saudi Arabia, rape and power in Pakistan, Muslim refugee, returnee, and displaced women, the lack of women's human rights in Algeria, and women's human rights on trial in Jordan.

Agarwal, Bina. 1994. A Field of One's Own: Gender and Land Rights in South Asia. New York: Cambridge University Press. 572 pages. Definitions, glossary, references, index. ISBN 0-521-41868-2.








Agarwal has spent over 15 years conducting research on rural poverty, agrarian changes, and the political impact of gender and working with peasant women in South Asia who are involved in grassroots activities concerning women's independent land rights. This book grew out of the need for research in the area of gender and land rights. Despite legislation providing women with certain inheritance and property rights, the stark reality is that "few South Asian women inherit landed property, and even fewer control it" (page xvi). This book examines the disparity between legal rights and implementation of these rights and examines many of the factors involved in preventing women from claiming these rights. Specific chapters focus on land rights for women, conceptualizing gender relations, customary rights and associated practices, traditionally matrilineal and bilateral communities, contemporary laws, the gap between law and practice, the gap between ownership and control, tracing cross-regional diversities, struggles over resources, suggestions for the future, and the dilemmas some of these suggestions create.

Women entrepreneurs and their contributions to society are often ignored in many Latin American countries, in part because they are not seen as true entrepreneurs. Many women sell a variety of items on street corners but are not thought of as businesswomen. This book attempts to focus attention on these women and their accomplishments. Broad areas examined include this informal sector of the economy and programs designed to help; training programs and technical assistance activities that are provided; case studies of credit programs; and major gender issues and evaluations of assistance programs. Specific chapters focus on improving women's access to credit, excess labor supply, small-scale commerce, solidarity group programs, training and technical assistance, credit guarantee mechanisms, the rural development fund, credit and development for women, the MUDE (Mujeres en Desarrollo Dominicana) credit

Many studies of African women and economic development have focused on women in West Africa, while fewer studies have been conducted on women and economic development activities in east, central, or southern Africa. This book focuses on women's economic activities from a comparative perspective that includes much of sub-Saharan Africa. Examining African market women and economic power, chapters focus on these issues and their relationship to the sexual division of labor in African cultures: competition between men and women concerning certain market areas and items; the nature of available resources; the cultural, social, and economic barriers that limit women's participation in economic activity; the ways that African women are able to exploit economic, social, and political opportunities; the effect of European imperialism on the status of women; and the effects of postcolonialism programs on the participation of women in economic activities.

For this book, Obermeyer has gathered together a variety of scholars who review population policies in the Middle East, including those who advocate fertility limitation in order to encourage national development and preserve environmental resources and those whose primary focus is protecting the rights of women. In the first part of the book, authorities describe the political conditions under which population policies are created and implemented, including legal, religious, and symbolic aspects. The second part discusses the constraints that family structures impose on individual behavior and the ways that the distribution of responsibilities within the household affects reproductive choice. Specific chapters focus on fertility policies and reforms in Turkey, Egypt's population policy, fertility transition in the Mashriq and the Maghrib, population policy in Iran, women and reproduction in Morocco, women's autonomy and gender roles in the Egyptian family, changing hierarchies of gender and generation, setting targets in family planning programs, broadening contraceptive choices, and rethinking family planning policy in light of reproductive health research.

in a slum area near Colombo, Sri Lanka, and in the largest slum of Bangkok, Thailand. She vividly describes the environment in which these women live, the lack of food and water, and their daily experiences. She discovers, and then focuses on, the importance of their relationships with other peopletheir children, husbands, other family members, and friends. Living in an environment in which life is a daily struggle, Thorbek also explains the influences other than poverty on the lives of these women. Men are considered to be stronger and more clever and with authority and control over women, and their work is considered more important because they are paid. Two women tell their own stories, poignantly showing not only the differences in their lives, but also the similarities.








Turshen, Meredith, ed. 1991. Women and Health in Africa. Trenton, NJ: Africa World Press. 250 pages. References, index. ISBN 0-86543-180-9.








African women face a multitude of health problems as a result of the work they do and outside forces that affect them, such as war and revolution, the economy, work opportunities, population growth, and demographic controls imposed by governments, health services, and disease control programs. Contributors to this book focus on the general problems women face in their communities. Specific health issues are discussed based on the experiences within each single country. Individual chapters focus on the impact of war on women's health in Mozambique; women working on plantations in Zimbabwe; nurses organizing in South Africa; domestic workers in South Africa; women, work, and nutrition in Nigeria; the sexual politics of women's productive and reproductive labor; Algerian women and conception and contraception; the politics of population control in Namibia; women, children, and health in CÃ´te d'Ivoire; and gender, power, and the risk of AIDS in Zaire. The editor concludes with a discussion concerning the relationship between gender and health and focuses on the social production of women's health care.

Syracuse University Press. 227 pages. Notes, index. ISBN 0-8156-2633-9.








This book was based in part on a conference concerning women in postrevolutionary Iran that was sponsored by the Foundation for Iranian Studies and the Middle East Center of the University of Pennsylvania and held at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Focusing on the condition of women in Iran, each article, many based on actual presentations at the conference, examines one aspect of life for these women. Many of the authors suggest that current conditions experienced by these women are based on historical Iranian culture. Topics discussed include a feminist perspective on women in postrevolutionary Iran, women's education, the status of women and female children, major women's issues, sexuality as a commodity, female participation in the labor market, temporary marriage, women in the Iranian cinema, sources of female power in Iran, the legal status of women, and excerpts of specific criminal laws as they apply to women.








Angel, Adriana, and Fiona Macintosh. 1987. The Tiger's Milk: Women of Nicaragua. New York: Henry Holt and Company. 142 pages. ISBN 0-8050-0638-9.








In 1956, General Anastasio Somoza Debayle took over the leadership of the country of Nicaragua, with the help of the U.S. government. He was supported by the National Guard, whom he considered his own personal army, until he was forced out of the country in June 1979 when the Sandinista National Liberation Front took over the leadership of Nicaragua. This book relates the stories of the peasant farmers, indigenous and ethnic communities, and women as they search for a peace that did not exist before 1979. Their stories of tragedy and triumph, along with black and white photographs, provide the reader with a first-person understanding of many of the problems faced by Nicaraguans during the Somoza regime and after Daniel Ortega took over the government with the Sandinistas. Experiences of the women of Nicaragua are especially poignant.

Page 274




Russell returned to South Africa, where she was born, from the United States and interviewed 24 women activists there. These women include world-famous leaders, trade unionists, members of radical organizations, and student activists who are white, black, Indian, or colored. This extraordinary book is the result of these interviews. Russell divides the book into four parts: women in South African prisons, the anti-apartheid movement, trade-union women fighting for workers' rights, women organizing with women, and the many faces of anti-apartheid activism. She lets each woman tell her own story, which adds to the emotional strength of the book. Women who were interviewed include Winnie Mandela and Nontsikelelo Albertina Sisulu, whose husbands, Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu, were leaders of the African National Congress and spent many years in prison; Helen Joseph, a white woman who became the first person to be subjected to house arrest (in 1962) and who became a leader in the anti-apartheid movement; and the granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi, Ela Ramgobin.








Sasson, Jean. 1994. Princess Sultana's Daughters. New York: Doubleday. 229 pages. Glossary, index. ISBN 0-385-47444-X.








As a follow-up to her first book about Princess Sultana (see below), Jean Sasson describes Sultana, what happens to her when her father discovers that she has written about the royal family of Saudi Arabia, and about her married life with her husband and three children. Even though the names had been changed in the first book to protect Sultana and her family, her brother and father discovered that she was indeed guilty of writing the first book, with the help of Sasson. In this book, she continues her life story, revealing the pain and joy that she experiences as a privileged member of the Saudi royal family. She describes the limitations that all Saudi women face: they are not allowed to drive cars, they cannot travel without the permission of their husbands or fathers, and they are not allowed to be seen in public without covering their bodies and their faces. The book reads like a fictional adventure; but the harsh reality is that it is a true glimpse of what life is like today for the women who live in Saudi Arabia.

wealthy Saudi Arabians, but she is unhappy because she realizes the low position of women in her country. She realizes that she has no real freedom and no control over her own life and decides to write this book about her experiences. Working with Jean Sasson, she tells the story of her life, anonymously, because the men in her family as well as the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia could easily call for her death if they discovered that she was revealing things best left untold (according to the religious establishment). She describes her childhood, her arranged marriage, the lives of her sisters, and reveals the incredible restrictions that women face in her country.

The complex relationships among religion, ethnicity, and gender are explored in this documentary that chronicles the experiences of four women and their wedding dresses. The travels of four Catholic women from three generations are examined as they migrated from Goa, India, to Singapore, and then to California. Each of the women married at a different time and place, and each wedding created different dilemmas for the women in defining their own cultural identities. By examining the personal lives of each of these women, the film illustrates that the decisions they made have had great significance for the identity of an entire ethnic group.

An intimate portrait of women living in four communities in the Andes is presented in this video. They discuss their beliefs and practices concerning childbirth and infant care. Because modern medical care has only recently penetrated into the rural Andes, many of these women have relied on ethnomedicine to manage their reproductive practices. These practices include ideas about conception, whether human or supernatural, postpartum seclusion, and perceived gender differences about the needs and personalities of infant girls and boys. The film shows that even though their folk medicine is based on several magical premises, the women receive real physical and emotional benefits. The film is in Spanish, with English subtitles and innovative side titles.

As the grandmother and mother-in-law, Dadi explains that she is the ''manager" of her extended family in the Haryana region of northern India. In this area, women leave the villages in which they were born and come as strangers to the households of their husbands' mothers. Through the women in Dadi's family, this video explores the relationships among family members and the problems that can occur. The women talk about the tensions created by Dadi's authority, the loneliness of veiled daughters-in-law who are always seen as outsiders, and husbands' expectations that wives will perform multiple tasks. These tasks include working in the fields, gathering water and cow dung for fuel, and having food and water waiting at home whenever the husbands want to eat or drink. Social and economic changes occurring outside the home also put pressure on the stability and cohesion of the family.

This video is one of the few in existence to present an African viewpoint concerning the culturally sanctioned practice of female genital circumcision. Soraya Mire, a filmmaker from Somalia, created this video, based on her experience with this practice when she was 13 years old. The video explores the socioeconomic, psychological, and medical consequences of this ancient custom. Several women who have experienced this practice speak out, describing their experiences. Many mothers agree with the practice and insist that their daughters also undergo the circumcision, even though they know the damage that will result. They continue to practice this custom in order to conform to the male expectation for a chaste wife. Doctors describe the various forms of female circumcision and the many physical problems that result from it.

Since the time that Europeans appeared on their land, these people have struggled to preserve their traditions and their life styles. As traditionally agrarian communities, indigenous families are facing the loss of their land. This video examines the future of these people.

The Hamar women are strong and outspoken. The first video, The Women Who Smile, centers on Duka, a young single girl who learns what to expect from life from the older women in the village. Their conversations range from teenage pregnancy and relationships with men to growing old. Although men are dominant in this society, the women can hold their own and sometimes mock the posturing of the men. The second video, Two Girls Go Hunting, tells the story of Duka and Gardi, two girls who are preparing to marry men they have never met. The third video, Our Way of Loving, shows Duka as a mother with two children. She spends most of her time caring for her children and her husband.

This video was originally intended as a documentary about the life of Nawal el Saadawi (see Chapter 3), a renowned feminist writer from Egypt. However, it developed into a broader examination of the life of women living in a Muslim society. Safaa Fathay, a young Egyptian woman living in Paris, returns home to interview Nawal el Saadawi but becomes disillusioned with her. Taking passages from el Saadawi's writings, Fathay travels to her family home and discovers similar conflicts between the traditional and modern ways facing women today. Fathay's mother's decision to return to wearing the veil and the genital circumcision of her female cousins bring home the realization that the country is renewing their beliefs in fundamentalism. Fathay examines the contradictions of feminism in a Muslim environment, providing an unforgettable picture of contemporary life for women in the Arab world.

In Pakistan, Nafisa Hoodbhoy, a journalist, investigated the rapes of three nurses in a hospital; one nurse was jailed, but the attackers were never charged. Pakistan's Islamic law does not differentiate between rape, adultery, and fornication. This video examines these laws and the effects that they have on women in Pakistan. Under this law, a woman and a man arrested for fornication are sentenced to 100 lashes and death by stoning. Pakistani courts value the testimony of two women equal to the testimony of one man. A woman who has been raped can be charged with having extramarital sex under Pakistani law. This video examines the contradictions in this law and describes the efforts of several organizations, such as the Women's Action Forum, to protect women against this type of discrimination.
