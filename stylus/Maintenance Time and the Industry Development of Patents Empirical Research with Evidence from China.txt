Abstract
The maintenance time of patents is one of the key indicators for evaluating the technological innovation capabilities of their owners. We analyzed the maintenance status of the patents which were granted by the State Intellectual Property Office of P.R. China (SIPO) in 1994. The results indicate that viewing only from the perspective of the maintenance time of the patents, the technological innovation capabilities of owners of patents received from home are obviously weaker than that of counterparts received from abroad. In addition, the technological innovation capabilities of enterprises are obviously stronger than those of other kind's owners of patents.

1.1 Introduction
In recent years, the numbers of patent1 applications and the number of granted patents in China have both greatly increased. Up to the end of December 2014, the State Intellectual Property Office of P.R.China (SIPO) has received 5,255,996 patent applications, among which 1,551,887 patent applications were granted,2 and by the end of June 2015, there are 1,318,000 valid patents.3

The patent is closely related to the technological innovation, and the output of patents is a key indicator for evaluating the technological innovation capability.4
,
5 In some countries, the output of patents has been used to evaluate the technological innovation capability of a country, region or organization since the late 1960s. For example, the evaluating indicators system of patent output constructed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been used to evaluate the global economic development and the technological innovation capabilities. And the policy makers of U.S. Government use the patent output of the Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to evaluate the technological innovation capabilities in national or regional levels. Some scholars think that the patent information is a valuable, rare, inimitable and irreplaceable resource of the intelligence and information that is connected to the technological development,6 it includes the standardized data connected to development of new ideas and new technologies and has become the focus of the research on many tools and approaches for evaluating the technological innovation capabilities.7 Other scholars believe that the number of the claims in patent applications can preferably reflect the technological innovation capability of a country.8 Through empirical tests, Zoltan J. Acs, Luc Anselin and Attila Varga found out that the number of patents is an important indicator for measuring the technological innovation capabilities.9 In China, Chen Yunwei, Yang Zhiping, Fang Shu studied the status quo of the national and regional technological innovation capabilities combining the practical status of China's patents database referring patent evaluation indicators for the technological innovation capabilities of famous foreign organizations and scholars.10

However, Lu Yongxiang, an academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences, persists that the evaluation of technological innovation capabilities should not simply base on the number of patents but mainly depend on the market values of the innovations, the roles that they play in economic and social development and national security, and the contributions of the innovation achievements in promoting competitiveness of a country, a region or an enterprise.11 Lu Fei and Wu Guiqin in viewing that the maintenance time of patents reflects to a certain degree the level of technology quality, the level of the law protection and the level of the patent execution.12 We believe that the maintenance time of patents can better reflect the market values of the innovation achievements and their contributions in promoting the competitiveness of a country, a region or an enterprise. Therefore, comparing with the amount of patent applications or grants, the maintenance time of patents can better reflect the technological innovation capability of a country or a region. This book tries to analyze the status quo of China's technological innovation capabilities on the basis of maintenance status of patents.13



1.2 Data Collection and Design of Variables

1.2.1 Data Collection
For the development trend of maintenance times on the patents can be better reflected, we chose the data of patents granted by SIPO in 1994. The specific method is that we logged on the patent retrieval website of China Intellectual Property Net (CNIPR), searched related data of 3838 patents,14 and investigated the legal status of these patents from the website of SIPO, and formed a Database of Related Information of the Patents Granted by SIPO in 1994.15 It is the basis of data analysis on this book.


1.2.2 Variables Design
In order to better reflect factors that affect the dependent variable—the maintenance time of the patents with the existing database, we chose the following independent variables: (1) Number of claims. The claim includes the independent claim and the dependent claim. (2) Number of inventors. (3) Type of owners. In this book owners are divided into four types: enterprises, institutes and universities (including universities, colleges and scientific research institutions), individuals, as well as state organs and organizations. (4) Nationality of owners. (5) Examination time (the length of time a patent spent in prosecution from its filing date to its grant date). There are two things need to be special mentioned: first, there are many factors that may affect the maintenance time of patents, this book only study it from the perspective of patent information; second, the citation indexes of patents (the forward citations and the backward citations) are not available in the existing database, which causes difficulties to the design of variables.



1.3 Analysis of the Basic Status of Patent Maintenance Times

1.3.1 Basic Status of Patents

1.3.1.1 Legal Status of Patents
On the basis of the Database of Related Information of the Patents Granted by SIPO in 1994, the data of patents granted in 1994 is analyzed by SPSS 11.5. The general status is as shown in Tables 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4.Table 1.1Legal status of patents Terminated for failure to pay maintenance feesUnexpiredExpirationAbandoned, withdrew, invalidTotalPatents29218753573838Percent (%)76.122.80.90.2100.0

Among 3838 patents granted by SIPO in 1994, there are 1643 patents received from home (hereinafter referred to as domestic patents) accounting for 42.8 % of the total number of patents granted, and there are 2195 patents received from abroad (hereinafter referred to as foreign patents) accounting for 57.2 % of the total number of patents granted. Up to April 30, 2007, 2921 patents, accounting for 76.1 % of the total number of patents granted, had been terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees, among which 1482 were domestic patents and 1439 were foreign patents. 875 patents, comprise of 22.8 % of the total number of patents granted, still remain valid, among which 156 are domestic patents and 719 are foreign patents. There are 35 patents at expiration, which make up 0.9 % of the total number of granted patents, among which only 1 is domestic patents accounting for 2.9 % of the total number patents at expiration and 34 are foreign patents accounting for 97.1 of the total number of patents at expiration. And there are 7 patents terminated in declaration of abandonment or considered abandoned, withdrew and invalid, which make up 0.2 % of the total number of granted patents.


1.3.1.2 Status of Fixed-Variable Relating Patents
The average maintenance time of patents is 5.05 years, which were granted by SIPO in 1994. For the domestic patents it is 4.09 years and for foreign patents it is 6.05 years. The gap between them is approximately 2 years. The average number of claims of the patents that terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees is 8.64. For domestic patents it is 4.65, and for foreign patents it is 11.63, over twice as many as of domestic patents. The average number of inventors of patents that terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees is 2.59; for domestic patents it is 2.80 and for foreign patents it is 2.44. And the average examination time of patents is 3.93 years. For domestic patents it is 3.39 years and for foreign patents it is 4.33 years. Form the above discussion, the conclusion can be reached that the average maintenance time, the number of claims and the examination time of domestic patents are shorter or fewer than those of foreign patents, while their average number of inventors are more than that of foreign patents.



1.3.2 Analysis of the Maintenance Status of Patents

1.3.2.1 Analysis of General Maintenance Status of Patents
The changing curve of patents terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees is as shown in Fig. 1.1. We can see that the second year after granted (i.e. 1996) the terminations rate of patents is the highest, after that year the number of patents terminated tends to steadily decline year after year.Fig. 1.1Maintenance status of patents

The very important problem is reflected by above data and Fig. 1.1, namely the maintenance ratio of patents granted by SIPO in 1994 is very low and the terminated speed of patents is fairly fast. During the period of 12 years and 4 months after granted, among 3838 patents, except that 1 was terminated on declaration of abandonment, 2921 were terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees,16 which account for 76.1 % of the total number of granted patents. Up to 2003, among America's patents granted in 1991, patents terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees account for 53.7 % of the total number of patents granted17 within 12 years. The China's ratio of patents terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees to the total number of granted patents is less 22.4 percentage points than that of America' patents.


1.3.2.2 Comparison Between Maintenance Status of Domestic and Foreign Patents
The specific maintenance status of 2921 domestic and foreign patents terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees is as shown in Fig. 1.2. Although maintenance statuses of both domestic and foreign patents all tend to rise fast firstly and then gradually fall, there are significant differences between domestic and foreign patents in the rising range and the falling speeds.Fig. 1.2Comparison of the maintenance status of domestic and foreign patents

The periods that the terminated number of both domestic and foreign patents is the highest are the 2nd year after granted. However, there are about 200 foreign patents that were terminated in the 2nd year after granted, while approximately 400 domestic patents were terminated in the same period. The amount of terminated domestic patents is nearly twice as many as that of terminated foreign patents. The amount of terminated domestic patents has the biggest drop range of terminations between the 2nd year and the 3rd year after granted and a less big drop range from the 3rd year after granted to the 6th year, then the falling trend goes smoothly and slowly. The amount of terminated foreign patents maintains smooth from the 2nd year after granted to the 10th year and has a relatively significant falling trend from the 10th year after granted to the 13th year. It can be seen that the speed of terminations of domestic patents is obviously faster than that of foreign patents. Therefore, as for maintenance times of patents, technological innovation capabilities of the owners of domestic patents are evidently lower than those of owners of foreign patents.



1.3.3 Comparison of Maintenance Status of Patents Owned by Different Types of Owners

1.3.3.1 Comparison of Fixed-Variables Related Patents Owned by Different Types of Owners
The maintenance time of patents as well as other indicators may be affected by different types of the owners. Table 1.5 shows the status of fixed-variable related patents for different types of the owners as well as their distribution status.Table 1.5Comparison of fixed-variables related invention patent for different types of ownersTypes of ownersMaintenance timeClaimsInventorsExamination timeEnterprises5.7410.552.604.13Institutes and universities3.775.193.513.65Individuals4.736.021.583.58State organs and organizations3.765.133.742.74

Table 1.5 shows that the average maintenance time of the patents owned by the institutes and universities and the state organs and organizations are respectively less than approximately 2 years those of the enterprises. The average number of claims of the patents owned by the institutes and universities and the state organs and organizations is less than half as many as that of the enterprises. The average numbers of inventors of the patents owned by the institute and universities and the state organs and organizations are over twice as many as those of the patents owned by the individuals. And the average application times of the patents owned by the enterprises are more than those of other types' owners, while the application time of the patents owned by the state organs and organizations is less than that of other types' owners. It is obvious that viewing from maintenance times or numbers of claims, enterprises is owner with the strongest technological innovation capability, in the next place individual, and then, institutes and universities. This conclusion is different from the general idea that institutes and universities have the strongest technological innovation capabilities.


1.3.3.2 Comparison of Distribution Status of Patents Owned by Different Types of Owners
Table 1.6 indicates that among the patents granted by SIPO in 1994, those owned by enterprises account for 61.51 %, and those owned by the institute and universities and the individuals account for less than 19 % respectively. The patents owned by the domestic enterprises only account for 23.51 % of the total number of domestic patents, while the patents owned by the foreign enterprises account for 89.93 % of the total number of foreign patents. The domestic institute and universities and the individuals respectively owned 39.52 and 35.08 % of the total number of domestic patents, while the foreign institute and universities and the individuals respectively owned 3.60 and 6.38 % of the total number of foreign patents. It is obvious that viewing only from the numbers of patents possessed, the technological innovation capabilities of foreign enterprises are obviously stronger than those of domestic enterprises.Table 1.6Comparison of the distribution on patents for different types of ownersTypes of applicantPatents (%)Domestic (%)Foreign (%)Expire (%)Unexpired (%)Enterprises236161.538623.51197589.93159054.6477183.08Institutes and universities72818.9764939.52793.6065722.58717.65Individuals71618.6657635.081406.3863321.75838.95Organizations and groups330.86311.8920.09301.0330.32Total3838100164210021961002910100928100

The number of terminated patents of the enterprises makes up 54.64 % of the total number of terminated patents, and the number of valid patents of the enterprises makes up 83.08 % of the total number of valid patents. Viewing from the ratios of the terminated patents and the valid patents, the maintenance rate of the patents owned by the enterprises are obviously stronger than those owned by the institute and universities and the individuals. So, the contributions made by the patents owned by enterprises in promoting the international, interregional and inter-enterprise competitiveness are obviously more than those owned by the institute and universities and the individuals.


1.3.3.3 Comparison of Maintenance Status of Patents Owned by Different Types of Owners
The distribution status of the patents terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees by different types of owners after granted (Fig. 1.3) shows that the numbers of patents owned by the enterprises, the institute and universities and the individuals18 all tend to scale down. However, their falling trends are significantly different.Fig. 1.3Comparison of the maintenance status of patents owned by different types of owners

The similarity of termination trends of patents owned by three type's owners is that each type has most terminated patents in the 2nd year after granted. And their difference is that the termination speed of patents owned by institute and universities is the highest, and the termination speed of patents owned by enterprises and individuals is relatively close.




1.4 Conclusions and Expectation
The maintenance time of patents is one of the key indicators for evaluating technological innovation capabilities of their owners. The maintenance status of the patents granted by SIPO in 1994 show that viewing only from the perspective of patent maintenance times, and the technological innovation capabilities of domestic owners are evidently weaker than that of foreign owners. And the technological innovation capabilities of the enterprises are evidently stronger than those of other owners. Therefore, China's innovational subjects should strengthen their awareness of patent strategy, and improve their capabilities of management and use patent. At the same time, the government should perfect the technology transfer market, and adjust policies on patent application, maintenance, transfer and license, and finally improve technological innovation capabilities of China's innovational subjects.

Abstract
Compared with the numbers of patent applications and patent granted, the numbers of valid patents and their maintenance times can better embody one country's technological innovation capability. In this book, 2921 patents, which granted by the State Intellectual Property Office in China in 1994 and up to April 30, 2007 terminated due to unpaid fees, are analyzed based on the patent information perspective by multivariate linear regression using SPSS software (11.5). The results show that the average maintenance time of patents, which granted by the State Intellectual Property Office, is shorter and the terminated speed quicker. The effecting degrees of a nationality of applicants, a examination time, a types of patentees, a number of inventors and a claims number of patents on the paten maintenance time followed by weakening.

2.1 Introduction
The attractiveness of a technology as an investment object depends decisively on its current life cycle stage. It is a widespread approach to study technology life cycles1
,
2 by observing the evolution of patent applications and the patent maintenance time.3 Patent activity is also used to describe life cycles at the levels of products4 and industries5 from the patent maintenance perspective.
The most important reason that patents applied and maintained by spending a lot of energy and funds is that patents, especially invention patents6 are important intangible assets. The quantity and the quality of effective patents of enterprises reflect their innovation capability, competitive strength and market potential. The quantity and the quality of effective patents in a country mark it's the technological innovation capability and the level of technological development potential.7 Obtaining a patent is only a right to use the invention, and the effective maintenance of patents is the beginning of its real role.8 The main purpose of patents is to maintain and use them, but only to apply and grant. Therefore, a research of the maintenance situation of patents should be one of the core content of patent issues.
Patent information is a valuable, rare, not imitate and irreplaceable resources, which relate with the technological development.9 It contains the standardization data associated with the new ideas and the new technological development. It also is many measuring innovative tools and methods of research focus.10 There are many research results on the relation of the technological development and the economic growth by the patent information.11 Some scholars have been studied more micro aspects of technological innovation and technological protection by the patent information. They believe that the claims of patent applications should be bitterly reflect patentee's technological capabilities.12
,
13 Therefore, it is very important that the research of the maintenance situation of patent or the effective patent issues by the patent information.
In this book, 2921 patents that up to April 30, 2007 terminated due to unpaid fees, of which 3838 granted by the State Intellectual Property Office in China (SIPO) in 1994, are analyzed based on the patent information perspective by multivariate linear regression using SPSS software. The purpose is to understand the weight of the factors to effect the patent maintenance time, and appropriately extend the patent maintenance time by studying the impact degree of the time needing from application to granted, types of patentees, the number of inventors and the number of patent claims on the patent maintenance time.

2.3 Basic Status of Patents

2.3.1 Data Collection
Based on the Database of Related Information of the Patents Granted by SIPO in 1994, the data of patents granted in 1994 is analyzed by SPSS 11.5. The general status is as shown in Table 2.1.Table 2.1Legal status of patents Terminated for failure to pay the maintenance feesUnexpiredExpirationAbandoned, withdrew, invalidTotalPatents29218753573838Percent (%)76.122.80.90.2100.0

Among 3838 patents granted by SIPO in 1994, Up to April 30, 2007, 2921 patents, accounting for 76.1 % of the total number of patents granted, had been terminated for failure to pay the maintenance fees. 875 patents, comprise of 22.8 % of the total number of patents granted, remain valid. There are 35 patents at expiration, which make up 0.9 % of the total number of granted patents. In addition, there are 7 patents terminated in declaration of abandonment or considered abandoned, withdrew and invalid, which make up 0.2 % of the total number of granted patents.


2.3.2 Analysis of the General Maintenance Status of Patents
The changing curve of patents terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees is as shown in Fig. 2.1. We can see that the second year after granted (i.e. 1996) the terminations rate of patents is the highest, after that year the number of patents terminated tends to steadily decline year after year.Fig. 2.1Maintenance status of patents

The very important problem is reflected by above data and Fig. 2.1, namely the maintenance ratio of patents granted by SIPO in 1994 is very low and the terminated speed of patents is fairly fast. During the period of 12 years and 4 months after granted, among 3838 patents, except that 1 was terminated on declaration of abandonment, 2921 were terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees,16 which account for 76.1 % of the total number of granted patents. Up to 2003, among America's patents granted in 1991, patents terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees account for 53.7 % of the total number of patents granted17 within 12 years. The China's ratio of patents terminated for failure to pay the maintenance fees to the total number of granted patents is less 22.4 percentage points than that of America' patents.



2.4 Multiple Linear Regression Analysis of the Factors to Influent the Maintenance Time of Patents

2.4.1 Regression Results
Assume that there are k independent variables impacting a dependent variable, and a multiple linear regression model is specified as:

The interpretation of the regression equation is the interpretation of the regression coefficient.
In a multiple linear regression, the regression coefficient ? is reflected a "net" role in the corresponding independent variable x on the dependent variable, namely the role of x

i
 to y if the rest variables controlled or excluded. However, the unstandardized coefficients are statistical variables that having metric unit,there are different metric units for different independents. Therefore, different metric units cannot be compared, and the "net" role of x

i
 to y cannot be judged by the value of ?

i
. In order to different metric units may be compared, the relative size of the role of independent variables is determined; the regression equation must transfer for the standardized regression equation, and the regression coefficient transfer for the standardized regression coefficient.
Based on the Database of Related Information of the Patents Granted by SIPO in 1994, the maintenance time of patents (Y) as the dependent variable, and the number of claims, the examination time, the number of investors, the nationality of applicant, the enterprises and the individual (the individuals and the enterprises as a virtual variables for institutes and universities) as the independent variable, the results of the multiple linear regression analysis on the data of patents granted in 1994 by SPSS (11.5) as Tables 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4.Table 2.2Model summarya

The number of claims, the examination time, the number of investors, the nationality of applicants, the enterprises and the individual (the individuals and the enterprises as a virtual variables for institutes and universities) as independent variables X1, X2, X3, X4, X5 and X6. The multiple linear regression models can be drawn as following:

The standardized coefficients of the dependent variable (the maintenance time of patents) (Y) on six independents respectively are 0.009, ?0.128, 0.314, 0.035, 0.113, 0.116.
This figure shows the influent degree of six independents variables for the dependent variable (Y). In other words, for the maintenance time of patent, the greatest impact for it is the nationality of applicant; second impact are the examination time, the enterprises and the individual; finally impact are the number of investors and the standardized coefficients.

The value of the overall correlation (R) between the dependent variable (Y) and six independents variables is 0.347, and the value of R2 is 0.121. In other words, the explanation degree of six independents variables to the dependent variable (the maintenance time of patents) is only 12.1 %. The main reasons led to such results are that the influent factors of the maintenance time of patents are many and complex. Of course, another important reason is that the cited index of patents (the forward citations and the backward citations) that granted by SIPO cannot be obtained from the existing patent databases, but this cited index is very important for the maintenance time of patents. However, we believe that the reason that the explanation degree is low cannot induce to the value of this research, because there is not better indictors to analyses the situation of the maintenance time of patents from the patent information in the existing conditions. Therefore, this model has an important value for the research of the weight distribution of the influent factor on the maintenance time of patents.
In six independents variables, the influent degree of the nationality of applicant on the maintenance time of patents is highest (standardized coefficients is 0.314). This research achievement provides an important inspiration that domestic applicants should study the experiences of patent application and patent maintenance from foreign applicants.
The influent degree of the examination time is less than that of the nationality of applicant. Its standardized coefficient is ?0.128. Namely, the maintenance time of patent will increase 0.128 years if the examination time decreases a year. Therefore, we must attach importance to the examination time of patents for extending the maintenance time of patent and effectively realizing the value of patent rights. The influencing factors of the examination time of patents include the examination procedures of patents, the examination efficiency of patents and the level of writing of the file of patent applications and so on.
The individuals and the enterprises are virtual variables for the institutes and universities. Their standardized coefficients respectively are 0.113 and 0.116. In other words, when other variables is same, compare with the institutes and universities, the maintenance time of patents of the individuals and the enterprises are more than 0.113 years and 0.116 years respectively. This shows that the maintenance times of patents of the enterprises, the individuals and the institutes show a weakening trend.
The number of inventors and the number of claims, as the independent variables, cannot be significant test (the value of P is less than 0.05). This shows that the influent degree of the number of inventors and the number of claims are very low. Their standardized coefficients respectively are 0.035 and 0.009; this also indicates that the explanation degrees of two independent variables are less than that of other influent factors.



2.5 Conclusions and Inspiration
The value of patent is to maintain it. This book uses standardized linear regression with the Database of Related Information of the Patents Granted by SIPO in 1994 to study the influent degrees of different influencing factors to the maintenance time of patents from the patent information by SPSS software (11.5). The conclusion can draw. The average maintenance time of innovation patents is shorter and the terminated speed quicker, which granted by the State Intellectual Property Office in China. Effects of the applicant's country, the examination time, types of patentees, the number of inventor and the number of patent claims on the Paten maintenance time is follow by weakening.
This conclusion provides three main inspirations to us. First inspiration is that we must comprehensively and in-depth study the real reasons why the maintenance times of patents granted by the State Intellectual Property Office in China are short and the terminated speeds of patents for failure to pay maintenance fees is quicker. At the same time, we must effectively solve these problems for the role of the patent system better played, and the utilization rate of public resources increased. The second inspiration is that we must recognize the status quo to maintain domestic patents and its impact to China's technological innovation, and appropriately adjust the patent system and relating policies. Its purpose is to improve the capacity to application and management patents of domestic patentees. The third inspiration is that we must improve the examination ability of patent examiners and the examination efficiency, strengthen the time concept of applicants and patent attorneys, and as short as possible the examination time of patents.
It is worth mentioning that research on the impact factors to the maintenance time of patents and its weight only from the perspective of the patent information in this study. In fact, there are many factors to impact the maintenance time of patents. For example, the level of patent strategy of patentees, the management level of patent, the conditions and the systems of the implementation, licensing, transfer of patents, the market conditions of patents trading, the available technology and the level of the creativity standards of the patents examination, the identified mode of patent infringement and the amount of compensation all will impact it. In order to reasonably extend the maintenance time of patents, improve the patent quality in China, and strengthen China's capability for independent innovation, we hope that the maintenance time of patents researched from these perspectives in the future if conditions permitted.

In China, patent includes invention patent, utility models patent and design patent. Because utility models patent and design patent need not substantive examination, so many scholars at home and abroad believe the quantity of inventions patents is one of indicators to measure the innovation capability of enterprises, a region and a nation. Therefore, in this book "patent" just refers to invention patent.

Abstract
The relevant data of 3838 domestic patents and foreign patents, which were granted by SIPO in 1994, are comparatively analyzed using SPSS software, and fund that the maintenance rate, the maintenance time, the average number of claims and the examination time of domestic patents are significantly less than foreign patents. In the maintaining patents, foreign patents focus on high-tech fields; domestic patents focus on traditional technologies fields. From the perspective of the maintenance status of patents, the innovation ability of domestic patentee is less than that of foreign patentee.

3.1 Introduction
The quantity and the quality of patents1 reflect the innovation ability of a country. They are also the key indicators to measure that whether a country is an innovation-oriented country,2 so it is necessary to explore the ways to improve the quantity and the quality of patents. In order to solve this problem, we must understand the quantity and the quality of existing patents and the existing capacity of innovation in China.3

The growth rate of China's patent applications has more than 20 % in continuous eight years, and the growth rate of patent grants also substantially increased. The patent report of WIPO (2007) shows that the amounts of China' patent application is the third in the world in 2005. In these patent applications, the number of domestic patent applications is the fourth in the world, and the number of foreign patent applications is the second in the world.4 At the end of June 2007, 1,193,856 of patent applications are accepted and 328,534 of patents are granted by State Intellectual property Office of the P.R. China (SIPO),5 and the granted rate6 is 27.5 %. At the end of June 2007, there are 242,435 existing patents in China, and the maintaining rate of patent7 is 73.8 %. In these existing patents, domestic patents are 83,018, and foreign patents are 159,417. They accounted for 65.8 and 34.2 % of the total of existing patents respectively. In the patents that the maintaining time is more than 10 years, there only are 4348 domestic patents, but there are 36,692 foreign patents. In the patents invalid at fist half on 2007, the average life of domestic patents is 6.3 years, and the average life of foreign patents is 10.0 years. Patents terminated by patent expiry, domestic patents account for 7.0 %, but foreign patents is 93.0 % of total terminated patents.8

These data remind us that the innovation ability of China's patentee is not optimistic from the domestic patent grants and the maintenance situation. Therefore it is very important to compares the maintaining situations of domestic patent and foreign patent and analysis the factors affecting the maintain time of patent,9 finally explore ways to extend the maintain time of patent and improve China' technological innovation capabilities and the core competitiveness.

3.3 Comparisons of the Basic Status

3.3.1 Comparisons of the Legal Status of Domestic Patents and Foreign Patents
Among 3838 patents granted by SIPO in 1994, there are 1643 patents received from home (hereinafter referred to as domestic patents), and there are 2195 patents received from abroad (hereinafter referred to as foreign patents). Table 3.1 shows the situation of the legal status of domestic patents and foreign patents. Up to April 30, 2007, 2921 patents had been terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees, among which 1482 are domestic patents and 1439 are foreign patents. There are 875 patents still remain valid, among which 156 are domestic patents and 719 are foreign patents. There are 35 patents at expiration, among which only 1 is domestic patents and 34 are foreign patents. And there are 7 patents terminated by abandonment, withdrew and invalid, which make up 0.2 % of the total of granted patents.Table 3.1Comparison of the legal status ExpirationUnexpiredAbandoned, withdrew, invalidTerminateda

3.3.2 Comparisons of the Status of Fixed-Variable of Domestic Patents and Foreign Patents
Table 3.2 shows the situation of the fixed-variable relating domestic patents and foreign patents. The average maintenance time of patents is 5.05 years, which were granted by SIPO in 1994. For the domestic patents it is 4.09 years and for foreign patents it is 6.05 years. The gap between them is approximately 2 years. The average number of claims of the patents is 8.64. For domestic patents it is 4.65, and for foreign patents it is 11.63, over twice as many as of domestic patents. The average number of inventors of patents is 2.59; for domestic patents it is 2.80 and for foreign patents it is 2.44. And the average examination time of patents is 3.93 years. For domestic patents it is 3.39 years and for foreign patents it is 4.33 years. Form the above discussion, the conclusion can be drawn that the average maintenance time, the number of claims and the examination time of domestic patents are shorter or fewer than those of foreign patents, while their average number of inventors are more than that of foreign patents.Table 3.2Comparison of the fixed-variable Domestic patentForeign patentMeanStd. deviationMeanStd. deviationMaintenance time4.092.8136.053.201Claims4.653.47011.639.771Inventors2.802.3182.441.775Examination time3.391.3964.331.486



3.3.3 Comparisons of the Maintenance Time of Domestic Patents and Foreign Patents
Figure 3.1 shows the trend of the maintenance time of domestic patents and foreign patents. Trends of the maintenance time of domestic patents and foreign patents are first rapidly increase, then gradually decline. However, there are significant differences in the height of increase and the rate of decrease.Fig. 3.1Comparisons of the maintenance time

The peak times of domestic patents and foreign patents that terminated for failure to pay the maintenance fees all are second years after patents granted. However, the number of domestic patents that terminated for failure to pay the maintenance fees about is 200 in second years after patents granted, but this number of foreign patents about is 400. For domestic patens, the largest decline that terminated for failure to pay the maintenance fees is the time between second year and three year after patent granted; this trend is larger in the time between fourth year and sixth year after patent granted; Then the downward trend tend is to slow. For foreign patents, however, this decline trend have been relatively flat in the time between second year and tenth year after patent granted; this decline trend is apparent in the time between tenth year and thirteenth year after patent granted. A conclusion can be drawn that the terminated rate of domestic patents that terminated for failure to pay the maintenance fees is significantly higher than foreign patents.



3.4 Comparisons of the Information of the Patent Applications

3.4.1 Comparisons of the Number of Claims of Domestic Patents and Foreign Patents
Figure 3.2 shows the situations of the claims number of domestic patents and foreign patents.Fig. 3.2Comparisons of the claims number

For domestic patents, the claims number of the most of patent is only two; the claims numbers of patents mainly lie in between 1 to 11; the largest number of claims of patents is 25. For foreign patents, the claims number of the most patent is ten; the numbers of claims of patents mainly lie in between 1 and 30; the largest number of claims of patent is 61. The claims number reflects the innovation ability in a country.12 A big gap that the claims number of domestic patents and foreign patents shows that the quality of the domestic patents is very poor.


3.4.2 Comparisons of the Inventors Number of Domestic Patents and Foreign Patents
Figure 3.3 shows the situations of the inventors' number of domestic patents and foreign patents. In these patents, the number of patents that the inventor number of is 1 is largest. However, the number of domestic patents that the number of inventor is 1 is more than the number of foreign patents. When the inventors number each patent between 1 and 4.2, with the growth of the number of inventors, the numbers of domestic patents and foreign patents all decrease. Even though the same number of inventors, the number of foreign patents is less than that of domestic patent. But when the number of inventors is more than 4.2, the trend of the number change of inventors of domestic patents and foreign patents tend to the same.Fig. 3.3Comparisons of the number of inventors



3.4.3 Comparisons of the Terminated Rate of Domestic Patents and Foreign Patents in Different Technical Fields
In order to have comparability in the different technical fields on domestic patents and foreign patents, this section only to compare the proportions that the number of granted patents that terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees account for the total number of domestic patents and foreign patents in different technical fields.13 Figure 3.4 shows the situations of the rate of domestic patents and foreign patents that terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees in different technical fields. For domestic patents, the proportions that the number of granted patents that terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees account for the total number of patents in human necessities, chemistry and metallurgy, fixed constructions technical fields is higher than that of foreign patents. For foreign patents, the proportions that the number of granted patents that terminated for failure to pay maintenance fees account for the total number of patents in textiles and paper, physics, electricity technical fields is higher than that of domestic patents. For this proportion, there is a little difference between domestic patents and foreign patents in performing operations and transporting, mechanical engineering, lighting, heating, weapons, blasting technical fields.Fig. 3.4Comparisons of the proportion in different technical fields. A human necessities; B performing operations, transporting; C chemistry, metallurgy; D textiles, paper; E fixed constructions; F mechanical engineering, lighting, heating, weapons, blasting; G physics; H electricity




3.5 Conclusion
Clear understanding the reality of the innovation ability in China is the basis on develops and implements the policy building an innovation-oriented country. This book from the perspective of the innovation ability compares the maintaining situation of domestic patents and foreign patents granted by SIPO in 1994. A conclusion can be drawn. The fact that the maintenance time of foreign patents is more than that of domestic patents shows that foreign patentees' the abilities to use patents are higher than domestic patentees' to a certain extent. The fact that the number of claims of foreign patents is more than that of domestic patents shows that foreign patentees' the qualities of patent applications are higher than domestic patentees' to a certain extent. The fact that the number of inventors of foreign patents is more than that of domestic patents shows that foreign patentees are more focus on the research and development team than domestic patentees to a certain extent. The technological fields of foreign patents focus on high-tech fields and the technological fields of domestic patents focus on traditional technologies, to a certain extent, show that the research priorities of foreign inventions have transferred from traditional industries to the high-tech fields, but the research priorities of domestic inventions still in the application level of traditional industries.

Abstract
The International Patent Classification System (IPC) provides a hierarchical tool of language independent symbols for the classification of patents according to the different technological fields to which they pertain, and the patents of each technological field should have their own technical characteristics. Using the information of patents in performing operations and transporting technological field, which were granted by the United States, Japan, Korea, Germany, French and China, conclusions can be drawn: firstly, the distributions of the technological fields of granted patents are related to the technology advantages of countries; Secondly, the respective trend of the maintenance time of granted patents in the performing operations and transporting technological field in six countries are consistent with the trend of the maintenance time of granted patents in all technological fields in six countries; Thirdly, the termination rates of granted patents in the longer period of maintenance times are larger than that of granted patents in the shorter period of maintenance times in this technological field in the United States, while the termination rates of granted patents in Japan and France mainly concentrate on the 6-10 years periods and the 11-15 years periods, and the termination rates of granted patents by China, Korea and Germany decrease with the period of maintenance time growth.

4.1 Introduction
There is no doubt that the patent system is very important for economic development in the knowledge economy society, so many countries have strengthened their protection levels of intellectual property rights in order to stimulate technological innovation. Standard theory believe that the protection system of intellectual property rights stimulates the innovation in that this protection system raises the incentives to create innovations by enabling innovators to reap the benefits of innovation (through monopoly profits) and recoup the costs of research and development investments.1 However, some recent studies argue this view is not correct. They believe that the patent system is useless and redundant since the inventions come from human's subjective creation and have nothing to do with the material incentives or the system security, instead lead to many invalid and none economical innovations.2 Besides, the monopoly of patent rights hinders other independent research's outcomes of the same invention made by own which shall enjoy the natural rights, Patents provide relatively broad protection: no one can legally use the same idea, even if they independently rediscover it, without permission from the patent holder.3 Bessen and Maskin believe that Patents may be desirable to encourage innovation in a static world, but they are less important in a sequential setting, where they may actually inhibit complementary innovation.4 Therefore, in recent years, the low utilization and the high input costs of large number of patents create more and more questions and deny on the patent system.5 However, the patent system is a result of which are attributable to the development of commodity economy of the growing commercialization of science and technology, and the patent system eventually severs the person or enterprise who want to rely on the advanced technology to gain market competitive advantages. For patentees, the cost of patent system is the expense of disclosing secret fills of technology and paying an annual fee, and the profit is the process of patent commercialization, but for the state and society, the purpose of patent system is to obtain a technological development. Roger Svensson considers that one of the major reasons why inventors are awarded for patents by governments is that they encourage R&D investments and commercialization of inventions. If the patent holder commercializes his invention, he would have stronger incentives to retain the patent.6 Therefore, the commercialization is an important factor of patent technological development.
Scholars research results mainly focused on the effecting factors of the patent maintenance time, the maintaining mechanism of the patent system, and so on, but there are relatively scarce on the research result of renewal patents about a single technological field, and there is no any specific data to support the results. Since The International Patent Classification (IPC), which was established by the Strasbourg Agreement, provides a hierarchical system of language independent symbols for the classification of patents and utility models according to the different technological field, and this system has been widely used to distinguish the technological fields of patent in most countries. The uniform international patent classification standard not only facilitates the analysis the states of similar technological fields of patents or the standardization of scientific research for the technological fields of patents, but also overcomes the limitations of the varying technical standards in the technological fields. The IPC divides technologies into eight sections with approximately 70,000 subdivisions. So this book chose section B, namely the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field and collected the data of granted patents by the United States, Japan, Korea, Germany, France, China in 1994, then analyzes the patent maintenance time of this technological field. The information of patent maintenance time reflects the economy value of those patents. Why chose the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field in this book? The reasons could be drawn from Table 4.1.Table 4.1The distributions of granted patents in all technological fields in six countries in 1994 ABCDEFGHTotalU.S.A735862472531193017585383838Germany418832715961414086735553838France713982599671153795244593838Japan333677709551543138597383838Korea2414326391204528290911703838China6537881051121842735093593838Total30934573418551265819564232381923,028

Table 4.1, we could find that there are different distributions of the patents number in different technological fields in six counties for the different economic development levels in different countries. But in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field, the total numbers of granted patents are more than the total number of granted patents in other seven sections. So studying the information of patent maintenance in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field has a great significance for improving technological innovation level and intellectual property management level. Therefore, with the granted patents of Performing Operations and Transporting technological field as the research object, this book analyzes the patent average maintenance time, the patent legal status, and the distributions of different maintain periods and so on. This book should multi-interpret the patent maintenance information in this technological field.


4.2 Data Sources and Collection
With the maintenance information of granted patents in the United States, Japan, Korea, Germany, France and China as the research objects retrieve out all the information of granted patents in six countries in 1994 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office website, the Japan Patent Office website, the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service website, the German Patent and Trademark Office website, the French Industrial Property Office website, and the State Intellectual Property Office of P.R.C website, then respectively chose 3838 patents granted by each countries with the isometric random sampling. Finally, we established the databases with the patent number, the patent maintenance time, the patent examination time, the patent technological field, the inventor's number and some other maintained information.
The reason we collect the data of patents in 1994 is that the maximum time of patent protection in the patent systems in the United States, Japan, Korea, Germany, France, and China are all of 20 years, and all patents granted in 1994 should be terminated in the year of 2014, so a complete protection cycle of granted patents could be researched. This database can reflect a cycle that patents from granted patents to terminated patents of total. In addition, China's granted patents in 1994 are 3838 pieces, so based on this number to chose the granted patents number of other five countries, the purpose is good for comparative studies and reducing the error, and improving the accuracy of the study.


4.3 Analysis of the Maintenance Time of Granted Patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting Technological Field in Six Countries
The patent maintenance time is an important index of evaluating the quality of patents, which reflects the performance of patent system in a country in a certain extent, so the patent duration is an important symbol to evaluate the quality of patent system.7 Therefore, this study on the patent maintenance time not only could reflect the length of validity of very patents, but also could show the achievement of the objective of the patent system. According to the data of patents granted by the United States, Japan, Korea, Germany, France, China in 1994, the granted patents number of the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field respectively is more than the number of granted patents in other seven technological fields by the United States, Germany and France; the granted patents number by Korea is the highest number of granted patents in section Electricity, the granted patents number in Japan is the highest number in section Physics, and the granted patents number by China, section Chemistry and Metallurgy has the largest number of patents. The reason of the phenomenon of the highest number of granted patents in the different technological fields may be the national policies and the economic conditions caused by the imbalances of technological innovation levels. Therefore, the granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting Technological Field could be the research object in that it has the largest number of patents in total of six countries.

4.3.1 Comparative Analysis of the Average Maintenance Time of Patents Granted in the Performing Operations and Transporting Technological Field in Six Countries
The average value represents the central tendency of an ordered set of values and has a relation with every data in the set, any changes with a data would differ the average. we first analyze the average maintenance time of granted patents for measure a country's patent maintenance situation, because it's able to represent the overall level of the situation of patents maintenance in the technological field. Table 4.2 shows the average maintenance time of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field in the United States, Japan, Korea, Germany, France and China in 1994. According to Table 4.2, there are different in the percentage of granted patents, the average maintenance time and the standard deviation of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field by six countries.Table 4.2The comparison of the average maintenance time of granted patents in the performing operations and transporting technological field in six countries The percentage of patents in section B (%)The average maintenance time (year)Standard deviationTotalSection BTotalSection BU.S.A.22.512.712.15.45.4Japan17.69.59.53.13.1Korea11.08.47.63.14.5Germany21.78.88.74.84.8France25.610.210.14.24.2China20.57.37.75.25.2

Table 4.2, we can find that the percentage of granted patents number in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field of the United States, Germany, France and China are all more than 20 % of granted patents in the all technological field. However, Japan and Korea have smaller rates of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field. Reasons for this situation may be greatly related to the economy and innovation development of those countries. As a developed country, The United States has the largest power of the economy and the technology and science in the world, so it could continue to be one of the world's largest manufacturers, and it could rank first in the world in the transportation, manufacturing sector and pipeline transport technology. As the fourth largest economy in the world, Germany's industrial, manufacturing, steel processing, mining, precision instrument, optics, and car departments are its pillar industry. France, which is a leading industrialized countries in Europe, it is ranked as the world's seventh largest economy with 39 of the 500 biggest companies in the world in 2010, and doing well in the infrastructure sectors, the railway, the electricity, the aircraft, the nuclear power and the telecommunications. China has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, which still dominates in the strategic "pillar" industries, such as the energy production and the heavy industries. All in all, The United States, Germany, France and China are all developed or developing in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field. In contrast, although Korea and Japan have advantages in the electronic industry and the auto industry, but limited by their size and resources, they do not belong to the heavy industrial countries so that the number of patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field are not in the dominant position. This is further evidence that a country's domestic distribution of granted patents in a technological field is affected by the various countries' domestic economic development and technical advantages. So there are different performances of the granted patents distribution in the eight technological fields in the different economy and innovation levels in countries, correspondingly, the role of the patent system should be treated differently in different technological fields and countries.
Through comparing the average maintenance time of granted patents in six countries, we can find that they are wide varies. The United States' average maintenance time of granted patents is the longest (12.7 years). The order of average maintenance times of granted patents in France, Japan, Germany, and Korea followed in turn are 10.2, 9.5, 8.8, and 8.4 years. However, the average maintenance time of granted patents in China is the shortest among the average maintenance time of granted patents by other six countries, which is only 7.3 years. The standard deviation is a measure of stability of numerical indicators, which is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A standard deviation close to 0 indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the average of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values. The average maintenance time of granted patents by the United States has the highest standard deviation among the six countries thanks to the patent renewal fee system in the United States, which is different from that of other five countries. The patent renewal annual fee system in the United States takes a four-year cycle, the patentee should submit patent renewal annual fee once every four years, which made the maintenance time in the United States stays in 4 years or 8 years arrangement, thus made its standard deviation bigger than others. The standard deviation of the average maintenance time of granted patents in China is only smaller than the United States but with the lowest average maintenance time, it shows that the maintenance time of granted patents in China is spread out over a wider range of values, which indicates that China has a great number of granted patents with lower maintenance time. The standard deviation of the maintenance time of patents granted by Germany ranks second (4.8) among the six countries. The standard deviation of the maintenance time of patents granted by Korea and Japan are lower than other countries.
The comparison of the average maintenance time of patents granted in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field by six countries indicates that the average maintenance times of patents granted in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field are consistent with the average maintenance time of all granted patents in each country. For example, the United State has the longest average maintenance time of all granted patents. Correspondingly, the average maintenance time of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field by the United States is longer than that of other countries; and the average maintenance time of patents granted by China is the shortest, correspondingly, the average maintenance time of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field by China is shorter than that of other countries. Besides, the average maintenance time of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field fluctuates up and down around the overall maintenance time of granted patents, and there is no consistent the variation. Therefore, the average maintenance time of granted patents in different technological fields is related to the management and application levels of granted patents in each country, and it is not influenced just by the technological field of granted patents.


4.3.2 Comparative Analysis of the Legal Status of Granted Patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting Technological Field in Six Countries
In this article, the patent legal status refers to a variety of situations occurred after being granted to be a patent, including the termination for failure to pay an annual fee or invalidated by other applicants or revoked by the court or expiration at the longest protection time. The patent legal status begins with authorization and ends with termination. It can reflect the maintenance situation of granted patents in the specific technological field in specific countries. Because the vast majority of patents were terminated for failing to pay the renewal annual fee, and other granted patents were invalided or revoked or expired, which all belongs to the termination status, in this article we do not distinguish with those status and all call them as the termination status. Then the termination and the expiration8 of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field by six countries are compared in this part. Assume the examination time of six countries are in the same level, if the expiry rates in a technological field are higher than that of other technological fields, it implies that the patentees may be expect more profit for those patents, further show that the patents in this technological field create more economic benefits for patentees and society. In other words, the patent system plays a more important role in the technological innovation.9

Table 4.3 indicates that the expired rate of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field are various widely across the six countries. The expired rate of granted patents in Japan is the largest (42.2 %) among the six countries. That means almost half of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field in Japan can be maintained to the length of the longest patent protection duration. The expired rate of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field in the United States is just lower than Japan, which is 27.7 %. The next is Germany, France, China and Korea in turn which expired rates are 18.1, 15.5, 14.0, 10.4 %. The analysis results show that the expired rate of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field in six countries are not as low as we thought.Table 4.3The legal status comparison of patents granted in the performing operations and transporting technological field in six countries U.S.AJapanKoreaGermanyFranceChinaExpirationNumber23928645151152110Percentage27.7 %42.2 %10.4 %18.1 %15.5 %14.0 %TerminationNumber623391387681830678Percentage72.3 %57.8 %89.6 %81.9 %84.5 %86.0 %Total862677432832982788

From the analysis of the average maintenance time and legal status comparison of patents granted in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field by six countries, we can conclude that the countries which have long maintenance time do not mean it will have a large number of patents which can maintain to the patent protection duration till to be terminated. For example, the average maintenance time of the United States is longer than Japan, but the number of patents which expired in the longest patent protection duration in Japan is bigger than that of them in the United States. And the average maintenance time of patents granted in Korea is longer than that of them in China, but the number of patents which expired in the longest patent protection duration in China is bigger than that of them in Korea. Because partly the maintenance time of granted patents represents the quality of patents, or put it another way that the longer of the maintenance time of granted patents, the greater impact on the patentee. While the expired rate refers to the patents that have high protection value, the higher expired rate means larger number of patents with high economic value. Therefore, the level of patent maintenance time has no absolute relationship with the rate of patent expires. Higher level of maintenance time do not equal to higher expired rate as the expired rate also involves the patent examination time. Under the same conditions, if the patent examination time is long enough, then even though patent's maintenance time is short, the patents might be still terminated in the longest protection duration.


4.3.3 The Distribution of Granted Patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting Technological Field in Six Countries in Different Maintenance Periods
To a certain extent the maintenance time of granted patents in the specific technological field not only reflects the length of the life cycle of a technology, but also reflects the period of expected earnings of patentees. The distribution of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field by six countries in different maintenance period can examine the value or function of the granted patents in the technological field. The longest maintenance time of granted patents in each country are all close to 20 years, so we divided the maintenance time of granted patents into four stages with five years as a period, and statistics the distribution rate of patent maintenance time in six countries in each period. Gaétan and Adam hold that results from a series of difference-in-differences regressions suggest that the increase in fees led to a weeding out of low-quality patents.10 So we can assume that under the same conditions, if the patent maintenance time is shorter, that means the lower of the patents quality and the smaller the values of the patents be. Therefore, if the numbers of patents in earlier periods are bigger than the later periods, it should demonstrate that the patents has much more economic value and deserve more protection.
When people decide whether to engage in an innovation activity, they'll consider both the gains and the risks.11 So we assume that only when the patentees have the expectation of the patent would bring economic interests for them, could the patentees pay the patent maintenance fee as the costs to exchange for the patent right. After a patent was granted, if the patent right can bring benefits beyond patent maintenance fee or the patentee had the expectation that the patent right would bring the benefits beyond the patent maintenance fees, the patentees will choose to maintain the patents. If the benefit cannot exceed the cost, the patentee would choose to terminate the payment, thus the reason why the patent cannot continue to be maintained. Although the maintenance time can't exactly equal to the patent quality, but at least it can prove that the patentee has a positive attitude to the patent's economic benefits. According to this theory, the countries that have high termination rate in 1-5 years period in Fig. 4.1 apparently do not have high patents value. The larger of the number of terminated patents in this period are the lower of the patents values of the innovation to the patentee or even to the country. At the same time, the larger of the number of the maintenance time of granted patents in the 16-20 years stages is, the greater the role of the patent system promoting innovation does.Fig. 1The distribution of patents granted in the performing operations and transporting technological field in six countries in different maintenance periods

Figure 4.1 shows that the termination rate of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field in six countries in the different maintenance periods are various. The termination rate of granted patents in higher period is higher than that of patents in the lower period in the United States. In other words, the vast majority of patents could maintain to 16-20 years till to be terminated. It indicates that the patentees who own patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field have positive attitude to the economic benefits of patents, and the number of patents with long maintenance time are bigger than the number of patent with short maintenance time. The trend of termination rates of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field in Japan and France in different maintenance periods is analogous. They all have a larger number in 6-10 years period and 11-15 years period, but a smaller number in 1-5 years period and 16-20 years period, while the number of granted patents terminated in 16-20 years period in Japan are far less than that of granted patents terminated at the same period in France, in that the examination time of granted patents by Japan is much longer than that of granted patents in other countries. This is the reason why the maintenance time of patents granted by Japan in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field are almost concentrate on 6-10 years period and 11-15 years period. The trend of termination rate of granted patents in China is consistent with Korea and Germany which is the termination rate decrease as the maintenance period growth. In particular the termination rates of granted patents in Korea and China at the lowest period (1-5 years period) are almost up to 50 %. Apparently, the granted patent quality in this technological field by Korea and China are not optimistic.



4.4 Conclusions
The technological field is an important indicator to reflect the patent maintenance time and evaluate the effectiveness of the patent system. In different technological fields, the number of patents application and the granted rate of patents in the specific period in countries are various. Therefore, the problem that how to evaluate the effectiveness of the patent system and how to effectively protect patents cannot be generally assessed, but rather does specific analysis in different technological fields. This book empirically investigates the maintenance time of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field in six countries from three aspects, which include the average maintenance time, the termination rate and the termination rate specifically, and the following conclusions could be drawn.
Firstly, it is different of the number of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field in six countries that the different political and economical environment in these countries led to these particular differences in technological innovation level and economy development, and these differences reflected the distribution of patent quantity. Namely the distribution of granted patents are relates to the situation of technology advantages.
Secondly, the maintenance time of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field in six countries are consistent with the maintenance time of granted patents in total technological field in six countries. The maintenance time of granted patents in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field fluctuates around the average maintenance time of granted patents in all technological fields in six countries. And the maintenance time of granted patents in the United States is the longest, while the maintenance time of granted patents in China is the shortest.
Thirdly, the order of expiration rates is not consistent with the order of maintenance times in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field of six countries. The patents granted by Japan have the largest rate of patents which be terminated till the longest time of patent protection period, while the patents granted by China has the smallest rate of that.
Finally, the termination rates of granted patents in higher period are more than that of the granted patents in the lower period in the Performing Operations and Transporting technological field in the United States. The termination rates of granted patents by Japan and France have the same trend: they all have a large number of granted patents in 6-10 years period and 11-15 years period, while they all have a small number in 1-5 years and 16-20 years. The termination rates of granted patents by China, Korea and Germany are consistent with the distribution which is the termination rate decrease with the period of maintenance time growth. However, almost half of grant patents by China and Korea were terminated in 1-5 years period. The reason brought about this phenomenon may be that there are different annual fee systems, different innovation ability, different technology benefits and even the different economic development in each country.

5.1 Introduction
The information of patent renewal is a critical index to measure the quality of patents in a country, which protect inventions and reinforce information reported to investors about the quality of inventions.1 The International Patent Classification System (IPC) was established by the Strasbourg Agreement in 1971, which divides technological fields into eight sections. IPC is a hierarchical language of independent symbols in the classification of patents. The quality of a patent is strongly and significantly correlated with the technological field. The Physics technological field belongs to the seventh section in IPC. The innovation research in this technological field is very important for the development of economy and the advancement of physics technology. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to found the difference of renewal information of patents in physics technological field granted by different countries.
Due to the locality of the patent system, there are different in the patent granted systems and the patent renewal systems in different countries. Yi Deng (2005) examined the joint patent designation-renewal behavior of the EPO patent applicants during 1978-1996, discovering that the European patents granted by the EPO are substantially more valuable than patents through the national route. The value of patent rights increases with the economics size of the country and has a modestly increasing return to scale. The model estimation also reveals significant institutional differences across different EPO member countries in patent protections and quantifies them.2 As technical characteristics in different technological fields may vary, for the patent renewal in specific technology area, Gronqvist (2009) discovered that there are large differences in values between technologies, and the higher level of patent protection can bring larger gains.3 Yongzhong Qiao (2011) believes that the patents maintenance time of the electricity technological field and the physics technological field are more than that of other technological fields.4 Shuang Song and Xiangdong Chen (2013) investigated the entire patents of information technological field granted by China from 1985 to 2009, and the results showed that the median survival period in information technological field is approximately 10.5 year, only 1 % patents maintain until expiration; the maintenance status of American applicants remains the best, while the overall maintenance period of Chinese applicants is the shortest.5 Xiaohui Cao, Yibing Duan through analyzed 1063 genetic engineering patents granted by US during 1991-1996, and founded that genetic engineering patents have a high renewal rate, and 61 % patents owned by large entities are renewed to full time and the average age is 13.65 years.6 Overview of the previous research found that there a few the research results for the comparative study of the patent renewal information in the specific technology granted by different countries, so the purpose of this research is to analyze the maintenance status of patents in the physics technological field granted by different countries.
As the advanced industrial counties, France and Germany have the strong technological innovation ability. According to the data, the research group has found that the maintenance time of patents granted by Germany is higher than that of other two counties. Comparative analysis of the maintenance status of patents granted by China, Germany and France are not only conducive to understanding the regularity of patent renewal in a specific technological field, but also find the capacity gaps of the patent management and utilization of patentees among different countries.


5.2 Data Collection and the Establishment of Database
In this book, all data from the database provided by State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China (SIPO), German Patent and Trade Mark Office (DPMA), French Industrial Property Office (INPI), 3838 samples were randomly extracted from patents granted by China, Germany and France in 1994,7 and the database of patents granted by China in 1994, the database of patents granted by Germany in 1994, the database of patents granted by France in 1994 were formed. Extracting physics selection patents data in the above data set, the database of the physics patents granted by China, Germany, and France in 1994 were formed. Based on this database, the claim number, the inventors number, the examination time and the maintenance time of granted patents in China, France and Germany will be researched.


5.3 Information Analysis of Granted Patents in Physics Technological Field in China, France and Germany

5.3.1 Analysis of the Claim Number of Granted Patents in Physics Technological Field in China, France and Germany
Claims are a part of a patent application that defines the scope of protection granted by the patent.8 The claim number includes the number of independent claim and the number of dependent claim, and it reflects not only the complexity of the technology protected by patents, also reflects the characteristics of the patentee claims composition and decision-making on the scope of protection. Figure 5.1 shows the distribution of the claim number of granted patents in the physics technological field in China, France and Germany.Fig. 5.1Distribution of the claim number of granted patents in physics technological field in China, France and Germany

Figure 5.1 indicates that the range of claim numbers of the granted patents in the physics technological field in China, France and Germany are large, and the minimum value of claim numbers are 1, the maximum value of claim numbers are 79, 62, 84 respectively. When the claim number of the granted patents in the physics technological field in China is 3, the percentage of patents in the physics technological field is largest, and account for 9 % of all granted patents in this technological field. When the claim number of granted patents is 10, the percentage of granted patents in the physics technological field in France is largest, account for 11.5 % of all granted patents in this technological field. When the claim number of granted patents is 6, the percentage of granted patents in the physics technological field in Germany is largest, account for 9.5 % of all granted patents in this technological field. These partly reflect the feature that patentee tend to protect patent right with less claim number of granted patents in the physics technological field in China. More uniformity trend is that the claim number of granted patents in this three counties concentrated on one to eighteen, when the claim number are greater than eighteen, the percentage of granted patents in the physics technological field are less than 2 %. The claim context and the claim number of a patent are decided by the characteristics of technological innovations. The reasonable context and the claim number of a patent should be able to meet the principle of full disclosure of the patent, maximize their scope of patent protection, and avoid the patent right are imitated by other people. Therefore, the claim number of patent is not better of more or less, but need on the basis of technical solutions to choose. What's interesting in this book found is that when the claim number are more than 18, the percentage of patents which granted in the physics technological field by China, France or Germany is extremely low. Therefore, even in different countries, as the complexity of technology has some characters in a specific technological field, the writing method of patent claims will also have a certain degree convergence. We may safely draw the conclusions from the above analysis that technical features of the Physics technological field make the large range of the claim number of patents for protection of patent rights, and the patentee tend to use less than 18 claims for their patent protection.


5.3.2 Analysis of the Examination Time of Granted Patents in Physics Technological Field in China, France and Germany
The examination time of patents refers to the time gap between the filing and granting date of patents. This period is the time to wait and review the application for patent in the patent office. Whether in China, France or Germany, a statutory protection period is twenty years from the date of filing and specific areas can be appropriately extended. The length of examination time of granted patents will not only affect the patent duration, but also affect the applicant's costs and the length of endurance, the greater the expected profit of applicants for patents is, the stronger the patentee's endurance for the patent examination time is, otherwise they will give up patent applications.9

Figure 5.2 shows that the range of the examination times of granted patents in the physics technological field in China, France and Germany are one to nine years, one to six years and one to seventeen years respectively. In other words, all the minimum value of the examination time of granted patents in the physics technological field in this three countries are one year, but the maximum value of the examination time in the physics technological field patents granted by China, France and Germany are nine years, six years and seventeen years respectively. And patents granted by Germany have the widest range of examination time. Figure 5.2, we note that the distribution of examination time of patents in the physics technological field granted by this three countries have two aspects in common: first, the examination time centralized distributed on three to five years, the largest percentage of the examination time of patents granted by China, France and Germany are three years (account for 29.5 %), four years (account for 34 %) and five years (account for 25.6 %) respectively; second, with the examination time increased, the percentage of granted patents first increased and then decreased.Fig. 5.2Comparative analysis of the examination time of granted patents in the physics technological field in China, France and Germany



5.3.3 Analysis of the Average Inventor Number of Granted Patents in the Physics Technological Field in China, France and Germany
The inventor number of each granted patent may reflect the complexity of patent and the investment of human resource for patent. Figure 5.3 shows the comparison of the average inventor number of granted patents in the physics technological field in China, France and Germany.Fig. 5.3Comparative analysis of the average inventor number of granted patents in physics technological field in China, France and Germany

Figure 5.3 shows that the distributions of average inventor number of granted patents in the physics technological field in three countries are basically same. With the average inventor number increased, the percentage of patents number all gradually reduced. When the average inventor number is one, the largest percentage of granted patents in the physics technological field in China, France and Germany are 42.2, 37.8 and 40.1 % respectively. So in the physics technological field, the cooperation rate of patent inventors is not high. The cooperation rate of patent inventors refers to the quantity proportion of the patents number that there are two or more than two inventors to all patents number.10 When the average inventors' numbers of patents are greater than or equal to six, the percentages of granted patents in these three countries are lower than 2 % of all granted patents in this technological field. The maximum values of average inventor numbers of granted patents in the physics technological field in China, France and Germany are thirteen, thirteen and ten respectively. The distributions of average inventor number of patents granted by these three countries are all concentrated on one to three. The highly consistent degree of distribution in the inventor number proved that the technical characteristics of a particular technological field have some rule for the characteristics of patent renewal information.


5.3.4 Comparative Analysis of the Interval Scale of Granted Patents in the Physics Technological Field in China, France and Germany
By comparing the mean values of each variable for patents in the physics technological field granted by China, France and Germany, we notice that the mean number of inventors of patents granted by this three countries are very close, but there are different of the mean number of claim, the examination mean time and the maintenance mean time (Table 5.1).Table 5.1Comparison of the interval scale of granted patents in the physics technological field in China, France, Germany Claim numberInventor numberExamination timeMaintenance timeChinaMean valueStandard deviation9.498.8642.211.5153.611.4168.125.414FranceMean valueStandard deviation11.38.5232.251.4733.981.09910.373.979GermanyMean valueStandard deviation9.727.3712.231.4835.092.1158.794.606

Table 5.1 shows the differences of mean values of claim number, the inventor number, the examination time and the maintenance time of granted patents in the physics technological field in China, France and Germany. Firstly, the maximum of average claim number of granted patents in the physics technological field in France is 11.3 items, but the mean value of claim number of granted patents in China and Germany are close, and the mean values are 9.49 items and 9.72 items respectively; Secondly, for the mean value of inventor number, there are a few different in the granted patents in the physics technological field in China, France and Germany, and the mean number of inventors are about two persons; Thirdly, the average examination time (5.09 years) of granted patents in Germany are more than that of granted patents by China and by France in the physics technological field, whose mean examination time are three years or so; Finally, the maximum of mean value of maintenance times of granted patents in the physics technological field in France is about 10.37 years, and the minimum value of the granted patents in the physics technological field in China is 8.12 years. In addition, there are different in the standard deviation of the average claim number, the average number of inventors, the average examination time and the average maintenance time of granted patents in the physics technological field in China, France and Germany.


5.3.5 Comparative Analysis of the Abandoned Patents Number in the Physics Technological Field Granted by China, France and Germany
The patent maintenance time refers to the length of time that patent from granted to abandon. It reflects the patent usage and management status, also reflects the duration of patents bring returns for patentees.11 So, we can use the variable "patent maintenance time" to research the difference of the value or quality of patents in the physics technological field granted by China, France and Germany. According to the patent maintenance annual fee system of China, we divide the maintenance time into one to three years, four to six years, seven to nine years, ten to twelve years, thirteen to fifteen years and sixteen to twenty years after patents were granted, and to analyze the abandoned patents number in the physics technological field granted by China, France and Germany in six maintenance periods.
Figure 5.4 shows that the trends of the distribution of abandoned patents in the physics technological field granted by China, France and Germany are different. With the maintenance time increased, the percentage of abandoned patents in the physics technological field granted by China presents the trend of increased after decreased first. When the maintenance time of patents granted by China is one to three years, four to six years, seven to nine years, ten to twelve years, thirteen to fifteen years and sixteen to twenty years, the percentage of abandoned patents is 27.7, 20, 15.9, 7.2, 13.7 and 14.5 % respectively. In the maintenance time of one to three years, the percentage of abandoned physics patents granted by China is the most to 27.7 %, and in stark contrast to the patents of granted by France, the percentage of abandoned patents in this period is 0, and the percentage of abandoned patents in the physics technological field granted by France presents the fluctuating trends with the maintenance time increased, when the patent maintenance time is thirteen to fifteen years, the percentage of abandoned patents is the maximum of all, account for 25.3 %. For the granted patents in the physics technological field in Germany, when the maintenance time of patents is one to three years, four to six years and seven to nine years, the percentage of abandoned patents gradually has increased, and when the maintenance time of patents is seven to nine years, the percentage of abandoned physics patents is the highest (24 %), but when the maintenance time of patents is ten to twelve years, thirteen to fifteen years and sixteen to twenty years, the percentage of abandoned patents in the physics technological field first increased and then decreased with the increasing of maintenance time. The distribution of abandoned patents in physics technological field granted by China, France and Germany indicates that when the maintenance time of patents are one to three years and sixteen to twenty years, the percentage of abandoned patents in the physics technological field granted by China is higher than that of patents granted by France and Germany, this partly reflects the maintenance time of patents in the physics technological field granted by China has the characteristic of two extremes distribution, while the distribution of maintenance time of patents granted by Germany and France are focused on four to six years, seven to nine years, ten to twelve years, thirteen to fifteen years, and their distribution are more balanced.Fig. 5.4Distribution of abandoned patents in the physics technological field granted by China, France and Germany




5.4 Conclusions
Although there are different patent systems in different countries, the convergence of technical characteristics make the closing gap of patent information of patents granted by different countries in a particular technology field. From the analysis results of the claim number, the examination time, the inventor number and the maintenance time of granted patents in China, France and Germany, conclusions can be drawn as following: first, different patent systems and patent management capabilities lead to different patent renewal information, but in the specific technological field, the difference will be shrink; second, the average number of claim, the average examination time, the average number of inventors and the average maintenance time of patents granted by China are lower than that of patents granted by France and Germany. Therefore, even if there are different patent systems in different countries and patentee has different abilities of patent management that can cause differences in patent maintenance, the consistency of the technical characteristics of a particular technological field will narrowed these differences. On the other hand, we should aware that as the policy stimulus and companies deepened the understanding of the importance of patents, filings of patent application in China fast-growing steadily in recent years, but compared to Germany, France and other industrial countries, the patent management ability and the ability to use patents of patentees in China are relatively inferior.

Abstract
The maintenance information of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions in China, Germany, France, and Japan are empirically analyzed, which shows that there are many differences in the maintenance time of the patents granted by them. The mean value maintenance time in the technical field of fixed constructions is shorter than that of other technical fields. In the technical field of fixed constructions, the maintenance time of patents granted by France is longer than that of patents granted by China, Germany and Japan; the maintenance time of patents granted by China is the shortest; the maintenance tendencies of granted patents are greatly various in different periods. As the maintenance time extends, the number of patents falls dramatically in China, but in Germany, the number of the patents falls gradually. Large proportion of patents granted by France and Japan are distributed in long maintenance periods.

6.1 Introduction
According to the list of top 250 international contractors released by the Engineering News-Recording (ENR) in 2014, 62 contracting enterprises are from China, 5 from Germany, 5 France, and 14 Japan.1 In terms of market revenue overboard, China, France, Germany, and Japan respectively ranked the second with $79.01 billion, the fourth with $50.74 billion, the fifth with $46.55 billion, and the seventh with $22.24 billion.2 In the international contracting market, contracting enterprises of China, Germany, France, and Japan are of great technical strength and large competitive advantages. It is widely accepted that the basis of technical strength holds the key to the competitive advantage, and patent is one of the important indicators of the technical strength.3 That was reason why we chose patents by China, German, France, and Japan in fixed constructions technical field to research technical strength in the construction industry. Through the cross-national comparative analyses of granted patents in this technical field, we expect to discover the difference of maintenance time of patents granted by these four countries, and reveal the competitive status of the technical strength in them.
The quantity and quality of patents symbolizes the technological development potentiality and the innovation capacity of a country.4 Scholars have made many important discussions about the relations between the maintenance time and the technical fields. Nakanishi, Yamada believed that an expiration rate of patents in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry is lower than that of other industries.5 Hall and Pakes discovered that the patent quality affects the maintenance time of patents.6 The maintenance time of granted patent is different among different technical fields.7 The patents in the technical field of chemistry and electricity have a higher maintenance rate.8 Nevertheless, according to the information that we search, the cross-national comparative analysis about the maintenance time of granted patents in the field of fixed constructions is still insufficient.


6.2 Data Collection and Variable Design

6.2.1 Data Collection
In this article, the data are collected from the patents granted by China, German, France and Japan in 1994. Because the number of patents granted by China in 1994 was 3838, we selected 3838 patents equidistantly from patents granted by German, France, and Japan for comparison. Then, we recorded the information of each patent's maintenance time and its technical field, which was input in the database of maintenance time of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constrictions.
The reason to use the information of the patents granted in 1994 is that in 2014, all of the patents granted in 1994 was out of the protection because of the expiration, no paying the maintenance fee or other reasons. Researching the patents granted in 1994 could lead the way for tracing the dynamic maintenance process of each patent.


6.2.2 Variable Design
The technical field in the article is concordant with the convection of the Strasbourg Agreement Concerning the International Patent Classification, which divides the patents into eight technical field categories: A (human necessities), B (performing operations), C (chemistry and metallurgy), D (textiles and paper), E (fixed constructions), F (mechanical engineering, lighting, heating, weapons and blasting), G (physics), H (electricity). The technical field of fixed constructions in this book falls under the fifth category: E (fixed constructions). The variable of "maintenance time" is the period from the date of authorization publication of a patent to the invalidation, termination or cancellation of the patent.



6.3 Comparative Analysis of the Maintenance Time of Granted Patents in the Technical Field of Fixed Constructions in the Four Countries
A patent maintained for a long time is considered to be high economic and technical value.9 The length of the patent maintenance time indicates the size of the patent commercial value to the right holders. If the patents could not generate enough profits for the patent holders, the right holders would not pay the maintenance fee to maintain the patents in a long period. To a specific technical field, the length of the patent maintenance time is not only an important manifestation of the technical strength and status of the patent holders, but also the capacity of independent innovation in that technical field for a country.

6.3.1 Comparative Analysis of the Mean Value of Maintenance Time of Granted Patents in the Technical Field of Fixed Constructions in the Four Countries
The mean value of patent maintenance time can comprehensively reflect the length of the maintenance time of patents granted by different countries, so it could be a useful tool to make cross-national comparative analysis about the maintenance time. With a statistical computing for patents granted by china, America, German, and Japan in 1994, we can get the results about the mean value of maintenance time in the following Table 6.1.Table 6.1The mean value of maintenance time of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions in the four countries Percent of FCTF (%)The mean value of maintenance time (years)Standard deviationINTFFCTFINTFFCTFCN2.197.306.165.154.70GE3.678.877.954.814.71FR3.0010.2110.294.194.52JP4.019.529.253.063.28
Note FCTF represents fixed constructions technical field; INTF represents the integral technical fields

Table 6.1 show that there are great differences in the mean value of the maintenance time of the granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions in China, German, France, and Japan. In these four countries, the mean value of maintenance time of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions in France is the longest (10.29 years). Its standard deviation is 4.52, which shows relatively poor stability on the maintenance time of granted patents in this technical field. The mean values of the maintenance times of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions in Germany and Japan are 7.95 and 9.25 years respectively. Their standard deviations are 4.71 and 3.28 respectively. In terms of the standard deviation, the stability in the maintenance time of patents granted by Germany is the worst, while the stability in the maintenance time of patents granted by Japan is the best. The mean value of maintenance time of granted patents by China is the least among the four countries, which is 6.16 years, and its standard deviation is 4.70, showing poor stability in the maintenance time.
Compared with the mean value of the maintenance time of the integral technical field, Table 6.1 reveals that the mean value of the maintenance time of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions in China, German, and Japan is shorter than that of the integral field. When it comes to France, the situation is different. The mean value of the maintenance time of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions in France is longer than that of the integral technical fields.
Compared with the patent number in other technical fields, the quantity of patents in the technical field of fixed constructions is much less than that of other technical fields. The percentages of patent number in the technical field of fixed constructions in four countries are all under 5 %. The comprehensive consideration of the mean value of the maintenance time and the percentage of patents together and take a further discussion, a thought-provoking conclusion could be drawn. Except for France, the higher the percentage of patents is, the longer the maintenance time is. The percentage of patents granted by Japan, German, and China descends orderly, and the mean value is 4.01, 3.67 and 2.19 % respectively. The mean values of the maintenance time of granted patents are consistent with the tendencies revealed by the percentage of patent number in the technical field of fixed constructions in four countries.


6.3.2 Comparative Analysis of the Distribution Trend of Different Maintenance Periods of Granted Patents in the Technical Field of Fixed Constructions in Four Countries
The distribution of the patents in different maintenance periods can provide an access to observing the process of dynamic variation and reflecting the maintenance tendency of the patents. In order to compare conveniently, in this book the maintenance time of patents are divide into seven sections: 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-15, 16-18 and 19-20 years after patents were granted. With the statistical computing for patents granted by China, German, France, and Japan in the technical field of fixed constructions, we can get the results about the maintenance tendency in different periods in the following Fig. 6.1.Fig. 6.1Distribution proportion of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions in four countries in different maintenance periods

In general, the higher the degree of technological innovation is, the longer the maintenance time of granted patents is. If more patents are distributed in longer maintenance periods, it would reveal that the quality of the patents in this technical field is relatively better than others. Figure 6.1 shows that there are obvious differences in the distribution trend in different maintenance periods of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions in four countries. A considerable proportion of the patents granted by German, France and Japan are more likely to be distributed in longer maintenance periods, while for the patents granted by China, the proportion is much smaller.
The distribution curve of granted patents number in the technical field of fixed constructions in China resembles a "slope". In different maintenance periods, with the maintenance time extends the patents number which maintained effectively falls dramatically. The quantity of granted patents, whose maintenance time is no more than 3 years, accounts for 36.14 % of the whole granted patents in China. And the percentage of granted patents distributed in the maintenance periods of 4-6, 7-9 years are 27.71 and 15.66 % respectively. The maintenance times of nearly 80 % of patents in the technical field of fixed constructions in China are less than 9 years. 8.43, 4.82, 6.02 and 1.20 % of all granted patents distributes in the periods of 10-12, 13-15, 16-18 and 19-20 years respectively. Figure 6.1, it is obvious that the proportion of granted patents that maintenance time is more than 10 years is pretty small in China.
The distribution curve of the number of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions by Germany resembles a "step plate". In different maintenance periods, with the maintenance time extends, the number of granted patents which maintained effectively falls gradually and irregularly. When the maintenance period is 7-9 years, the percentage of granted patents which maintained effectively is the highest (24.11 %). In the maintenance periods of 1-3 and 4-6 years, the maintenance proportion of granted patents are 19.86 and 23.40 % respectively. The maintenance time of 32.62 % of all granted patents is more than 10 years. Specifically in the periods of 10-12, 13-15, 16-18 and 19-20 years, the maintenance proportion of granted patents are 12.77, 10.64, 8.51 and 0.71 % respectively.
The distribution curve of the number of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions by France resembles a "hump yard". In different maintenance periods, with the maintenance time of granted patents extend, the number of granted patents which maintained effectively fluctuates dramatically. When the maintenance period is 4-6 years, the percentage of granted patents maintained effectively is the highest (28.70 %). The outstanding feature of distribution trend of the patents granted by France is that the maintenance rates of granted patents are still higher (19.13 %) in the periods of 13-15 and 16-18 years. The maintenance time of 48.70 % of granted patents are more than 10 years.
The distribution curve of the number of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions by Japan resembles a "trapezium". At the two ends of the maintenance periods, the maintenance rates of granted patents are rather small. In the maintenance periods of 1-3, 16-18 and 19-20 years, the maintenance rates of granted patents are 0.65, 1.95 and 0 % respectively. Apart from the two ends, the maintenance rates of granted patents fluctuate smoothly. The maintenance rates of granted patents in the maintenance periods of 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 and 13-15 years are 29.22, 25.97, 24.03 and 18.18 % respectively.



6.4 The Causal Analysis of the Difference of Maintenance Time of Granted Patents in the Technical Field of Fixed Constructions in Four Countries
The length of the maintenance time of granted patents is determined by many aspects. A series of factors contribute to the different results of the maintenance time of the patents granted by the four countries. In term of the external influencing aspects, the maintenance time of the patents is closely associated with the patent policy in a country. The difference of the specific arrangement of the patent policy leads to different characteristics of the maintenance trend. Firstly, the patent policy, especially the level of the patent maintenance fee, has a significant impact on the maintenance time.10 Compared with Germany, France, and Japan, the maintenance fee of China is relatively lower. Apart from the level of the maintenance fee, the payment method is also very different. In China and Japan, the patent holders need to pay the maintenance fee once a year, and the maintenance fee increases every three years. This kind of payment method may be conductive to the extension of the maintenance time. Secondly, various institutional environments of commercial operations of the patents in different countries give rise to the different situations of the maintenance time. The commercial operations of patent, such as license, assignment, and pledge, need the institutional arrangement by governments. Compared with Germany, France, and Japan, the commercial operations of the patents in China start relatively late because of the institutional deficiencies. Thirdly, the extent of the incentives provided by the government is also an important influencing factor for the maintenance time. In four countries, especially for China, besides the central government, the local governments usually provide the patent holders with subsidies, which may influence their patent maintenance strategies.
Besides the external aspects, the internal aspects need to be taken into consideration. The quality of patent and the ability of patent management of the patent holder are two important factors that influence the maintenance time. There are many honorable construction contracting companies in these four countries, such as the CRCC (China Railway Construction Corp.) and the CSCE (China State Construction Corp.) from China, Hochtief from Germany, Vinci, Bouygues, and Eiffage from France, and Taisei and Kajima from Japan. On top of these, there is one more important aspect that needs to be considered. The companies from Germany, France, and Japan, which were established earlier, thus enjoying a long process of development, have the advantages of accumulative technical strength and the capability of management related to patent. Though companies from China have been acquiring remarkable achievements since the 1980s, the process of technical accumulation is relatively shorter, and there is still a gap in the technical strength as against these three. Compounded by the lack of patent awareness, and their incompetent of the patent management and application, Chinese companies are unable to maintain patents for a long time.


6.5 Conclusion
Through researching the mean value of the maintenance time and the maintenance tendency of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions in China, Germany, France, and Japan, the following conclusions can be drawn.
The mean value of the maintenance times of granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions is shorter than that of granted patents in other technical fields. In the technical field of fixed constructions, the maintenance time of granted patents granted by France is longer than that of granted patents by other three countries. The maintenance time of patents granted by Japan and Germany are longer than that of patents granted by China. Different patent policies and commercial environments contribute to the diverse maintenance situation of granted patents in the field in four counties.
There are obvious differences in the distribution trend in different maintenance periods of the granted patents in the technical field of fixed constructions in four countries. With the maintenance time of granted patent extends, the number of the patents which maintained effectively falls dramatically in China. In Germany, the number of the patents maintained effectively falls gradually. The maintenance time of large proportion of patents granted by France and Japan are more than 13 years. The difference of the distribution curves of patents number in different counties come from the comprehensive function of multiple factors, such as different stages of economic development, policy arrangement, and others.

Abstract
The foreign priority is close related with the foreign patent. For foreign patents, the number of patents with foreign priority is far more than that of the patents without foreign priority. Because of the different innovation abilities and the unbalanced intellectual property development, the average maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority is shorter than that of the patents with the foreign priority granted by USA, Korea and Japan, while the average maintenance time of patents without the foreign priority is longer than that of the patents with the foreign priority granted by China.

7.1 Introduction
The patent1 priority right is a time-limited right, allowing the claimant to file a subsequent applicant for the same invention as of the date of filing the first application of patent within a certain period of time. It includes the foreign priority and the domestic priority. There are many differences in the periods and limits of priority of the domestic priority systems in USA, China, Japan and Korea, while the foreign priority systems of patent systems in many member countries of PCT are similar. So the foreign priority system only was discussed in this book. In these four countries, the foreign priority systems are established with the multilateral arrangement, the bilateral agreement and the relationship of mutual benefit. It means the claimant can files a subsequent applicant in another country for the same invention as of the date of filing the first application within 12 months.
A claimant of foreign priority usually files the first application of a patent at home country, and then files the subsequent application of this patent in other countries within the period of priority. It means that most foreign patents could file foreign priority rights. However, a few of foreign patents have no foreign priority right, which means they firstly file the applications of patent in foreign countries. Maybe there are two reasons of this phenomenon. One is that claimants are fail to firstly file the formal applications of patents at home country because their patent application were withdrawn, abandoned or rejected, and the inventions are still unknown to be published; the other is that claimants give up their first application of patent at home country by themselves, for example, the multinational company has a invention whose market in a foreign country, they would to give up the patent application at home country for saving money and filing the patent application in foreign country firstly.
Literature review shows that researches of patent maintenance focus on three parts. The first is the research on the length of patent maintenance time, for example, Zeebroeck found European patent granted rate was gradually slow down but the maintenance time become longer during 1980-2000.2 The second is the research on the affecting factors of patent maintenance time, for example, Scotchmer thought that the patent annual fee balances the patent maintenance cost and the patent maintenance profit3; Wu Hong, Fu Xiuying and Dong Kun compared domestic patent and Japanese patent granted by China in fuel cell field, and found that the macro factors of patents maintenance time doesn't absolutely influence a single technical field patent maintenance time.4 The last is the research on the relationship between the patent maintenance time and the patent quality, for example, Schankerman and Pakes thought the better the patent quality is, the longer the maintenance time is5; Zhu Xuezhong found that the average maintenance time of patents granted by China is shorter, which reflects the patent quality is inferior based on the maintenance time of patents granted by China.6 The researches on the foreign priority focus on two parts. One is from the practical view, for example, Eike Ullmann thought that a legitimate perception of right from priority must consider the interests of the patent applicant as well as the interest of the general public at same time.7 The other is from theoretical view, for example, Du Juan thought that the foreign priority is a right that independent from the patent application right in essence and its transfer has economic value in some situations.8

The basic purpose of the priority right is to safeguard, for a limited period, the interests of a patent applicant in his endeavor to obtain international protections for his invention, thereby alleviating the negative consequences of the principle of territoriality in patent law.9 In the period of priority, claimant can fully consider whether file a patent application in another country based on the cost of application and maintenance, or improve their inventions. From this perspective, we believe that the values and the maintenance time of foreign patents with foreign priority are higher and longer than that of patents without foreign priority. We try to compare the distributions of maintenance time of foreign patents without priorities in order to find the difference between the foreign patents without foreign priority and the foreign patents with foreign priority, based on the maintenance information of patents granted by USA, Korea, Japan and China.


7.2 Data Sources
The reason why choose the patents granted in 1994 is that it is a complete cycle of patent maintenance from 1994 to 2014. It can reflect developing trend of patents maintenance time. 3838 patents granted in 1994 by China were choosing from the patent search platform on the website of State Intellectual Property Office of the P.R.C.(SIPO) (ending on December 31, 2014). Then according to this patent information to establish the information database of patents granted by China in 1994. Chinese patent information database's size is smallest of the four countries, so we take 3838 patents as other three countries' database size. "information database of the patents granted by USA in 1994", "information database of the patents granted by Korea in 1994" and "information database of the patents granted by Japan in 1994" were established by the systematic method from patent search platforms of United States Patent and Trademark Office's website, Korean Intellectual Property Office's website and Japan patent office's website. The above four databases are the analysis basis in this book.


7.3 Data Analysis

7.3.1 The Distribution of Foreign Patents Without the Foreign Priority

7.3.1.1 The Quantitative Distribution of Foreign Patents Without the Foreign Priority
The quantity distributions of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by USA, Korea, Japan and China are shown in Table 7.1. Table 7.1 shows that the number of the foreign patents without the foreign priority granted in USA, China, Korea and Japan are 237 patents, 183 patents, 91 patents, 46 patents respectively, accounting for 6.18, 4.77, 2.37, 1.20 % of the total sample respectively. The number of granted patents without the foreign priority in Japan is more than that of granted patents without the foreign priority in USA and Korean, and the number of granted patents without the foreign priority in China is least. The number of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by China account for the highest percentage of the total patents without the foreign priority (10.26 %); the percentage of the granted patents without the foreign priority in USA and Korea accounting for the all sample are 10.15 and 4.68 % respectively. However, the percentage of the granted patents without the foreign priority in Japan accounting for the all sample only is 1.34 %. From the perspective of the sorts of foreign or domestic patents, the quantities of foreign patents granted by China, Korea, USA and Japan decreases gradually. What's more, only 394 foreign patents were granted by Japan in 1994, and this number of foreign patent is far less than that of other three countries. This is reason that the ratio of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by Japan is higher than that of patents granted by China and Korea. In a word, the quantities of foreign patents without the foreign priority are smaller in four countries.Table 7.1Quantitative distribution of foreign patents without the foreign priority Foreign patents without the foreign prioritySample patents (%)Patents without the foreign priority (%)Foreign patents (%)US2376.18233510.15167614.14KR912.3719464.6819344.71JP461.2034231.3439411.66CN1834.77178410.2622248.23

7.3.1.2 The Distribution of Technological Fields of Foreign Patents Without the Foreign Priority
Figure 7.1 shows the distributions of technological fields of foreign patents without the foreign priority in four countries. The foreign patents without foreign priority granted in USA, Korea and China are mainly distributed in field A (Agriculture), field B (Performing Operations and Transporting) and field C (Chemistry and Metallurgy). What's more, in field A (Agriculture), USA has the most patents (60 patents); China has 30 patents followed and Korea has the least, only 13 patents. In field B (Performing Operations and Transporting), USA, China and Korea have 58 patents, 48 patents and 20 patents respectively. In field C (Chemistry and Metallurgy), China has 59 patents which is far more than USA and Korea. While the distribution of technological fields of those patents granted in Japan are little different from above three countries, which is mainly distributed in field C (Chemistry, Metallurgy), field G (Physics), field H (Electricity) and field B (Performing Operations, Transporting). Even though those patents granted by Japan are mainly distributed in these three fields, the number of patents in these three fields are still less than other three countries, only are 11 patents, 11 patents, 8 patents and 8 patents respectively. Meanwhile, the four countries have same place that all of their patents are least distributed in field D (Textiles, Paper) and field E (Fixed Constructions). We could find that most of patents are distributed in the technological fields of A (Agriculture), B (Performing Operations and Transporting) and C (Chemistry and Metallurgy), while few patents numbers are distributed in the technological fields of D (Textiles and Paper) and E (Fixed Constructions) in four countries.Fig. 7.1The distributions of foreign patents without the foreign priority in technological fields in four countries



7.3.1.3 The Nationalities Distribution of Applicants Own Foreign Patents Without the Foreign Priority
Figure 7.2 shows the nationalities distributions of applicants own foreign patents without the foreign priority in four countries. In USA, the numbers of patents owned by applicants from Chinese Taiwan and Japan are far more than that of applicants from Germany and France. In Korea, the most of patents owned by Japanese applicants, and the number of patents owned by American is more than that of applicants from China, Germany, France and England, most of patents owned by American applicants in Japan. There are a little difference in the number of patents owned by English, German, Korean and Chinese. In China, the number of patents owned by American applicants and Japanese is far more than that of patents owned by German, English, Korean and French.Fig. 7.2Comparison of the nationalities distributions of applicants own foreign patents without the foreign priority in four countries

Such result indicates that American applicants and Japanese applicants own the most of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by four countries. The reason is that American and Japanese are keen on the patent international application at that time. In other words, the number of foreign patents with the foreign priority own by American and Japanese are more than that of foreign patents with the foreign priority own by other countries.



7.3.2 Comparative Analysis of the Maintenance Time of Foreign Patents Without the Foreign Priority
The sample patents are classified into domestic patents or foreign patents with the foreign priority and domestic or foreign patents without foreign priority. Foreign patents without the foreign priority are closely related with foreign patents with foreign priority, domestic patents without the foreign priority and total patent without the foreign priority. Table 7.2 shows the characteristic of maintenance times for foreign patents without the foreign priority.Table 7.2Comparison of the average maintenance time of four kinds patents Foreign patents without the foreign prioritySample patentsPatents without the foreign priorityAMTAMTBalanceAMTBalanceUS11.0812.66−1.5812.42−1.34KR7.058.4−1.358.49−1.44JP9.29.52−0.329.57−0.37CN7.427.30.125.142.28 Domestic patents without the foreign priorityForeign patents with the foreign priorityAMTBalanceAMTBalanceUS12.57−1.4913.05−1.97KR8.56−1.518.28−1.23JP9.57−0.378.720.48CN4.882.549.17−1.75

7.3.2.1 Individual Analyses of the Maintenance Time of Foreign Patents Without the Foreign Priority Granted by Four Countries
Figure 7.2 shows that average maintenance time (11.08 years) of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by USA is smaller than that of other three kinds of patents, and their balances are more than 1 year. The balance of average maintenance time in between foreign patents without the foreign priority and foreign patents with the foreign priority is the largest, while the balance of average maintenance time of between foreign patents without the foreign priority and patents without the foreign priority is the smallest. In a word, it is short for the average maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by USA, while the average maintenance time of foreign patents with the foreign priority is longer.
The situation of the average maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by Korea is similar with that of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by USA. The average maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority is 7.05 years. The balance of average maintenance times in between foreign patents without the foreign priority and the patents without the foreign priority is the largest, while the balance of average maintenance times of between foreign patents without the foreign priority and foreign patents with the foreign priority is the smallest. For the patents granted by USA, the situation is similar.
In Japan, the average maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority is 9.2 years. The balance of average maintenance times of between foreign patents without the foreign priority and other kinds of patents (except foreign patents with the priority) is smaller than that of corresponding patents granted by USA and Korea. Especially, the maintenance time of foreign patents with the priority is the shortest. Overall, the maintenance time of all kinds of patents is close, and the maintenance time of domestic patents is longer than that of foreign patents.
The situation of average maintenance times for four type's patents granted by China is opposite with that of patents granted by Japanese. The average maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority is shorter than that of foreign patents with the priority, but it is longer than that of other three kind's patent. The balance of average maintenance time of between foreign patents without the foreign priority and other kind's patents is larger. This phenomenon indicates that the average maintenance time of foreign patents is longer, while the maintenance time of domestic patents is shorter.
From the above facts, we could find that average maintenance times of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by USA, Korea and Japan are shorter, while the average maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by China is longer.


7.3.2.2 Comparative Analyses of the Average Maintenance Time of Foreign Patents Without the Foreign Priority Granted by Four Countries
Figure 7.2, the average maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by USA is the longest in four countries, because of the patent annual fee system in USA. The trends of maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority in USA, Japan and Korea are almost similar, meanwhile they have two differences. Firstly, the average maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted is longer than that of foreign patents with the foreign priority by Japan; however the average maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by Japan are shorter than that of foreign patents with the foreign priority by USA and Korea. Secondly, the balance of between the average maintenance time of this type and the average maintenance time of other types patents is smaller (0.37 years), while this data in USA and Korea are about 1.5 years. The situation of the average maintenance time of this type patents in China is different from other three countries, and it's opposite with Japan totally. What's more, the balances of between the average maintenance times of foreign patents without the foreign priority and other types patents are slight fluctuations in USA, Korea and Japan, but this balance in China vary wildly, and the range is from 0.2 to 2.54 years. The average maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority is shorter than that of foreign patents, which is similar with USA and Korea.
Because the maintenance time of domestic patents is relatively short, the situation of patents maintenance time in China is different from others. There are 1601 domestic patents without the foreign priority, accounting for 89.74 % of patents without foreign priority. The average maintenance times of these patents are only 4.88 years, which shorten the average maintenance times of the patents without the priority directly. What's more, the total maintenance time of domestic patents also is 4.89 years. Therefore the average maintenance time of all sample patents relatively shorter. It indicates that the average ability to use patents for patentees in China is poorer than that of foreign patentees. So we suggest Chinese patentees should convert patents into productivity actively, rather than just take the patents as an honor.




7.4 Conclusion
Comparative research on foreign patents without the foreign priority helps us know the difference between this patents' maintenance time and other kinds of patents' well, meanwhile help us know more about the influence for the foreign priority on the patent maintenance time. From above analysis, we could find that the quantities of foreign patents without the foreign priority in USA, Korea and Japan are smaller. Most of this type patents distribute in technological field A (Agriculture), B (Performing Operations and Transporting) and C (Chemistry and Metallurgy, and the majority of applicants of this type patents are from American and Japanese. The maintenance times of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by USA, Korea and Japan are relatively short, while the maintenance times of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by China is relatively long.
The maintenance situations of foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by USA, Korea and Japan are almost similar, but it is different for foreign patents without the foreign priority granted by China. This phenomenon maybe relate to the unbalanced development of intellectual property in different countries. American and Japanese have stronger innovation abilities, and the awareness to protect their inventions. What's more, their well-developed international trades also encourage them to apply for the PCT patents. But in China, the innovation abilities and the awareness of intellectual property protection are relatively weak in that time. Of course, with the perfection of intellectual property system and the reinforcement of intellectual property protection awareness, the gaps of average maintenance time of foreign patents without the foreign priority China and other countries might be narrowed shorten.



Footnotes


1


There are different for the definition of patent in different countries. In China, it includes invention patent, utility model patent and design patent, while in USA, it includes invention patent, plant patent and design patent and in Japan and Korea it only refers to a invention patent. When patents granted by these four countries comparatively researched, it is essential to unify patents type. So in this book, patent only refers to the invention patent and foreign patent refers to the invention patent owned by foreign patentee.

Abstract
Based on the maintenance and examination information of granted 3838 patents in 1994 by SIPO, this paper draws some conclusions after concrete analysis. Firstly, the maintenance time is negatively related to the examination time. Secondly, the maintenance times of most patents are 1-3 years and the examination times of most patents are 2-5 years. Thirdly, when the examination time of a patent is between 2 and 5 years, the maintenance time of this patent will be longer, especially in 4 years, compared to other examination time. Then, this paper researches the reasons of above conclusions from the point of patent protection period, the financing policy, the market conditions and the patent censor system. In the end, this paper makes suggestions how to extend maintenance time of patent.

8.1 Introduction
Since patent system has been implemented in China from 1985, the patent work has realized leapfrogging development. Since the utility model patent and design patent can be granted without substantive examination, the influence factor of the utility model patent and design patent maintenance time always is random. So in this paper, patent only refers to the invention patent. According to statistics, SIPO has accepted 4580173 applications of domestic patents by October 2015 with year-on-year growth of 22.4 % in 2014. Meanwhile SIPO has accepted 1479850 applications of foreign patents with year-on-year growth of 5.3 % in 2014. By October 2015, the domestic valid patent quantity is 877535, while the foreign valid quantity is 538991. The domestic quantity of application, authorization, increment and validation is far better than in foreign countries. In conclusion, China has become a patent country.
The quantity of patent doesn't represent the quality of patent. The maintenance time is a significant standard of the quality of patent. First, sign into the State Intellectual Property Office of P.R.C. website, the United States Patent and Trademark Office website, the German Patent and Trademark Office website, the French Industrial Property Office website, the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service website and the Japan Patent Office website, then isometric randomly chose 3838 patents granted in 1994 from six countries, finally count the maintenance time of 3838 patents from every country. The analysis results show that the quantity of patent, the maintenance time of which is over ten years, is 1156 in China, 2485 in America, 1602 in German, 1986 in France, 1485 in Korea and 1957 in Japan by the end of 2014. It can be seen that the quantity of patent that the maintenance time is over ten years is obvious lower than other developing countries. Therefore, China still is not a powerful patent country. We must intensive research how to extend the maintenance time if China wants to bloom into a powerful patent country.
The maintenance time is influenced by multiple factors, the research literature from home and abroad is rarely so that we could not find literature which analyzes the relationship between examination time and maintenance time and reasons behind the relationship.
A literature published in China has put forward the influence factors of the maintenance time of patent. There are the patent information, the degree of patent commercialization, the patent system, the patent authorized institution, the patent management and the patent strategy. All of these influence factors primarily include the country of holder, the mold of holder, the techno-sphere, the patent family, the annual fee of patent, the scope of patent protection and so on.1 A literature has drawn a conclusion that the examination time is inversely proportional to the number of years that the right of patent is invalid due to the annual fee. When the examination time decreases 1 year, the maintenance time will increase 0.128 year.2 Brown and Harhoff researched the relationship between the country of holder and the maintenance time of patent.3
, 4 Nakanish researched the relationship between the techno-sphere and the maintenance time of patent in 2008.5 Liua researched the relationship between the patent family and the maintenance time of patent in 2008.6 Gronqvist researched the relationship between the mold of holder and the maintenance time of patent in 2009.7 However, there is still no one analyze the reasons between the maintenance time and the examination time specially.
Based on the research of predecessors, this paper will analyze the relationship between the maintenance time and the examination time, and then we will analyze the reasons behind the relationship, so that we can obtain the methods how to extend the maintenance time of patent.


8.2 Data Sources
The number of patents application of three-kind patents averagely increase 20 % above every year. The number of application and authorization of three-kind patents achieved 2377000 and 1313000 in 2013. In order to analyze the relationship between the maintenance time and the examination time, if we statistics the data one by one, the workload will be heavy. So the data bases on patents granted in one year.
First, sign into the State Intellectual Property Office of P.R.C. website, and then isometric randomly chose 3838 patents granted in 1994, finally count the maintenance time and the examination time of 3838 patents by the end of 2014 as the samples. On the one hand, we can research the whole process of protection and the reason of invalidation of patent because that the duration of patent is 20 years, so that we can reach the result of the relationship between the maintenance time and the examination time. On the other hand, the data of 2014 is new.


8.3 The Relationship Between the Examination Time and the Maintenance Time of Patents
Based on the literature review, the relationship strength on the examination time and the maintenance time of patents were concluded. However, the linear-regression analysis was established on the macro-perspective. This paper mainly analyzes the relationship on the micro-perspective.

8.3.1 Based on the Perspective of the Percentage Variation of the Patent Number
The analysis on the relationship bases on the every patent number under different maintenance time as a percentage of the total patent number under different examination time. For example, when the examination time is one year, the patent number when the maintenance time is over ten year as a percentage of the total patent number, can reflect the possibility that the maintenance time is over ten year under different examination time. The higher the percentage is, the longer the maintenance time is. So if there is a negative linear correlation between the examination time and the maintenance time of patents, the percentage will be lower when the examination time is longer.
Figure 8.1 mainly analyzes the percentage variation of patent number when the maintenance time is over 10 and 15 years. The reason is that the maintenance time from 10 to 15 years belongs to the transitional period, and the maintenance time which is over 15 years is relatively long.Fig. 8.1The percentage variation of patent number when the maintenance time is over 10 or 15 years

Figure 8.1, whatever the maintenance time is over 10 years or 15 years, the trends of the percentage are down. So we can conclude that the examination time is negative relative with the maintenance time. Second, the trend of the percentage when the examination time is 3 years appears rise but still is down after the rise under the variation curve that the maintenance time is over 15 years, which does not reflect the negative relationship. Third, whatever the maintenance time is over 10 years or 15 years, the percentage is under 50 %, which reflect that the patent which the maintenance time is over 10 years is not much. So the maintenance time in China is not long.


8.3.2 The Relationship Analysis Between the Maintenance Time and the Examination Time of Patents Based on the Perspective of the Variation of the Patent Number
Above mentioned analysis shows that the examination time is negative with the maintenance time, and the possibility that the maintenance time is 15 years will be higher when the examination time is 3 years from the perspective of the percentage variation of the patent number, and the maintenance time is not long for the whole. Now, we analyze the patent number under different examination times fewer than two circumstances that the maintenance time within 10 and over 10 years. The greater the patent number is, the longer the maintenance time is. The relationships are showed in Figs. 8.2 and 8.3.Fig. 8.2The variation of the patent number when the maintenance time is within 10 years
Fig. 8.3The variation of the patent number when the maintenance time is above 10 years

Figure 8.2, when the maintenance time is within 10 years, the patent number under different examination time shows the trend to rise first and then fall. On the one hand, when the examination time is 2-5 years, the patent number under different maintenance time all along is much than other examination time, which reflects that the examination time assembles in 2-5 years whatever the maintenance time is. On the other hand, when the maintenance time is 1-3 years, the patent number under different examination time all along is much than other maintenance time, which reflects that the maintenance time assembles in 1-3 years whatever the examination time is.
Figure 8.3, the first variation of the patent number is not obvious but then appears up and down significantly when the maintenance time is over 10 years. As the examination time is 2-5 years, the patent number when the maintenance time is 15-19 years is more than other maintenance time, which reflect the possibility that the maintenance time is over 15 years is maximum when the examination time is 2-5 years.


8.3.3 The Relationship Analysis Between the Maintenance Time and the Examination Time of Patents Based on the Perspective of the Examination Time within 2-5 Years
Figures 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3, we can conclude that the examination time of patents assembles within 2-5 years and the possibility that the maintenance time is over 15 years is maximum. The maintenance time of patents assembles within 1-3 years. Now, we begin to analyze the relationships from the perspective that the patent number under different maintenance time as a percentage of the total samples. The total samples are 3631 except for the invalid samples. Because the cardinal number of percentage is the total samples, so the higher the percentage is, the higher the possibility that the maintenance time appears under one examination time is. The relationships can be showed in Table 8.1.Table 8.1Patent number every examination time correspond to under different maintenance timeETMT1%2%3%4%5%1-4250.7258739410.837710.42627.25-8210.61343.721762456.71423.99-12170.5802.21193.31514.2802.213-1650.1701.9992.71734.81123.117-19100.3571.6942.60000Total782.259916.492325.494626.159616.41-46%7%8%9%  5-81413.9551.590.2130.4  9-12922.5371290.8140.4  13-16491.3210.610.100  17-19200.680.20000  Total00000000  1-43028.31213.3391.1270.8  
Note ET the examination time of patents; MT the maintenance time of patents

First, the examination time which the top four percentage of patent number correspond to is 3, 4, 5 and 2 years, the maintenance time all is within 1-3 years, which reflects that the examination time always within 2-5 years and the maintenance time always within 1-3 years.
Second, when the examination time is 2-5 years, the percentage of patent number is over 2 %. When the maintenance time is 13-19 years, the percentage is over 3. All of this reflects that when the examination time is within 2-5 years, the possibility that the maintenance time will be within 13-19 years is higher.
Thirdly, when the examination time is 1, 6, 7, 8 and 9 years, the percentage of the patent number all appear the circumstance that the percentage is below 1 %, and when the maintenance time is 13-19 years, the percentage is all below 0.7 %. It thus appears that when the examination time is 1 and within 6-9 years, the possibility that the maintenance time will be within 13-19 years is lower.
Finally, when the examination time is 4 years, the percentage (except for the top four percentage) is higher than the percentage under the other examination time which the different maintenance time correspond to, and the percentage all is above 4 %. It shows that the possibility that the examination time is 4 years is biggest, and the maintenance time is smallest under this examination time.
It follows from this that when the examination time is within 2-5 years, the possibility that the maintenance time will be within 1-3 years is maximum, which reflect that the maintenance time of China is short as a whole. When the examination time is 4 years, the possibility that the maintenance time is long reaches the maximum.



8.4 The Analysis on the Reasons of the Relationship Between the Examination Time and the Maintenance Time of Patents
We always base on the patent system and the essence of the patent if we analyze the reasons of the relationships between the examination time and the maintenance time. A patent always undergo four-phase procedure that is the application, the examination, the authorization and the employment which the policy and technology market have a far-reaching influence on. So this paper analyzes the reasons from the perspective of the term of the protection, the policy support, the technology market and the censorship.

8.4.1 The Perspective of the Patent Protection Term
The term of patent protection in China is 20 years, which calculated from the date of the application. The maintenance time of patent is calculated from the date of the authorization. The examination time is calculated from the date of the application. So the sum of the examination time and the maintenance time is 20 years. Except for other influencing factors, the relationship under ideal condition between the examination time and the maintenance time can be showed by Fig. 8.4.Fig. 8.4The ideal relationship between the examination time and the maintenance time

The examination time refer to the duration from the date that the technology solution is applied to the date that the technology solution is granted. The maintenance time refer to the duration from the date that the patent is granted to the date that the right of patent is abandoned or invalidated or terminated. The longer the examination is, the shorter the date from the authorization date to invalidation date is. Hence, the maintenance time is inevitably negative with the examination time from the perspective of the term of the protection. This verifies that when the maintenance time is above 15 years, the initial point of the examination time that the patent number is 0 is 6 years, and when the maintenance time is above 10 years, the initial point of the examination time that the patent number is 0 is 9 years in Fig. 8.1.


8.4.2 The Support Perspective of the Patent Policy
The intellectual property law is regarded as a benefit distribution, law choice and integration between the monopolized interest of the intellectual property owner and the public interest. The patent fee is one of the most direct embodiments of this. The applicant can be access to exclusive rights by paying a fee.
In order to apply for or maintain the patent, we should pay the patent fees which include application fee, licensing fee, annual fee and agent fee. The annual fee not is invariable but terraced increase as the growth of the protective time. The first 3 annual fees can be maximum reduction of 85 % for personage and 70 % for enterprise. Meanwhile, local government subsidizes various innovative subjects to apply patent by fiscal appropriation which leads to the reduction of the cost of the patent application, sometimes even overflow the cost. When the applicants make a profit from the fiscal appropriation about patent, the motivation of applicant will be change. They will apply patent for profit not for the protection of the technology market. In such a motive of domination, the applicants maybe take advantage of the loophole of system and policy to apply crap patent which has no innovative content.
According to the balance payments theory, due to the policy breaks and government funding, some patents can't make profit from market, but patent holder will continue to maintain the patent to be valid because the cost is lesser than profit after the various supports. This verifies that whatever the examination time is, the maintenance time of most patent will be within 2-3 years, and the possibility that the examination time is within 2-5 years is relatively high and the maintenance time of this patent is mostly within 1-4 years in Fig. 8.2 and Table 8.1.


8.4.3 The Perspective of the Patent Market
In the situation of marketing economy, large collection of patents has formed the huge patent market which refers to the market mainly through patent as commodity trading. In 2005, Jilin, Wuhan emerge "patent supermarket" which tries to settle the problem of patent market exports. In 2006, in order to cultivate patent market and market service system of patent technology transfer, trade and implement the transformation, SIPO developed the national patent technology exhibition transaction platform project and approved a batch national patent technology exhibition center so that there could be a high integrity and low cost of the permanent show trading place for inventor and investor.
The patent as a technical solution is to settle the technical problem. It is operational and practical. Who own the exclusive right of a technology, who will be the market leader of this field of technology? The possibility that this patent forms a new technology market will rise greatly if a patent is accessible to transfer. Therefore, which technology solution can be authorized firstly that settles the some technology problem, the possibility that it occupies the market will be higher and the prospect benefit will be higher.
The overlong examination time tends to make a technology confront the crisis of being eliminated by market when this technology is authorized so that this patent can't achieve higher prospect benefit. In the end, this patent can't maintain the balance of payments. The maintenance time mainly depends on the result of balance of payments. The longer the examination time is, the shorter the maintenance time is, and the prospect benefit will decline. Whether continue to maintain the patent exists certain risks. When the prospect benefit decline, the risk will increase and the possibility that the patent holder continues to maintain will decline. This verifies the reason why the examination time is negative with the maintenance time.


8.4.4 The Perspective of the Examination System
According to the article 34 and 35 of patent law, the longest date of the preliminary examination calculated from the date of application is 18 month, and substantive examination is conducted within 3 years calculated from the date of application. So the date from the application to authorization as a general rule will be within 5 years which verifies that the reason why the percentage is 84.4 % when the examination is within 2-5 years in Table 8.1. In addition, the larger the cardinal number is, the greater the possibility that the maintenance time is long is, which verifies that when the examination time is within 2-5 years, the possibility that maintenance time is within 13-19 years is greater than other examination time.
The patent law just provides the date of preliminary examination and the starting time of substantive examination, the date of substantive examination is not provided. The influence factors of examination time have application document, the efficiency of the censors, audit program and the patience of applicant. The factors will indefinitely delay the date of substantive examination which leads to abnormal situation that the examination time is above 5 years. The patent percentage when the examination time is above 5 years just is about 13.7 % in Table 8.1. The possibility that the examination time is above 5 years is low, so the possibility that the maintenance time is long is low. For the same reason, the patent percentage is 2.15 % when the examination time is 1 years in Table 8.1, constrained the date of patent examination and the skill of patent examination, so the possibility that the maintenance time is long is low.



8.5 Conclusion and Enlightenment
The maintenance time is a mirror of the patent strengthens of one country and it's important for China to become a patent power country. In conclusion, the sum of the examination time and the maintenance time is 20 years, so the negative relationship necessary being between them. Secondly, most patents maintain within 3 years and the examination time mainly is within 2-5 years. Thirdly, the probability that the maintenance time is long will be higher when the examination time is within 2-5 years. Finally, the probability that the maintenance time is long will be highest when the examination time is 4 years.
Due to the sum of the examination time and the maintenance time is 20 years, with other conditions unchanged, so the longer the examination time is, the shorter the maintenance time is. If we want to extend the maintenance time, what we can do is to shorten the examination time. But it not means to infinitely shorten the examination time because of the reality, which the patent has strong technicality, so novelty, invention and practical application is necessary to be examined. Due to the limited skill of examination, SIPO can't finish examination in a short time. Hence, we should avoid the unlimited extension of examination time because of the influence factors apart from the patent technology itself. Then, it is good to control the examination time within 2-5 years, which can extend the maintenance time. How to avoid unlimited extension of examination time can be showed by following points.
In the matter of audit program, we propose revise the patent law so that the date of examination is explicitly stipulated. It is sensible to supervise the patent examination effectively by legal restraint so that we can avoid the contraction of maintenance time due to the excessive time of examination and the depression of market.
In the matter of examiner, we suggest that establish and improve system of examiner. We can establish the test system of examiner like the National Patent Agent Qualification Examination. The examiner should improve the quality of their professional competence and strengthen professional conduct. The crap technology should be put outdoor of patent from the source.
In the matter of patent application, patent ability should be strictly regulated and the applicant scope should be strictly limited. The patent application must be carried out by specialized patent agency institute, which can avoid the extension of examination time due to the problems that the applicant is blind to application process and the application document is not comprehensive enough.
To sum up, we can redefine and improve the system of audit program, examiner and patent application lead to avoid the extension of examination time due to the reason of non-patented technology itself. Consequently, the maintenance time of patent is extended to some extent.

9.1 Introduction
The new generation information technology industry is one of the seven major strategic emerging industries in China.1 As a mode of technological cooperation in enterprises, patent licensing also more and more are adapted by enterprises. The research results of the patent cooperation are mostly about the patent cooperation of countries under the economic globalization environment,2 Network co-op3 and the speed and dissemination of the network technology innovation.4 These researches of patent licensing mainly concentrated on the domains of the patent licensing evaluation index,5 the development of the cooperation of pattern patent race6 and how to avoid the patent licensing risk of enterprises,7 etc. Some scholars also studied the technical standards of the patent licensing revenue in communications industry,8 the problem of monopoly agreements and the patent cross-licensing.9 However, there are a few of works to analyzing the situation of enterprise cooperation from the patent licensing cases in the particular industry. Therefore, this book will analyze the patent licensing data of the enterprises cooperation progress in the new generation information technology industry, then draw some conclusions for improve the using ability of intellectual property of enterprises and promote the development of the new generation information technology industry.


9.2 Data Sources and Research Methods
In this book, the patent licensing data come from the record information of the patent licensing contract and the service platform of patent information published by State Intellectual Property Office in China (SIPO) (http://​search.​cnipr.​com/​). The specific methods are input "2009-2013" in the publication date of legal status bar, input "licensing" in legal status bar, then according to these result to retrieve the specific information of the new generation of information technology industry.
According to the "the Top 100 Electronic Information enterprises in China in 2012" announced by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in China, and referencing the main business direction of enterprises, select Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (abbreviation "Huawei"), Lenovo Mobile Communication Technology Co., Company (abbreviation "Lenovo"), ZTE Corporation (abbreviation "ZTE") and Datang Telecom Technology Group (abbreviation "Datang") from the new generation of information technology industry as representatives enterprises, analyze the trends of patent licensing volume, the licenses objects, and study the patent cooperation of enterprises in the new generation information technology industry.


9.3 Data Analysis

9.3.1 The Developing Trends of Patent Licensing in Four Representative Enterprises
From the number of patent licensing of Huawei, Lenovo, ZTE and Datang (Table 9.1), the following two trends could be found: first, the patent licensing number show the wavy declining trend in three companies, except Lenovo; second, the patent licensing number is increasing yearly in Lenovo. In particular Lenovo had no the patent licensing records in 2009 and 2010, there is a small amount of patent licensing began to appear gradually in 2011, and then surged in 2013.Table 9.1The number distribution of patent licensing of four representative enterprises 20092010201120122013Huawei2361010ZTE4731351Lenovo0051568Datang94712

The quantity surging of patent licensing is related to the technical cooperation of Lenovo with the Dolby Company in 2013. According to the record information, almost all patent licensing of Lenovo are from the Dolby Laboratories. The cooperation of the Dolby and Lenovo launched in the strong entertainment function and theater audio experience of PC products in 2005, but the true cooperation of patent licensing between the Dolby Laboratories and Lenovo began in June 2012. After that, Lenovo used the fourth generation advanced technology of Dolby home theater or the second generation of Dolby PC audio technology on products such as ThinkPad, Think Centre, Idea Pa and Idea Centre, so as to make the surge of patent licensing in Lenovo in 2013.


9.3.2 The Distributions of the Patent Types to Licensing in Four Representative Enterprises
Except ZTE have five design patents in patent licensing, patent licensing of other three enterprises are invention patent or utility model patent. In other perspective, the patent types to licensing can be dividing into the product patent, the process patent, and the product and process patent. The distributions of the patent types to licensing of four representative enterprises are very different (Table 9.2).Table 9.2The distributions of patent types to licensing of four representative enterprises HuaweiLenovoZTEDatangThe product and process patent22272311The process patent1118238The product patent743234

From Table 9.2, we can draw a feature of the distributions of the patent types to licensing of four representative enterprises, namely, the patent types to licensing of Huawei and Datang involve the product patent and the process patent mainly, the patent type to licensing of Lenovo involves the product patent mainly, and the proportion of the patent types to licensing of ZTE is a little different, which involve the product patent, the process patent, and the product and process patent. The main reasons are related to the business distribution of these enterprises. The business of Huawei include the products and solutions covering the mobile, the broadband, the IP, the optical network, the telecommunication value-added services and terminals and so on, which are committed to providing full IP integration solution, so the process patent are more than the product patent in Huawei. Lenovo, the leadership of global PC market enterprises, mainly produces the desktop computers, the servers, the laptop computer, the printer, the PDA, the motherboard, the mobile phones and other goods, so the type of patent licensing more focus on the product patent. ZTE is the global leader of the solutions providers of integrated communications, and the world fourth largest mobile phone manufacturers, so the proportion of two business pieces is equal. This reflects that the proportion of the product patent and the process patent of patent licensing are equal too; Datang's main business domain includes the communication terminal industry and the coordination with the communication terminal applications and services industry, so the content of the patent licensing also involves the product patent and the process patent. This shows that the patent types to licensing of enterprise are related with their main business domain.


9.3.3 The Licensor or Licensee Distribution of Patent Licensing in Four Representative Enterprises
According to the licensor or licensee distribution of patent licensing in four representative enterprises (Table 9.3), we can find the similarities and differences between the models of licensing patents.Table 9.3The licensors or licensees distribution of patent licensing in four representative enterprises HuaweiLenovoZTEDatangLicensor4036730Licensee08520

Huawei and Datang all are licensors in their patent licensing. The licensees of patent licensing is not fixed in Huawei, most of which are companies of Guangdong province. Huawei is the second largest communication equipment supplier and the third largest smart phone manufacturer in the world, and the domestic amount of patent licensing reduced yearly. The situations of patent licensing in Datang mostly are the patent licensing within the enterprise, which is inseparable with the complex internal structure in Datang. All of patent licensing in Datang are subordinate enterprises of the Datang group, which mainly include the xi'an Datang Telecom Co., Ltd., the Datang Mobile Communication Equipment Co., Ltd., the Datang Microelectronics Technology Co., Ltd., the Datang Telecom Technology Co., Ltd., Telecommunications Institute of Science and Technology and Datang Microelectronics Technology Co., Ltd. The licensees are also inside companies of the Datang group, including the Datang Telecom Technical Services (Tianjin) Co., Ltd., the Datang Telecom Communication Terminal Manufacturing (Tianjin) Co., Ltd., the Datang Telecom Technology Industry Holding Co., Ltd., and the Fourth Telecommunications Institute of Science and Technology, in addition to the licensing patents in Datang have 2 pieces of other companies, they are the Shanghai Feili Communications Technology Industrial Company and Guangzhou Mingsen Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Co., Ltd.
Most of licensing patents in ZTE are licensing others to use, including 81 % of the total amount of licensing patents are the permission to internal company, and the other companies accounted for only 19 % of licensing patents. The licensor of licensing patents in ZTE all are ZTE co., LTD., except 2 pieces of licensing patents are licensed for the Italian interest thinking co., LTD. Therefore, the internal licensing type of patents in ZTE is more important than that of licensing patents with other enterprise.
However, the licensors or licensees distribution of patent licensing of Lenovo are very different with that of other enterprises. Three pieces patents are licensed the Lenovo Mobile Communication Technology Co., Ltd., Lenovo Mobile Communications Software (Wuhan) Co., Ltd. The rest of the 85 pieces patents licensed to use of others, and licensees are fixed to the Dolby Laboratories licensing Company and the Dolby International Company, including 33 pieces are the Dolby Laboratories Licensing Company and the Dolby International Companies, which licensed the Lenovo Mobile Communication Technology Co., Ltd., 52 pieces is the Dolby Laboratories Licensing Company and the Dolby International Company Licensed Lenovo (Beijing) Co., Ltd. The Dolby Laboratories Licensing Company and the Dolby International Company mainly invented the noise reduction technology and the voice compression coding technology, etc., in accordance with the proportion of products patent in Lenovo.



9.4 Conclusions
Based on the perspective of patent licensing to analyzing the technology cooperation is of significance. Through the empirical analysis of patent licensing in four representative enterprises of the new generation of information industry in China in 2009-2013, we can draw the following five conclusions: first, the amount of patent licensing shows the wave downward trend in the three companies; second, the patent types to licensing of Huawei and ZTE are major in the product and process patent, the patent type to licensing of Lenovo is major in the product patent, and the proportion of the patent types to licensing of ZTE is a few difference; third, most of patent licensing in ZTE are the enterprise internal licenses; the patent licensors in Lenovo and Datang are relatively fixed; the licensees of patent in the Huawei are not fixed.

10.1 Introduction
The next-generation information technology industry is one of the seven major strategic emerging industries in China.1 With the development of the next-generation of information technology industry, the cooperation mode of patents in enterprises become more complicated. Although the technology market for patents is far from perfect because of high transaction costs and information asymmetry between potential licensors and licensees,2 and a large number of firms do not license although they are willing to do so because such patents are less appealing.3 In addition, the high transaction costs associated with the market for patents hinder the licensing of even appealing patents.4 However, in the information technological industry, patents are perceived as a relatively effective tool of appropriating rents from technological innovation,5 and the licensing propensity in such industries may be higher than in others. In addition, firm size matters as well because the rent dissipation effect of licensing, due to increased competition in the product market, is smaller for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that do not have a significant presence in the product market.6 At same time, according to the absorptive capacity theory, a potential licensee is typically a large firm that can conduct substantial in-house complementary R&D.7 Therefore, as a mode of technological cooperation in enterprises, patents licensing more and more are adapted by enterprises. In China, the works of patents licensing mainly concentrated on the domains of the patents licensing evaluation index,8 the development of the cooperation of pattern patent race9 and how to avoid the patents licensing risk of enterprises. However, there are a few of works to analyzing the situation of enterprises cooperation from patents licensing cases in the particular industry. For this purposes, this book main study the technical fields distribution of patents licensing of Chinese large firms in the next-generation information technology industry.


10.2 Data Sources and Research Methods
In this book, the patents licensing data come from the record information of patents licensing contracts and the service platform of patent information published by State Intellectual Property Office in China (SIPO) (http://​search.​cnipr.​com/​). The specific methods are input "2009-2013" in the publication date of legal status bar, and input "licensing" in the legal status bar, then according to these results to retrieve the specific information of the International Patent Classification (IPC) of patents licensing in the next-generation of information technology industry.10

According to the "the top 100 electronic information enterprises in China in 2012" announced by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in China, and referencing the main business direction of enterprises, select Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (abbreviation "Huawei"), Lenovo Mobile Communication Technology Co., Ltd. (abbreviation "Lenovo"), ZTE Corporation (abbreviation "ZTE") and Datang Telecom Technology Group (abbreviation "Datang") from the next-generation of information technology industry as representative enterprises.


10.3 Data Analysis
The IPC provides for a hierarchical system of language independent symbols for the classification of patents according to the different areas of technology to which they pertain. The IPC divides technology into eight sections with approximately 70,000 subdivisions. Each subdivision has a symbol consisting of Arabic numerals and letters of the Latin alphabet. The main NGIT items include: the next-generation mobile communications, the next-generation core Internet equipment, the convergence of Telecom/Cable TV/Internet networks, the Cloud Computing, etc. According to the IPC symbol, by analyzing the distributions of technical fields of patents licensing, we can master the output and demand level of technologies in four representative enterprises.

10.3.1 The Distribution of the Sections of Technical Fields of Patents Licensing
According to the IPC symbol and the distribution of the sections of technical fields of patents licensing in four enterprises (Table 10.1),11 the technical fields of patents licensing of four enterprises in the new generation of information technology industry mainly distributed in G (physics) section and H (electricity) section, in a small amount of B (performing operations, transporting) section and C (chemistry and metallurgy) section. In H (electricity) section, ZTE's the number of patents licensing is the largest, other firms' number of patents licensing are a few differences. In G (physics), Lenovo's the number of patents licensing is the largest; Huawei and ZYE' number of patents licensing are a few differences; Datang's the number of patents licensing is the lowest, which is as same as its number of patents licensing in C (chemistry and metallurgy) section.Table 10.1The distribution of the sections of technical fields of patents licensing in four enterprises HGCBHuawei502611Lenovo555200ZTE1122200Datang41660



10.3.2 The Distribution of the Classes of Technical Fields of Patents Licensing
Each section is subdivided into classes which are the second hierarchical level of the classification. The classes distribution of the technical fields of patents licensing in four enterprises (Table 10.2) shows that the classes distribution of patents licensing are mainly concentrated on H04 (electrical communication technology) class in Lenovo, ZTE and Datang, however, the distribution of patents licensing in Huawei are more dispersed. Specifically, the distribution of this class has following principle features.Table 10.2The distribution of the classes of technical fields of patents licensing in four enterprises HuaweiLenovoZTEDatangThe basic electrical components (H01)8030The generation, substation and distribution of power (H02)7040The basic electronic circuit (H03)12031The electrical communication technology (H04)153510240The other categories not included power technology (H05)17000The measurement; testing (G01)11023The control; regulation (G05)1020The calculation; projections; count (G06)139142The signal device (G08)2000The instruments; acoustic (G10)40031The information storage (G11)3000The horology (G04)0010

First of all, the distribution of the technical fields of patents licensing in Huawei is relatively scattered, mainly distributed on the fields of G10 (instrument and acoustics) class, H05 (other categories not included power technology) class and H04 (electronic communication technology ) class. Second, the distribution of the technical fields of patents licensing are relatively concentrated in Lenovo, ZTE and Datang. The distribution of the technical fields of patents licensing in Lenovo is mainly distributed on H04 (electrical communication technology) class and H03 (basic electronic circuit field) class; The distribution of the technical fields of patents licensing in ZTE focuses on H04 (electrical communication technology) class and G06 (calculation, prediction and calculation) class and a small amount of patents licensing distributed on H02 (generation, substation and distribution of power) class, H01 (basic electrical components) class, H03 (basic electronic circuit) class, and G10 (instruments, acoustic) class; The distribution of the technical fields of patents licensing in Datang mainly concentrated on H04 (electronic communication technology) class, and a small amount of patents licensing distributed in G01 (measurement and testing) class.


10.3.3 The Distribution of the Subclasses of Technical Fields of Patents Licensing
Each class comprises one or more subclasses which are the third hierarchical level of the Classification. Table 10.3 shows the main distributions of the sub-classes of technical fields of patents licensing in four representative enterprises.Table 10.3The subclasses of technical fields of patents licensing in four representative enterprisesHuaweiH01BH01LH02HH04BH04LH05KG01RG06FG06QG08G3a

aThe numbers below the subclass symbols are the amount of patents licensing in the technical field

From Table 10.3, the following key features can be found. In Huawei, the subclasses of technical fields of patents licensing mainly distribute on H05K (printed circuits, casings or constructional details of electric apparatus, manufacture of assemblages of electrical components) subclass; G06F (electric digital data processing) subclass; G01R (measuring electric variables; measuring magnetic variables) subclass; and H04L (transmission of digital information). In Lenovo, the subclasses of the technical fields of patents licensing mainly distribute on G10L (speech analysis or synthesis, speech recognition, speech or voice processing, speech or audio coding or decoding) subclass; H04S (stereophonic systems) subclass; H03G (control of amplification). In ZTE, the subclasses of technical fields of patents licensing mainly distribute on H04Q (selecting) subclass; G06F (electric digital data processing) subclass; H04L (transmission of digital information) subclass; H04B (transmission) subclass; and H04M (telephonic communication). In Datang, the subclasses of technical fields of patents licensing mainly distribute on H04Q (selecting) subclass; H04L (transmission of digital information) subclass; and H04M (telephonic communication) subclass.



10.4 Conclusion
A research on the technological cooperation is of a great significance based on a perspective of patents licensing. Through the empirical analysis of the distribution of technical fields of patents licensing in four representative enterprises of the new generation of information industry in China in 2009-2013, we can draw the following conclusions: in the sections of technical field, the technical fields of four firms mainly distributed on physics section and electricity section; in the classes of technical field, Huawei's technical fields of patents licensing is relatively scattered, other three firms' technical fields of patents licensing are mainly concentrate on the electrical communication technical field; in the subclasses of technical field, Huawei and Lenovo's technical fields of patents licensing respectively concentrate on the field of the manufacture of assemblages of electrical components, the fields of the speech analysis or synthesis, the speech recognition, the speech or voice processing and the speech or audio coding or decoding, ZTE and Datang's technical fields of patents licensing both concentrate on the field of selecting.

11.1 Introduction
With the severity of the global environmental issues and the shortage of energy resources, it is important to research on the granted patents distributions of the energy-saving and environmental protection technical fields for the development of related industry. The energy-saving and environmental protection industry is one of seven strategic emerging industries in China1 and it is also one of major industry domains of the Twelfth Five-Year Development Plan in China. The development of the energy-saving and environmental protection industry is of great importance to ease the pressure on traditional energy consumption, foster the new economic growth point and develop the emerging industries.
The development of the energy-saving and environmental protection industry is inseparable from technological innovation. Patent is one of the most reliable measures of the most direct indicators of technological innovation,2 which would reflect the latest trends of researches in the industry and make companies develop their own technological strategies.3 The patent system may improve the green technological innovation capability through a continuous cycle process: technological exploitation—protection—utilization—improvement—protection—utilization.4 In 2012, the patent applications of the low-carbon technology and the energy-saving technology having been advanced examined by State Intellectual Property Office in China (SIPO).5 This system is conducive to promote the industrial management of the energy-saving technology, which will further promote innovations in the energy-saving and environmental protection industry.6

Researches on the energy-saving and environmental protection industry have attracted more and more scholars' attentions in home and abroad, because China ranked it as one of strategic emerging industries in 2010. Lots of works have done in the existing researches on the relative field of the industry, such as trends and development, strategies and measures, experience and creation, etc. Though plenty of results of the study have been carried on, most researches are based on the qualitative analysis from the macro perspective, lacking of quantitative and empirical research on patent issues of the energy-saving and environmental protection industry. The quantitative and empirical analysis of patents is in favor of clearing the difference in innovation ability and the technological gap of between domestic and foreign technical fields.7 In that way, we would figure out more effective strategies to further develop the industry of China.
A developing trend of patents is one of an important indicator of industrial development, and the use of patent indicators to quantitative analysis the level of industrial technology and the innovation capability is a new research trend.8 It is the most common method to analyze the steady exponential growth characteristics of the patent document of related industrial technologies which can determine technological innovation activities in the industry.9
,
10 In order to clarify the technological development characteristics of the energy-saving and environmental protection industry and promote the industry development in China, we analyzed quantitatively the industry development status and trends of the energy-saving and environmental protection industry by the method of patent-bibliometric.


11.2 Data Source and Industry Classification
In this article, the granted patents statistics is searched by IPC (International Patent Classification) in the platform of patent-searching system of Patent Star (website: http://​searchtel.​patentstar.​com.​cn/​) from 2008 to 2013; and the information of the granted patents of the energy-saving and environmental protection industry is analyzed; then the development trends and patent problems in the industry in China are exposed.
The energy-saving and environmental protection industry is divided into the energy-saving industry, the resources recycling industry and the environmental management industry. Their main technical areas involved the International Patent Classification (IPC) symbols are based on the "Patent Search Handbook in Strategic Emerging Industries".11



11.3 The Granted Patents Distribution of the Energy-Saving and Environmental Protection Industry

11.3.1 The Overall Features of the Granted Patents

11.3.1.1 The Distribution of Granted Patents in Three Sub-industries
Based on the statistics of granted patents in nearly six years of the energy-saving and environmental protection industry in China, we can draw some features of the development status and trends of patented technology in energy-saving, resources recycling and environmental management industries.
Figure 11.1 shows the trends of granted patents of the energy-saving and environmental protection industry in China from 2008 to 2013. We could find that the characteristics of granted patents in the industry. Firstly, the granted patent numbers of three technical fields have been increasing during the period of 2008-2013, but the growth rates were different. The growth rate of the granted patent number of the environmental management industry is the sharpest, and the growth rate of the granted patent number of the energy-saving industry is the lowest. Secondly, the growth rates of the granted patents are different in different periods in three technical fields. The growth rates were lower in three technical fields during 2008-2010. The growth rate of granted patents of environmental management industry was the highest, but the growth rate of granted patents of the resource recycling industry was low during 2010-2012. The granted patents numbers of the energy-saving industry and the environmental management industry slightly decreased during 2012-2013. Apparently, the innovation capability of the environment management industry was significantly stronger than that of the other two industries in this period.Fig. 11.1The trends of granted patents in the energy-saving and environmental protection industries



11.3.1.2 The Domestic and Foreign Granted Patents Distributions of in the Tree Technical Fields
The domestic and foreign patents distributions of the three technical fields are shown in Fig. 11.2 and these patents were granted by State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC (SIPO) from 2008 to 2013. Two characteristics can be found from Fig. 11.2: firstly, the domestic granted patents are dominant in the three technical fields of the energy-saving and environmental protection industry in China.Fig. 11.2The domestic and foreign granted patents distributions of three fields

There are obvious advantages in the three technical domains for domestic patentees, and foreign patentees are not threats to the related industrial development in China. Secondly, there are different technical advantages degrees in various technologies for the holders of domestic granted patents. The patents advantages of the environmental management industry are the most obvious, slightly followed by the resources recycling industry, and the energy-saving industry is the weakest.



11.3.2 The Granted Patents Distributions of the Energy-Saving Industry
The technical field of the energy-saving industry includes the industrial boiler design and manufacturing technology (F22B9/00-F22B9/18, F22B27/00-F22B27/16, and F22B29/00-F22B29/12), the waste heat and energy utilization technology (F27D17/00) and the environmentally air conditioning and heat pump technology (F24F1/00-F24F1/04, F24F3/00-F24F3/16, F24F5/00, F25B30/00-F25B30/06).

11.3.2.1 The Granted Patents Distribution of Main Technologies in the Energy-Saving Industry
As shown in Fig. 11.3, inventions in the energy-saving industry mainly concentrated on the environmentally air-conditioning and heat pump technology. There are 2899 granted patents in this technical field, which are accounted for 87.3 % in all granted patents in the industry, and there are 388 granted patents in the technical field of the waste heat and energy utilization. The industrial boiler design and manufacturing technology only get 35 granted patents in the past six years, which is the least in the three technical fields in the energy-saving industry.Fig. 11.3The granted patents distribution of main fields of the energy-saving industry

From Fig. 11.3, we could draw a conclusion: firstly, there is serious imbalance of the granted patents distribution in the energy-saving industry from 2008 to 2013. It primarily focused on the environmentally air-conditioning and heat pump technology, while the innovative capabilities of other two technologies need to enhance; secondly, the competition of the environmentally air-conditioning and heat pump technology will be more acute in the future.


11.3.2.2 The Domestic and Foreign Granted Patents Distributions of the Energy-Saving Industry
The domestic and foreign granted patents distribution of major technical fields in the energy-saving industry (Fig. 11.4) can be found two features. Firstly, there are generally consistent on the domestic and foreign granted patents distributions in the energy-saving industry. The granted patents distributions of both extremely focusing on the environmentally air-conditioning and heat pump technology, and there are relatively small proportions in the waste heat and energy utilization technology and the industrial boiler design and manufacture technology. Secondly, the domestic granted patents amount is absolutely more than that of foreign granted patents in various technical fields. But the gap multiples of domestic and foreign granted patents are not identical. The number of domestic granted patents almost is seven times that of foreign granted patents in the waste heat and energy utilization technology, and is less than doubled in other two technical fields. This shows that the distributions of domestic and foreign granted patents are basically focus on main technical fields in energy-saving industry, however, the domestic granted patents of the waste heat and energy utilization technology has more advantages in China.Fig. 11.4The domestic and foreign granted patents distributions of major fields in energy-saving industry




11.3.3 The Granted Patents Distributions of the Resources Recycling Industry
The technologies of the resources recycling industry include the low-grade metal ore recycling technology (B03B7/00, B03B9/06, B03D1/00-B03D1/26), the comprehensive utilization of desulfurization gypsum technology (C04B7/04, C04B11/00-C04B11/30, C04B28/14-C04B28/16), the comprehensive utilization of coal gangue technology (C04B18/04-C04B18/12, C10L5/48), the food waste treatment and comprehensive utilization technology (B09B1/00, B09B3/00, A23K1/10), the waste material dismantling and sorting processing technology (B29B17/00-B29B17/02, H01M6/25, H01M10/54, H01J9/52), the key re-creation technology (C05F9/00-C05F9/04, B22F8/00), the urban sewage sludge recycling technology (C02F11/00-C02F11/02, C05F7/00-C05F7/04).

11.3.3.1 The Granted Patents Distribution of the Main Fields in the Resources Recycling Industry
The features of the granted patents distribution of the main technologies in the resources recycling industry in China from 2008 to 2013 (Fig. 11.5) are as follows: Firstly, the granted patents of the resource recycling industry mainly focused on the food waste treatment and comprehensive utilization technology and the urban sewage sludge recycling technology, which are more related to human's daily living. Secondly, they are relatively uniform for the granted patents distributions of the low-grade metal ore recycling technology, the comprehensive utilization of desulfurization gypsum technology, and the comprehensive utilization of coal gangue technology. Thirdly, their granted patents amounts of the waste material dismantling and sorting processing technology and the key re-creation technology are lower, and their roles are weaker in the resource recycling industry.Fig. 11.5The granted patents distribution of the main fields of the resources recycling industry

Therefore, the technological innovational capacity of the food waste treatment and comprehensive utilization technology and the urban sewage sludge recycling technology are obviously leading the industrial development, while the technological innovational capacity of the waste material dismantling and sorting processing technology and the key re-creation are relatively weak in the resources recycling industry in China.


11.3.3.2 The Domestic and Foreign Granted Patents Distributions of the Resources Recycling Industry
Figure 11.6 shows the domestic and foreign granted patents distributions of major technologies in the resources recycling industry in China. Three features could be drawn from it.Fig. 11.6The domestic and foreign granted patents distributions of major fields of the resources recycling industry

Firstly, the number of domestic granted patents is more than that of foreign granted patents in the resources recycling industry in China. Secondly, the granted patents numbers of the food waste treatment and comprehensive utilization industry and the urban sewage sludge recycling industry are the key technical fields at home and abroad, however the granted patents number of the key re-creation technologies is relatively low, especially the number of foreign patents. Thirdly, the domestic granted patents number is accounted for a larger ratio of the comprehensive utilization of coal gangue technology, while the proportion of the foreign granted patents is very low. This indicates that the domestic innovational capability is stronger in the comprehensive utilization of coal gangue technology, and the foreign innovational capability is stronger in the waste material dismantling and sorting processing technology.
We could make a conclusion: the food waste treatment and comprehensive utilization and the urban sewage sludge recycling technologies are the major innovative technical fields at home and abroad in the resources recycling industry; the comprehensive utilization of coal gangue technology place an important role in technical innovations of the resources recycling industry.




11.4 The Granted Patents Distributions of the Environmental Management Industry
Main technologies of the resource recycling industry include the heavy metal wastewater, waste gas, waste residue pollution control technology (C02F1/62-C02F1/64, B01D53/64), the flue gas desulfurization technology (B01D53/48-B01D53/60), the high concentration organic wastewater control technology (C02F1/00-C02F1/78, C02F3/00-C02F3/34, C02F9/00-C02F9/14), the heavy metals and POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants) contaminated soil remediation technology (B09C1/00-B09C1/10).

11.4.1 The Granted Patents Distribution of Main Fields of the Environmental Management Industry
From the granted patents distribution of main technologies in the environmental management industry (Fig. 11.7), we could find that the granted patents number of the environmental management industry is 18,270 from 2008 to 2013, which is completely unbalanced to other technical fields. In other words, more than 80 % of granted patents in the industry focused on the high concentration organic wastewater control technology. The granted patents number of the high concentration organic wastewater control technology is more than others. There are serious problems of industrial organic waste water stimulated technological innovations in this field. The continuous innovation abilities of the heavy metal wastewater, waste gas, waste residue pollution control technology and the heavy metals and POPs contaminated soil remediation technology are insufficient, accounted for only about 3 % of the granted patents number of the industry.Fig. 11.7The granted patents distribution of main technologies of the environmental management industry

Therefore, the innovative capability of the high concentration organic wastewater control technology is the strongest, while the innovative capabilities of the heavy metal wastewater, waste gas, waste residue pollution control technology and the heavy metals and POPs contaminated soil remediation technology still need to greatly improve.


11.4.2 The Domestic and Foreign Granted Patents Distributions of the Environmental Management Industry
As shown in the granted patents distributions of the environmental management industry at home and abroad (Fig. 11.8), we could find the following features. Firstly, the domestic granted patents number is far more than the foreign granted patents number of the environmental management industry in China. Secondly, the distributions of domestic and foreign granted patents both significantly concentrate on the high concentration organic wastewater control technical field. It indicates that the technical field of the high concentration organic wastewater control technology is the key domain in the environmental management industry in China.Fig. 11.8The domestic and foreign granted patents distributions of the environmental management industry




11.5 Conclusions
The energy-saving and environmental protection industry is one of the seven strategic emerging industries, which is the key industry to change the economic development mode, promote and upgrade the industrial chain in China.12 By analyzing the granted patents distribution of the energy-saving and environmental protection industry in China from 2008 to 2013, we could draw the following four conclusions: Firstly, the technological development of the energy-saving and environmental protection industry developed rapidly, but the development of sub-technology industries is not balanced, and the innovative capability of the environmental management industry is the strongest. Secondly, technological innovations of the energy-saving industry are focused on the environmentally air-conditioning and heat pump technology, and technological innovations of the resources recycling industry are mainly concentrated on the food waste treatment and comprehensive utilization technology and the urban sewage sludge recycling technology, and technological innovations of the environmental management industry are highly focused on the high concentration organic wastewater control technology. Thirdly, the granted patents distributions of the key strategic technical fields are unbalanced, of which the granted patents of the environmental management industry have the largest share. Fourthly, the domestic granted patents distributions are basically similar to that of foreign granted patents in the energy-saving and environmental protection industry in China, but the numbers of domestic granted patents are more than the numbers of foreign granted patents.

12.1 Introduction
Since the 20th century, the growth of the world economy is unprecedented, but along with the economic development, environmental problems have become increasingly prominent. Global warming, resource depletion, biodiversity loss, environmental pollution, desertification and other environmental problems are becoming increasingly threatening the survival of humanity. The issues that ensure economic and social development, but not damaging the environment, have gradually become a priority in various countries. Therefore, the environmental protection industry attracts more and more attention in most countries. The energy-saving and environmental protection industry is one of seven strategic emerging industries in China,1 with granted patents growth rate of 34.94 % in 2012, which is higher than that of other granted patents in the corresponding period.2 Energy-saving industry is one of the sub-industries in energy-saving and environmental protection industry, which is also the key industry for development in the Twelfth Five-Year Development Plan of China. Energy-saving industry has become an important force of China's economic growth in the emerging industry.
China's energy-saving technology develops rapidly, especially after China regarded it as one of key strategic emerging industries. The innovation activities of energy-saving technologies are prosperous, and more and more researches are focusing on the technology development and other relative issues.3 Patent is one of the most reliable measures of the most direct indicators of technological innovation,4 which would reflect the latest trends of researches in the industry and make companies develop their own technological strategies.5 The patent's quantity and quality have become a key force in the development of energy-saving industry both in China and the world.
Though plenty of results of studies have been carried on, most are still pointing on qualitative analysis from a macro perspective, lacking of quantitative and empirical researches on technology patents. Hence, the theoretical support for the development of energy-saving industry is insufficient. In order to clarify the characteristics of the development of China's energy-saving technology, and to provide a wider field of theoretical support for it, we quantitatively analyze status and trends of the development of patents of China's energy-saving industry related technologies, providing more references.


12.2 Data Source and Technology Classification
In this article, the patents statistics is searched by IPC (International Patent Classification) in the platform of patent-searching system of Patent Star (website: http://​searchtel.​patentstar.​com.​cn/​) from 2008 to 2013; and the information of patents of the energy-saving industry is analyzed; then the development trends and patent problems in the industry in China are exposed.
The technical fields of the energy-saving industry includes the industrial boiler design and manufacturing technology, the waste heat and energy utilization technology, and the environmentally air conditioning and heat pump technology. Their main technical areas involved the International Patent Classification (IPC) symbols are based on the "Patent Search Handbook in Strategic Emerging Industries".6 The IPC codes of the technical fields of energy-saving industry are shown in Table 12.1.Table 12.1The IPC codes of the technical fields of the energy-saving industry in ChinaTechnical fieldsIPC codesIndustrial boiler design and manufacturing technologyF22B9/00-F22B9/18; F22B27/00-F22B27/16;F22B29/00-F22B29/12Waste heat and energy utilization technologyF27D17/00Environmentally air conditioning and heat pump technologyF24F1/00-F24F1/04; F24F3/00-F24F3/16; F24F5/00;F25B30/00-F25B30/06



12.3 The Patent Distributions of Main Technologies in the Energy-Saving Industry

12.3.1 Technological Innovation Characteristics of the Energy-Saving Industry in China
With statistics of nearly six years of granted patents the energy-saving industry in China, we can draw the status and trends of patented technologies in the industry. Figure 12.1 shows the trend of granted patents the energy-saving industry in China from 2008 to 2013, from which we can get the information on changes of granted-patents technology by years. As shown in Fig. 12.1, the grants of the energy industry in China technology patents were 3322, a dramatic promotion compared with the early development of the industry.Fig. 12.1The development trend of granted patents the energy-saving industry in China (2008-2013)

The grants are not growing year by year, but a form of wavy growth. Though China listed the energy-saving and environmental protection industry as one of strategic emerging industries in 2010, there is no significant improvement in granted patents in the industry. It indicates that the industrial structure of the energy-saving industry in China is not yet mature, with a unstable development. There may be two reasons accounting for that: on the one hand, since China's energy-saving industry started late, and is subject to constraints to the level of industrial technologies, the technological innovation capacity is insufficient7; for the other hand, by the simple pursuit of influence GDP over the past years, local governments vigorously develop the extensive industrial economy, lacking of attention to the energy saving, without giving any proper policy support and guidance, and finally, resulting in the lacks of motivation in the field of energy technology innovation.


12.3.2 Distributions of Granted Patents in the Technological Fields of Industrial Boiler Design and Manufacturing and Waste Heat and Energy Utilization
Table 12.2 shows that distribution of granted patents in the technological fields of industrial boiler design and manufacturing and waste heat and energy utilization from 2008 to 2013. As can be seen from Table 12.1, innovation activities in the two fields are not active, totally granted 423, accounting for 12.73 % of patents of the energy-saving industry. The creative capability of industrial boiler design and manufacturing technology is obviously insufficient, only granted 35 patents in the past 6 years. In specific technical items, the grants of F22B27/00-F22B27/16, only granted 8 patents, are the least, while F27D17/00 gets a relatively large amount.Table 12.2Distributions of granted patents in the technological fields of industrial boiler design and manufacturing technology and waste heat and energy utilization (2008-2013)States/areasIndustrial boiler design and manufacturing technologyWaste heat and energy utilization technologyF22B9/00-F22B9/16F22B27/00-F22B27/16F22B29/00-F22B29/12F27D17/00CN1246339JP00019KR0200EU02916USA0006Others0008Total1281538835388Compared with foreign patentees, the granted patents of domestic take an absolute advantage both in the two technical fields, with a number of 361, accounting for 85.34 % of the total granted patents in the two technological fields. And foreign patentees were granted only 62 patents. It shows that in terms of quantity, there is no threat to the related technology development in China for foreign patentees in the two domains


F22B9/00-F22B9/16: Steam boilers of fire-tube type, i.e., the flue gas from a combustion chamber outside the boiler body flowing through tubes built-in in the boiler body; F22B27/00-F22B27/16: Instantaneous or flash steam boilers; F22B29/00-F22B29/12: Steam boilers of forced-flow type; F27D17/00: Arrangement for using waste heat (heat-exchangers per seF28); Arrangement for using, or disposing of, waste gases (removing fumes in general B08B 15/00).


12.3.3 Distributions of Granted Patents in the Technological Fields of Environmentally Air Conditioning and Heat Pump
Table 12.3 shows distributions of granted patents in the technological fields of environmentally air conditioning and heat pump technology. As shown in Table 12.3, the innovative capabilities in the field of environmentally air conditioning and heat pump technology are strongest the energy-saving industry in China. The granted patents occupy the absolute advantage in the industry, with a total of 2899 patents, accounting for 87.27 % of total patents. In specific technical items, four specific technologies in the field develop well, of which granted patents are higher than other areas of specific technical items. The amount of F24F1/00-F24F1/04 technology item is the most, up to 1025 granted patents.Table 12.3Distributions of granted patents in the technological field of environmentally air conditioning and heat pump (2008-2013)States/AreasEnvironmentally air conditioning and heat pump technologyF24F1/00-F24F1/04F24F3/00-F24F3/16F24F5/00F25B30/00-F25B30/06CN462532447367JP2951637734KR257891915EU737156USA23179Others21466Total10258665714372899
F24F1/00-1/04: Room units, e.g., separate or self-contained units or units receiving primary air from a central station; F24F3/00-3/16: Air-conditioning systems in which conditioned primary air is supplied from one or more central stations to distributing units in the rooms or spaces where it may receive secondary treatment; Apparatus specially designed for such systems; F24F5/00: Air-conditioning systems or apparatus not covered by group F24F 1/00 or F24F 3/00; F25B30/00-30/06: Heat pumps

Compared with foreign patentees, 1808 patents are granted to the domestic patentees, while the foreign patentees get 1092. It can be seen that the competition between domestic and abroad is fierce, and the development of domestic technology is not dominant in the field of environmentally air conditioning and heat pump technology. Foreign patentees are most from Japan, Korea, the European Union and the United States and other countries or regions. Japan and South Korea patentees attain larger grants among the foreign patentees, accounting for 87 % of the total foreign grants.
The energy-saving industry in China, the key researches, domestic and abroad, are consistent, both absolutely focuses on the field of environmentally air conditioning and heat pump technology. Although the domestic granted patents take advantage in the overall numerical value, domestic granted patents are lower than other countries in some specific technical items. For instance, in the technical item of F24F1/00-F24F1/04, the domestic shared 462 patents, while foreign patentees get 563 patents granted, 101 more than the domestic. It indicates that some core technologies are still controlled by foreign patentees in China's energy-saving industry, hindering the further development of domestic industry.



12.4 Conclusions
The energy-saving and environmental protection industry is one of the seven strategic emerging industries, which is the key industry to change the economic development mode, promote and upgrade the industrial chain in China.8 As an important part of energy-saving and environmental protection industry, the development of energy-saving industry will greatly promote the development of energy-saving and environmental protection industry in China. The patent system may improve the green technological innovation capability through a continuous cycle process: technological exploitation—protection—utilization—improvement—protection—utilization.9

By analyzing the patents distribution of the energy-saving industry in China from 2008 to 2013, we could draw the following four conclusions: First, at present, the development of energy-saving industry in China is not yet mature, with a wave patent growth by years; Second, the development of various technologies the energy-saving industry in China is uneven, mainly concentrated on the field of environmentally air conditioning and heat pump technology. And in technology-specific items, granted patents are more focusing on F24F1/00-F24F1/04; Third, the amount of domestic patents is dominant in the overall numerical value, but some core technologies are still controlled by foreign technology patent powers like Japan, South Korea, America and European Union; Fourth, the key researches, domestic and abroad, are consistent in the energy-saving industry in China, as well as the patent distributions in different technological fields.

13.1 Introduction
The new energy vehicles is a new technology and new structure car, which adopts an unconventional vehicle fuel such as the power source or the conventional vehicle fuels, and which adopts some advanced technologies such as the new-vehicle power unit, the dynamics control vehicle etc. The new energy automotive industry, which is engaged in the production and the use of new energy automotive industry, is one of seven strategic emerging industries in China. It is very important to study on the granted patents distributions of this technical field for the technological innovation and development of the new energy automotive industry.
Comparative analysis on the patent distributions of technical fields in representative firms can provide important reference for the development of related industries in China.1 Existing studies mainly focus on the new energy industry policies, the overall analysis of the development strategy in the new energy automotive industry. As studies have shown, the United States will mainly focus on the hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles, and the hybrid cars will be developed by Japan in feature.2 The biggest problems restricting the development of the new energy automotive industry in China are the high expenditure, the low capacity and the instability of battery.3 There is the inadequate of technological innovation ability, the shortage of infrastructure in the development of new energy vehicles.4 So China must bypass these technical barriers, and enhance the level of technological innovation, and promote the development of new energy vehicles, at same time upgrades the traditional automotive technology.5 The research results of the new energy research industry mainly focus on the following aspects: statistical analysis of the patents types, the application subjects and the key technical fields in new energy vehicles6; comparative analysis of patents in the new energy automobile industry in China and Japan7; the patent standardization of the new energy automobile industry in China8; the patent distributions of brand cars in the new energy technology9; comparative study of patent situation of key technologies in the new energy vehicles in China, Japan and the United States and other developed countries.10 In addition, Guangdong Province in China has released "the patent analysis and forewarning reports on the new energy automotive industry".11 Changzhou of Jiangsu Province in China has issued "the patent forewarning analysis on the new energy vehicle industry".12 Key enterprises are backbones of the industrial development, but the patent distributions and trends of key technologies of major enterprises in the new energy vehicles has been a little reported.
This book intends to take Chery Automobile Co., Ltd. (referred to as "Chery"), BYD Company Limited (referred to as "BYD"), Geely Holding Group Co., Ltd. (referred to as "Geely") and Chang'an automobile Co., Ltd. (referred to as "Changan") for example in the new energy automobile industry in China, combining with the enterprise development strategies of the new energy automotive industry, analyze the patent distribution characteristics and problems of the new energy automotive industry, provide a theoretical reference for the development and investment of the new energy automotive industry.


13.2 Technical Field and Data Retrieval

13.2.1 Technical Fields
The new energy vehicles includes the hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), the blade electric vehicles (BEV, including solar power car), the fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV), the hydrogen engine vehicles, and other new energy sources (such as the high energy storage devices, DME) cars and other categories of products. The developing direction of the technological innovation mainly focuses on the hybrid vehicles, the blade electric vehicles and the fuel cell vehicles.


13.2.2 Key Enterprises
On the domestic patent applications, the first three enterprises are Chery, BYD and Changan in the hybrid vehicles field; the first three enterprises are BYD, Chery, Tsinghua University in the blade electric vehicles field; the first two enterprises are Tsinghua University, Shanghai God in the fuel cell vehicle field; the top three enterprises are BYD, Chery, Tianjin Power of God in the battery technical field.10 Therefore, this article focuses on the distribution characteristics and problems of granted patents of the Chery, BYD, Geely and Changan in China.


13.2.3 Data Retrieval
All patent data in this article are searched from the SooPat patent database (http://​www2.​soopat.​com/​Home/​IIndex), retrieval method is "apply subjects + IPC classification codes", the interval time from 2008 to 2013, and then statistics the information of granted patents of four enterprises. In additional, the individual IPC codes of different technical fields may be repeated, so some statistics data taken by labor.



13.3 Data Analysis

13.3.1 The Overall Distributions of Granted Patents of Four Technological Fields
The distribution of granted patents in the hybrid vehicles field, the blade electric vehicles field, the fuel cell vehicles field and the battery technical fields in Chery, BYD, Geely and Changan from 2008 to 2013 shows as Fig. 13.1.Fig. 13.1The overall distributions of granted patents of four technical fields

As can be seen from Fig. 13.1, in the hybrid cars fields, the differences of granted patent number of Chery, BYD, and Geely are small, but the granted patent number of Changan is significantly disadvantage. In the blade electric vehicles field, the polarization of granted patents number is not obvious. In the fuel cell vehicles field, the numbers of granted patents of Chery, Geely and Changan are relatively low, only a few granted patents. In the battery technical field, the advantage of granted patents of four enterprises are obvious, especially BYD' total reached 732, which is more than the sum of the other three enterprises.
Specifically, the characteristics of granted patents distribution in four key technical fields in four enterprises as following: firstly, BYD's granted patents number is the largest in four technical fields, and it obtained an absolute advantage in the battery technical fields; secondly, Changan's granted patents number behind other three companies in the hybrid cars field, which indicates that its technology innovation level is relatively backward in the field; thirdly, Geely's granted patents number of the blade electric vehicles field is less than that of the hybrid vehicles field, and the focal point of patent distribution are vary in the different fields; fourthly, from the total number of granted patents, Changan's overall number of granted patents is relatively low, although the granted patents number of the battery technical field is higher than other technical fields.


13.3.2 Distributions of Granted Patents in the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Field
The hybrid car is a generators car, which equipped with two or more power sources, such as batteries, fuel cells, solar cells or locomotives. In the transition process of from a traditional car to a new energy car, the hybrid power is the only way for the technological development of enterprises. The distribution of granted patents of the hybrid vehicle technical field in four companies shows as Table 13.1.Table 13.1The distributions of granted patents in the hybrid electric vehicle field CheryBYDGeelyChanganThe arrangement or installation of prime mover (B60K6)a

aThe International Patent Classification represents the whole body of knowledge which may be regarded as proper to the field of patents for invention, divided into eight sections. Sections are the highest level of hierarchy of the classification
bThe data format: invention patents + utility model patents

Seen from Table 13.1, there are the following characteristics of the hybrid vehicle technical fields in four firms. Firstly, in the arrangement or installation of prime mover technical field, BYD and Geely's granted patents have an advantage, the Chery and Changan's granted patents numbers are relatively lower; In the vehicle control system field, Chery' granted patents number is of an obvious advantage, and BYD, Geely and Changan's granted patent numbers are a few; In power electric traction technical field, Changan's granted patents are fewer; In the joint control of the vehicle subsystems technical field, Chery' granted patents number is the sum of other three firms, and BYD' granted patents are few. Secondly, in Chery, the granted patent number is more balance in various technical fields, and it has an obvious advantages in the joint control of vehicle subsystems technical field; In the arrangement or installation of prime mover field, BYD and Geely have an absolute advantage, and its granted patent number is more than the total number of granted patents of other technical fields in this firm; In Changan, the amount of granted patents is relatively small, and there are only a few granted patents in the major technical fields. Finally, in the hybrid cars field, the number of granted invention patents in various technical fields is much higher than the amount of granted utility model patents, indicating all enterprises focuses on the technological innovation and the quality of granted patents.
It can clearly be seen that the total of granted patents of Chery, BYD and Geely are little difference, but Changan's granted patents number is fewer in the hybrid vehicles field. In this technical field, the ratio of granted invention patents is high; and the ratio of utility model patents is relatively low in four enterprises.


13.3.3 Distributions of Granted Patents in the Blade Electric Vehicle Field
The granted patents distributions of the blade electric vehicle technical field in four enterprises in 2008-2013 as shown in Table 13.2. According to Table 13.2, in the blade electric vehicles field, BYD's granted patents number is the largest, Chery' granted patents number is second, and their competitive advantage are obvious; Geely and Changan' granted patents numbers are closer, and the total is small.Table 13.2The distributions of granted patents in the blade electric vehicle field CheryBYDGeelyChanganThe power electric traction (B60L11)13 + 30 + 22 + 00The battery pack/power supply (H02J7)44 + 1457 + 8012 + 2011 + 3The battery and manufacturing (H01M10)8 + 010 + 162 + 56 + 4The manufacturing method and structural components (H01M2)4 + 34 + 60 + 94 + 10The vehicle drive arrangement/installation (B60K17)8 + 74 + 150 + 73 + 9Total1041945750

According to Table 13.2, four distribution characteristics of granted patents can be found in four major technical fields in four companies. First, in the power electric traction technical field, Chery's granted patent number is relatively large, BYD and Geely have only two patents, Changan has not granted patent in this field. Combining with the content of Table 13.1, we can discovery that the power electric traction technical field not only involves the blade electric vehicle technology, but also belong to the core technology of the hybrid vehicles field and the fuel cell vehicles field. This indicates that there is a certain the cross and contact among the technical fields in the new energy automotive industry. Secondly, in the battery pack/power supply technical field, granted patents technologies most concentrated in four enterprises, of which BYD's advantages is particularly obvious, and the number of granted patents reached 137, but more than 60 % of the number is utility model patents. Thirdly, in the battery and manufacturing technical field and the arrangement/installation of vehicle drive fields, the granted patents distributions of four firms are relatively uniform, and BYD has a little advantage. It is worth noting that Changan has relatively strong competitiveness in the three technical fields. Finally, Chery's invention patents amount is much higher than the amount of utility model patents, however, BYD, Geely and Changan's proportions of utility model patents are higher, which indicates Chery pay more attention to improve its patent quality.
In short, in the blade electric vehicles field, the development trends of four enterprises are relatively balance, and the overall advantage of this field is more prominent, the extreme phenomenon of granted patents is not obvious. BYD is a leader of granted patents, but Chery has greater invention patents, which more focus on the patent quality.


13.3.4 Distributions of Granted Patents in the Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Field
Since the fuel cell electric vehicle can achieve the zero emissions of carbon dioxide, and it has the long mileage, the short fueling time and other advantages, it is an ultimate direction of the automotive development in future. But the technological innovation of the fuel cell vehicles field is not obvious. The granted patents distributions of the fuel cell electric vehicle field four firms as shown in Table 13.3. According to Table 13.3, BYD's number of granted patents is the largest, followed by Chery, and Geely and Changan's number of granted patents are rare. It shows that there is serious technical level differentiation in this field in four firms. This book argues that there are two reasons for this phenomenon: firstly, BYD's predecessor is a battery manufacturer, which has the first granted patent battery technology, so it has an absolute advantage in the electric vehicles field in China; secondly, BYD had established the Academia Sinica, the Electronic Research Institute of Automotive, the Engineering Research Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute, which are responsible for the development of high-tech products and technologies in this technical field.Table 13.3The distributions of granted patents in the fuel cell electric vehicle field CheryBYDGeelyChanganThe fuel cell and manufacturing (H01M8)017 + 42 + 01 + 0The electrode elements (H01M4)1 + 0000The power electric traction (B60L11)0000The input into output of DC power (H02M3)8 + 312 + 1100 + 1Total144423

The distribution characteristics of granted patents in the fuel cell vehicle technical field in four firms showed the following aspects. Firstly, the granted patents of the electrode elements field and the power electric traction technical field almost are zero. The electrode elements technology involves more the lithium iron phosphate sub-cell, and it's not much correlation with the fuel cell. The power electric traction technology is the core technology of the hybrid vehicles and the blade electric vehicles. There is not a patent in the power electric traction field in four firms. Secondly, in the fuel cell vehicle technical field, the granted patents mainly focus on the fuel cell and manufacturing field and the input into output of DC power technical fields.
We can clearly see that the overall amount of granted patents is lower, in the last one of four technical fields in the fuel cell vehicles field. And in this field, the distribution granted patents is not uniform, and the extreme phenomenon is obvious, and the technological innovation needs to further strengthen.


13.3.5 Distributions of Granted Patents in the Battery Technical Field
From the distributions of granted patents in the battery technical field in four enterprises (Table 13.4) can find that four firms all are more concerned on the granted patent distributions of the battery technical field, and the proportion of granted patents number in this field accounted for the total of granted patents number is higher. Because that electricity replace oil is the key of that the new energy vehicles replace the fuel powered automobile. Therefore, whether the hybrid vehicles, the blade electric vehicles, or the fuel cell vehicles, all belong to the new energy vehicles, which use electricity as the primary power source. So the battery technology will be inevitably become the core technology of research and development of various enterprises.Table 13.4The distributions of granted patents in the battery technical field CheryBYDGeelyChanganThe battery and manufacturing (H01M10)43 + 4142 + 1081 + 77 + 6The manufacturing method of structural components (H01M2)21 + 1272 + 1330 + 56 + 3The electrode elements (H01M4)61 + 1205 + 1500The circuits or fluid lines and original layout (B60R16)61 + 245 + 2530 + 8212 + 29The arrangement or installation of electric power plant (B60K1)15 + 163 + 244 + 184 + 13Total25873214780

According to Table 13.4, in the field of battery technology, BYD's granted patents number is far beyond the sum of other three firms. There are obvious advantages for the granted patents distribution of the battery and manufacturing field, the manufacturing methods of structural components field and the electrode elements field.
The proportion of invention patents to utility model patents in the battery and manufacturing field is basically flat. The proportion of utility model patents in the manufacturing methods of structural components field is relatively higher. In the electrode elements field, the amount of granted invention patents is majority. These facts indicate that the distribution of granted patent types is difference in different technical fields. In the circuits or fluid lines and original layout field and the arrangement or installation of electric power plant field, BYD's granted patents number is relatively low and the types of patents mainly is utility model patents. This indicates that BYD has not advantage in these technical fields.
In the battery technical field, Chery's distribution of granted patents is evenly in various key technical fields. Although the granted patents numbers of the manufacturing methods of structural components field and the arrangement and layout of electric power plant field are relatively low, but the gap is small, and the invention patents number is larger. Geely and Changan's granted patents number in this field is lower, and the distribution of granted patents has obvious characteristics. First, the granted patents number of the cell and manufacturing field and the manufacturing methods of structural components field are a few, and the granted patents number of the electrode elements field is zero; Second the granted patents number of the manufacturing methods of structural components field and the arrangement and layout of electric power plant field is relatively high, however, which are mainly the utility model patents, and the patents quality is not high.
This shows that the granted patents numbers of the battery technical field in four enterprises are higher. This field is the key field of patents distribution, however, there are different focuses for the granted patents distribution in the different enterprises, and there are larger gap.



13.4 Conclusion
By analysis on the granted patents distribution of four key technical fields of Chery, BYD, Geely and Changan in new energy automotive industry in China, conclusion can be drawn that, in hybrid field, Chery, BYD, Geely's granted patents number are little difference, and the patent quality is higher, however, Changan's granted patents level is lower. In the blade electric vehicles field, the development trends of granted patents are relatively balance, and the overall advantage is obvious, the extreme disparity of granted patents is not obvious, and BYD lie in a leadership position in four enterprises, however, Chery's patents quality is higher. In the fuel cell vehicles field, the total of granted patents is lower, and the distribution of granted patents is uneven, and the extreme phenomenon is obvious. In the battery technical field, the total of granted patents is higher, which is the key field of patent distribution, however, there are obviously gap in four enterprises.

14.1 Introduction
Traditional medicine is a general term comprised of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Indian medicine, Arab medicine and other traditional medicine systems and various folk therapies.1 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the unique form of traditional medicine in China passed down over thousand years, is the most influential traditional medicine system with the largest population and the most complete preservation.2 TCM industry plays an important role in the strategic framework of the sustainable development of China's pharmaceuticals industry. A system, consisting of international treaties, domestic laws and regulations and related industry policies, has been formulated for the overall protection of the TCM industry in China. With regard to the great impact of patent system on the development of TCM industry, this book focuses on the status quo and object of patent protection of TCM, the influence of patent protection on R&D of the TCM industry and the challenges and solutions.


14.2 The Status Quo of Patent Protection of TCM
In China, before the enforcement of the Patent Law of the People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred as the Patent Law), the enterprises preferred the measures of internal confidential methods and implementation of various security procedures to protect TCM. The patent protection of TCM has experienced three periods after the enforcement of the Patent Law. Phase One (1985-1992) is from the implementation of patent law to the first revision. During this period, the Patent Law implemented in 1985 provided a very low level of patent protection for TCM, covering only the pharmaceutical manufacturing methods and medical apparatus and instruments, but excluding the use of drugs and substances obtained by chemical methods. Phase two (1993-2000) is from the first revision of Patent Law to China's WTO entry. After the first revision, the Patent Law began to protect drugs (including TCM), which substantially increased the level of patent protection of TCM and promoted the development of China's TCM industry. Phase three is from 2001 until now. Since China's accession to WTO in 2001, TCM industry has progressed substantially because the invigorating drug patent protections have greatly stimulated increased TCM patent applications. However, some problems still remain due to the intrinsic characteristics of TCM.

14.2.1 An Overview of TCM Patent Applications
These statistics are taken from the patent database of China Intellectual Property Net (CNIPR), A61K353 (Medicinal preparations containing raw materials or reaction products with undetermined constitution) and A61K33 (Medicinal preparations containing mineral active ingredient) as the search portal. The result shows: the amount of patent applications accepted by State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) during 1985-2007 was 2,972,262 and 382052 of them were granted. Among them, the number of patent applications of TCM was 41,482, which accounted for 1.4 % of the total; and the number granted was 12,690, which accounted for 3.3 %. According to a statistics on patent applications of TCM from 1992 to 2002, the applicants were mainly domestic, while international applications only accounted for 1.2 %. Therefore, the data in the paper illustrates the situation of Chinese medicine applications and grants.
As shown in Fig. 14.1, the situation of TCM patent applications accepted by SIPO in 1985-2007 corresponds with the three periods of patent protection of TCM. The amount of TCM applications from 1985 to 1992, though rising steadily, was very small, ranging from 43 in 1985 to 629 in 1992. In comparison with the first period, the amount of patent applications of TCM significantly increased from 1993 to 2000. However, the growth rate in this period was as low, with a decrease of 171 from 1993 to 1995, to increase to 2166 applications in 2000. The trend of TCM patent applications from 2001 to 2007 experienced parabolic (rising and falling) processes. In the third period, the amount of patent applications rose significantly in comparison with the second period. In 2003, the number of patent applications peaked (4358), while in 2007 dropped to 2282. Therefore, patent applications of TCM experienced three periods: steady growth, stable development, and significant drops.Fig. 14.1Statistics of patent applications of TCM accepted by SIPO during 1985-2007. Date source China intellectual property net patent database service platform



14.2.2 An Overview of TCM Patent Grants
As shown in Fig. 14.2, compared with patent applications of TCM, the periodic time demarcations of the number of TCM patents granted by SIPO is sporadic. The period of 1985-1992 indicated steady growth with an increase from 21 to 147. The number of TCM patent grants substantially increased from 147 in 1992 to 521 in 1993, because the first revision of the patent law protected TCM products, while the Patent Law in 1985 did not.4 The number of TCM patent grants steadily increased from 1993 (521) to 2002 (1508). However, since 2002, the number has dropped significantly. Therefore, the TCM patent grants experienced three phases: slow, steady rising; rapid rising with a plateau effect; and rapid increase and decline.Fig. 14.2Statistics of patent of TCM granted by SIPO during 1985-2006. Date source China intellectual property net patent database service platform



14.2.3 TCM International Patent Applications
In 1998, there were only two TCM PCT applications, which accounted for 2.4 % of China's total of PCT applications. However, the proportion kept increasing with the number of patent applications rising each year, and reached 4.4 % in 2000, and 4.5 % in 2001. This change reflected the gradual participation of TCM enterprises in the world market competition. But the proportion of TCM PCT applications among all Chinese medicine applications was very low. In 2002, the proportion was only 0.6 %, that is, 99.4 % of domestic TCM was not internationally patented, thus losing the international market share.5




14.3 The Impact of Patent Protection on the TCM Industry R&D
Though TCM industry's great achievements cannot be totally attributed to the patent system, the patent system has indeed greatly promoted the development of TCM industry. The Patent Law has played an important role in the development of TCM industry ever since the implementation of the law, especially, since the first revision in 1992. In recent years, TCM industry has maintained rapid development. In 2002-2005, China's TCM industry (including Chinese patent drugs industry and TCM prepared in ready-to-use forms industry) developed with a 20 % annual increase rate of gross value of industrial output, an 18.5 % annual increase rate of products sales revenue and 11.6 % total profits.6 From January to May, 2007, the gross value of industrial output of Chinese patent drugs was ¥9.34 billion, and TCM prepared in ready-to-use forms ¥47.66 billion, which rose by 32.91 and 19.7 % respectively, compared with the same period last year. The whole industry maintained a rapid growth rate.7 From January to August, 2007, cumulative gross value of industrial output of China's Chinese patent medicines industry achieved ¥90.51 billion with an increase of 20.1 % compared with the same period last year.8


14.3.1 The Impact of Patent Protection of TCM on the Expense and Social Benefits of TCM Institutions' R&D
Figure 14.3 compares the numbers of TCM patent applications and grants, TCM R&D expenditures and the TCM hospital revenues and expenditures from 1998 to 2006.9 It shows that the number of TCM patent applications and grants increased at the beginning then later declined. The number of TCM patent applications peaked in 2003 (4358), and the number of the grants peaked in 2002 (1508). TCM intuition R&D expenditures distinctly climbed with the largest increase from 2002 to 2003. The changes of the total revenues and expenses of TCM hospitals were basically in the same condition—significant increases with the largest increase from 2002 to 2003. It can be concluded that the change of the number of patent applications and grants of TCM exerts no distinct influence on the R&D expenditures of TCM institutions and the social benefits of TCM. This book holds that the reasons for the phenomenon are: (1) the TCM patent protection has improved considerably and TCM industry has developed greatly in recent years; therefore, the R&D expenditure of TCM institutions and the revenues and expenditures of TCM hospitals are rising significantly; (2) because of the particularity of the patent protection object of TCM, it is normal that the number of TCM patent applications and grants will drop when it increases to a certain point. The reason is that the TCM patent protection has its certain object and content so the protection coverage is limited. The level of TCM patent protection is continually rising, while the number of TCM patent applications and grants will stabilize or even decline at a certain point.Fig. 14.3An overview of the number of TCM patent applications and grants, TCM R&D expenditures and TCM hospital payments from 1998 to 2006.

14.3.2 The Impact of TCM Patent Protection on the TCM Institution Human Resources
In recent years, TCM human resources have greatly developed. Statistics shows that the R&D staff in Chinese medicine manufacturing enterprises accounted for 25.4 % of the entire medicine manufacturing industry in 2005. In 2006, the number of the R&D staff in business circles was 5748, and institutions 4578.10 In Fig. 14.4, a comparison is made between the number of patent applications and grants, the R&D staffs in TCM institutions, and college students majoring in TCM.11 The number of patent applications and grants of TCM will not be repeated here since it has been mentioned previously. As shown in Fig. 14.4, the number of the R&D staffs in TCM institutions, and college students majoring in TCM increased except in 2000. Both components increased from 2000 to 2002, and the number of TCM institution R&D staffs had a relatively larger margin of increase. From 2002 to 2006, the number of the R&D staffs in TCM institutions had no significant changes, while the number of college students majoring in TCM continued to increase, especially from 2003 to 2005. It can be concluded that there is no direct relationship between the number of patent applications and grants and the number of the R&D staffs in TCM institutions according to the changes of the number of patent applications and grants and the number of the R&D staffs in TCM institutions and college students majoring in TCM.Fig. 14.4An overview of the number of TCM patent applications and grants, the TCM R&D staff and the number of students in TCM colleges and Universities from 1999 to 2006.

14.3.3 The Impact of TCM Patent Protection on the Scientific/Technical Output of TCM Institutions
Figure 14.5 compares the number of TCM applications and grants, the amount of scientific papers of institutions, and the number of papers delivered overseas. The number of TCM applications and grants will not be repeated here since it has been mentioned previously. In this period, the amount of scientific papers of institutions first declined by a small margin and then increased gradually with no significant rise, except for the rapid increase from 2005 to 2006. The number of papers delivered overseas changed in a non-linear manner, with no significant fluctuation. It dropped to the bottom in 2001 (66) and peaked in 2004 (130). It can be concluded that there is no direct relationship between the number of Chinese medicine patents applied and granted and the numbers of the scientific/technical output of Chinese medicine research institutions.Fig. 14.5Comparison of the amount of TCM patent applications and grants and the amount of scientific/technical papers of institutions from 1998 to 2006.

14.4 The Challenges Confronting TCM Patent Protection and the Solutions
Currently, the TCM industry is facing great opportunities. The annual trade volume of Chinese herbal medicine and Chinese patent medicines has exceeded $15 billion. Thirty percent of the population in Europe has used Chinese medicine, and 10 % of the doctors in Germany have received preliminary training of acupuncture and moxibustion. A TCM cooperative research project has been set under FP7 of EU.12

However, the TCM patent protection is also confronted with severe challenges. Firstly, the open requirement of the claims of patent application undermines the patent protection of TCM. Secondly, the patentability examination could be challenging for TCM patent applications to pass because of the characteristics of TCM compound prescriptions. Thirdly, the uncertainty of the active ingredients in a TCM formula also leads to the difficulty of determining patent infringements.
Lastly, China's TCM resources have been drained in recent years, which have challenged the development of TCM industry. Overseas enterprises develop new drugs from TCM and apply for patents to stifle China's TCM industry. Taking Teikoku Seiyaku Co., Ltd. in Japan as an example, it applied for and received USA patents on four compound prescriptions mainly treating ulcerative colitis "modified ease powder", "Chinese angelica root and lactiflora peony root soup", "cinnamon twig and Tuckahoe pills" and "paeonia lactiflora and hay soup".13 In another example, USA has owned 8 patents on peppermint originated from Jiangsu in China. Among the 68 patents on precious TCM herd gingko in China, four are owned by foreigners, but the four cover almost all the extraction processes of gingko.
To further facilitate the development of TCM industry, this book offers the following suggestions besides improving the patentability examination and infringement determination rules of TCM. Firstly, taking advantage of the coming third revision of the Patent Law, inheritance resource disclosure mechanism should be introduced to enhance TCM patent protection. Secondly, the relationship between the Patent Law and other systems of TCM protection should be coordinated, so as to increase the efficiency of laws and regulations and industry policies, and thus promote the development of TCM industry. Besides the Patent Law, other laws, regulations and industry policies also play important roles in the development of TCM. They provide a multi-level protection for TCM. But their compatibility is low, and some conflicts even exist. Some voids remains in TCM protection. Lastly, the legislative body should initiate special TCM protections aimed at the unique features of TCM industry to promote its modernization.

Abstract
With the continuous deepening of the reform of political system, the transparency of the governmental decision and the governmental action has become an inevitable trend in China. In order to conform to this trend, the content of the patent ownership of inventions-creations created by the government-funded has been added in the Law of the People's Republic of China on Science and Technology Progress (the amendment bill) and the Patent Law of the People's Republic of China (the amendment bill for examination). For the understanding of these provisions, this book studies on the mode of the patent ownership of inventions-creations arising from mainly government-funded research programs. The conclusion is that among inventions-creations created by research programs mainly using government funds, the right of patent applications or the patent right of the ones involved with the national security or vital interests shall belong to the state, unless a funding agreement is signed for it; the right of patent application or the patent right of the ones not involved with the national security or vital interests shall belong to programs undertakers; if the program is also funded by the third party, the right of patent applications or the patent right shall be decided with a funding agreement between program undertakers and the third party, when there is no agreement or the agreement is not explicitly, the right of patent applications or the patent right shall belong to program undertakers.

15.1 Introduction
The transparency of the governmental decision and the governmental action is that a government should tell on the public on the procedures and results of the governmental decision and the governmental action by the appropriate channels and means, except them involving national security and commercial secrets.1 Along with the acceleration of the economic development and the modern democratic political process, the institutionalized and legalized on the ownership of inventions-creations created by the government-funded is the inevitable demand of the democratization of social management and the efficient of public services.
In the Government Report on Patents Policies in 1978, the Federal Committee on Science and Technology in the United States pointed out that the utilization rate of 2800 patents licenses owned by federal government was less than 5 % in 1976.2 At that time there had different regulations on the patent ownership of inventions-creations created using government funds in many states in the United States, which resulted in difficulties for application of patent rights on inventions-creations created by the government funds.3 American government began to realize that it mainly was the government's control of patent ownership that prevented inventions from the commercial application.4 Under this situation, a core law—the Bayh-Dole Act,5 which involved with the patent ownership of inventions-creations created using government funds, was promulgated in the United States in 1980. The Bayh-Dole Act granted universities and small businesses the right to own their inventions created by the Federal funds. And the Bayh-Dole Act played a great role on the economic development in the United States. As an economist, who is a writer of Science Technology Quarterly, concluded: "the Bayh-Dole Act is possibly the most inspired piece of legislation to be enacted in America over the past half-century". American universities have witnessed a ten-fold increase in their patents and created more than 2200 companies to exploit their technology, which in turn has produced 260,000 new jobs since 1980; they contribute $40 billion annually to the American economy in 2002.6 In many OECD countries, universities and institutes in the public sector are establishing new regulations and incentive structures to promote the development and exploitation of knowledge with commercial promise. At the same time, many governments are also establishing explicitly policies or guidelines concerning intellectual property rights for the public institutes.7 In China, the Law of the People's Republic of China on Science and Technology Progress (hereinafter referred to as the Law on Science and Technology Progress (the amendment bill) passed in Dec 2007. Articles 20 and 21 of this law stipulated the issues of the ownership, the execution and the benefit distribution of intellectual property rights of research achievements created by government financial funds. Article 9 in the Patent Law of the People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the patent Law) (the amendment bill for examination), which is a bill of State Intellectual property Office of the People's Republic of China (SIPO) offer for the State Council Legislative Affairs Office (SCLAO), regulated principally the patent ownership, the implementation and the application of inventions-creations created mainly using government funds, and also presented that the specific methods that deal with these issues are regulated specifically by the State Council. In order to better carry out and understand Articles 20 and 21 of the Law on Science and Technology Progress (the amendment bill), and offer suggestions for the amendment of the Patent Law and the Implementing Regulations of Patent Law of the People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the Implementing Regulations of Patent Law), this book tries to discuss the mode of the patent ownership of inventions-creations created by the government funds under different situations, through analysis of the relevant policy history and the existing problems, the ownership mode of inventions-creations, the performance of inventions-creations created by government funds in China.


15.2 The Development and the Defects of the Relevant Policies
The departmental regulations, rules and laws or relevant policies, which concerned the patent ownership of inventions-creations arising government-funded program, have undergone a tortuous development process. It is clear that there are some defects on these policies.

15.2.1 The Development of the Relevant Policies
Among Chinese current laws, the Law on Science and Technology Progress (the amendment bill) is the first law to regulate the relevant issues on the patent ownership of inventions-creations by the government-funded program. Previously, there are some departmental regulations, rules and relevant policies regulated such issues. The development of these departmental regulations, rules and relevant policies may be divided into five stages, according to the mode of the patent ownership of inventions-creations arising government-funded program. The period from 1984 to 1993 is the first stage: the administrative regulations and rules stipulated that the patents are owned by the state. Its mark is Article 7 of the Regulations on the Management of Scientific and Technological Research Achievements (the trial implementation) promulgated by the former State Science and Technology Commission in 1984. The period from 1994 to 1999 is the second stage: the administrative regulations and rules stipulated that the patents ownership is decided with the contracts. Its mark is Article 5 of the Methods on Management of Intellectual Property Rights of National Hi-tech Research and Development Plan (the trial implementation) promulgated by the former State Science and Technology Commission in 1994. The period from 2000 to 2001 is the third stage: the administrative regulations and rules stipulated that patents are owned by the program undertakers, except for special and promissory situations. Its mark is the Several Suggestions on Strengthening of Protection and Management of Intellectual Property Rights Related to Science and Technology promulgated by the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2000. The period from 2002 to 2007 is the fourth stage: the administrative regulations and rules stipulated that patents are owned by the program undertakers, except for special situations. Its mark is Article 1 of the Several Regulations on Management of Intellectual Property Rights of National Scientific and Technological Research Programs Achievements issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Finance together. The period from July 1, 20088 is the fifth stage: the law stipulated that patents are owned by the program undertakers pursuant to the law, except for special situations. Its mark is Articles 20 and 21 of the Law on Science and Technology Progress (the amendment bill) passed on Dec 29, 2007.


15.2.2 The Defects of the Relevant Policies
Before the Law on Science and Technology Progress (the amendment bill) was passed, there are some defects on the departmental regulations, rules and relevant policies about the patent ownership of inventions-creations by the government-funded program in China. First, the content about the ownership of inventions-creations is inconsistent in these policies. For example, the regulations on the condition of the ownership of inventions-creations are different between the Measures on Management of Intellectual Property Rights of National Hi-tech Research and Development Plan (the trial implementation) and the Several Suggestions on Strengthening of Protection and Management of Intellectual Property Rights Related to Science and Technology. Second, the content about the march-in right of the state is out of line. Such as, the regulation about the condition of the march-in right of the state is different between the Several Regulations on Management of Intellectual Property Rights of National Scientific and Technological Research Programs Achievements and the Several Suggestions on Strengthening of Protection and Management of Intellectual Property Rights Related to Science and Technology. Third, the regulation about the rights of inventors or creators is different. Finally, the content about the rights and obligations of the third party participating in the project is indefinite. Such as, the relationship between the rights of the state and the third party is not yet clear, there is no specific regulation to ensure benefits of the third party when the implementation of the march-in right of the state, etc.



15.3 The Analysis on the Ownership Mode of Inventions-Creations by the Government Funds
For the ownership of inventions-creations created by the government funds, the different modes of attribution have a different role on the technological innovation in different periods. The paragraph 1 of Article 20 of the Law on Science and Technology Progress (the amendment bill) and the paragraph 1 of Article 9 in Patent Law (the amendment bill for examination) have regulated the ownership of these inventions-creations; however, these regulations have some flaws.

15.3.1 The Analysis of Advantages and Disadvantages
For the ownership of inventions-creations created by the government funds, many countries passed a transformation process from "getting back of powers" to "devolution of powers", and formed the policy that inventions-creations created by the government funds are owned by program undertakers finally. "Getting back of powers" overemphasizes the public interest. Of course, the realization of public interests is inseparable from the cooperation with R&D institutions. Therefore, the devolution of powers is also in favor to the realization of the objectives of government funds as encouraging technological innovation and technology transfer, rather than damaging public interests. Accordingly, in order to balance the interests of the state, the R&D institutions and the public, and to make sure that the government retains sufficient rights for the interests of the state and the public, it is necessary to appropriately restrict the powers of program undertakers. If all the patents of inventions-creations achieved by research programs mainly using government funds, which is involved with national security or vital interests, are owned by program undertakers, it perhaps breach the objective of government funds and even materially damage the benefit of the state in some time. In the past, to a certain extent it was reasonable to grant the patent ownership of all the invention-creations created by the research programs mainly using government funds to the state, but apparently it is out of time to deal with the patent ownership as such principle nowadays. However, it has certain rationality to grant the patent ownership of inventions-creations created by the research programs mainly using government funds, which is not involved with the national security or vital interests to the state nowadays.


15.3.2 The Latest Policies and Their Flaws
The paragraph 1 of Article 20 of the Law on Science and Technology Progress (the amendment bill) regulates that intellectual property right of the research achievements created by the government funds shall be obtained by program undertakers pursuant to the law, except ones involved with national security, the interest of the state and the important public interests. The paragraph 1 of Article 9 in Patent Law (the amendment bill for examination) regulates that the right of patent applications or the patent right shall belongs to the entity who undertakes the program, except ones involved with the national security or vital interests. It is not only complies with the international development trend, but also conforms to the practical situation in China to grant the right of patents applications or the patent rights of inventions-creations to program undertakers, which is not involved with national security or vital interests. However, this regulation neither defines the ownership of inventions-creations involved with national security or vital interests clearly, nor stipulates the rights of the third party participating in the project. Therefore this book believes that inventions-creations involved with national security or vital interests shall be owned by the state in principle pursuant to the law, and the state shall have the absolute control power due to their significance to the state and the society. However, it is necessary to provide with the relative flexibility of the regulations. So we believe that the principle of agreement priority may be applied for the patent ownership. In other words, the Implementing Regulations of Patent Law should regulate that the right of patent application or the patent rights of invention-creation achieved by scientific research programs mainly using government funds, which is involved with national security or vital interests, shall belong to the state, except the funding agreement is signed for them.


15.3.3 Legislative Proposals
It is very important to precisely define the patent ownership of inventions-creations for improving the efficiency of government funds, the utilization rate of inventions-creations and the enthusiasm of the program undertaker or the third party participating in the program. We believe that the key to determine the patent ownership is to judge whether the invention-creation is involved with the national security or vital interests. The Patent Law (the amendment bill for examination), the Several Suggestions on Strengthening of Protection and Management of Intellectual Property Rights Related to Science and Technology, the Several Regulations on Management of Intellectual Property Rights of National Scientific and Technological Research Programs Achievements, the Regulations on Strengthening of Management of Intellectual Property Rights of National Scientific and Technological Programs in China and the Bayh-Dole Act in the United States, all regulate that the ownership of research achievements of programs using the government funds belongs to program undertakers, except the exceptional cases. However, it is not easy to regulate such exceptional cases exactly for with the change of situations these exceptional cases perhaps to change. Consequently, this book suggests that the Enforcement Regulations for Patent Law should regulate the time, the agencies and the procedures of the definition of the national security or vital interests.



15.4 The Impact of the Modes of Ownership on the Amounts of Inventions-Creations
The different modes of ownership of inventions-creations created by the government funds play different incentive roles for inventors. This section analysis the choice of the optimal models though the comparative between the amounts of inventions-creations created by the government funds and the amount of government-funded.

15.4.1 Comparative Between the Amounts of the Service Invention Patents and the Government Funds
The data of the applications and grants of the invention patents of the research programs funded by the government cannot be collected under existing conditions, so the applications and grants of the domestic service invention patents substitute for the applications and grants of invention patents of research programs funded by the government in this comparative analysis. This book believes that the change trend of the relation between the applications and grants of the domestic service invention patents and the government funds is reflected the change trend of the relation between the applications and grants of the invention patents created by government funds and the amount of subsidy of the government.
From Fig. 15.1, we could see that the amount of government funds increased steadily from 2000 to 2006. Moreover, both the applications and the grants of the domestic service invention patents increased obviously, especially the patents applications during this period. Maybe the granting of the invention patents needed a certain period, so the patents granted grew more slowly. But the invention patents applications and granted increased greatly from 2002 to 2003. We think that this increase trend indicates the impact of the Several Regulations on Management of Intellectual Property Rights of National Scientific and Technological Research Programs Achievements
9 on technological innovation. In other words, the ownership mode that the patent of inventions-creations created by scientific and technological research programs grant program undertakers except special situations promoted the technological innovation.Fig. 15.1Comparative between the application and grants of the service invention patents and the government funds. Data sources China's major science and technology indicators database, http://​www.​sts.​org.​cn/​kjnew/​maintitle/​MainTitle.​htm 2008-5-5



15.4.2 Comparative Between the Achievements of NKTRP and the Government Funds
The National Key Technologies R&D Program (NKTRP) is the first national S&T program in China. It aims to study major S&T issues in the national economic construction and social development. This program has solved a number of technological problems during the national economic and social development, which plays an important leading role in the technological development and structural readjustment of major industries in China, forms lots of scientific and technological achievements, lays the technological groundwork and enhances the innovation ability to bring about a great increase of overall level of our scientific and technological work.
The Fig. 15.2 shows the development trends of the achievements (including patents application, invention patents application, patents granted and invention patents granted) of NKTRP and the government funds during from 2000 to 2006. It indicates that the amounts of the government funds on NKTRP increased steadily during this period. However, the achievements achieved by NKTRP in the two periods from 2000 to 200110 and from 2005 to 2006 obviously decrease, but the achievements achieved by NKTRP obviously increase in two periods from 2002 to 2003 and from 2004 to 2005. These facts also show that the ownership mode promoted the technological innovation, which is determined the Several Regulations on Management of Intellectual Property Rights of National Scientific and Technological Research Programs Achievements.Fig. 15.2Comparative of the achievements of NKTRP and the government funds. Data sources China's major science and technology indicators database, http://​www.​sts.​org.​cn/​kjnew/​maintitle/​MainTitle.​htm 2008-5-5



15.4.3 Comparative Between the Achievements of NPKBRD and the Government Funds
The basic research is a driving force for the progress of human civilization, a source of economic development. Significant breakthroughs from the basic research often trigger remarkable changes in economic and social sectors. Therefore, the State Science and Education Steering Group decided to formulate the National Plan on Key Basic Research and Development (NPKBRD) and organize the implementation of the National Program on Key Basic Research Project (973 Program) in 1997. The purpose of these two initiatives is to strengthen the basic research in line with national strategic targets. The strategic objective of the Program is to mobilize China's scientific talents in conducting innovative research on major scientific issues in agriculture, energy, information, resources and environment, population and health, materials, and related areas.
The Fig. 15.3 shows the information of patents application, invention patents application, patents granted and invention patents created by NPKBRD and the amounts of government funds from 2000 to 2006.11 We could see that the investment on NPKBRD by the state steadily increase during this period, however, patents application, invention patents application increased greatly from 2000 to 2006, especially from 2002 to 2003. Patents granted and invention patents granted increased greatly from 2000 to 2004, especially from 2002 to 2003, but compared with the information in 2004, this growth trend of patents granted and invention patents granted decreased in 2006. In other words, the Fig. 15.3 also shows that the ownership mode promoted the technological innovation, which is determined the Several Regulations on Management of Intellectual Property Rights of National Scientific and Technological Research Programs Achievements.Fig. 15.3Comparative analysis of the achievements NPKBRD and the government funds. Data sources China's major science and technology indicators database, http://​www.​sts.​org.​cn/​kjnew/​maintitle/​MainTitle.​htm 2008-5-5

Form the above discussion, the conclusion can be reached that the ownership mode, which is determined intellectual property rights created by scientific and technological research programs grant program undertakers except special situations, is an optimal way to promote the technological innovation.



15.5 Conclusions
It is crucial to settle the patent ownership of inventions-creations achieved by research programs by the government funds for accelerate the commercialization of inventions-creations and enhance the state's competitiveness. It is also very necessary to choice the optimal model with the principle of balancing the benefits of the state, program undertakers and the public. Therefore, according to the conclusions from Sects. 15.3 and 15.4, and Articles 20 and 21 of the Law on Science and Technology Progress (the amendment bill), for the patent ownership of inventions-creations created mainly by the government funds in the Patent Law (the amendment bill for examination) and the Enforcement Regulations for Patent Law, this book puts forward following suggestions: Among inventions-creations created by research programs mainly using the government funds, the right of patent application or the patent right of the ones involved with national security or vital interests shall belong to the state, except the funding agreement signed for it; the right of patent application or the patent right of the ones not involved with national security or vital interests shall belong to program undertakers; if the program is also funded by the third party, the right of patent application or the patent right shall be agreed by program undertaker and the third party in written, in case there is no agreement or the agreement is not explicitly, the right of patent application or the patent right shall belong to program undertakers.

Preface

The patent is closely related to the technological innovation, and the output of patents is a key indicator for evaluating the technological innovation capability. In some countries, the output of patents has been used to evaluate the technological innovation capability of a country, region or organization. The attractiveness of a technology as an investment object depends decisively on its current life cycle stage. It is a widespread approach to study technology life cycles by observing the evolution of patent applications and the patent maintenance time. Patent activity is also used to describe life cycles at the levels of products and industries from the patent maintenance perspective. The maintenance time of patents also is one of the key indicators for evaluating technological innovation capabilities of their owners. In recent years, the number of patent applications and the number of granted patents in China have both greatly increased. The maintenance time of granted patents in China, especially them of granted patents owned by patentee, gradually became of longer duration. Therefore, the study of the maintenance time of granted patents in China has important significance for the promotion of innovation and industrial development.
Five chapters of this book were mainly developed by Yongzhong Qiao, other ten chapters were developed by Yongzhong Qiao and his co-authors. These authors include Xuezhong Zhu, Qi Liang, Siwen Liu, Tiantian Zhang, Yan Sun, Yan Zhang, Wanlin Tan, Jun Shen, and Peng Hao. Their contributions to the book were marked in the right places.
