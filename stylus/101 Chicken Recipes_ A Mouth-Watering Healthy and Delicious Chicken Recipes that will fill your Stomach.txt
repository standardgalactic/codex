Conclusion
Chicken is a very good source of lean, high quality protein which is an essential nutrient for growth and is important in assisting overweight and obese people. For older people, the proteins in chicken help against bone loss. Eating 100 gm of chicken breast gives you half the daily protein requirement. Chicken is a good source of B-vitamin that protects the body against cancer. High protein gives the body enough energy to function properly. Phosphorus in it helps maintain the health of teeth and bones, and also ensures healthy functioning of the kidneys, liver and the central nervous system.
Consuming a higher protein diet can help you lose weight. Protein helps regulate appetite and cravings by enhancing the feeling of fullness for longer after a meal or snack. Your protein needs are determined by lean body mass, not calories, so as calories are decreased on a weight loss plan, protein intake should stay the same, or possibly even increase in order to preserve muscle. If you want to build and maintain muscle mass, you need to eat enough dietary protein. Dietary proteins play a crucial role in both muscle and bone maintenance. Strong muscles help protect bones from conditions like osteoporosis, and eating enough protein protects against progressive muscle loss with age. Dietary protein is known to stimulate growth factors that strengthen bone and muscle, as well as increase calcium absorption. In older adults, more than the current Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) may be better, as senior adults require more protein to build and maintain muscle than do younger people.
Chicken meat is high in calories, low in fat, high in protein, and high in nutrients and vitamins which makes it an ideal food for weight maintenance. It is very safe, healthy and light food if any vegetarian wants to start eating non-veggie food. It is such a versatile ingredient and super easy to cook healthy dishes with. Indulge yourself in these delicious and healthy chicken recipes for a delicious meal that will help keep your weight in check.
