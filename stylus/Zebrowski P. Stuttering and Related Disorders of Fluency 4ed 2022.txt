Important note: Medicine is an ever-changing science undergoing
continual development. Research and clinical experience are
continually expanding our knowledge, in particular our knowledge
of proper treatment and drug therapy. Insofar as this book
mentions any dosage or application, readers may rest assured that
the authors, editors, and publishers have made every eﬀort to
ensure that such references are in accordance with the state of
knowledge at the time of production of the book.
Nevertheless, this does not involve, imply, or express any
guarantee or responsibility on the part of the publishers in
respect to any dosage instructions and forms of applications
stated in the book. Every user is requested to examine carefully
the manufacturers' leaflets accompanying each drug and to check,
if necessary in consultation with a physician or specialist, whether
the dosage schedules mentioned therein or the contraindications
stated by the manufacturers diﬀer from the statements made in
the present book. Such examination is particularly important
with drugs that are either rarely used or have been newly
released on the market. Every dosage schedule or every form
of application used is entirely at the user's own risk and
responsibility. The authors and publishers request every user to
report to the publishers any discrepancies or inaccuracies noticed.
If errors in this work are found after publication, errata will be
posted at www.thieme.com on the product description page.
Some of the product names, patents, and registered designs
referred to in this book are in fact registered trademarks or
proprietary names even though specific reference to this fact is
not always made in the text. Therefore, the appearance of a name
without designation as proprietary is not to be construed as a
representation by the publisher that it is in the public domain.
Thieme addresses people of all gender identities equally. We
encourage our authors to use gender-neutral or gender-equal
expressions wherever the context allows.
This book, including all parts thereof, is legally protected by
copyright. Any use, exploitation, or commercialization outside the
narrow limits set by copyright legislation, without the publisher's

For Ray—my steadfast partner then, now, and everywhere in between. I love you. And for the mentors, students,
colleagues, and the people who stutter and have shared themselves with me. You have been my greatest teachers,
and I am forever grateful for what I learned from you.
Patricia M. Zebrowski
To my family who have always been there for me, my students who have challenged me to be a better
professor, and my cats who kept me company as I wrote (even though they sometimes made it diﬃcult
to type or sat on the keyboard).
Julie D. Anderson
To the many family members, friends, mentors, professors, students, and teachers who helped me take
the road, in the words of Robert Frost, "...less traveled by, and that has made all the diﬀerence."

Foreword
When I received an invitation from Patricia M. Zebrowski,
Julie D. Anderson, and Edward G. Conture to write this
foreword for their book, it provided me with an extraor-
dinary and unexpected opportunity to consider the cur-
rent evidence in the field, especially as it relates to our
clients and families. I have sat at the feet of these authors
(literally, on one occasion, as there were no empty seats
in the auditorium at ASHA!). I am in awe of their aston-
ishing intellect, their phenomenal clinical skills, and their
vast experience in the world of stuttering and I know that
anything they teach is worth learning, anything they say
is worth listening to, and anything they write is worth
reading.
Throughout this text, one can hear the authors' voices—
their personal styles shine through in a very engaging
way. Their depth of knowledge and enthusiasm for their
area of expertise jump out from their chapters. They bring
therapy to life in the case examples they describe. I am
fortunate to know most of these contributors and you will
too by the time you have finished reading their chapters.
And if you are wise, you will open other journals and
books and attend conferences and courses and webinars,
where you will encounter them and other talented col-
leagues who share this quest to understand more about
stuttering to be the best researcher, teacher, and therapist
you can be.
It is my honor to follow in the footsteps of—and cur-
rently head up—a team of phenomenally talented thera-
pists at the Michael Palin Centre. As a specialist center for
stammering, as we Brits call it, it is our responsibility to
maintain the highest possible level of knowledge and
expertise to support our clients—children, teenagers,
parents, adults—as well as our therapy colleagues. Some
questions from clients and families truly stretch us, neces-
sitating some research before we can give an informed
response. We hold a responsibility to impart knowledge
and advice and to deliver therapy services which are
based on sound and contemporary theoretical evidence
and learning from our expert colleagues in other settings.
To that end, this text is an extraordinary synthesis of a
vast array of academic, research, and clinical expertise.
The editors have invited contributions from the key
authorities in the world of stuttering and related fluency
disorders. Readers will acquire a comprehensive under-
standing of the wide range and depth of research and
practical methodology.
In sections I and II, various authors who are at the heart
of the current explosion in our knowledge base take us
through the common characteristics and the theories
of stuttering, going into depth on the genetic, speech,
language, and cognitive, neural and physiological, and the
temperamental and emotional processes associated with
stuttering. An in-depth and yet concise summary of the
research and our theoretical understanding about stutter-
ing are presented by those who have undertaken the stud-
ies and made the learning accessible so that it can be
translated into our clinical practice. These chapters are a
wonderful resource as we seek to understand stuttering
so that we can, in turn, explain it to our students, our
therapist colleagues, the children, young people, parents,
and adults who seek our help, as well as wider society.
These six chapters will equip us for this task as well as
point us to more sources of research to encourage us to
keep learning and deepening our understanding.
In section III, a range of expert therapists in pre-school,
school-age, adolescent, and adult stuttering provide us
with detailed and highly practical descriptions of the
assessment and diagnosis of stuttering. A therapist who is
not sure what to do with a child or adult who is referred
for evaluation can simply follow the content of these
chapters. In doing so, they will cover all the important
aspects which will equip them and their clients to make
sound decisions about next steps.
Section IV takes the reader through the many therapy
options across the age ranges, with contributions from
highly experienced therapists, covering a wide range of
approaches. Importantly, the theoretical framework and
rationales are presented, enabling readers to consider how
diﬀerent approaches might suit diﬀerent children and cli-
ents. Further reading and training will help the therapists
to develop their knowledge and skills with these diﬀerent
approaches, and this comprehensive summary will help
steer that ongoing process.
In section V, we are provided with an invaluable under-
standing of language, phonological, bilingual, and multi-
cultural considerations in assessment and treatment,
followed by a summary of the research on pharmacology.
The authors are leaders in these fields, and in these
chapters, the reader will find answers to many questions
we are asked by families and colleagues, as well as
pointers to further research to give depth to our knowl-
edge. Finally, section VI covers cluttering and acquired
stuttering. It may be that these are conditions that thera-
pists encounter less frequently and about which they con-
sequently feel less knowledgeable, skillful, and confident.
The two chapters in this section present an up-to-date
and concise summary of the relevant research and therapy
approaches, again from researchers and therapists who
are expert in these areas, equipping us all to expand our
own spheres of understanding, confidence, and expertise.

I have had the privilege of working in the field of stut-
tering and cluttering for many years than I care to admit.
How come I have not diversified, become bored with this
area, branched out into something shiny and new? The
simple answer is because I have never stopped learning,
being challenged, being inspired. I am where I am because
I have learned so much from my colleagues across the
globe. There is always something shiny and new to learn
about, to challenge my preconceptions, to stretch my
thinking, to try out and evaluate. We are all a work in
progress and this book is an invaluable tool in our ongoing
development.

Preface
"Life is divided into three terms—that which was, which is,
and which will be. Let us learn from the past to profit by the
present and from the present live better in the future."
William Wordsworth (b. 1770, d. 1850)
Inspired by Mr. Wordsworth's philosophy, our goal for
the revised edition of this book is to provide students with
an understanding of how the past informs our present
understanding of stuttering. Our hope is that by honoring
both, we will create a bright future of promise for people
who stutter and the clinicians and researchers who are
their allies.
Initially developed over 30 years ago, the first three
editions of this book bore the same title; the first two
were edited by the late Dr. Richard F. Curlee and the last
was co-edited by Dr. Curlee and Dr. Edward G. Conture.
Dr. Curlee was a broad-minded clinician and scholar,
whose wide and deep knowledge of stuttering was the
catalyst for bringing together a diverse set of contributors
in those earlier editions of this book. Walking in the foot-
steps of Dr. Curlee, we believe and hope that this fourth
edition is true to the notion, as Wordsworth proposed,
that the discoveries of the past are the bedrock of the
present and the inspiration for our future explorations
into the nature and treatment of stuttering. Beginning
with basic facts and theories, the chapter contents tran-
sition to describe the key factors that likely contribute
to the emergence and development of stuttering. This
content sets the stage for subsequent chapters on the
comprehensive evaluation and treatment of stuttering
and related fluency disorders across the lifespan.
We received contributions from among the best and
brightest academicians, clinicians, and researchers in the
field of stuttering and related disorders. Their names and
reputations speak for themselves, but it is the collective
wisdom and experience of each one of these authors that
makes the whole of the book greater than the sum of its
parts. Each chapter has been thoroughly edited and
reviewed by the co-editors to ensure that the material is
as accessible as possible to both students and instructors
alike. Some of the areas covered in this book may be on
the frontiers of some readers' knowledge, but rest assured
all represent active, current, and important topics that
need to be included in any modern-day, comprehensive
discussion of the nature and treatment of stuttering.
Last, but not least, we acknowledge our friends and
loved ones who often had to share our attention and time
"with the book." Their advice, suggestions, and support
along the way have been invaluable. That said, whatever
flaws that remain are totally the editors' doing. We remain
humbled by the enormity of the landscape our chapter
authors have helped us traverse, while at the same time
remain excited by the positive impact this work will have
on the future of people who stutter and their families.
As Daniel Goleman, of emotional intelligence fame, has
suggested, "Nothing important gets done alone." Nothing
more truly describes the combined eﬀorts of chapter
authors, book co-editors, and Thieme staﬀin the develop-
ment of this book!

1 Common Characteristics
Edward G. Conture, Victoria Tumanova, and Dahye Choi
Abstract
The purpose of this chapter is to describe and discuss some of
the more common characteristics of stuttering, particularly in
children. The chapter begins with a definition of stuttering, inci-
dence and prevalence, the types of speech disfluencies most apt
to be judged as stuttering, measures of stuttering and associated
variables as well as nonspeech behaviors associated with stut-
tering. Following that, the chapter describes basic facts about
stuttering, for example, variability, an important hallmark of
stuttering. Finally, the chapter discusses some of the more
common behaviors (e.g., singing) and conditions (e.g., delayed
auditory feedback) associated with decreases in stuttering. Under-
lying the above information is the fact that stuttering begins in
early childhood, with more children exhibiting mild than severe
stuttering, and that more children recover (70-80%) from stutter-
ing than persist (20-30%). Although the precise mechanism that
causes stuttering to emerge in young children remains unclear,
multifactorial perspectives suggest that causation involves inter-
actions among a finite number of variables. Available information
further suggests that stuttering does not randomly occur within
an utterance; rather it appears to be associated with speech-
language aspects of the utterance (e.g., adjectives, adverbs, nouns,
and verbs). Some of these speech-language aspects associated
with instances of stuttering may be unique to the individual who
stutters (e.g., stuttering on words that begin with "f"), while
others are more common for many people who stutter (e.g., stut-
tering on words in the beginning of the utterance).
Keywords: stuttering, common characteristics, basic facts,
children
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the most common
and well-documented characteristics of stuttering. Although no
single chapter can include all such characteristics, our descrip-
tion should provide readers with a broad perspective regarding
stuttering behaviors and associated phenomena. With such a
perspective, the reader will better appreciate the information
presented in subsequent chapters discussing constitutional and
environmental processes associated with stuttering as well as
assessment and treatment of stuttering.
1.2 Common Characteristics:
Definitions of Stuttering, Speech
Disfluency Types and Stuttered
and Nonstuttered Disfluencies
1.2.1 Definition
Stuttering is a speech disorder that typically emerges in early
childhood (i.e., for most children, stuttering onset occurs
between 2.5 and 4 years of age). Stuttering is typically charac-
terized by frequent repetitions of sounds (e.g., "S-s-see the
dog") and monosyllabic words (e.g., "I-I-I am going"), sound
prolongations, and interruptions in the forward flow of
speech, often accompanied by physical muscle tension and
struggle. The disorder has a lifetime incidence of approxi-
mately 5 to 8%, with prevalence of approximately 1% at any
one point in time.1,2 Stuttering can significantly impact child-
ren's academic, emotional, and social abilities as well as their
later vocational potential and achievements.3,4 As is true with
many disorders, early detection followed by appropriate inter-
vention has been shown to increase the odds of a successful
outcome.
Stuttering can also occur, although less commonly, in older
individuals experiencing neurodegenerative disease, stroke,
traumatic brain injury, tumors, emotional trauma, and psychi-
atric disorders. For the purpose of this chapter, we will focus
on developmental stuttering, which typically begins in early
childhood. Adult-onset stuttering is discussed in detail in
▶Chapter 17 of this book.
1.2.2 Speech Disfluency Types
Speech disfluency refers to any interruption in the rhythm and
forward flow of speech. For example, when saying the sentence,
"Bobby look at this," someone may say the word "Bobby" as
"B-B-Bobby," repeating the first sound of the word multiple
times. This type of speech disfluency is described as a "sound/
syllable repetition" (i.e., "part-word repetition"). If in the same
sentence someone repeats the first word multiple times,
"Bobby-Bobby look at this," then this speech disfluency would
be described as a multisyllabic whole-word repetition.
1.2.3 Stuttered and Nonstuttered
Disfluencies
Naïve listeners as well as expert clinicians and researchers most
frequently judge the following types of speech disfluencies to be
"stuttered": sound/syllable repetitions, audible and inaudible
sound prolongations (the latter, in particular, often referred to as
"blocks"), monosyllabic whole-word repetitions, and within-
word pauses. Listeners are apt to notice these speech disfluencies
in someone's speech and perceive them as diﬀerent, atypical, or
abnormal. People who stutter often report that these "stuttered"
disfluencies are associated with a feeling of loss of control and
tension. On the other hand, listeners more typically perceive
phrase repetitions, revisions of words, phrases, and sentences,
interjections (e.g., "uh," "um"), and repetitions of multisyllabic
words to be normal, "not stuttered," or typical. Often, listeners
do not notice these speech disfluencies in their own or someone
else's speech. Further, speakers do not usually associate these
more typical speech disfluencies as being connected with any
specific feeling, such as loss of control or tension.
To assess someone's speech fluency, clinicians and researchers
count both types of speech disfluency: stuttered (e.g., "I-I-I
3

will go") and nonstuttered (e.g., "I will-I will go"). The typical
way to do this is to obtain a speech sample, usually during a
conversation, and an oral reading sample for those children
and adults who can read. Based on these samples and associated
counts of stuttered and nonstuttered disfluencies, the examiner
can determine the frequency of stuttered and nonstuttered dis-
fluencies, important measures of any comprehensive assess-
ment of stuttering. We will provide a bit more detail regarding
these measures in the following sections.
Of these two categories of stuttered and nonstuttered dis-
fluencies, it is the stuttered disfluency that is of primary focus
during an assessment for stuttering. Typically, the examiner
focuses on stuttered disfluencies because he or she is trying to
determine whether someone stutters as well as determine the
severity of their stuttering. Measures of stuttering frequency
and severity are clinically important because they contribute to
the diagnosis of stuttering and inform the decisions about the
need for therapeutic intervention.
It should be noted, however, that although stuttering fre-
quency and severity are related to one another, they are not
identical measures (more about each measure later). As sug-
gested earlier, these two measures—stuttering frequency and
stuttering severity—are usually considered together to achieve
a comprehensive index of stuttering. Although we described
"stuttered" and "nonstuttered" as two diﬀerent types of dis-
fluencies earlier, it should be noted that some stuttered disfluen-
cies (e.g., brief sound prolongations) are not always perceived as
stuttering. Likewise, some nonstuttered disfluencies may be per-
ceived as stuttered (e.g., multiple repetitions of an interjection).
Despite these challenges to measurement accuracy, ▶Table 1.1
provides examples of the diﬀerent types of speech disfluencies
and whether they are most apt to be judged by listeners as stut-
tered or nonstuttered (i.e., typical).
1.3 Common Characteristics:
Measures of Stuttering and
Associated Variables
1.3.1 Stuttering Frequency
As mentioned earlier, stuttering frequency and severity are the
two most common measures of stuttering. Again, the first
measure, stuttering frequency, involves a count of the number
of stuttered disfluencies per X number of syllables or words
spoken (often expressed as "percent syllables stuttered" or
"percent words stuttered"). Although counting syllables versus
words when measuring stuttering frequency is the source of
some debate among clinicians and researchers, both measures
allow the examiner to come reasonably close to the same con-
clusion in terms of the frequency of stuttering.
1.3.2 Stuttering Severity
The second measure of stuttering is stuttering severity. In gen-
eral, stuttering severity is a description of the degree to which
stuttering interferes with typical speaking/communication. The
degree of severity ranges from not very serious (i.e., mild) to
quite serious (i.e., severe). Specifically, stuttering severity is
often indexed by an overall or composite score that may be
based on several measures. For example, the Stuttering Severity
Instrument,
fourth
edition
(SSI-4)5
determines
stuttering
severity by considering the following measures: (1) frequency
of instances of stuttering (stuttered disfluencies), (2) the aver-
age duration of the three longest instances of stuttering, and
(3) the quantity and quality of associated nonspeech behaviors
(see the explanation later). The SSI-4 is one of the norm-
referenced assessments of stuttering severity although other
assessments can also be employed to assess stuttering severity
(e.g., Test of Childhood Stuttering [TOCS]).6
1.3.3 Associated (Non) Speech Behaviors
The speech and nonspeech behaviors associated with stuttering—
also referred to in the literature as accessory or secondary behav-
iors as well as physical concomitants—can run the gamut from
minimally to very apparent.2,7 Indeed, as experienced clinicians
can attest, parents may have little concern about their child's
repetition of whole words (e.g., "I-I-I want a cookie"). However,
if the child also tightly closes his or her eyelids and/or sharply
turns his or her head to the side while saying "I-I-I- want a
cookie," the parents are much more likely to be concerned and
seek professional advice, whether from a speech-language path-
ologist or a pediatrician.
The quantity and quality of these associated behaviors are
quite varied across people who stutter. However, in young

(e.g., "T-[0.750 seconds silence while person holds articulatory posture
for 't']-oday is Monday")
Inaudible sound prolongations shorter than 0.500 seconds
(e.g. "T-[0.250-second silence while person holds articulatory posture
for 't']-oday is Monday")
Interjections (repeated multiple times); e.g., "I will, ah, ah, ah, ah, be late"
Interjections (repeated once); e.g., "I will, ah, be late"

children who stutter, these behaviors can include eyeball
movements (e.g., looking to one side or the other), eyelids
opening and closing (or sometimes even fluttering), turning of
the head to one side or the other, lip pressing, or pitch rises
(these behaviors are just examples; such behaviors may occur
with some but not every instance of stuttering). Movements of
the arms and torso as well as alterations in breathing may also
accompany instances of stuttering, but such "larger muscle"
movements are more apt to be observed in older children,
teens, and adults who stutter than in younger children.
Speaker's associated nonspeech behaviors may "...reflect a
variety of cognitive, emotional, linguistic and physical events
associated with childhood stuttering".7 The following describes
but a few examples of what these nonspeech behaviors may
reflect:
●Overflow behavior: Facial or bodily acts and movements that
one might see, for example, when a person is having trouble
opening a jar.
●Reduction in aversive listener feedback or reaction: A child
closing his or her eyelids, for example, during an instance of
stuttering to minimize viewing a listener's startled or
concerned expression or reaction.
●Ongoing cognitive or emotional activity: A person's attempt to
avoid or not stutter, for example, by consciously selecting
words believed to be less likely to be stuttered and/or an
(un)conscious emotional reactions to an instance of stuttering.
Despite the apparent "uniqueness" of these associated (non)
speech behaviors, most clinicians focus on modifying the child's
speech disfluencies and/or any concomitant speech-language
processes (e.g., diﬃculties with speech sound articulation8) that
seems to contribute to these speech disfluencies. Nevertheless,
the relation between the nonspeech behaviors associated with
instances of stuttering remains a very intriguing window of
observation through which to view the possible mechanisms
associated with and/or underlying instances of stuttering.
1.3.4 Speaking Rate and Speech
Naturalness
Speaking rate and speech naturalness are two additional meas-
ures (besides stuttering frequency and severity) that can be
considered when determining the degree to which stuttering
interferes with verbal communication.
Speaking rate is important to consider because instances of
stuttering consume a portion of a person's speaking time. Thus,
the more instances of stuttering a speaker produces, the more
speaking time is consumed. This, in turn, impacts the number
of overall words spoken for any time period, which can interfere
with successful and eﬃcient communication. There are two
ways that speaking rate can be measured. One way is to meas-
ure how many words or syllables a person says during their
utterances. This measure includes pauses that speakers nor-
mally have in their utterances. The resulting measure is called
the overall speaking rate. It is relatively easy to calculate and
only requires a stopwatch. Another way to measure speaking
rate is by only considering fluent sounds and words produced
by a speaker. This measure is called the articulatory rate.
Articulatory rate is computed by calculating the number of
fluent sounds or syllables produced per unit of time, with all
disfluencies and pauses longer than 250 milliseconds removed
from the total length of the speaking sample. The resulting
articulatory rate reflects the speaker's rate of producing fluent
speech. Articulatory rate calculation requires the use of acous-
tic analysis software and is more time-consuming than the
calculation of the overall speaking rate, which may be the rea-
son why it is mostly used in research. Further, articulatory rate
does not distinguish children who do from those who do not
stutter, but overall speaking rate does. That is, higher fre-
quency and longer duration of speech disfluencies produced
by children who stutter yield them a significantly slower over-
all speaking rate when compared to their nonstuttering peers.
Speech naturalness is another measure of how much stuttering
interferes with typical communication. This measure includes
clinical judgments about how typical and natural someone's
speech sounds and its degree of intelligibility. Although some
clinical tests for stuttering assessment (e.g., SSI-4) include a
Likert-type scale (e.g., 0 = very mild to 7 = very severe), judgments
of speech naturalness are less often similarly scaled. In general,
factors mentioned earlier (i.e., frequency and severity of stutter-
ing, presence of associated [non]speech behaviors, speaking rate)
aﬀect listener's judgments of speech naturalness. Nevertheless,
since diﬀerent listeners may have unique criteria for how
"natural" speech should sound, ratings of speech naturalness
remain somewhat subjective. Regardless, for people who stut-
ter, speech naturalness remains an important consideration
for the diagnosis and treatment of stuttering, especially given
that few treatments of stuttering are designed to result in
unusual or unnatural sounding speech.
In sum, although all of the measures reviewed earlier can
augment one's description of stuttering, the primary measures
used to index a change in stuttering, especially change associ-
ated with therapeutic intervention, are measures of stuttering
frequency and overall stuttering severity.
1.4 Common Characteristics:
Variability (General Aspects)
1.4.1 Variability
One of the more common characteristics of instances of stutter-
ing is that they change, fluctuate, or vary in frequency of occur-
rence. To understand stuttering is to understand that it varies.
Although there is variability in stuttering between people who
stutter (not all people stutter in the same way), in the following
we will focus on the variability that can occur within a person
who stutters. Simply put, a person who stutter's stuttering may
change if there are changes in the speaking environment (e.g.,
home vs. clinic), listeners (e.g., parent vs. clinician or friends vs.
strangers), nature of the speaking task (e.g., conversation vs.
reading), time of day (e.g., morning vs. afternoon), fatigue level
(e.g., after a restful night's sleep vs. after a day of intense cogni-
tive and physical activity), presence of positive emotion (e.g.,
child speaking at their birthday party),9 and so on.10
People who stutter and their family are usually aware of and
perplexed by such day-to-day or moment-to-moment changes
in stuttering frequency and are unlikely to know how to inter-
pret such variability. One helpful thing to keep in mind is that
the knowledge regarding stuttering variability can (and should)
1.4 Common Characteristics: Variability (General Aspects)
5

temper one's concern after observing a day's worth of frequent
stuttering. With such knowledge, an observer may be better
able to see that over-concern about a day of highly frequent
stuttering is no wiser than under-concern about a day's worth
of totally fluent speech! This inherent quality of stuttering—its
variability—also has important implications for clinicians who
treat and researchers who study stuttering. For example, to
capture the true nature of stuttering during assessment, a clini-
cian may need to obtain several samples of speaking at begin-
ning, middle, and end of assessment as well as across days or
weeks and then calculate the person's central tendency (i.e.,
average) as well as minimum and maximum frequency of stut-
tering across such time spans. Alternatively, a clinician could
ask the child's parent or caregiver (or the person who stutters)
how representative the speech sample was of the child's stut-
tering in everyday life (e.g., did the child [you] stutter more,
less, or about the same as they [you] usually do?).
Such variability is one reason why some clinicians will ask
the child's caregivers—particularly when the type or frequency
of the child's speech disfluencies is on the cusp between normal
and stuttered—to record a speech sample from home or to
bring the child back in 3 months or so for a second evaluation
and/or before formal therapy begins. In this way, the child's per-
formance at the first evaluation and the second evaluation can
be compared and contrasted. Similar multisampling advice may
be applied to tracking treatment progress over time. To illus-
trate this point, ▶Fig. 1.1 graphically illustrates stuttering varia-
bility exhibited by a young child who stutters across several
weekly therapy sessions (as measured by their clinician). Expe-
rienced clinicians will continue to sample and record stuttering
frequency at consecutive therapy sessions to thoroughly docu-
ment ongoing changes in the child's speech fluency.
In sum, it is important to understand that for an individual
who stutters their stuttering frequency of today may diﬀer
from their stuttering frequency of tomorrow. Such fluctuations,
while a common characteristic of stuttering, are important to
note for both the diagnosis and treatment of stuttering.
1.4.2 Non-normally Distributed
Students and clinicians alike may wonder when they see the
header "non-normal distribution" why a "statistical" issue is
presented in a more clinically oriented text. The reason is sim-
ple: stuttering frequency (at least in children) is not normally
distributed. That is, rather than the usual bell curve that repre-
sents the so-called normal distribution, the curve of stuttering
in children is skewed to the right.11,12 This means that for the
population of children who stutter, there are more children
whose stuttering frequency is relatively low (▶Fig. 1.2). In
essence, more children cluster at the low (less often) end of the
Fig. 1.2 Non-normal distribution of stuttered
disfluencies in preschool-age children who do
stutter (n = 210) and who do not stutter
(typically fluent; n = 199). These graphs display
these two groups of preschool-age children's
percent stuttered disfluencies per total words
spoken during conversational speech. (Adapted
from Tumanova et al.12) The number of children
for each vertical bar of stuttering are represented
on the ordinate or vertical axis for each talker
group. Although 10 children who did not stutter
had 2.6% stuttered disfluencies in their speech,
the graphical software used to make this figure
rounded that value to 3.

ing across treatment sessions. Fluctuations in or

stuttering frequency distribution than the high (more often)
end of the stuttering frequency distribution. Why should stu-
dents and clinicians care?
People who diagnose, treat, and study stuttering should care
because the non-normal distribution of stuttering means that
student-clinicians, practicing clinicians, and researchers are
more apt to encounter children with lesser than greater
amounts or frequencies of stuttering. Below we provide an
illustration of variability of stuttered disfluencies across a rela-
tively large sample of children who stutter.12 It is important to
know that children with relatively low stuttering frequency
(and likely less severe stuttering) are truly children who stutter,
not merely some relatively fluent normally fluent children. And
yes, normally fluent children produce speech disfluencies, just
not as frequently and far less of the kind that children who stut-
ter more frequently produce (i.e., sound/syllable repetitions and
sound prolongations). Indeed, it is this fact—greater numbers of
children with low rather than high frequency of stuttering—
that may cause some children with bona fide but relatively low
stuttering frequency to fall through the cracks and not receive
needed treatment. This fact also suggests that many reported
studies of stuttering, particularly in children, may include more
children with low (compared to high) frequency of stuttering.
Forearmed is forewarned.
1.5 Common Characteristics:
Variability (Specific Aspects)
In the earlier section, we discussed variability of stuttering in
general. We should note, however, that there are specific condi-
tions in which stuttering varies in a relatively predictable way.
In the following section, we discuss these conditions and their
implications for clinical practice.
1.5.1 Adaptation Eﬀect
One of the earliest studied aspects of stuttering variability was
"adaptation" or, as it is commonly referred to, the "adaptation
eﬀect." The adaptation eﬀect was initially observed in adults
when they read aloud the same passage several times in a row.13
This initial study was published over 80 years ago and was fol-
lowed by numerous empirical studies of stuttering adaptation in
children and adults. Indeed, adaptation of stuttering was one of
the more frequently studied basic characteristics of stuttering;
however, more recently, there have been fewer published inves-
tigations of the phenomenon.
In brief, adaptation of stuttering (or the "adaptation eﬀect")
refers to decreases in stuttering frequency during successive
oral readings or speaking of the same material (as shown in
▶Fig. 1.3 for one individual who stutters). This decrease, aver-
aged across people who stutter, is about 50%. In other words,
there is a 50% decrease in stuttering from the first to the fifth
oral reading of the same text.13,14 Thus, adaptation, as described
here, is a specific condition in which stuttering varies in a rela-
tively predictable way.
The adaptation eﬀect can be mitigated (i.e., the reduction in
stuttering would be smaller during successive oral readings)
in several ways, including (1) increasing the time interval in
between successive readings, (2) increasing the number of lis-
teners with each successive oral reading, and (3) changing the
material that is read or spoken in each of the successive read-
ings. Thus, when discussing stuttering variability associated
with adaptation, it is important to specify the nature of the
material being read, the type and number of listeners, the
nature of the situation in which the person reads, and so forth.
As with the non-normal distribution of stuttering frequency,
some might wonder why adaptation is of relevance to clinical
practice. Frankly, to date some findings regarding stuttering
adaptation are more theoretical than clinical in significance.
However, the fact remains that many (but not all) people who
stutter decrease stuttering during repeated oral readings if the
material, listener, time interval between readings, and listener
remain the same. For the clinician, therefore, this observation
suggests the possibility that some of the changes that occur
during treatment, with the same clinician, room, and speaking/
reading material, may be associated with adaptation (and not
merely the influence of the treatment regimen). Clinicians who
understand this will then be sure to account for it by varying
therapy contexts (i.e., location, timing of breaks, where the
client and clinician sit, etc.) and activities within and between
sessions. Certainly, these simple, matter-of-fact changes make
the treatment setting a bit less constant. However, such changes
also make the therapy setting more closely reflective of the
continual change the person who stutters experiences outside
of the clinical setting. Indeed, a client's ability to generalize

temporary effects of stuttering. Adaptation
effect: The steady decrease in the number of
stuttered words (i.e., decrease in stuttering
frequency) from 21 to 10—from Reading 1 to
5—across five successive readings of a 133-word
passage by a young adult who stutters. This
individual read this passage five times in a row,
with no stopping or resting between each of the
five readings. Temporary effect of adaptation:
After the fifth reading, the same individual had a
pause of no reading or speaking for 30 minutes,
and then read the passage a sixth time, with their
stuttering frequency on the sixth reading
returning to the same frequency they exhibited
during Reading 1.

change in stuttering from a nonchanging (clinical) to an ever-
changing (everyday) environment may be quite challenging for
some clients.
1.5.2 After the Eﬀects of Adaptation
Have Dissipated
Given the fluency-inducing eﬀect of adaptation, one might
think that an individual's stuttering could be solved merely by
having them read or speak the same material over and over.
However, this is not the case. For as we will see immediately be-
low, the eﬀect of adaptation is temporary. If a person who stut-
ters takes a break after repeatedly reading or speaking the same
material, their stuttering frequency tends to return to about the
same level as they exhibited on the first oral reading.15,16,17 For
example, let us say a person stutters on 8% of the words read
(or 8 stuttered disfluencies per 100 words read) in the first oral
reading of a passage. By virtue of adaptation, they then stutter
on 4% of the words by the fifth reading of the same passage. If,
however, following that fifth reading, the person takes a 30-
minute break and then reads the same passage for the sixth
time, their stuttering returned to 7% (or 7 stuttered disfluencies
per 100 words read). The person's 7% stuttering on the sixth
reading is nearly the same frequency of stuttering they exhib-
ited in the first reading. This temporary eﬀect of adaptation is
relatively common.16,17,18 Again, as with most such eﬀects,
some people exhibit total return to their typical stuttering fre-
quency, some less so, and some very little. Although the reasons
for the adaptation-related decreases and increases in stuttering
have long been of interest to both clinicians and researchers,
there remains no agreed-upon explanation for why such
changes in stuttering frequency occur. At the risk of redun-
dancy, we note that the one constant about stuttering is that it
changes!
1.5.3 Consistency Eﬀect
Similar to the adaptation eﬀect, the consistency eﬀect was also
first described over 80 years ago in a study that asked adults to
repeatedly read the same passage aloud.13 The consistency of
stuttering (▶Table 1.2) refers to the fact that people who stut-
ter tend to stutter on the same words when they repeatedly
read the same text aloud.13,19 Although the consistency eﬀect
was primarily studied with adults, it also applies to children
who stutter.20,21 This suggests something quite important to an
understanding of stuttering: some features or stimuli within
the reading material appear to either "set the occasion for" or
elicit an instance of stuttering. In other words, stuttering is not
produced in a random or haphazard fashion; rather there is
consistency in the places within an utterance where stuttering
is produced. The frequency of stuttering at certain places in ut-
terances is significantly higher than chance, although not totally
predictable within and between individuals who stutter. The
percentage of words that are consistently stuttered across mul-
tiple oral readings of the same material has been reported to
range from about 50 to 100% with an average of 77%.20,22,23 In
general, the cues (e.g., position of word within sentence, gram-
matical function of the word, etc.) associated with consistency
seem to be related to a mix of factors (1) unique to each individ-
ual who stutters and (2) common to the group of individuals
who stutter. These cues or stimuli have been described as the
"loci of stuttering" (with "loci" the plural of "locus").
1.5.4 Loci of Stuttering
About the time that adaptation and consistency of stuttering
were being studied, so too were the loci of stuttering. The loci
of stuttering refer to the characteristics (e.g., sounds, syllables,
and words) of those places that are consistently stuttered. Spe-
cifically, the loci of stuttering are often associated with longer
words, words at the beginning of the sentence, and the like.24,25
As with the consistency eﬀect, the loci of stuttering highlights
the fact that instances of stuttering are (1) not random and (2)
associated with specific linguistic qualities of a word, phrase,
utterance, or sentence.
Initially, the loci or characteristics of consistently stuttered
words were thought to involve (1) longer words (five or more
letters); (2) words that begin with a consonant; (3) words that
are in the first three positions of a sentence; and (4) words that
were nouns, adjectives, verbs, or adverbs.26 This observation
was mainly based on adults who stutter; however, when
researchers began to study the loci of stuttering in the conver-
sational speech of children, the picture changed somewhat.
That is, young children appeared to stutter mainly near the be-
ginning of sentences and on function words (e.g., conjunctions,
prepositions, and pronouns). This finding is in contrast to adults
who stuttered on content words (i.e., nouns, verbs, adverbs, ad-
jectives). These tendencies appeared to apply not only to Eng-
lish but also to other languages, such as Spanish, German, and
Portuguese. Recently, however, loci of stuttering have been
examined in children who speak Korean, a language where
function words are less likely to occur in the sentence-initial
position compared to English.27 Findings indicated that unlike
English-speaking children who stutter, Korean-speaking chil-
dren who stutter stuttered more on content words than func-
tion words. These findings support the contention that it is not
the function or content words that are associated with stutter-
ing, but rather their position within an utterance.24
Table 1.2 Example of consistency of stuttering
Reading 1: "You wish to know all about my grandfather. Well, he is nearly ninety-three years old."
Reading 2: "You wish to know all about my grandfather. Well, he is nearly ninety-three years old."
Reading 3: "You wish to know all about my grandfather. Well, he is nearly ninety-three years old."
Reading 4: "You wish to know all about my grandfather. Well, he is nearly ninety-three years old."
Reading 5: "You wish to know all about my grandfather. Well, he is nearly ninety-three years old."
Note: ▶Table 1.1 depicts an individual who stutters reading the same sentence five times in a row, with each sentence read immediately after one
another. The words read for each of the five sentences that were stuttered during each of the five readings are highlighted in bold font. From this table,
it can be seen that the word "grandfather" is consistently stuttered across all five readings and the words "ninety-three" across two of the five readings.
Common Characteristics
8

Although theoretical accounts of the factors associated with
loci go beyond the scope of this chapter, research has consis-
tently pointed to the nonrandom nature of stuttering loci. For
example, a child may not always stutter on every utterance-
initial word, but when the child does stutter many of his
instances of stuttering will be on utterance-initial words. This
stuttering characteristic has encouraged researchers to study
such factors as speech production (i.e., speech motor control)
and speech-language planning (e.g., expressive vocabulary,
sentence construction) in people who stutter in attempts to
determine whether they have clinical or subclinical diﬃculties
with these processes. Indeed, the association between these
processes and stuttering will become clearer in the later chap-
ters of this book. Likewise, in subsequent chapters, authors
will discuss the translational or applied implications of stut-
tering loci for the diagnosis and treatment of stuttering.
1.6 Other Common
Characteristics: Age at Onset,
Gender, Persistence, and Recovery
from Stuttering
1.6.1 Age at Onset
Within the above definition of stuttering is the phrase "...first
emerges in early childhood." Thus, it should not be surprising
to find that stuttering typically begins in early childhood, with
onset ranging in age from 2 to 5 years of age with a mean age
of 33 months.28 Can stuttering begin outside of this age range?
Certainly. It is quite possible for stuttering to begin in older
children, teens, and adults. Although possible, it is much less
probable.
Why would stuttering begin for most children during early
childhood? What might be occurring during that time period
that contributes to stuttering? At present, we lack precise
answers to such questions. However, in the chapters ahead,
this book presents several credible possibilities, for example,
subtle but important diﬀerences in speech/language plan-
ning, neurological processes, speech motor control, and emo-
tional reactivity and regulation. The notion that "multiple
factors" contribute to early-childhood onset of stuttering has
led to the development of what are called "multifactorial"
theories.29,30,31
A detailed description of the multifactorial theory is
beyond the scope of the present chapter; however, the basic
tenet of such a theory is that there is no single factor that, in
and of itself, causes stuttering. Rather, there are a finite num-
ber of clusters, constellations, or groupings of factors that
contribute to the onset of stuttering. For example, for one
grouping of children, all factors—speech/language, neurologi-
cal, speech motor, and emotion—may play a role, with chal-
lenges to speech motor processes weighting more heavily
than the other factors. For another grouping of children, on
the other hand, the same factors might be involved, but
weigh more heavily toward language and emotional factors.
Again, further discussion of factors that may contribute to
stuttering onset and development is beyond the scope of this
chapter, but it will be discussed in the chapters that follow.
At present, it does appear that ascribing the reason that stut-
tering begins in early childhood to one single factor is less
than appropriate given available information.
1.6.2 Gender
In general, boys (who have XY chromosomes) are more likely to
exhibit a full range of developmental disorders (such as
language-learning and reading problems) than girls (who have
XX chromosomes). However, gender disparities are the rule
rather than the exception for many disorders, which raises the
possibility that stuttering is associated with sex-linked, genetic
processes.32 Therefore, it should not be particularly startling to
learn that stuttering is more apt to be exhibited by boys than
girls. (One exception to this rule is that boys and girls, near
the onset of stuttering, are roughly equally represented.) Why
such a gender disparity? We could certainly ask the same
question regarding gender disparities for other disorders, for
example, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive
compulsive disorder, etc. Be that as it may, why do more boys
than girls (and, ultimately, men than women) develop stutter-
ing in early childhood?
Like the former question regarding stuttering and age of
onset, we lack a precise answer as to why stuttering is more
apt to emerge in boys than in girls. Still, the sex discrepancy
for stuttering remains a fact. And such facts typically, like
iron filings to a magnet, attract a variety of explanations. For
example, some have suggested that in general, when com-
pared to girls, boys' speech and language matures later and/
or is more apt to be disordered. Others have suggested that
genetic influences for at least some other nonspeech and lan-
guage disorders are more prevalent for boys than for girls.
Still others have suggested that environmental influences, for
example, diﬀerences in parental attitudes and child-rearing
practices, account for stuttering to be more prevalent in boys
than in girls. Or epigenetic processes (i.e., environmental and
learning influences on gene expression that do not involve
changes in the deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] sequence) might
be at play diﬀerently for boys than for girls. Perhaps the truth
lies in the possibility that both genetic and environmental
factors contribute to the unequal sex ratio, possibilities that
will be explored in greater depth in the following section, in
▶Chapter 3 discussing the association between genetic fac-
tors and stuttering.
In contrast, one can still find mutually exclusive accounts for
why more boys than girls stutter, for example, mainly genetic
versus mainly environment. These explanations lie counter to
the fact—as discussed earlier—that many that treat and research
stuttering have increasingly embraced more multifactorial ac-
counts of its etiology. Hence, it is possible that a multifactorial
approach may be—in the long run—a more productive account
for the sex ratio of stuttering than more unifactorial accounts.
This is consistent with other developmental and behavioral dis-
orders in that a single factor is neither necessary nor suﬃcient
to account for the emergence of such disorders. Indeed, a multi-
factorial perspective seems reasonable given the fact that one-
factor perspectives have not led to particularly resounding
clarity regarding the cause of stuttering as well as the fact that
more males than females stutter.

1.6.3 Stuttering Persistence and
Recovery
It has long been known that some children recover from stut-
tering without intervention, while others persist in stuttering.
In recent years, however, the exact percentage of persistence
and recovery has become more apparent.33 Indeed, the percent-
age of children who exhibit unassisted recovery (roughly
70-80%) is greater than for those whose stuttering persists
(roughly 20-30%). Specifically, children for whom stuttering
persists (relative to those who recover) have been shown to
exhibit lower receptive and expressive vocabulary,34 more vari-
able speech articulation,34,35 stronger and more frequent nega-
tive emotions (such as fear) per parent report,34 diﬀerences in
neurological function,36 and greater psychophysiological reac-
tivity (i.e., skin conductance) to stress at initial assessment.37
Therefore, measurable, though sometimes subtle, diﬀerences
in speech, language, and emotional processes seem to be associ-
ated with the persistence of stuttering. Nevertheless, it is
important to mention that while children who stutter (CWS)
may diﬀer from children who do not stutter (CWNS) on these
various measures (1) CWS's abilities generally remain within
normal limits and (2) there is no evidence, to date, that any one
deficit is necessary or suﬃcient to cause stuttering.
Although we are far from knowing all there is to know about
the factors associated with the persistence of stuttering, a broad
theory characterized by the interaction of multiple factors is
beginning to emerge, one that will be elaborated upon in the
chapters to follow, from both basic and applied perspectives. Of
course, establishing an association between two variables
should not be taken to suggest that one causes the other.
Indeed, the exact mechanisms by which any of these speech,
language, and emotional processes "cause" stuttering to persist,
if any of them do, will only be uncovered by future research.
1.7 Common Characteristics:
Behaviors and Conditions that
Decrease Stuttering
Several behaviors, on the part of the person who stutters, and
conditions, when experienced by the person who stutters, are
known to be associated with a decrease in stuttering frequency.
Usually, however, once the behavior is stopped or the condition
changed, the frequency of stuttering returns to its previous
level (this is a bit like the increase of stuttering once the adapta-
tion paradigm is completed). The section provides a brief
description of the more common behaviors and conditions
associated with decreases in stuttering frequency.
1.7.1 Behaviors Associated with
Decreases in Stuttering
Behaviors associated with decreases in stuttering (i.e., fluency-
inducing behaviors and conditions) are fairly common events
(e.g., singing). Indeed, these behaviors can lead to a dramatic
reduction in the frequency of stuttering for people who stutter.
Most speaking-related behaviors described below are associ-
ated with decreases in stuttering in most, but not necessarily
all, people who stutter. Because of their temporary impact on
stuttering (i.e., they are only associated with decreases in stut-
tering when they are employed), modern-day clinicians gener-
ally do not include these behaviors as a part of their stuttering
therapy program.
Furthermore, these behaviors may not seem appropriate or
desirable for typical communication (e.g., a person who stutters
is unlikely to choose to sing instead of speaking when ordering
food at a drive-through). Suﬃce it to say, at present, the under-
lying mechanisms or reasons why these various behaviors
impact stuttering are not fully understood. Some have sug-
gested that the fluency-inducing eﬀects, specifically paced
speech, and singing may be related to more eﬀective coupling
of auditory and motor systems (e.g., eﬃcient self-monitoring).38
Others have noted that diﬀerent brain activation patterns
(e.g., increased right hemisphere activation of speech-related
regions) in people who stutter have also been reported during
these times.
Singing
Singing is commonly associated with decreases in stuttering.38,39
Of course, as suggested earlier, we do not precisely know why
singing decreases stuttering but we will provide some edu-
cated guesses. First, most singing diﬀers from typical conversa-
tional speech and language in that songs are generally memo-
rized. Singing a song, in whole or in part, generally involves
little changing or improvising the words to the song. Con-
versely, most conversational speech is not memorized; rather,
it involves spontaneous, on-the-fly responses. Such responses
may occur, for example, when the speaker shifts from one
thought to the next. Or when the listener asks the speaker
questions or the speaker or listener creates shifts in the topic(s)
of conversation, shifts that require the speaker to respond on
the fly. Second, singing is often accompanied by music—either
played by the singer or other external sources—which has a
melody and a rhythm. Conversational speech, on the other
hand, is seldom associated with external cadences, melodies,
or rhythm. Third, when someone sings, they are seldom inter-
rupted. That is, once someone begins to sing a song, unless they
are rehearsing for a play or recording the song, the "singer" is
seldom corrected or interrupted in mid-song. In contrast, cor-
rections, disagreements, questions, and other interruptions are
an integral part of everyday conversational speech.
In short, as mentioned earlier, we lack a definitive answer
regarding why singing decreases stuttering. However, we do
know that singing represents a significant departure from natu-
ral, everyday speech and language planning and production. As a
result, singing—as a means for everyday conversational speech—
is not apt to be tolerated or used by most individuals who speak,
whether they stutter or not, as their go-to means for communi-
cation. So, although many of us enjoy listening to music and
singing, few would select singing to conduct their daily conver-
sational communication, which begs the question: Why would
we ever expect a person who stutters to tolerate such a "cure"?
Whispering
In contrast to singing, during whispering, the vocal folds are
typically held apart (i.e., moved and held away from midline of
Common Characteristics
10

the speaker's glottis), which minimizes the speaker's ability to
vocalize (i.e., when a speaker whispers, their vocal folds are
minimally if at all vibrating).40,41,42 Conversely, during typical
conversational speech, vocal folds rapidly shift between vibra-
tion and no vibration. Such shifting in vocalization during
speaking—between voiced and voiceless sounds—is required to
produce vowels and voiced consonants, whereas voicing is not
required to produce voiceless consonants. Thus, quite diﬀerent
behaviors—one where voicing is absent (i.e., whispering) and
the other where voicing is very present (i.e., singing)—seem to
decrease instances of stuttering.
The diametrically opposed nature of these two behaviors—
whispering and singing—may be telling us that merely adjust-
ing vocal fold activity does not completely explain why these
behaviors impact stuttering. Importantly, just as with singing,
continually whispering when we speak is less than a desirable
means for everyday communication (if not impossible when
there is loud ambient or background noise). Therefore, requir-
ing a person who stutters to whisper more or less constantly
when they speak would appear to be a "cure" that is likely to be
more unsatisfactory than the concern, embarrassment, incon-
venience, and less-than-typical communication associated with
stuttering itself!
Speaking While Performing in a Play
It has often been observed that people who stutter may
decrease their stuttering while performing in a play.43 To the
authors' knowledge, there is no definitive explanation for this
observation. Again, it should be mentioned that there is one
major diﬀerence between the lines spoken by someone in a play
and the words, phrases, sentences, and thoughts expressed
during everyday conversation. The former—performing in a
play—is generally well rehearsed and memorized, while the
latter—everyday conversational speech—is typically not (as
mentioned earlier). Further, a stage or performance speaking
style typically involves using a slower rate, increased volume,
and overarticulation—all resulting from using the speech pro-
duction system diﬀerently than the way we use it for everyday
talking.
As with singing, when we act in a play, we are seldom ques-
tioned or interrupted by our listeners. Indeed, most if not all in-
terruptions by actors are a priori scripted, often rehearsed, and
thus fairly quite predictable to the actor. In contrast, and as
mentioned earlier, a speaker's natural conversation often con-
stitutes on-the-fly changes. These frequent, if not sudden, stops
and starts for the speaker in a conversation are often related to
the speaker's listener(s) interrupting, questioning, and talking
over the speaker's conversational utterances. Thus, our natural,
conversational speech and language planning and production
cannot, and should not, be memorized to achieve fluent speech.
Such memorization, of course, is appropriate for acting in a play,
giving a speech, or performing a religious ritual. However, for
naturally occurring conversational speech? Not so much.
Speaking in a Slow, Prolonged Manner
Speaking in a slow, prolonged manner (i.e., prolonged speech)
also has been shown to lead to decreases in stuttering
frequency.44,45 When employing prolonged speech, people who
stutter are typically instructed to significantly (1) decrease their
rate of speech (by 50%),46 (2) elongate their syllables and words,
and (3) maintain continuous voicing across words and syllables.
The fluency-inducing eﬀect of slow, prolonged speech has been
attributed to increased vowel and syllable durations.47,48 Unlike
singing and whispering, speaking in a slow, prolonged manner
has been included in some stuttering therapy approaches.49,50
Depending on how slow the person needs to speak to achieve
the fluency-inducing eﬀect, people who stutter may find that
routinely
employing
slow,
prolonged
speech
sounds
feels
unnatural, both to themselves and their listeners, and for that
reason is less than an ideal means for maintaining natural every-
day communication.
1.7.2 Conditions Associated with
Decreases in Stuttering
Conditions associated with decreases in stuttering include, but
are not limited to, the following: (1) delayed auditory feedback
(DAF), (2) loud noise, and (3) external rhythmic stimulus.
Digital technology allows these conditions to be readily manu-
factured, which has led to continuing discussion about their
clinical applicability as a central or peripheral part of a stutter-
ing therapy program. Several questions remain regarding the
appropriateness and usefulness of these conditions for people
who stutter. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, we
provide below some brief description and discussion of these
conditions.
Delayed Auditory Feedback
DAF, in essence, "takes" the speaker's air-conducted or airborne
auditory sidetone while speaking and delays the arrival of this
sidetone to the speaker's ears (i.e., auditory system) by fractions
of a second.51,52 When a speaker, whether they stutter or not,
speaks in the presence of DAF, they typically change their
speech in response. In the case of a person who stutters, this
"change" can involve decreases in stuttering, at least during cer-
tain speaking conditions (e.g., reading aloud). In other words,
"changes" (e.g., slowing down their speech rate) in natural
conversational speech—similar to whispering or singing—may
be induced by DAF. This slowing of speaking rate may be one
reason why DAF decreases stuttering, along with possible
increased attention paid to kinesthetic and proprioceptive cues.
Another possible contributor, suggested by some,53 is that DAF
somehow compensates for a deficit that people who stutter
have in their auditory feedback for speech. Commercially avail-
able DAF units, similar in size to modern-day hearing aids,
appear to be of help for some adults who stutter, especially
those who stutter more severely and/or did not have success
with other available treatments.
Rhythmic Stimulation
Rhythmic stimulation (i.e., metronome eﬀect) as a means to
ameliorate stuttering has a long history.54,55 When people who
stutter speak to the beat of a metronome (or the metronome's
"tick-tock-tick-tock, etc." sound), they typically are more fluent.
Similar to DAF, rhythmic stimulation changes the naturalness of
one's speaking. This is because synchronizing or timing one's
1.7 Common Characteristics: Behaviors and Conditions that Decrease Stuttering
11

speech to the beat of a metronome typically results in a slower,
less typical sounding speaking pattern. With rhythmic stimula-
tion, the speaker's speech sounds singsong, staccato, or rhyth-
mical. Although such rhythmic stimulation is associated with
an appreciable reduction in stuttering, the speaker's speech
both feels and sounds far less than natural. Given this less-than-
natural quality of speech-language production, many people
who stutter are likely to prefer to speak and stutter than speak
to the beat of a metronome. In short, what most people who
stutter want—similar to most people who do not stutter—is
typical sounding speech. They do not seem to be seeking to re-
place one less than typical sounding speech (e.g., "th-th-th-this
is diﬀerent") with a second less than typical sounding speech
(i.e., "th-is-dif-fer-ent").
Loud Noise
Loud noise (e.g., white noise eﬀect), whether naturally present
in the environment or deliberately introduced while a person
who stutters is speaking, can be associated with a decrease in
stuttering.54,56,57,58 When people speak in the presence of
masking noise, regardless of whether they stutter or not, they
tend to increase the loudness of their own speech (for the
interested
reader,
this
is
called
the
"Lombard
eﬀect").59
Although speaking louder appears to decrease stuttering, at
least to some degree, the loud noise also presents a threat to
the speaker's hearing system (i.e., has potential to contribute to
at least a temporary noise-induced hearing loss; this is why
construction workers using jackhammers wear ear protectors).
Further, it is hard to imagine successful communication when
someone not only has to raise their voice level or loudness but
also has to listen to a loud noise in their headphones while try-
ing to engage in conversational speech! Therefore, routinely
speaking in a loud voice, with or without ambient loud noise, is
not a particularly desirable means for ameliorating stuttering.
Summary of Behaviors and Conditions
Associated with Decreases in Stuttering
Before we end our discussion regarding behaviors and condi-
tions associated with decreases in stuttering, we would like
to make some general comments regarding both. First, we
are unable to cover all such behaviors and conditions in this
space, just some of those most commonly noted (see Blood-
stein's seminal overviews43,60,61). Second, whether whisper-
ing or speaking to the beat of a metronome, these behaviors
and conditions are associated with not only changes in stut-
tering but also changes in the naturalness of conversational
speaking. Thus, most behaviors and conditions that induce
fluency do so—at least in part—by creating a significant
departure from speaking naturalness. This departure from
natural conversational speech makes us question the routine
use of most such behaviors and conditions with people who
stutter. Third, some of these behaviors and conditions involve
memorized, noninterrupted speaking events. Such memori-
zation is simply not feasible for speakers to employ, whether
they stutter or not, in everyday conversation. Nor, for that
matter, can speakers, whether they stutter or not, expect to
engage in conversational speech that is noninterrupted.
Fourth, some of these behaviors and conditions, DAF, for
example, represent "speaker-passive" rather than "speaker-
active" means for changing stuttering. Rendering a speaker
more or less passive in the generation of his or her own
speech fluency can be problematic, especially if the behavior
or condition does not appreciably ameliorate stuttering
(keeping in mind that few things work for everyone, in all
circumstances).
Nevertheless,
these
various
behaviors
and
conditions
(▶Fig. 1.4) may be telling us something about the variables
associated with increased fluency for people who stutter.
▶Fig. 1.4 presents a summary for the common features of some
fluency-inducing behaviors and conditions. For example, some
of these behaviors and conditions seem to induce a more regu-
lated, less changeable, more predictable, and slower form of
"speaking." Importantly, these changes in speech planning and
production concurrently induce a significant departure from
the ever-changing tempo of natural conversational speaking.
The fluency gained with these behaviors and conditions comes,
however, at the cost of significantly altering the naturalness
(and sometimes speaking rate) of speaking. We would like to
suggest that such alterations in speech-language planning and
production—especially speech naturalness—is a price that most

fluency-inducing (i.e., decreases in stuttering)
behaviors and conditions. Note: Some of these
fluency-inducing behaviors/conditions, as
▶Fig. 1.4 suggests, can be associated with two
or more characteristics. For example, the
condition of singing can be associated with the
following characteristics: it is often memorized, it
involves nearly continuous voicing, it is often
produced slower than conversational speech, and
it can occur with external rhythm.
Common Characteristics

speakers, whether they stutter or not, are generally not willing
to pay. Indeed, as we shall see in later chapters covering the
treatment of stuttering, changing stuttering is best, and with
most long-term benefits, accomplished in a "nonhomogenized"
environment of ever-changing, natural speech and language. Or,
by way of analogy, a ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what
ships are built for.
1.8 Future Directions
Future investigations of stuttering will undoubtedly study the
various contributors to stuttering, for example, constitutional,
developmental, and environmental factors in stuttering devel-
opment. Such study will include investigations of genetic
underpinnings of stuttering, developmental processes related
to speech, language and temperament, and contributions of en-
vironmental factors such as caregiver interaction style, among
others. Of course, some of these directions will be shaped by
developments in methodology, for example, neuroimaging, as
well as theoretical models suggesting new, fruitful avenues of
investigation, for example, cortical/neurological antecedents to
the development of anxiety. Likewise, the development of more
advanced means of measurement will lead to more fine-
grained understanding of the perceptual as well as behavioral
aspects of instances of stuttering. All such informational, meth-
odological as well as theoretical advances—from behavior to
neurological processes—will further our understanding of stut-
tering as well as improve our basic study of and clinical diagno-
sis/treatment of stuttering. This enhanced general knowledge
of stuttering may be augmented by specific study of possible
subgroups of people who stutter. Results from such specific
studies, it is thought, should contribute to our ability to more
narrowcast the treatment of stuttering to the individual needs
of people who stutter.
1.9 Conclusion
Stuttering is a speech disorder that typically begins in early
childhood. In its early stages, stuttering is equally distributed
between boys and girls, with more boys than girls developing
chronic stuttering. The disorder is characterized by relatively
frequent production of sound/syllable repetitions, (in)audible
sound prolongations, and repetitions of monosyllabic words,
with more young children exhibiting mild rather than severe
stuttering. Stuttering frequency is quite variable within and
between people who stutter, but, importantly, the loci of
stuttering within an utterance are not random. For example,
stuttering most often occurs in the beginning of an utterance.
Various nonspeech behaviors may be associated with stutter-
ing, for example, eyelid opening and closing, and turning of the
head away from the listener. However, the precise reason(s) for
the occurrence of these behaviors is unclear. More children
recover from stuttering without therapy than develop chronic
stuttering. However, for those children who persist, stuttering can
significantly impact their academic, emotional, and social abil-
ities as well as their later vocational potential and achievements.
Given that the loci of stuttering are not random, stuttering
appears to be a relatively predictable reaction to specific stimuli,
some of which are seemingly unique to the individual who
stutters (e.g., words that begin with "f"), while others are more
common to the problem of stuttering itself (e.g., words at the
beginning of the utterance). Often, as will be discussed in greater
detail in later chapters, instances of stuttering are associated
with the linguistic content of the speaker's message. For
example, longer, more grammatically complex utterances will be
more apt to contain instances of stuttering than shorter, less
grammatically complex utterances. Is this apparent diﬃculty
with more complex linguistic content due to the (1) linguistic
abilities of the person who stutters, (2) the inherent challenges
of longer, more complex utterances, or (3) a combination of
both? At present, the answer to this question is not clear.
What is clear, as subsequent chapters will describe, is that
both clinicians and researchers alike are continuing to develop
a more comprehensive, data-based understanding of such
issues, a fact that following chapters will strongly aﬃrm. There-
fore, if Hobbes (1668) is correct, that knowledge is power, the
future, for both people who stutter and those who treat them,
should be full of bright promise.

The decrease in stuttering fre-
quency that occurs during successive oral readings or
speaking of the same material. This is sometimes called the
adaptation eﬀect.
Associated (non) speech behaviors:
Any speech (e.g., overly
loud production of a word) or nonspeech (e.g., tight closure
of eyelids) behavior associated with an instance of stuttering.
These behavioral events are also referred to as accessory,
concomitant, or secondary behaviors.
Consistency (of stuttering):
The tendency of people who stut-
ter to stutter on the same words when they repeatedly read
the same text aloud. This is sometimes called the consistency
eﬀect.
Delayed auditory feedback (DAF):

speaker to listen to his or her own speech a fraction of a
second later.
Fluency-inducing behavior and conditions:
Any behavior
(e.g., whispering) or condition (e.g., speaking to the beat of a
metronome) that is associated with a noticeable decrease in
stuttering (hence an increase in speech fluency).
Lifetime incidence:
The percent of people who have stuttered
sometime in their life.
Loci (of stuttering):
The characteristics (e.g., sounds, syllables,
and words) of those places within an utterance that are con-
sistently stuttered, for example, longer words, words at the
beginning of the sentence, etc.
Non-normal distribution (of children's stuttering):
For the
population of children who stutter, there are more children
whose stuttering frequency is relatively low (i.e., they cluster
at the low end of the distribution) rather than high (fewer

Monosyllabic repetition:
Repetition of one- or single-syllable
words (e.g. "I-I-I am going").
Multifactorial perspectives:
The idea, hypothesis, notion, or

The percent of people who stutter at any one
point in time (e.g., presently).
Rhythmic stimulation:
A fluency-inducing condition where-
by a person who stutters speaks to the beat of a metronome

2 Some 20th- and 21st-Century Theories of Stuttering:
A Brief Overview
Edward G. Conture, Julie D. Anderson, and Patricia M. Zebrowski
Abstract
This chapter begins with a brief description of both theories
and speculations about stuttering prior to the age of enlighten-
ment or reason (i.e., from about biblical time to about the time
of Francis Bacon [mid to late 1600s]). Subsequently, from about
the beginning of the age of enlightenment and the scientific
method that it engendered, the chapter provides a succinct
overview of theories of stuttering from the 1700s through the
early 1900s. Following that, the chapter provides a bit more
expansive overview of theories of stuttering from the mid-20th
to early 21st century. The chapter ends with a discussion of
these theoretical foundations, followed by some conclusions. It
should be noted that not all theories of stuttering are described
in this chapter, nor are those selected comprehensively dis-
cussed. Rather, we chose theories that are (1) the most promi-
nent and/or cited, (2) better reasoned and possibly testable,
and/or (3) associated with data that either support or refute the
theory's premises. Such theories range from broad to narrow
focus on variables thought to contribute to the onset, devel-
opment, and maintenance of stuttering. Knowledge of these
theories should help readers better appreciate subsequent
chapters that cover the knowledge base, diagnostic, and
treatment protocols for stuttering across the lifespan.

2.1 Introduction
"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of
Giants."
Sir Isaac Newton (b. 1642, d. 1727)
The past, it is said, is prologue. Certainly, that is the case with
theory. Theories of yesterday inform, to greater or lesser degrees,
those of today. Thus, this overview of past and present theories
of stuttering begins by providing some historical context.
Readers are briefly introduced to the medical/scientific world
that predates modern-day approaches to science, medicine,
human health, etc. The pre-modern-day approaches are mainly
focused on the opinions and writings of a select number of
authorities, whereas the modern-day approaches are more
focused on hypothesis generation, testing, and evaluation. Such
early (prescientific method) conceptualizations of stuttering,
theory, and therapy were often based on a very diﬀerent model
of human health and its disorders: the humoral system. As sug-
gested earlier, the "humoral" perspective was highly influenced
by the ideas, theories, and writings of past authorities. Such
influence meant, for investigators and practitioners alike, that
there was little to no attempt or incentive to make new,
exact observations and/or systematically collect data. Our brief
exploration of pre-modern-day approaches to human health
and disorders should help provide background and context
for our later coverage of modern-day theoretical accounts of
stuttering.
"The body of man has in itself blood, phlegm, yellow bile and
black bile; these make up the nature of this body, and through
these he feels pain and enjoys health."
Hippocrates (b. circa 460 BC, d. circa 375 BC)
2.2 Humoral System of Medicine
Up until the late 1600s through the early 1800s, the humoral
system of medicine influenced much of the theory and therapy
regarding human disorders, including stuttering. Suﬃce it to
say, this early system of medical practice is quite foreign and/or
unknown to early 21st-century readers of this chapter. Yet its
influence carried on long after its demise, even impacting some
of our modern-day terminology. To provide such historical per-
spective, the following brief overview discusses some of the
seemingly more salient early antecedents to as well as promi-
nent mid-1990s to early 2000s theories of stuttering. Similar
discussion is available elsewhere, for example, Duﬀy's1 discus-
sion of older to modern health care, in general; Rieber and
Wollock's2 discussion of ancient to mid-1990s approaches to
stuttering; and Van Riper's3 discussion of 1800s to 1900s stut-
tering therapies.
In brief, the ancient, humoral view of human health and its
disorders held that our universe has four basic qualities: cold,
dryness, heat, and moisture. Combining these qualities in pair-
like fashion, four elements are created: cold and dryness (earth),
cold and moisture (water), heat and dryness (fire), and heat and
moisture (air). Based on this conceptualization, ancient physi-
cians and scholars considered humans to be a miniature or
microcosmic version of this universe. These early practitioners
and scholars appeared to believe that the human equivalent of
these four elements was the four humors (bodily fluids): yellow
bile, blood, black bile, and phlegm. Everyone was believed to
have their own unique balance of humors, which was referred
to as their natural temperament.2
According to this belief, there were four broad categories of
natural temperaments that determined mental and physical
health. If someone had too much yellow bile, then they
were choleric (hot and dry). This was taken to mean that they
were easily angered, aggressive, and smart. Someone who was
sanguine (hot and moist), on the other hand, had an abundance
of blood in their body. As a consequence of such abundance, the
individual was assumed to be "fleshy," yet physically vigorous
and optimistic. In present-day terms, we might say that an indi-
vidual has a "fiery disposition" (i.e., choleric) or another person
has a "happy-go-lucky" disposition (e.g., sanguine). In contrast,
a melancholic (cold and dry) individual was believed to have an
16

excessive amount of black bile, which resulted in an anxious,
fearful, and brooding temperament. Finally, if phlegm was the
dominant humor, then the person had a phlegmatic tempera-
ment, which gave them the unfortunate distinction of being fat,
"soft," dull, and cowardly.2 Nowadays, hearing the phrase "She
is in good humor today" is a verbal remnant of the ancient
humoral system! Whatever the case, these humors and their
associated temperaments were the basic building blocks upon
which ancient/early physicians and scholars approached human
health, including stuttering.
Perhaps most curious for readers living in the early part of
the 21st century is that ancient health care providers consid-
ered their client's "temperaments" as important to treat as the
symptoms of the disorder itself.2 For these early practitioners,
the various temperaments were thought to contribute to
the client's problem, symptoms, and treatment, in that the
"disease" was not, for example, stuttering but an imbalance in
the humors that impacted the whole person. This also meant
that people with the same disease could have diﬀerent etiolo-
gies; for example, stuttering in a person with a choleric
temperament would have a very diﬀerent cause than someone
with a phlegmatic temperament. In a way, such possible dif-
ferences among people are reflected in the present-day notion
of "individual diﬀerences" in abilities, sensitivities to drugs,
reactions to stress, etc. Regardless of the presumed etiology,
however, bringing the client's humors back into balance was
viewed as crucial to bringing the client's physical and mental
health back to normal.
So, what does the above have to do with theories of stutter-
ing? A good deal, or at least the way the ancients thought about
stuttering. For example, a person with a melancholic tempera-
ment was theorized to have rapid motion(s) of the imagination
(today we might say cognition/language formulation). This was a
problem because the tongue of the melancholic person could not
easily "keep up with" the mental concepts they were processing.
Stated in more modern terms, Rieber and Wollock2 suggested
that early scholar-physicians believed that "stuttering... (is) a
failure of synchronization between the processes of thinking and
speaking." Whether valid or not, this "desynchronization" idea
comes close to being one of the first of what we might consider
to be a theory or at least hypothesis regarding stuttering. How-
ever, the only thing constant is change. So, as we will see, the age
of enlightenment or reason would put the humoral system
firmly in its rearview mirror.
To obtain some insight into the role that the humoral system
played in ancient/early medical practice, it is instructive to
consider the circumstances surrounding the death of the U.S.
President George Washington. In the early morning hours of
December 14, 1799, Washington woke his wife Martha com-
plaining that he felt quite sick and that he was having trouble
breathing and talking. Shortly thereafter, Washington asked his
estate overseer to bleed him. At that time, bloodletting was a
practice based on the humoral system of medicine and, in this
case, used to treat George Washington.
His doctors arrived a bit later that day, assessed George's
condition, and drained even more blood from Washington.
His throat was swapped with a salve as well as a preparation
made from insects, and other treatments were used in apparent
attempts to address Washington's serious illness. Although it
is diﬃcult to be precise based on written notes made over
200 years ago, modern-day estimates suggest that, in total, the
bloodlettings removed 40% of Washington's blood from his
body. Likewise, present-day examination of the records sug-
gests that the former president most likely died from a serious
infection of the epiglottis at around 10 or 11 p.m. on December
14, 1799; however, it seems safe to say that the loss of so much
blood probably did little to improve an already very serious
situation.
For further details, see DM Morens' article titled "Death of a
president."4
"Half of science is putting forth the right questions."
Francis Bacon (b. 1561, d. 1626)
2.3 The Beginnings: Shifting from
Humoral to Scientific Approaches
In its earliest days, Francis Bacon was a major contributor to
what we now call the scientific method or scientific investiga-
tion. People such as Bacon and Isaac Newton were not satisfied
with repeating the words and thoughts of the authorities before
them. Rather, enamored as they were with scientific investiga-
tion and observation, they advocated for the idea that one must
test those words and thoughts. Despite this philosophical
change in the zeitgeist, however, the past humoral system was
not far behind. And this makes sense, for like the pendulum of a
clock that swings from one side to the other, it too must pass
through the middle. Or in Bacon's writings:
"Divers, we see, doe stut. The Cause, may bee, (in most,) the
Refrigeration of the Tongue; Whereby it is lesse apt to move.
And, therefore wee see that Naturalls doe generally Stut. And
wee see that in those who stut, if they drinke Wine moderately,
they Stut less, because it heateth...."2
Bacon's quote points out, once again, the earlier theory based
on the humoral system that the tongue of (most) people who
stutter is weak or cold. With that as the basic assumption, it
was suggested that heat, like that provided by the alcohol in
wine, rectifies the "refrigerated condition" of the tongue of peo-
ple who stutter. So, it would seem, such early "treatment" was
consistent with early theory. Of course, to subscribe to such
theory requires one to ignore other possible explanations cast-
ing doubt on Bacon's basic premise that alcohol "heats" a "cold"
tongue and thus leads to increased fluency.2 For example,
perhaps the person habitually inhibits the smooth, fluent flow
of their speaking by overly self-correcting, editing, and revising
their speech-language planning and production. Thus, drinking
alcohol may disinhibit the person's habitual and frequent inhib-
iting tendency. And by so doing, the person exhibits an increase
in fluent speech!
Be that as it may, it is not our intent to use the advances in
knowledge and procedures of the 21st century to critique
Bacon's 17th-century notion of stuttering. Rather, it is to show
that Bacon and his predecessors held theories about the cause
and treatment of stuttering that were influenced, at least in
part, by the tenets of the humoral system. Even so, Bacon and
his fellow travelers of that time were unique in that they were
some of the first to suggest that merely relying on the word of
2.3 The Beginnings: Shifting from Humoral to Scientific Approaches
17

authority about x, y, or z phenomena was inadequate to obtain
a true understanding of such phenomena. Bacon and those who
followed him, such as Voltaire, Darwin, and Pasteur, would
instead push for exact, rigorous observation (and, if possible,
testing) of events, stimuli, and phenomena. Truly this, called the
"scientific method," laid down the blueprints that much of our
current research continues to follow and refine.
"But by far the greatest obstacle to the progress of science and to
the understanding of new tasks...is found in this—that men
despair and think things impossible."
Francis Bacon (b. 1561, d. 1626)
2.4 The 18th and 19th Centuries:
Establishment of the Scientific
Method
Beginning in the late 17th century with the work of Bacon/
Newton and continuing through the early 19th century, the age
of enlightenment or reason held sway throughout much of Eu-
rope. This period was noted for many things, but for our pur-
poses we will focus on its rejection (without criticism) of the
words and thoughts of authority and emphasis on the scientific
method. Indeed, much of our modern-day scientific method
saw its beginning during this time.
Of relevance is this period's emphasis on the process of acquir-
ing and/or developing knowledge, to test hunches, hypotheses,
ideas, and theory. This method then insisted on (and still does
now) careful/exact observation, applying objectivity/skepticism
toward that which is observed, and from these observations,
developing, testing, and refining or rejecting hypotheses. As
more and more investigators followed these principles of the
scientific method, more and more objective information about
and understanding of stuttering was developed and reported.
Ideas die hard, however, and many were not overly impressed
with the scientific method, relying instead on the thoughts and
words of authorities through much of the 19th century. This is
particularly true when it comes to theories of stuttering during
the 19th century (i.e., the 1800s). This was the age of nosology
(i.e., classification of diseases), which lead to the classification
of speech and hearing disorders. Some of these classification
schemes were focused on symptomatology, whereas others also
included etiologies, anatomy, and therapy procedures for each
disorder. Of these elements of classification, we turn to etiology
for that is, in essence, theory.
"There is no short cut to truth, no way to gain a knowledge of the
universe except through the gateway of scientific method."
Karl Pearson (b. 1857, d. 1936)
Of the various classification schemes, Erasmus Darwin's2 non-
humoral system account bears special mention. This is because
of his strong interest in normal as well as disordered speech
and language. In general, his theory of stuttering appears based
on the law of association or contiguity: two objects become
linked with one another when they are perceived or thought of
simultaneously or in close association. (This is a bit like the
American behavioral psychologist Edwin Guthrie's principle of
contiguity learning, i.e., a combination of stimuli that accom-
pany a movement will, on its recurrence, be followed by that
movement. Or, the modern-day neuroscience principle, "those
things that fire together wire together.") Specifically, Darwin
theorized that when the person who stutters is considerably
focused on an idea, the associated fear of failure is so strong
that muscular motions and/or articulations become impaired.
What is important here is that Darwin's theory specifically
implicated simultaneously occurring psychology and physiolog-
ical processes in stuttering and did so in a way that comes close
to being testable and possibly falsifiable (falsifiability refers to
the ability of a theory or hypothesis to be contradicted and is
one important cornerstone of the scientific method). His theory
clearly breaks with earlier humoral system accounts and points
to increasing use of the scientific method to better understand
stuttering.
"Observation, reason, and experiment make up what we call the
scientific method."
Richard P. Feynman (b. 1918, d. 1988)
2.5 The 19th and 20th Century:
Physiological and Psychological
Theories
Although the scientific method was, at least at its outset,
more amenable to the study of observable anatomical and
physiological structure and functioning, during the 1800s
psychological processes were increasingly considered. Quite
naturally, this orientation has carried into therapeutic and
theoretical accounts of stuttering. It should be noted that dur-
ing this period, physiology was thought to have considerable
impact on psychology. Indeed, many appeared to believe that
the brain, either in general or specifically, determined an indi-
vidual's psychological assets and liabilities.
At this time, we find theorists suggesting that psychological
processes, emotions, and the like may contribute to stuttering.
One such theorist—Edward Warren2—suggested in the mid-
1800s that stuttering is a nervous system disorder and that
when this "weakness" is associated with or exacerbated by fear,
true stuttering occurs. Warren appears to be one of the first to
suggest that the cause of stuttering was both mental and phys-
ical in nature. Interestingly, Warren also suggested that people
who stutter often exhibit a "nervous temperament." Indeed,
considerable discussion during the 1800s regarding tempera-
ment and stuttering, as well as refinement in the nature and
variety of temperaments occurred, presaging a return to this
area of study in the first two decades of the 21st century.
"The deepest sin against the human mind is to believe things
without evidence. Science is simply common sense at its best—
that is, rigidly accurate in observation, and merciless to fallacy in
logic."
Thomas H. Huxley (b. 1825, d. 1895)
In 1914, John M. Fletcher published a paper (really more like
a monograph)—An Experimental Study of Stuttering5—that
reported the findings of a series of empirical studies of stuttering.
Some 20th- and 21st-Century Theories of Stuttering: A Brief Overview
18

Although smaller studies before and larger studies after were
published, Fletcher's study is notable for its systematic applica-
tion of the scientific method, not to mention its emphasis on
the "psychology" of stuttering. Heretofore, most theories of
stuttering, with some exceptions, focused on possible anatomi-
cal, physiological, and neurological contributions to stuttering.
Indeed, as we cover more modern-day theories, it will be
become apparent that some are primarily based on a "nature"
(i.e., genetic, congenital, biological) perspective, some primarily
a "nurture" (i.e., environmental, learned, psychosocial) per-
spective, and others an "interactive" nature plus nurture (e.g.,
slow-to-develop speech-language abilities interacting with
emotional sensitivity) perspective.
As mentioned earlier, for further detail pertaining to stut-
tering therapies and the theories behind them during the
1800s through mid-1900s, see Van Riper.3 His extensive cov-
erage, especially those based on translations of non-English
publications, provides a good breadth and depth description
of various approaches to stuttering. Further, Van Riper's writ-
ing gives the sense that many aspects of stuttering therapy/
theory believed to be "novel" actually have a considerable
history of application and reported results. Of course, these
earlier studies do not always meet the 21st-century stand-
ards of scientific study, but applying the 21st-century stand-
ards to 19th-century research is less than reasonable. What
does seem reasonable, however, is to admire these earlier
investigators increased willingness to experiment and test
hunches, hypotheses, and ideas about stuttering instead of
merely accepting and following authoritative but nontested
opinions and pronouncements about stuttering.
Before we begin our discussion of some of the more promi-
nent theories of the 20th and 21st centuries, it is worth noting
that at their heart lies the notion of causality—that is, "what
causes stuttering?" The search for "cause" is, of course, a chal-
lenging but not insurmountable task, as modern-day theories
meet up with ever-more refined, sophisticated methodology.
Technically, for A to cause B, three conditions must be met:
(1) A (cause) must happen before B (eﬀect); (2) A (cause) and B
(eﬀect) must covary (e.g., if more of A more of B); and (3) no
plausible alternative "causal" variable should be readily appa-
rent. Unfortunately, these causality conditions have not always
been applied to modern-day theories of stuttering, especially
those that are more formal and testable using the scientific
method.
Just importantly, however, such lack of application does
not render theories meaningless, particularly if they lead to
further scientific exploration that reveals more truths about
stuttering that were not previously known. However, that
few such theories have met these formal "causality" condi-
tions should create a degree of humbleness for both theorists
and therapists alike. In the latter part of this chapter, we will
return to the issue of causality, the criteria for establishing it,
and challenges to meeting those conditions when empirically
examining stuttering.
"In the real world there is no nature vs. nurture argument, only
an infinitely complex and moment-by-moment interaction
between genetic and environmental eﬀects."
Gabor Maté (b. 1944)
2.6 The Early to Mid-20th Century:
Physiological and Psychosocial
Theories
2.6.1 Nature Perspectives
The brain, of course, is fundamental to what we do and say. It
should, therefore, come as no surprise that one of the first
prominent 20th century theories of stuttering involved the
brain and its processes. Indeed, empirical studies of one aspect
of this theory—namely, the notion that people who stutter
have insuﬃcient cerebral dominance—continue to this day. As
we shall see later in the chapter, some of the more rigorously
pursued modern-day approaches toward identifying causal con-
tributors to stuttering involve cortical and subcortical processes.
Cerebral Dominance Theory
One of the more notable theories of this period, the cerebral
dominance theory of stuttering,6,7,8,9 posited that people who
stutter have ambiguous or uncertain laterality of cortical domi-
nance, particularly for the speech-language centers of the brain.
The underlying assumption of the cerebral dominance theory
was that during normal speech there was synchronization in
timing between the two cerebral hemispheres for control of the
left and right halves of the speech musculature. This synchroni-
zation was believed to be possible because one hemisphere,
usually the left, was dominant over the other. This theory sug-
gested, however, that people who stutter did not have this
normal pattern of cerebral dominance and this led to poor syn-
chronization of the speech musculature and, in turn, stuttering.
Research Findings
Technology and research methods available in the late 1920s
and some decades thereafter made it decidedly diﬃcult to
directly test the notion of "laterality of cortical dominance."
However, handedness (i.e., being right-handed, left-handed, or
ambidextrous), which can be related to cerebral dominance,
has been thoroughly studied during the first and second halves
of the 1900s. During this time, a multiyear exploration of the
relation between handedness and stuttering was therefore,
initiated to test, albeit indirectly, whether uncertain cerebral
laterality was associated with stuttering.
To begin with, some of the earlier studies appeared to sup-
port a lack of cerebral dominance in people who stutter, but a
series of studies, employing larger numbers of participants, did
not. More recently, Geschwind and Behan10 reported that in rel-
atively large samples of "highly" righted-handed and "highly"
left-handed individuals, self-reports indicated that 4.5% of the
left-handed stuttered and 0.9% of the right-handed stuttered.
Following, a robust meta-analysis11 of cortical activity, mainly
involving adults, indicated that people who stutter are more
apt to exhibit right (or anomalous) lateralization.
There were no diﬀerences, however, in cerebral lateralization
between either older12 or younger9 children who do and do not
stutter. These diﬀerences in findings between children and
adults who stutter have led some13 to suggest that anomalous
lateralization in adults who stutter results from "neoplastic

adaptation." In other words, adults who have stuttered since
childhood change, shift, or switch their "cortical resources" for
speech production from the left to the right hemisphere
following a lifetime of adapting to or dealing with stuttering.
Whatever the case, the cerebral dominance theory of stutter-
ing presages early 21st-century scientific studies. These more
recent theories of the brain and stuttering have employed
various
modern,
sophisticated
neuroimaging
and
related
methodology. Although perhaps obvious, these more modern
procedures for studying brain function and structure were not
available in the 1920s to 1940s when the cerebral dominance
theory was first proposed and tested. We will return to these
more recent cortically oriented theories later in this chapter.
2.6.2 Nurture Perspective
It is diﬃcult to categorically dismiss the notion that environ-
mental factors/variables contribute to human development
and health. Indeed, it is highly likely that similar to other
developmental disorders, environmental factors significantly
contribute to the onset, development, and maintenance of
stuttering. Like the brain, however, saying that environmental
processes may contribute to stuttering is about like saying
that oxygen contributes to our well-being. Such is a foregone
conclusion; what is unknown, however, are the specifics of
these contributions, be they cortical (nature) or environmental
(nurture). The following sections, along with the preceding
coverage of theory, attempt to "fill in" some of the specifics.
Diagnosogenic Theory
If the cerebral dominance theory of stuttering was largely
"nature," Johnson's14,15,16 diagnosogenic theory of stuttering
was largely "nurture." Specifically, according to the diagnoso-
genic theory, the speech (dis)fluencies of children who stut-
ter, at least those occurring near the onset of stuttering, were
assumed to be similar to those of children who do not stutter.
What diﬀered, according to this theory, was that some
parents "diagnosed" stuttering in their children on the basis
of brief, "eﬀortless" repetitions of sound, syllables, words,
and phrases. For example, the theory suggested that when a
child produces a "normal" disfluency, the parents may perceive
it as stuttering, and react to it with concern, worry or upset. If
the parent reacted that way, according to the theory, the child
might try harder not to produce the parent-reacted-to disflu-
ency to avoid disapproval from the parents. Consequently, the
theory suggests, the child's ensuing struggle would transform
his or her normal disfluency into a stuttered disfluency and,
after repeated occurrences, the child would go on to develop
stuttering. On the other hand, if the child's normal disfluency
was perceived as just that—a normal disfluency—then the child
would develop typically fluent speech. Thus, the diagnosogenic
theory states that a child's stuttering starts after, not before, being
diagnosed by an adult, typically one or both parents. In general,
the model is often summarized by saying, "stuttering begins in
the ear of the parent rather than the mouth of the child."
Research Findings
If one is to stay true to the scientific method, handed down and
refined by our predecessors, then one should probably use
Johnson's theory to develop testable hypotheses, empirically
test the same, report the findings, and discuss whether findings
support or refute the hypotheses. That is all well and good, but
if the problem begins with the parent's diagnosis, how might a
researcher study that event? Our answer: not very easily. So,
although the diagnosogenic theory appears somewhat reason-
able and tantalizing, it is in essence incapable of being readily
falsifiable. In short, the theory cannot be tested, at least not
easily. This lack of testability is important if one is going to rest
their beliefs and understanding on facts and data, and not on
seemingly logical but untestable speculation of authority.
Further, more recent genetic findings, for example,17 strongly
suggest that inheritance or nature plays an important role in
the onset and development of stuttering. This does not render
the diagnosogenic theory completely invalid, but it does, once
again, suggest caution, humbleness, and thoughtfulness when
promoting pure or solely nurture or environmental accounts of
stuttering.
Approach-Avoidance Conflict Theory
In his approach-avoidance conflict theory, Sheehan18,19 pro-
posed that stuttering resulted from opposing drives or ten-
dencies to both speak and refrain from speaking. This notable
theory was probably the first to heavily rely on theory and
research findings from psychology. According to this theory,
for a person who stutters, speaking has two "tendencies": one
positive (e.g., I can say what I want) and one negative (e.g., I
do not want to stutter). Furthermore, this theory suggests
that the person will approach the positive and avoid the
negative.
Consequently, if the positive tendency outweighs (i.e., is
stronger than) the negative, the person who stutters will
approach talking and speak fluently. Conversely, if the negative
tendency outweighs the positive, the person who stutters will
avoid and not talk. However, when the two tendencies are
roughly comparable in strength, they intersect and the ensuing
conflict (i.e., "do I approach or avoid?") results in an instance of
stuttering. A similar situation occurs when the person who
stutters considers not speaking; there is a positive tendency (I
will not stutter) and a negative tendency (I will not say what I
want to say). The conflict between the desire to both approach
and avoid not talking (i.e., silence) is, in a sense, the mirror
image of the conflict that occurs between approaching and
avoiding speaking (hence this theory is often referred to as
double-approach-avoidance
conflict
for
speaking
and
not
speaking).
Research Findings
Of the three early to mid-20th-century theories we have exam-
ined thus far, the approach-avoidance conflict theory is perhaps
the most formal and logical. Formal and logical, however, does
not always translate into testable. Others20 have said much the
same, "A theory may be poor not because it is untrue, but
because it is logically incapable of verification as stated." Cer-
tainly, avoidance of speaking, especially in older children, teens,
and adults who stutter can and does occur; however, whether
the mechanism that Sheehan suggests accounts for such avoid-
ance remains unclear. What seems clearer, however, is that
there is a lack of data, facts, and/or findings that either support

20

or refute the fundamental tenets of the approach-avoidance
conflict theory of stuttering. This lack of factual support is no
doubt related to the challenges of empirically testing such a
theory.

this as a sign that you have neither understood the theory nor the
problem which it was intended to solve."

2.7 The Late 20th Century:
Learning and Multifactorial
Theories
2.7.1 Nurture Perspectives
Related to environmental contributions to stuttering is the
notion that learning underlies some, if not much of, stuttering.
As with many human disorders, stuttering is likely to be some-
how related to processes of learning. These processes involve a
myriad of events, for example, developing behavior, knowledge,
insights, and understanding through experience. Furthermore,
these learning processes can be conscious, unconscious, or
some combination of both. The following two theories of stut-
tering, two-factor theory and operant conditioning theory, go
beyond the general in attempts to account for the specific
nature of learning and its contributions to stuttering and asso-
ciated behavior.
Two-Factor Theory
In general, the two-factor theory of stuttering21,22 and other
learning-based models (e.g., operant conditioning) shifted focus
away from nature (e.g., in-born or innate abilities, attributes,
traits) to a more nurture (e.g., experiential, environmental fac-
tors) account of stuttering. Specifically, the "two-factor model"
proposed that instances of stuttering (e.g., sound-syllable repe-
titions) were developed through classical conditioning. It also
proposed that associated, concomitant or secondary behaviors
(e.g., head jerks, eyelids closing, eyeballs turning to the side,
etc.23) were developed through operant conditioning. Accord-
ingly, instances of stuttered speech were thought to result from
emotional arousal that became associated with speech through
classical conditioning. For example, during one occasion a child
might experience negative emotion (e.g., fear) when speaking
to a teacher. If such occasions are repeatedly experienced, the
child's negative emotion (and related increases in anxiety,
stress, or tension) may become more generally associated with
the act of speaking with the teacher. These repeated "pairings,"
in this example negative emotion plus speaking with a specific
individual (in this case the teacher), are posited, by this theory,
to result in disruptions in fluent speech production.
Again, after repeatedly experiencing such encounters, the
child will begin to more frequently produce stuttered speech
whenever he speaks to his teacher, thus marking the beginnings
of stuttering. On the other hand, associated behaviors, such as
lowering eyelids or moving eyeballs to the side when talking,
were thought to be acquired or learned through operant
conditioning, largely through escape and avoidance. For exam-
ple, a child might "accidentally" escape a moment of stuttering
by closing their eyes as he attempts to get a particular word
out. According to the two-factor theory, the momentary relieve
or reprieve the child experienced from escaping an instance of
stuttering would serve as reinforcement, increasing the likeli-
hood that the behavior (i.e., closing the eyes) will occur again.
As with the approach-avoidance conflict model, clinicians
have employed therapeutic approaches that are based on the
theoretical
underpinnings
of
the
two-factor
theory.
This
theory-to-therapy connection seemingly rests on two points.
The first point relates to the model's assumption that instan-
ces of stuttering resulted from disruptions of speech by "fear
reactions" that have been classically conditioned. Thus, thera-
pies attempting to treat these "fear reactions" have employed
"systematic desensitization." That is, the person who stutters is
helped, by the clinician, to reach a state of deep relaxation.
While in that state, the client is asked to imagine feared speak-
ing situations, beginning with those that are less feared. Once
the client indicates that the imagined situation no longer
evokes fear or distress for them, the procedure is then repeated,
gradually increasing, over time, the degree of fearfulness of the
imagined situations. The relaxation is thought to inhibit or min-
imize the various cognitive, emotional, and physical events
associated with fearfulness, as the two states of being (i.e.,
relaxed, nonfearful vs. nonrelaxed, fearful) presumably cannot
occur simultaneously.24
The second point relates to the model's assumption that asso-
ciated, concomitant, or secondary behaviors (e.g., head jerks)
were developed through operant/instrumental conditioning
and as such could not be mitigated by systematic desensitization.
Instead, these operantly conditioned behaviors were thought to
be changed through the process of reactive inhibition.25 With
this therapy, a person who stutters would engage in mass (i.e.,
repetitive) practice of these concomitant behaviors. These
repeated productions of associated behaviors (e.g., looking
away from the listener) were thought to build up fatigue (i.e.,
reactive inhibition)20 and, therefore, diminish or inhibit the
reinforcement that supposedly developed these behaviors in
the first place.
Research Findings
Although the theory and logic behind the two-factor theory
appear reasonable, there have been relatively few published
reports of empirical testing that either support or refute its ten-
ets. Those that have been reported26,27 indicate that, in general,
various forms of "punishment" have no appreciable impact on
stuttering. In fact, in one single-participant study,28 punishment
was reported to actually increase the frequency of prolonga-
tions. Others,29 however, have reported that making a loud
auditory stimulus contingent on sound prolongations and repe-
titions reduced these speech disfluencies. If, as the two-factor
account suggests, instances of stuttering are not instrumentally
or operantly learned, then stuttering should not decrease
because of punishment; however, in at least one study it did.
Currently, therapy procedures based on the two-factor model
are not widely used. Still, some individuals with a long history of
stuttering may find it helpful to learn how to cognitively, emo-
tionally, and physically relax when speaking. This is particularly
2.7 The Late 20th Century: Learning and Multifactorial Theories
21

true for those who have developed fears and worries about both
talking and stuttering. In hindsight, perhaps the biggest contri-
bution of the two-factor theory was to shift the emphasis from
cortical/physiological accounts of stuttering to learning and envi-
ronmental contributions. This shift in emphasis helped the field
better understand the challenge of employing relatively invaria-
ble (nature) accounts as the sole means for explaining variable
behavior such as stuttering (a point we will return to at the end
of this chapter). Immediately below, we shall see at least one
more prominent theory of stuttering—operant conditioning
theory—that also shifted the frame of reference concerning the
etiology of stuttering.
Operant Conditioning Theory
The operant conditioning account of stuttering (e.g., Flanagan
et al,30 Shames and Sherrick,31 Ingham and Andrews,32 and
Ingham33) was based on Skinner's34 theory of
learning.
According to this account, instances of stuttering are "operants"
or behaviors that "operate" on the environment that can be
modified by their consequences.34 As such, these operant behav-
iors can be learned or established through response-contingent
reinforcement.
Relating operant conditioning to stuttering, instances of stut-
tering are thought to be developed, established, or learned
according to the principles of operant conditioning. Specifically,
there may be something positive in the environment that rein-
forces the behavior (i.e., stuttering). For example, say that a
child produces a repetition, and this has the eﬀect of getting
the parent's attention. The increased parental attention being
paid to the child may serve as a positive reinforcer, making it
more likely that the child will produce a repetition in the future,
when he desires the parent's attention. (Of course, parental
attention, in this example, is assumed to be desired by the child,
something the child would do nothing to avoid and if not
desired, parental attention may not be reinforcing.)
Although positive reinforcement is an important aspect of
operant conditioning, so too is negative reinforcement (and
negative reinforcement is not the same as punishment). Nega-
tive reinforcement may occur if there is cessation or removal of
a non-positive environmental event contingent upon a behavior
or the consequence thereof. For example, removal or cessation
of parental frowning can be "negatively" reinforcing if contin-
gent on or the consequence of a child's attending rather than
ignoring the parent. In other words, the parent ceases to frown
when the child attends. If applied consistently each time the
child attends, at least in theory, cessation of parental frowning
should increase the frequency of the child's attentiveness. Be
that as it may, for the purpose of this overview of theories of
stuttering, we will limit our discussion of the operant theory of
stuttering to "positive" reinforcers or reinforcement.
The elegant simplicity of this theory was attractive to both
theorists and clinicians alike. This was because, at least in part,
the theory was based on measurable, observable behaviors or
events that could be counted and compared across settings
and/or over the course of treatment. Indeed, the "observable"
aspect of this model is completely in line with the position
taken by Francis Bacon; he would only theorize and discuss that
which was observable.
In keeping with Skinner's ideas, researchers and clinicians
who viewed stuttering as an operant behavior would count
instances of stuttering as an index of "learning." Again, the beauty
of this approach was its steadfast adherence to identifying learn-
ing through measurable, observable behavior by using means
readily available to other researchers and clinicians. In other
words, such measurable, observable behaviors could be readily
replicated from one observer to the next. Accordingly, any aspect
of stuttering that changed due to response-contingent reinforce-
ment (or punishment) was considered, by definition, to be an
operant. These operant behaviors are fundamentally diﬀerent
from classically conditioned behaviors, which involve stimu-
lus substitution (e.g., a light stimulus substituting for a loud,
annoying alarm bell) as the mechanism for learning. Further,
this theory, because of its reliance on measuring only that
which is observable, eschews more abstract constructs such
as feeling, thinking, etc.—unless, of course, one would assume,
they could be clearly connected to or considered observable
behavior.
Research Findings
Research has shown that overt stuttering can either decrease or
increase in response to environmental events. These findings
lend support to the hypothesis that various aspects of stuttering
behavior are operant in nature. One of the nontrivial inconsis-
tencies with the operant model of stuttering, however, is that
there have been reported instances of stuttering increasing
with punishment.35 If a behavior is truly an operant, according
to the theory, it should decrease with punishment or negative
consequences/contingencies. Indeed, clinically oriented studies
of young children who stutter, for example,36,37 have reported
that apparently neutral to benign verbal corrections, reprimands,
or punishment for stuttering decrease stuttering (putting aside,
for the sake of argument, the decrease in stuttering that at least
70% of children who stutter will eventually experience without
formal therapeutic intervention).
These diﬀerences in the behavioral responses between chil-
dren and adults to response-contingent reinforcement, have
led to at least two observations: (1) we cannot readily extrap-
olate backward from the behavior of adults who stutter to that
of children who stutter, and (2) we cannot readily extrapolate
forward from the behavior of children who stutter to that of
adults who stutter. Thus, there remains some uncertainty
regarding the influence of chronological age and/or experi-
ence on operant-oriented treatments for stuttering. There is
less uncertainty that early enthusiasm for theoretical consid-
eration of stuttering as an operant behavior has not seemingly
been maintained in recent years. Nevertheless, despite waning
of theoretical interest in operant theories of stuttering, there
remains enthusiasm, by some clinicians, for operant-informed
treatments of stuttering. Specifically, clinical approaches,
based solely or in part, on operant theory/method, especially
for young children who stutter, continue to be employed in
the form of "verbal contingencies" for both fluent and stut-
tered productions.36 Such clinical approaches have reportedly
resulted in significant improvement in stuttering for these
children.37

22

2.7.2 Nature and Nurture Interaction
Perspectives
Demands and Capacities Model
The demands and capacities model (DCM) of stuttering is
straightforward in suggesting that stuttering occurs when the
"demands" (social or otherwise) that are being placed on a
child for fluent speech exceed the child's "capacities" (social-
emotional maturity, language formulation, cognitive skills, and/
or speech motor) for producing fluency.38,39,40 If the demands
continue to exceed the child's capacity, the child will struggle
more during speaking, particularly during instances of disflu-
ency, leading to the development of stuttering. The DCM was a
truly interactive model in that environmental pressure, require-
ments, or stimuli were thought to interact with the child's
inherent or innate capabilities. Although the model attempts to
account for stuttering in people who stutter as a group, it has
the potential to account for individual cases as well. That is, the
DCM allows for many permutations of demands exceeding ca-
pacities involving one or more constructs (i.e., linguistic, motor,
etc.). Interestingly, the converse—capacity exceeding demand—
does not seem to be, according to the DCM model, a potential
pathway to producing stuttering. In other words, the interac-
tion between demand and capacity seems uni- rather than
bidirectional in nature.
Research Findings
It is worth noting that in 2000 an entire issue of the Journal of
Fluency Disorders41 was devoted to a critical appraisal of the
DCM's theoretical and clinical implications. In the absence of
testable hypotheses and empirical data, it is diﬃcult to adequately
assess the validity of this volume other than saying that the DCM
engendered a robust pros and cons debate. A bit closer to testing
the DCM, or at least some of its basic assumptions, it would
seem, are the findings of a series of studies by a German
researcher, Bosshardt.42 Although these studies involved adults
rather than children who stutter, some of the findings are rele-
vant to the DCM. In essence, Bosshardt's studies examined the
eﬀect of changes in "processing load" (one form of demand, it
may be argued), using a dual-task paradigm (think about driving
a car while talking on a telephone), on the frequency of stutter-
ing. The adults who stutter were reported to exhibit increased
disfluency and/or lower linguistic productivity, suggesting that
the "heightened demands" of the task exceeded their capacity
for fluent speech and/or language formulation. Whether these
findings are directly related to the DCM, the implications of these
results for hypotheses and theory are exactly the type of knowl-
edge generation/theory testing that the founders of the enlight-
enment like Bacon, Newton, and Voltaire had in mind.
2.8 Late 20th to Early 21st
Century: Prominent Contemporary
Theories
As the 20th century turned the corner into the 21st century,
theories of stuttering became increasingly influenced by advan-
ces in a variety of related disciplines (e.g., psycholinguistics,
speech motor control, etc.). The application of these advances
moved from the general (e.g., demands and capacity model) to
much more specific processes (e.g., the covert repair hypothesis
[CRH], execution and planning [EXPLAN] model, etc.). Indeed,
the past 20 to 25 years of theory relating to the causation of
stuttering have increasingly relied on understanding of findings
and speculation from outside the area of speech-language path-
ology. These theories are noted not only for this reliance but
also for their formality and ability to generate hypotheses that
are both testable and capable of being falsifiable. The speech-
language formulation and computational/ neurocomputational
models discussed in this section are based on a nature perspec-
tive, whereas the multifactorial theories are clearly interactive—
that is, they adopt both a nature and nurture orientation.
2.8.1 Speech-Language Planning
Theories
Covert Repair Hypothesis
Arising from a psycholinguistic perspective regarding (a)typical
speech-language planning and production, Dutch researchers
Postma and Kolk formulated and reported on the CRH.43,44 The
CRH provides a decidedly diﬀerent approach to understanding
stuttering. In brief, the model takes a psycholinguistic perspec-
tive that focuses on the interactions between linguistic and
psychological factors. As such, psycholinguists study the psy-
chological and neurological underpinnings of human language
comprehension and production.
Beginning with their landmark theoretical-position paper,43
Postma and Kolk's CRH was created to explain both typical
and atypical speech disfluencies. The model rests on the rea-
sonable assumption that all speakers occasionally produce
errors during language processing. For example, when prompted
to name a picture of a cat, a speaker might inadvertently select
the wrong phoneme (/r/), saying "rat" instead of "cat." Most
theories of language production propose that the accuracy of
speech can be monitored before production and if an error is
detected, it can be corrected. To repair the error, speech is inter-
rupted, with the by-product of this repair being a normal or stut-
tered disfluency—that is, the very aspects of speech output that
characterize instances of stuttering.
The CRH appears rooted in the idea that unlike normally
disfluent individuals, people who stutter are presumed to have
diﬃculty with phonological processing (see ▶Chapter 4). As a
result of these assumed phonological processing diﬃculties,
individuals who stutter have many more opportunities to correct
their (more frequent) errors, and thus, create, as a by-product,
more disfluency. The model was quite unique and generated a
great deal of attention from researchers and clinicians alike,
resulting in a fair amount of empirical testing. It is also one of
the only models that have attempted to explain the production
of diﬀerent types of disfluencies (e.g., why a speaker might
sometimes produce a sound repetition and at other times a
sound prolongation).
Research Findings
In general, some research findings support the basic notion(s)
of the CRH and some do not. Regardless, such testing is a step
2.8 Late 20th to Early 21st Century: Prominent Contemporary Theories
23

forward to the truth of the matter and for that, the CRH has
moved our understanding of stuttering forward. For an exam-
ple, it has been reported that slips of the tongue (e.g., saying
"coﬀee cot" for "coﬀee pot") are related to instances of stutter-
ing produced by children who stutter.45 Likewise, articulatory
accuracy is lower for children whose stuttering persists com-
pared to those who recover.46 Studies of syntactic (i.e., gram-
matical formulation level)47 and lexical (i.e., word-selection
level) processing48 have further indicated that these aspects of
speech-language planning and production diﬀer between chil-
dren who do and do not stutter. Interestingly, at the phonolog-
ical level (i.e., sound-selection level), there appears to be no
diﬀerence in performance between children who do and do
not stutter. However, children who stutter, unlike their nor-
mally disfluent peers, exhibit a significant correlation between
their articulation test scores and their overall reaction times to
name age-appropriate pictures.49
Finally, one study of phonological processing50 inspired by
the CRH investigated whether children who stutter, when com-
pared to their typically fluent counterparts, exhibit less mature
(i.e., holistic) than mature (i.e., incremental) forms of phonolog-
ical encoding. Holistic processing involves processing of speech
at the syllable level, whereas incremental processing involves
processing of speech at the individual sound level. Overall, find-
ings from this study were taken to suggest that young children
who stutter were delayed in shifting from holistic to incremen-
tal forms of processing. This developmental challenge may
impact their abilities to begin and maintain fluency as they
encounter increasingly more complex verbal expression as they
age, findings and speculation consistent with the CRH.
The above findings provide mixed support for the basic tenets
of the CRH. However, findings appear suﬃciently robust to war-
rant empirically investigating this model with diﬀerent, more
fine-grained means of measurement. For example, employing
precise measures of speech reaction time (e.g., measuring elec-
trical activity in the brain using electroencephalography) may
provide more definitive evidence to either support or refute
the CRH.
Execution and Planning Model
The EXPLAN model51,52,53 is similar to the CRH in that both are
psycholinguistic in orientation. According to the EXPLAN mod-
el, which was developed by the British researcher Howell,
speech disfluencies are related to a dyssynchrony (i.e., a timing
or temporal mismatch) between language planning and motor
execution. Specifically, speech disfluencies are thought to occur
when the processes involved with language planning (i.e.,
PLAN) are delayed or slower than the rate of execution (i.e., EX)
of speech.
In essence, there are two interrelated phases to EXPLAN. Giv-
en that the formulation of a language plan occurs before motor
execution, the first phase consists of a delay in language plan-
ning resulting in no speech (available) to execute. In the second
phase, when faced with no speech available to execute, the
speaker adopts one of two processes to "gain" or "buy" time for
further processing. Typically or normally fluent speakers (i.e.,
nonstutterers) do this by means of a "stalling process." This
"stalling process" involves repeating the previously produced
word or inserting a filled (e.g., ummmm, errrrr) or unfilled
(e.g., silent) pause until the language plan becomes available for
execution. In contrast to the "stalling process" employed by
typically fluent speakers, this model posits that people who
stutter employ an "advancing process" whereby they repeat
portions of the word that is presently being processed. This
"advancing process" is thought to result in sound/syllable repe-
titions (e.g., "m-m-m-more"), blocks (e.g., "muh [long silent
pause] ore"), or sound prolongations (e.g., "mmmmmore").
Research Findings
There is an intuitive feel to EXPLAN. That is, the model, although
much more sophisticated and technical in nature than models of
the early to mid-20th century, shares some of the same assump-
tions. For example, in 1826, Combe2 suggested that stuttering
relates to "the ineﬀectual struggle of a small organ of language
to keep pace with the workings of larger organs of intellect."
In essence, these early-day scholars were proposing "a lack of
synchronization between language and thought."2 Of course,
19th-century notions of "language" and "thought" do not readily
map onto current, more data-based terms, like "execution" and
"planning," but the key similarity is the notion of less-than-
appropriate synchronization between related but diﬀerent proc-
esses. And given that instances of stuttering seem to disrupt the
"temporal flow" of speech, as mentioned earlier, there is intuitive
appeal for a model like EXPLAN in which disturbances in timing
are thought to be central to stuttering.
Of course, just because something seems intuitive (rather
than evidence based) does not necessarily mean it is wrong. In-
deed, many well documented theories start out from intuitions,
hunches, and observations made during the process of clinical
practice. Whether intuitive or not, Howell52 proposes that
EXPLAN's account of stuttering involves an "autonomous
theory"—that is, a theory that assumes that the production
system works independent of perception. As such, Howell
argues, "...many features of stuttering can be explained in an
autonomous production model in which the problem arises at
the point where linguistic and motor processes interact." Here
again, there is intuitive appeal to EXPLAN in that stuttering is
quite often associated with the first word of an utterance, a
word spoken that is not apparently reliant on perception of
one's own overt speech.
Interestingly, the "autonomous" nature of EXPLAN contrasts
with other models (e.g., Kolk and Postma44) that assume a link
between perception and production. Which approach best fits
actuality or data—that is, perception linking with production
versus perception autonomous from production—will not be
solved in these pages. However, both CRH and the EXPLAN
model have benefitted greatly from the confluence of modern-
day psychological and linguistic constructs in research. In short,
both models have expanded the parameters as well as frame-
work within which to view the possible means by which
instances of stuttering are generated and, hence, elevated and
furthered our understanding of stuttering.
2.8.2 Multifactorial Theories
Dual-Diathesis Stressor Model
The dual-diathesis stressor (DD-S)54,55,56 model of stuttering
builds on the earlier Monroe and Simons' diathesis stress

24

model57 in the field of psychology. As applied to stuttering, the
DD-S model rests on several assumptions. Below are brief descrip-
tions of the diathesis stressor model in general as well as specific
assumptions made when applying the model to stuttering.
The word "diathesis" comes from the Greek term for predis-
position or sensibility. A diathesis (thought to be an inherited
or innate vulnerability/weakness) can take many forms, for
example, biological, genetic, or psychological. Stress or stressors
are typically considered to be related to environmental or life
challenges, events, or experiences. Taken together, this model,
typically considers the diathesis to be a biological or genetic
trait (but other forms are possible, e.g., the early life experience
of loss or death of a parent) and stress to be an environmental
event or experience. Central to the diathesis-stress model is the
notion that a diathesis, predisposition, or vulnerability interacts
with stress (stressors) associated with environmental factors.
The model assumes that when the combination or interaction
of the diathesis-stress exceeds a threshold, the individual may
be at risk of developing a disorder, especially if this combination
is experienced repeatedly or routinely. If this model sounds like
one that assumes that nature (diathesis) interacts with nurture
(stressors), that is because it is such a model! Furthermore, the
model assumes that diatheses vary across individuals. Thus, if
two individuals, with diﬀerent diatheses, are exposed to similar
life experiences, their responses or outcomes are likely to diﬀer,
according to this model.
Briefly, the DD-S model's application of diathesis-stress
theory to stuttering, involves specific assumptions. First, the
DD-S model assumes two diﬀerent diatheses, one emotional
and the other speech-language, with some people who stutter
having one or the other or both. Second, the DD-S model
assumes that neither diatheses nor stressors need be pathologi-
cal or markedly disparate from the norm to activate underlying
predispositional vulnerabilities. Rather, the model assumes that
there merely needs to be a confluence of the two—the diathesis
and stressor—that exceeds some threshold for an instance of
stuttering to occur and/or a problem with stutter to develop or
exist. Third, the DD-S model of stuttering assumes that proc-
esses thought to contribute to stuttering—such as cognitive,
emotional, linguistic, and motoric processes—concurrently in-
teract with one another and that these processes are likely
sources of diatheses. Fourth, and perhaps obvious, the DD-S
model assumes that people who stutter may have a biological
or genetic diathesis (i.e., a vulnerability) that can be activated
by domain-specific stress. Domain-specific stress is specific to
each diathesis, for example, planning or formulating speech-
language at a rate of speech (the stressor) that well exceeds
one's
motoric
abilities
to
produce
speech
fluently
(the
diathesis). Fifth, and finally, the DD-S model assumes that these
diatheses—again, frequently thought to be biological and/or
inherited in nature—represent "open" genetic variables. This
means that they are "open to" or permit considerable environ-
mental interaction and influence (i.e., epigenetic).
In general, the DD-S model of stuttering posits that one or
both diatheses (i.e., emotions and speech-language) contribute
to stuttering, each with its own domain-specific stressors (as
mentioned earlier). Specifically, the DD-S model hypothesizes
that a diathesis (e.g., high emotional reactivity and/or low emo-
tional regulation) that is intermittently but predictably activated
by environmental events or experiences increases the likelihood
of instances of disfluency occurring and/or a stuttering problem
developing or existing. The confluence or combinations of
diatheses-stress (be they emotional, speech-language, or both)
intermittently challenge the speaker's ability to plan and produce
on-the-fly speech and language fluently and quickly. These
two "combinations" can occur concurrently or singularly. Most
importantly, the notion of "intermittently activated" is consistent
with the model's basic assumption that the cause of stuttering is
neither static nor invariant, thus accounting for variability in
stuttering itself (with variability being a hallmark of stuttering).
Research Findings
To date, the DD-S model of stuttering has been tested at least
three times.55,56,58 The first empirical test,55 with young chil-
dren who do and do not stutter, indicated that emotion and
language diatheses in preschool children are associated with
not only stuttering but also coping strategies and situational
emotional stressors. For example, children who exhibited more
negative emotions and lesser abilities to regulate their emo-
tional reactivity produced more stuttering, whereas those with
more negative emotions and greater regulation produced fewer
stuttering (see ▶Chapter 6). Findings from a second study56
with young children demonstrated that increases in stuttering
were associated with higher levels of both positive and negative
emotions—that is, the more emotionally aroused a child was,
the more likely they were to stutter, regardless of whether the
emotions were positive or negative. Findings from a third
study58 of older children who stutter appear to support the
basic diathesis-stress tenet of the DD-S model. The authors of
this third study58 interpret their findings as supporting the
notion that a child's temperament may be, for example, an
"intrinsic sensitivity" (diathesis) that is "triggered and boosted
by external agents" (stressors) "to influence the emergence of
disfluencies" (p.10).
However, given that these three studies involved young and
older children, it remains unclear if their findings also apply to
teens and adults who stutter. Further, as findings suggest,58
there may be temperamental diﬀerences between younger and
older children who stutter (diﬀerences confounded by the fact
that younger children, when compared to older children, who
stutter are more likely to recover from their stuttering without
formal treatment). Whatever the case, at least for pre-school
and school-age children who stutter, emotional processes
would appear to warrant inclusion as one variable related to
stuttering, the diagnosis as well as stuttering, the behavior (see
▶Chapter 7 for further discussion of the assessment of emotional
contributions to the assessment of stuttering in preschoolers).
Multifactorial Dynamic Pathways Theory
As an outgrowth of a long-standing program of empirical study
of stuttering, Smith et al59,60 developed the multifactorial
dynamic pathways (MDP) theory of stuttering. This theory
would appear to provide, a "grand amalgam" of many factors
operating in concert to contribute to stuttering. At the heart of
this "multifactorial" model is a disruption in motor speech pro-
duction that is impacted by cognitive, linguistic, and emotional
variables. The centrality of motor disruption is consistent
with the near universal nature of instances of stuttering, such
as sound/syllable repetitions and prolongations. In essence, a
2.8 Late 20th to Early 21st Century: Prominent Contemporary Theories
25

single "source of disruption" is hypothesized to create homoge-
neity in the symptoms of stuttering. This hypothesis is somewhat
at odds with the observation that stuttering is heterogeneous in
terms of the variables that impact its frequency and severity.
That is, for some people who stutter, emotional factors seem to
predominate, whereas for others, linguistic factors are most
salient. And yet for still others, a combination of variables seems
to be of greatest import. To account for such heterogeneity, the
MDP theory proposes that cognitive, emotional, etc., variables
interact with as well as condition the underlying motor disrup-
tions, making them more or less capable of creating a disruption
in speech fluency. In other words, the theory appears to be sug-
gesting that a select number and nature of motor disruptions are
the reason the "symptoms" of stuttering are essentially universal
across people who stutter, whereas individual diﬀerences in
cognitive, emotional, and linguistic factors are viewed to be the
reason for variation in at least the frequency of overt expression
of these symptoms.
According to the model, this interaction among variables that
contribute to stuttering is dynamic in nature. The word
"dynamic" implies that the contribution of the variables them-
selves and their interactions diﬀer with time, circumstances,
and/or context. For example, a child with strong reaction to a
new or unfamiliar situation, change, and diﬀerence may experi-
ence cognitive or emotional stress. Such stress leads to a scan-
ning of the situation for "threat," creating the potential for
impacting the child's cognitive, linguistic, and motor systems in
a manner that disrupts, at least to a degree, the child's speech
fluency. In other situations, emotion and cognitive variables
may be of less salience, for example, a person describing all the
features of a new bicycle over the phone to someone (who can-
not see the bicycle). In this example, of greater salience is the
fact that such description requires the use of new words and
phraseology that can increase linguistic demand on an already
vulnerable motor system, resulting in speech disfluencies.
In short, the multifactorial model describes a reasonably
select number of variables that may contribute to stuttering.
Further, it suggests that such variables may combine in various
permutations to undermine a person's speech fluency. These
various possible permutations would appear to increase theo-
retical as well as clinical flexibility and thoughtfulness when
accounting for group and individual diﬀerences across various
investigations.
Research Findings
There appears to be developing empirical support for the multi-
factorial model.61,62 For example, the notion that one variable
can create the conditions for another variable to emerge can
be seen by findings61 that longer, more complex sentences may
be associated with more variable speech motor production for
children and adults who stutter, one convergence of events
that may undermine speech fluency. The question remains,
however: why doesn't this impact all speakers?
Perhaps it does, but the impact is thought to be slight
compared to the person who stutters with a vulnerable motor
system, prone to disruption by certain variables or combinations
of variables. The stress, at least for some people who stutter,
could be as straight forward as thought-processes that render an
automatic act like speaking into one that is far more deliberate
(i.e., thinking more about how they speak than the thoughts they
want to express). Whatever the case, the multifactorial model
covers many of the variables reasonably thought to contribute to
stuttering. Furthermore, its manifold possible accounts of stut-
tering open, to a degree, various pathways for research and
clinical exploration. If it is true that standing for most anything
leads to falling for most anything, the long-term influence of
this theory is unknown, but for the present its comprehensive
approach to stuttering is refreshing and quite empirically testable.
2.8.3 Computational/
Neurocomputational Models
SimpleDIVA and Related Models
The last theory discussed in this chapter is the SimpleDIVA
(Directions into Velocities of Articulators)63 model. This model
was "streamlined" from its predecessor models to better charac-
terize individuals with speech disorders. As mentioned, Simple-
DIVA was derived from its "parent" models developed by
Guenther and colleagues: the DIVA model64,65 and its subsequent
version, Gradient Order DIVA (GODIVA).66,67,68 These earlier,
more comprehensive models provide a robust and testable neu-
rocomputational account of speech motor control and sound
sequencing. Although the DIVA family of models are not models
of stuttering per se, some elements of these (DIVA and GODIVA)
models have been applied to stuttering.69,70 Detailed, further
explanation of the first two models—DIVA and GODIVA—goes
well beyond the purpose and scope of the present, brief
overview chapter. Instead, we will briefly cover the essentials
of SimpleDIVA, the most recent model in the DIVA family of
models. Again, whereas DIVA and its oﬀshoots are not models
of stuttering per se, they have been applied to the empirical
study of stuttering and will undoubtedly receive further study
employing computer simulations as well as other experimental
methodologies.
In short, SimpleDIVA addresses three fundamental compo-
nents of the DIVA model:64,65 (1) auditory feedback, (2) soma-
tosensory feedback, and (3) feedforward control processes.
Feedforward control refers to a mechanism in a system that
monitors performance inputs rather than outputs and reacts
so as to maintain a specified state by correcting errors or prob-
lems before they occur. So, in a sense, feedback "looks back" to
what has happened and feedforward "looks forward" to what
may or is about to happen.
These three components of SimpleDIVA and their interactions
are perhaps best viewed through the lens of a sensorimotor
adaptation experiment. In such an experiment, the speaker's
acoustic signal is disrupted or shifted over some period of time
(i.e., their auditory feedback is perturbed/shifted). Conse-
quently, the speaker changes their speech production (which
alters their somatosensory feedback) in opposition to the shift,
in order to make their perception better match what they
intended to say (which engages their feedforward control proc-
esses). The processes the speaker uses to make such adjustments
involve a complex combination of feedback and feedforward
controls, processes that are very much involved with normal
speech and language production.
The SimpleDIVA publication63 used real data from an existing
dataset in computer simulations to test the model's fit. To the
Some 20th- and 21st-Century Theories of Stuttering: A Brief Overview
26

present authors' knowledge, SimpleDIVA has not been specif-
ically applied to stuttering. If applied, diﬀerences between
individuals who do and do not stutter in their relative use of
auditory feedback, somatosensory feedback, and feedforward
control processes during speech production may provide some
insight into the underlying mechanisms associated with speech
motor control in stuttering. At the very least, the perturbations
to the auditory/motoric processes associated with instances of
stuttering would seem fertile ground for SimpleDIVA application.
Furthermore,
SimpleDIVA's
relatively
clear,
straightforward
framework and predictions make it an accessible entrance point
for the interested reader, clinician, or researcher interested in the
DIVA/GODIVA model.
Research Findings
Results of recent studies of stuttering, which were either gener-
ated or interpreted by the DIVA/GODIVA models, can be found
in Daliri et al69 and Garnett et al.70 For example, findings from
this latter study indicated that children whose stuttering per-
sisted exhibited reduced thickness in their left motor and later-
al premotor cortices, a morphological diﬀerence that may be
associated with impaired neural processing. These diﬀerences
may make it diﬃcult for the basal ganglia motor loop to identi-
fy/provide the proper sensorimotor context for initiating the
next gesture in a speech sequence, resulting in stuttering. Spe-
cifically, the authors interpreted their findings from two possi-
ble perspectives regarding directionality of eﬀect: (1) impaired
ventral motor/premotor cortex processing makes it diﬃcult for
the basal ganglia to initiate the next gesture in a speech
sequence, creating instances of stuttering; or (2) impaired basal
ganglia neural processing leads to less eﬀective motor programs
in the ventral motor/ventral premotor cortices, creating instan-
ces of stuttering. Chang and Guenther's71 recent review of such
research provides, within the neurocomputational framework
of DIVA, a general takeaway applicable to stuttering. Specifi-
cally, this review suggests that stuttering behaviors may be
associated with impairment within the basal ganglia; impairment
of axonal projections between cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and
thalamus; and impairment in cortical processing. Certainly, these
are intriguing, thought-provoking possibilities. However, such
possibilities must await results of future research for refinement,
refutation, or confirmation.
Whichever perspective on the directionality of eﬀect is even-
tually best supported by objective results, these DIVA-/GODIVA-
interpreted findings are an excellent example of the power of
producing data to examine testable hypotheses generated by a
model (a "test-your-theory" process that was previously dis-
cussed and championed by Newton, Pasteur, Voltaire, and others
in the development of and support for the "scientific method").
Whether hypotheses generated by SimpleDIVA will be empiri-
cally tested regarding the cause and/or origins of instances of
stuttering remains an open question, but the future shines bright
for the DIVA family to further illuminate our understanding of
stuttering.

hypothesis by an ugly fact."
Thomas H. Huxley (b. 1825, d. 1895)
2.9 Further Considerations
The previous section represents a brief coverage of some of the
more prominent theories of stuttering and related phenomena
from the early-mid 20th to early 21st centuries. As mentioned at
the outset, this description was not intended to represent all
theories of stuttering nor was it meant to be comprehensive in
describing those selected. It was, however, representative of the-
ories that were mainly nurture, mainly nature, or amalgams of
both. Furthermore, although some theories have been directly
tested by empirical studies, others have not been tested due to
the challenges that such study would entail. Still, other theories
have either gained or lost support due to studies that indirectly
tested its assumptions; for example, the theory that stuttering is
mainly learned was less than able to readily account for findings
from genetic studies indicating heritable aspects of the disorder.
Thus, theories may rise or fall, in whole or part, due to the
emergence of new data, facts, or information. Such theoretical
comings and goings are not easily charted by a straight line.
However, science, as may be apparent by now, does not proceed
in a straight line but often along a crooked one. Certainly,
science is not a full-contact sport, but neither is it for the faint
of heart. Likening science to ships, it is said that ships are safe
in the harbor. But ships were not built for the harbor.
Whatever the case, there are general considerations regarding
theories of stuttering that deserve mention as well as some
thought. The following are among the more germane considera-
tions, provided neither to critique nor support the above theories
as much as to provide perspective. And, like the present authors'
coverage of the theories themselves, these considerations are not
intended to be nor will be comprehensive of all such matters.
2.9.1 Theories of Stuttering Etiology
Most theories of stuttering attempt, more or less, to put forth or
describe the causes of stuttering. At the least, these theories try
to provide a conceptual framework with which to understand
and view the cause or etiology of instances of stuttering. Putting
forth both—description of cause and conceptual framework—is
helpful and needed. It provides the natural rationale for account-
ing for known facts and theory development. Nevertheless, it is
critical for us to think about what we mean when we say that X
causes Y. Doing so, the authors believe, gives us pause about how
far along the various theories of stuttering have progressed
towards formulation of cause.
Indeed, and as briefly discussed earlier, individuals in the phi-
losophy of science have suggested that to conclusively indicate
that X causes Y, the following three conditions must be met:
●X (cause) must happen before Y (eﬀect), that is, there must
be "temporal precedence."
●X (cause) and Y (eﬀect) must covary (i.e., a relation must
be established), so that the following occurs:
- If X, then Y.
- If not X, then not Y.
OR
- If more of X, then more of Y.
OR
- If less of X, then less of Y.
●There should be no plausible alternative explanation.
2.9 Further Considerations
27

Although some theories of stuttering meet some of these crite-
ria, more than a few meet none or perhaps only one of the
requisites to establish cause-eﬀect. Certainly, the preceding cri-
teria set a high bar to hurdle. However, one might welcome
more explicit attempts to meet such criteria. By so doing, we
might better move forward in our quest to establish the cause
of stuttering. Of course, stuttering is not unique in this regard,
for across the array of speech-language disorders, few theories
can meet these criteria for establishing cause-eﬀect. Indeed,
some of these conditions are diﬃcult to meet regarding stutter-
ing. For example, consider whether the relative thinness of
cortical tissue "causes" persistent childhood stuttering (some-
thing the authors of the previously mentioned study70 did not
suggest). The following question could be asked: Was the corti-
cal morphologic diﬀerence present before the child began to
stutter or did it appear after the child began to stutter? Given
our present lack of precursor indicators prior to the onset of
stuttering in young children, this question is diﬃcult, if not
impossible, to answer.
The bottom line is that understanding the criteria for deter-
mining causation, and our challenges in meeting such criteria,
should make us careful about our statements of cause. Achiev-
ing such humbleness, uncertainty of thought and expression,
should not stifle our attempts to advance our understanding/
knowledge of cause(s) of stuttering. Neither, however, should it
suggest that we know (let alone have answered) all the ques-
tions surrounding what causes stuttering.
"I am an agnostic; I do not pretend to know what many ignorant
men are sure of."
Clarence Darrow (b. 1857, d. 1938)
2.9.2 Antecedents to versus
Consequences of Stuttering
We are often puzzled when we observe and study the behaviors,
events, processes, and experiences associated with stuttering,
either those that are antecedents (occur before) or consequences
(occur after) of the disorder. Arguably, if we could go back in
time to the period before the person began to stutter, we might
have a better understanding of this puzzle. However, even if time
travel were possible, we would still have problems because our
ability to predict stuttering from infancy remains an inexact
science (keeping in mind that most stuttering begins between
2.5 and 4.0 years of age, not during infancy). That said, at present
it remains challenging to precisely discern whether a phenomen-
on associated with stuttering is an antecedent or a consequence.
Some may express knowledge about what preceded what, but
certainty about the uncertainty does not make the latter disap-
pear. It merely puts it out of sight, and often out of mind. And to
paraphrase Aldous Huxley, facts, in this case uncertainty regard-
ing antecedents and consequences, do not cease to exist (simply)
because they are ignored.
The conundrum of what is antecedent and what is conse-
quent becomes even more problematic when one assumes con-
sequence and in addition to that assumption, assigns a causal
chain of events. For example, nonspeech associates of stuttering
(e.g., eye blinking) can have many possible originating sources18
that have little or nothing to do with learned avoidance or
escape, one of the more common explanations for the occur-
rences of nonspeech behaviors associated with stuttering. Thus,
the reader is cautioned to take with a grain of salt conclusions
about antecedents versus consequences of stuttering. For if we
are still struggling to meet the criteria for establishing the cause
of stuttering, we are certainly going to struggle to distinguish
between that which is antecedent to and that which is the con-
sequence of stuttering. Or, as Voltaire reminds us, "Doubt is not
a comfortable condition, but certainty is absurd."
2.9.3 The Diagnosis versus the Behavior
of Stuttering
To date, much of the research into the cause(s) of stuttering has
involved comparing two groups of people: individuals who
stutter and a comparable (e.g., in age and sex) group of individ-
uals who do not. Results from these investigations have been
helpful, informative, and insightful regarding possible causes
of/contributors to stuttering (as well its nature). Such research
can and should continue, particularly when used as an initial
investigation into a promising line of investigation. However,
knowing something about stuttering, the diagnostic category, is
not quite the same as knowing something about stuttering, the
behavior. The diagnostic category is based on a variety of objec-
tive and subjective measurements of stuttering (e.g., measuring
the frequency and severity of stuttering; measuring their level
of articulatory, vocabulary, or language development; asking
the parents of a child who may or may not be stuttering about
the child's speech, language, or fluency; or asking the person
who stutters about their behavior and experiences with stutter-
ing). These measures help the clinician know or understand a
variety of things about the client, for example, whether the
child is stuttering and, if so, their risk of continuing to stutter;
how stuttering is impacting a teen's or adult's academic, emo-
tional, social, and vocational lives; and so forth. Fine, such infor-
mation is important and needed knowledge for clinical practice.
However, one should probably not equate knowing how to
diagnose stuttering with knowing how/why instances of stut-
tering occur. Certainly, knowledge about diagnosis of stuttering
is related to knowledge about how/why instances of stuttering
occur, but knowledge about one is not identical to knowledge
about the other.
Risking redundancy, our understanding of the causal contrib-
utors to stuttering would be stronger if there were available
data that showed that when X variable is present or active,
instances of stuttering occur, or that more stuttering occurs
when there is evidence that a cognitive, emotional, linguistic, or
motor process known to be associated with stuttering occurs with
more frequency or strength. Stronger or more data-supported
levels of knowledge does not imply, of course, absolute as much as
simply greater knowledge.
In essence, more direct, observable measurement of possible
connections between a causal variable and instances of stutter-
ing is what is needed. However, this may be easier said than
done considering that some processes are currently diﬃcult, if
not impossible, to measure on a moment-by-moment basis. For
example, it is not clear how one would measure whether some-
one was having diﬃculty retrieving a lexical item or motor plan
at exactly the same time an instance of stuttering occurred.
And, even if one could measure these exceedingly rapid events,
Some 20th- and 21st-Century Theories of Stuttering: A Brief Overview
28

it would be nearly impossible to know if what is observed is an
antecedent or a consequence of stuttering itself. For example,
perhaps an instance of stuttering that resulted from something
other than what is being measured interfered with the retrieval
of the lexical item or motor plan. Keeping that in mind, it is pos-
sible that the connection between a seeming causal variable
and stuttering might be either moderated or mediated by a third
variable. Hypothetical examples of such interactions are demon-
strated in ▶Fig. 2.1. In ▶Fig. 2.1a, a third or X moderating
variable (i.e., fatigue) conditions, influences, or moderates the
relation between Y, the causal variable (i.e., impaired basal gan-
glia processing), and Z, the eﬀect (i.e., instance of stuttering).
For example, if the person who stutters is fully rested in the be-
ginning of the day, the basal ganglia process may have minimal
impact on the speaker's fluency, but far more at the end of the
day when the speaker is more tired.
In ▶Fig. 2.1b, a third or X mediating variable (i.e., word-initial
sound/syllable) determines or mediates, to a large degree, the
relation between Y causal variable (i.e., impaired basal ganglia
processing) and Z eﬀect (i.e., instance of stuttering). For example,
stuttering would be most prominent on word-initial sounds or
syllables, and less so during other portions of the word. Again,
moderation and mediation are hypothetical examples of how a
third variable might impact the relation between a purported or
known causal variable and an instance of stuttering.
Whether moderated, mediated, or not, it would be a significant
move forward to know, based on data or evidence, that when
alleged causal agent occurs, so too does an instance of stuttering.
Certainly, a causal agent could act in concert with other agents
and/or be "activated" or "set into motion" by other processes or
events. Nothing is oﬀthe table when it comes to considering
causal activities, agents, or events associated with stuttering.
Of course, singular, data-based knowledge about stuttering is
helpful; it provides a pretty good, decent start. For example, it
is helpful to know that judgments of instances of stuttering are
often associated with particular aspects of speech (dis)fluency,
for example, sound/syllable repetition or sound prolongations.
Yes, such basic knowledge is a start to a data-based understand-
ing of stuttering. Likewise, in terms of variables associated with
the diagnosis of stuttering, for example, we know that more
boys than girls are apt to be diagnosed as stuttering. Again, such
knowledge is all well and good, but what does such knowledge
tell us about instances of stuttering and/or the diagnosis of stut-
tering, whether we measure variables like disfluency types or
gender quantitatively or qualitatively?
Perhaps we could extend such knowledge by building upon
known, singular facts in a more "stair-step" fashion. For exam-
ple, assume that several rigorously conducted empirical studies
involving many people who stutter report that utterance-initial
words act like a magnet to attract the iron filings of instances of
stuttering. Starting with such findings might lead us to develop
additional, reasonable, hypotheses. Such hypotheses might, in
turn, guide empirical testing to determine, for example, if
utterance-initial word position acts alone or in concert with
other concurrent variables (e.g., sentence length). This sort of a
"stair-step"
approach,
done
rigorously and
systematically,
allowing the findings to guide each step, would seem to have
potential for furthering our knowledge of stuttering, and, by
doing so, contribute to the development of a comprehensive,
data-based understanding of instances of stuttering, the diag-
nosis of stuttering, and so forth.
2.9.4 Nature, Nurture, and Their
Interaction
Some of the aforementioned theories, such as the diagnosogen-
ic theory, lend themselves to a predominantly nurture, learned,
or environmental explanation of stuttering. Other theories (e.g.,
Fig. 2.1 Hypothetical moderating and mediating
variables. To make the concepts of moderating
and mediating variables more tangible, we
hypothetically assumed that Y causes Z. (a) In
the case of moderation, X (fatigue) conditions,
influences, or moderates the relation between Y
and Z. (b) In the case of mediation, X (word initial
sound/syllable) determines or mediates, to a
large degree, whether Y will cause Z.
2.9 Further Considerations
29

the DIVA family of theories) lend themselves to a predomi-
nantly nature, constitutional, genetic, or neural processes
explanation of stuttering. Obviously, these explanations cannot
be both right, or can they?
Perhaps the truth lies in the fusion of both approaches. For
example, one might speculate that a nature perspective best
explains the basic, essentially universal speaking disruption
associated
with
judgments
stuttering
(e.g.,
sound/syllable
repetitions and sound prolongations). Conversely, a nurture
perspective may best explain individual diﬀerences in related
behavioral, cognitive, and/or emotional processes (e.g., some
children who stutter are quieter, whereas others are quite talk-
ative). Such a nature-nurture account is unlikely to come about
unless those who are adamant that stuttering is solely a prod-
uct of nature and, likewise, those who are steadfast in their
belief that it is solely a product of nurture can collaborate, com-
municate, and work together. For in the end, that which looks
purely genetic may be shown, with further research, to be sub-
ject to experience and learning. Similarly, that which appears
purely experiential may be shown, with further research, to be
inherited as well. Whatever the case, pushing the two ends—
nature and nurture—toward the middle would ultimately help
people who stutter and their families, the ones who must
ultimately contend with, in their daily lives, the interactions
between the two extremes.
2.9.5 Diﬀerent Measurements, Diﬀerent
Results
There is an old saying that if one's only tool is a hammer, every-
thing looks like a nail. Translated to theories of stuttering: if
one only views stuttering from an anatomical perspective,
everything about stuttering looks like bone, cartilage, ligament,
muscle, etc. The notion of parallax is an apt proxy for diﬀering
perspectives that occur when trying to tell time by viewing
the hands of an old-fashioned (analog) clock. If one person
"measures" the hands of an analog clock when directly facing
the clock, they will get perspective A. This perspective will dif-
fer, somewhat, from perspective B, when another person looks
at the same hands telling the same time, but this time they are
standing nearly 90 degrees to the right of the clock face. Yet
another person will get perspective C when they stand nearly
90 degrees to the left of the clock face. All three viewers have a
slightly diﬀerent perspective regarding the time displayed on
the clock face, but each is correct from their diﬀering perspec-
tives or forms of "measurement" of time.
In other words, diﬀerent ways of measuring or observing
provide diﬀerent perspectives of the same constructs. In our
clock analogy above, the diﬀerent perspectives would probably
correlate with one another, but that is not always the case. For
example, our perception of a speech sound is one thing, the
acoustic "profile" of the sound another, and the physiological
movements of the lips, lower jaw, tongue, soft palate, and lar-
ynx still another. Their relation may be less than perfect, but
they are still accurate representations of the same event, just
based on diﬀerent measures which, in turn, may lead to diﬀer-
ent perspectives.
So too are our findings relative to stuttering based on examiner
observation, parental report, electrophysiology, brain imaging,
acoustic analysis, psychophysical measures, and so forth. Each
"type of measurement/observation" provides information, just
from diﬀerent perspectives. Indeed, converging these divergent
indices onto a single behavior, construct, event, or problem would
be one excellent, comprehensive means to better understand that
single "issue." That is true, even if some of the indices do not
correlate with one another or when more of index X is associ-
ated with less of index Y. Hence, having more than one means
of measurement in our methodological toolbox, whether one
is a researcher or a clinician, is wise if one is to achieve a truly
comprehensive understanding of stuttering.
2.9.6 A Varying Eﬀect, an Unvarying
Cause
Johnson72 stated that "...a varying eﬀect may not be accounted
for by reference to an unvarying cause" (p.5). In short, this
statement makes apparent something often overlooked, but
fundamental, about stuttering: it varies. Indeed, for many, if not
most, people who stutter, their speech is more fluent than it is
stuttered. At the least, a fixed or nonvariable "cause" is highly
unlikely to be the one and only cause of a variable problem like
stuttering. It is more likely that a stable variable in a chain of
variables converges to create instances of stuttering, provided
that the other variables change in a similar manner to instances
of stuttering. In other words, the nonvarying variable may only
be a factor during certain conditions—for example, beginning
an utterance—and not others.
Whatever the case, in any of the theories described earlier, as
well as other extant theories not covered or may yet to be
developed and put forth, the notion that stuttering varies must
be recognized and accounted for. Yes, it is an inconvenient truth,
but the truth, nonetheless. Again, we quote Aldous Huxley, who
said "facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored."
2.10 Conclusions
This chapter presented a brief overview of some of the more
prominent theories of stuttering of the 20th and earlier 21st
centuries. In so doing, it also provided, some of the antecedents
to as well as context and background surrounding these theories.
Furthermore, it briefly covered some of the challenges and issues
that all theories must account for and/or deal with. In general, all
theories have pluses and minuses, but taken as a whole, they
provide a framework within which readers may view the onset,
development, and maintenance of stuttering. Indeed, theories
might be likened to cooking recipes and ingredients.
2.10.1 Recipes/Ingredients
One might suggest that theories help narrow the number of in-
gredients that need to be considered when we think about the
cause of stuttering. However, each theory leverages a diﬀerent
recipe to bring those ingredients together in a manner thought
to cause stuttering. Where the challenge remains is not with
the various recipes and their array of ingredients. Instead, the
challenge is that theoretical recipe A may exclude some ingre-
dients of theoretical recipe B. Conversely, theory B may exclude
some of the key ingredients of theoretical recipe A! Both theo-
ries might reflect attempts to account for stuttering but do so

based on diﬀerent sets of constructs, behaviors, or processes.
However, to paraphrase the late U.S. Senator, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, "You are entitled to your own opinion. But you are
not entitled to your own facts." Thus, the reader should attempt
to discern what the sets of facts may be, the actual documented
evidence for such facts, and form their opinions accordingly.
Our confidence in "facts" increases (or at least it should) as
the number of peer reviewed reports from diﬀerent sources
attest to their existence, occurrence, presence, etc. Keep in
mind, though, that some diﬀerences between theories relate to
the context that surrounds their development. For example,
some diﬀerences can, and often do, reflect the (1) general and
specific state of knowledge at the time that each theory was
developed, (2) the quantity and quality of the available technol-
ogy and methodology to test the theory, and (3) the prevailing
clinical and research perspectives at the time the theory was
developed. We can hardly fault, for example, the 1700s theo-
rists proposing a theory that ignores bacteria, microbes, neuro-
transmitters, and viruses if during that long-ago time there was
little or no knowledge of bacteria, microbes, neurotransmitters,
and viruses! When a country's only forms of transportation are
oxen and horses, it seems inappropriate to fault that country for
not having gas stations.
2.10.2 Divergent Approaches to
Same Topic
Returning to our recipe/ingredient metaphor, from the outside
looking in, there is the tendency to think that too many cooks
spoil the broth. Perhaps, but empirically studying the same con-
struct (e.g., fear) using divergent perspectives and methods can
be, and generally is, a strength rather than weakness. It can pro-
vide a more comprehensive, multifaceted understanding of a
given construct rather than one whose view is constricted by
personal, philosophical, or theoretical blinders. Ideally, diver-
gent scientific approaches and specialties should come together
to, at the least, determine that something exists, is present, and
observable. Present and observable, however, does not mean
understood. Likewise, employing an equally divergent approach
helps ensure that meaningful contributors to stuttering are not
ignored or left out of the purview of clinicians and researchers
alike.
2.10.3 The Only Certainty is That
Nothing is Certain
Although a divergent approach to stuttering may provide a
breadth and comprehensiveness to our understanding of stut-
tering, it may also engender uncertainty. And although such
uncertainty may indeed occur, to be absolutely certain that only
X is worthy of study seems strange when applied to an uncer-
tain problem such as stuttering. Indeed, as the old saying goes,
the only certainty is that nothing is certain. Perhaps, a more
middle-ground approach is to suggest that both certainty and
uncertainty are relative in nature. For example, multiple studies
have made it increasingly clear that a significant number of
children who begin to stutter will recover from stuttering with-
out the assistance of formalized treatment.73 We can, therefore,
be relatively certain that within a group of children who are
initially diagnosed with stuttering, more than a few will recover
without treatment.
Such "relative" certainty should come, however, with more
than a little doubt or uncertainty. For example, why does recov-
ery occur for some children but not others? Can we identify,
from the very beginning, those who will and those who will not
recover? Should we treat all such children regardless of
whether they will recover without treatment? Such questions
grow out of the petri dish of uncertainty. Suﬃce it to say that
it is doubt not certainty that more often helps energize our
attempts to advance our knowledge about the onset, develop-
ment, and maintenance of stuttering. And advancing such knowl-
edge is one of the creative and important accomplishments
achieved by the theoreticians reviewed in this chapter.
2.10.4 Facts Are the Foundation
Facts are pesky things. They simply refuse to go away no matter
the strength of our theoretical disinfectant. For example, certain
tests are routinely employed to evaluate the frequency, impact,
and severity of stuttering. Fine, but the "authority" implied by
the consistent, widespread use of such tests should not thwart
attempts, based on systematic collection and analysis of rele-
vant data, to advance, refine, or even replace such tests. Cer-
tainly, these consistently used tests tell us about important
parts of stuttering. But parts do not necessarily constitute a
whole. Indeed, present and future methods, especially in the
area of measuring elements associated with instances of
stuttering74 or factors that contribute to individual diﬀerences
in stuttering,75,76 may lead us to question our understanding of
stuttering. And by raising such questions, they make us a bit
less complacent and certain about what we know about stutter-
ing. This, in turn, should help us to develop diﬀerent perspec-
tives, which may more accurately trace the contours of reality,
no matter how jagged they may be. Without these diﬀerent
perspectives, which are often fostered by new information or old
information viewed in a new way, it will be quite diﬃcult to
advance our understanding of stuttering beyond that of the
present. Fortunately, most clinicians, researchers, and students
who read these words are the oﬀspring of the age of enlighten-
ment. As such, these individuals are likely to expect that the old
and new theories and perspectives will be evaluated based on
relevant data, evidence, and facts. Such evaluation, of course, will
find that some theories are not supported, whereas others are
supported by data, evidence, and facts. And although these same
individuals may regret the former's demise, it is hoped that they
will employ the latter to help build present and future theories
of stuttering upon a foundation of fact more so than fancy.

2.11 Definitions
Approach-avoidance conflict theory:
A psychological (nur-
ture) theory that proposes that stuttering resulted from
opposing drives or tendencies to both speak and refrain
from speaking.
2.11 Definitions
31

Causality:
The relationship between a cause and its result or
consequence (an eﬀect).
Causality conditions:
Three conditions are necessary for
establishing causality:
temporal precedence (X must come
before Y), covariation (if more of X, more of Y), and elimination
of alternative causes (no other variable is responsible for the
relationship between X and Y).
Cerebral dominance theory:
A physiological (nature) theory
that posits that children stutter have ambiguous or uncer-
tain laterality of cortical dominance, resulting in conflict
between the left and right hemispheres for control of the
speech musculature.
Classical conditioning:
A form of learning, sometimes called
"Pavlovian conditioning" after the Russian experimenter
Ivan Pavlov who is generally credited as the originator of
this model of learning. Classical conditioning involves a
learning process that occurs when two stimuli are repeat-
edly paired; a response that is at first elicited by the second
stimulus is eventually elicited by the first stimulus alone.
Demands and capacities model:
A multifactorial model that
suggests that stuttering occurs when the "demands" (social
or otherwise) that are being placed on a child for fluent
speech exceed the child's "capacities" (social-emotional
maturity, language formulation, cognitive skills, and/or
speech motor) for producing fluency.
Diagnosogenic theory:
A psychosocial (nurture) theory that
proposes that stuttering developed because a listener, usu-
ally a parent, erroneously labeled a child's normal disfluen-
cies (i.e., repetitions of sound, syllables, words, and phrases)
as stuttering.
Diathesis:
A constitutional predisposition
or
vulnerability
(sometimes referred to as "weakness") that can take the form
of biological, genetic, psychological, or situational factors.
Dual-diathesis stressor model:
A multifactorial model that
suggests
that
stuttering
develops
from
an
interaction
between speech-language and/or emotional diatheses and
stressors associated with environmental factors.
Feedback: One means for controlling a system, of which there
are two types:
negative and positive feedback. Negative
feedback occurs when the end results of an action decrease
that action from continuing to occur. Positive feedback
occurs when the end results of an action increases that
action to continue to occur.
Feedforward:
Another means for controlling a system. A
mechanism in a system that monitors performance inputs
rather than outputs. This mechanism reacts to maintain a
specified state, thus preventing or minimizing problems be-
fore they occur. Both feedback and feedforward can coexist,
often do, and concurrently function within one system.
Humor:
A bodily fluid. Humors were involved with a very early
theory that a person's health came from balance between the
bodily liquids. Disease and disorders were to happen to when
an imbalance occurred between a person's humors.
Humoralism:
An ancient/early system of medicine sometimes
referred to as the humoral theory or humoralism. This sys-
tem detailed the supposed makeup and workings of the
human body. This theory originated with ancient Greek and
Roman physicians and philosophers but was widely prac-
ticed in western medicine into the 19th century. Humorism
began to fall out of favor in the 1850s with the advent of
germ theory, which put forth the idea that many diseases
previously thought to be humoral were in fact caused by
pathogens.
Interactive perspective:
It refers to the interaction of both
nature (genetic) and nurture (environmental) factors associ-
ated with human development.
Mediating variable:
A variable that explains how or why there
is a relationship between two variables—a cause and an
eﬀect—in a causal chain.
Moderating variable:
A variable that aﬀects the strength and/
or direction of a relationship between two variables.
Multifactorial dynamic pathways theory:
A multifactorial
theory that proposes that motor, linguistic, and emotional
factors variables interact with an unstable speech motor
system to result in stuttering.
Multifactorial theories:
Theories that propose that traits and
conditions are caused by the interaction of more than one
factor.
Nature perspective:
Refers to genetic and biological factors
associated with human development.
Nurture perspective:
Refers to environmental, learned, and
psychosocial factors associated with human development.
Operant conditioning:
A form of learning, sometimes called
instrumental
conditioning.
Operant
conditioning
(also
called instrumental conditioning) is a type of associative
learning process through which the strength of a behavior is
modified by reinforcement or punishment. It is also a proce-
dure that is used to bring about such learning.
Operant
conditioning
theory:
A
psychological
(nurture)
theory that suggested that stuttering is learned or established
through response-contingent reinforcement.
Parallax:
An eﬀect that occurs when the position or direction
of an object appears to diﬀer when viewed from diﬀerent
positions.
Physiological theories:
Theories that emphasize a biological
basis for a condition or disorder.
Psychological theories:
Theories that emphasize a psycholog-
ical or emotional basis or a condition or disorder.
Scientific method:
A method of research in which a problem
is identified, relevant data are gathered, a hypothesis is for-
mulated from these data, and the hypothesis is tested.
Directions
Into
Velocities
of
Articulators
(SimpleDIVA):
A neural network model of speech motor development and
production.
Stressor:
A biological, chemical, environmental condition, or
an external stimulus or event seen as causing stress to an
organism. Psychologically speaking, a stressor can be events
or environments that individuals might consider demand-
ing, challenging, and/or threatening to individual safety.
Two-factor theory of stuttering:
A psychological (nurture)
theory that proposed that instances of stuttering were
developed through classical conditioning and secondary
behaviors through operant conditioning.

Abstract
In this chapter, we review basic concepts of genetics, describe
what is known about how genetics impact risk of stuttering, and
discuss directions for future study. The chapter begins with a
review of the concept of heritability and how the familial nature
of stuttering has been used to learn about the genes that impact
its risk. Next, we introduce key concepts in human molecular
genetics including how deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is inherited,
how genes are transcribed as ribonucleic acid (RNA) and trans-
lated into protein, and how the characteristics of these molecules,
which diﬀer from person to person, can help us understand risk of
stuttering on a cellular level. Then we will learn about the genes
linked to stuttering that have been identified thus far, explore the
limitations of these studies, and consider the kinds of future
research that will be needed to understand three primary, but still
incompletely understood, questions, in stuttering: (1) Why are
some people and families at greater risk of stuttering? (2) What
genes and genetic variants have been identified in studies of
developmental stuttering to date? and (3) How are the genetics of
stuttering related to the genetics of other traits and how can these
relationships help us understand and treat stuttering? Finally, we
will discuss future steps in genomics that are poised to inform the
design and development of eﬀective therapies for stuttering and
empower people who stutter with information about how genetic
factors may underlie their conditions.

3.1 Introduction
The central goal of classical epidemiology is to understand
patterns of disease occurrence in human populations and the
factors, or "exposures," that influence these patterns. In genetic
epidemiology, genetic variation is the factor of interest. Genetic
variation has some important qualities: because the DNA you
are born with typically does not change over the course of your
life, it is an exposure that is intrinsic to the individual; and
although some genetic variation can be causal for disease, many
diseases and disorders are the consequence of a constellation of
genetic and environmental eﬀects. In general, it is fair to say
that research findings to date characterize developmental stut-
tering as an example of one such disorder. Thus, the goal of
genetic epidemiology as applied to developmental stuttering is
to assess the contribution of genetic and environmental factors
to better understand the cause (etiology), distribution, and
treatment of stuttering in families and populations. To apply
genetic epidemiology to stuttering, the central steps are:
1. Establish that there is a genetic component to the stuttering
by assessing its heritability.
2. Establish the relative size of that genetic influence (eﬀect) in
relation to other factors impacting disease risk (i.e.,
environmental eﬀects).
3. Identify the gene(s) responsible for the genetic component of
stuttering risk.
Genetic epidemiology enhances our understanding of the
pathogenesis of disease, while medical genetics is the branch of
medicine that utilizes what is known about the genetic causes
to diagnose and treat hereditary disorders. Together, these
fields can help us understand the molecular and cellular basis
of stuttering risk and utilize the knowledge to improve treat-
ment and outcomes for people who stutter. Today, active areas
of research in genetic epidemiology and medical genetics
include studies of the inheritance of diseases and disorders in
families, mapping genetic risk factors within the genome in
populations and families, analyzing and understanding the mo-
lecular processes that lead to disease, and diagnosing and treat-
ing genetic diseases and disorders. Medical genetics as a field
has only existed for about 60 years, beginning around the time
of the first X-ray photograph of DNA taken by Rosalind Franklin
and Raymond Gosling in 1952. When we compare this to many
other medical or scientific specialties, it is still in its infancy,
and this is reflected in our rapidly growing and evolving
understanding of human genetics generally, and the genetics
of developmental stuttering specifically.
3.1.1 Heritability of Stuttering
Stuttering occurs more often in some families; many individu-
als who stutter have a family member who also stutters. Clues
as to the heritability of developmental stuttering emerged
when Dr. Mildred Berry, a pioneer in the field of speech pathol-
ogy, surveyed a thousand families in 1937 and discovered that
twinning occurred more frequently in families that stuttered;
moreover, stuttering also occurred more frequently in twins
than siblings.1 More recent familial incidence studies report
familial stuttering in 30 to 60% of probands (the first aﬀected
family member being studied) compared to less than 10% in
families of control probands.2,3 For example, in 1993 Ambrose
et al evaluated a sample of 69 preschool children who stuttered,
determining that 45% of probands had relatives who stutter in
their immediate family (parents and siblings) and 71% of pro-
bands had relatives who stutter in their extended family
(grandparents, first cousins, avuncular relationships).4 Although
genetics is one explanation, there can be multiple reasons stut-
tering occurs more often in family members of people who
stutter, including nongenetic factors such as the environment
and random chance, and gene-environment interactions can
play a role as well.
Because stuttering is enriched in families, we can hypothesize
that there might be shared environmental and/or genetic
factors that explain the enrichment. Heritability is a measure of
the variance in a trait that can be explained by genetic factors.
Studies of the diﬀering rates of stuttering among family members
provide one way to measure the proportion of risk that comes
from genetics. For example, if we assume that environmental
eﬀects impact identical (monozygotic) twins and fraternal
(dizygotic) twins similarly, then any diﬀerences in concordance
rates (the percentage of cases in which both twin pairs exhibit a
given disorder or trait) between monozygotic and dizygotic
twins can be assumed to be due to their diﬀerences in genetic
37

sharing: monozygotic twins share 100% of their DNA while
dizygotic twins, on average, share only 50% of their DNA. The
genetic heritability of a trait can be calculated from the diﬀer-
ence between concordance rate of monozygotic twins and the
concordance rate of dizygotic twins. Since Berry's seminal study,
published estimates of the genetic heritability of stuttering have
fluctuated with recent studies reporting heritability estimates as
low as 42%5 and as high as 81 to 84% (▶Table 3.1).6,7,8 Neverthe-
less, many studies of other complex disorders (e.g., type 2
diabetes,9 serum lipid levels,10 Parkinson's disease,11 Alzheimer's
disease12) with similar or smaller genetic heritability estimates
have discovered genetic risk factors essential to understanding
the molecular basis of the disease. However, note that even in
monozygotic twins there is not complete concordance of stutter-
ing, indicating that although there is a strong genetic component
to developmental stuttering, nongenetic factors play an impor-
tant role in an individual's risk as well. Indeed, most phenotypes
(the measurable characteristics of an individual) range from
highly heritable (genetic) to highly plastic (nongenetic), and are
influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and
completely random factors.
The fact that genetic factors are contributing to much of the
interindividual variability in risk for stuttering does not tell us
anything about the specific genetic factors that aﬀect risk of
stuttering, nor does knowing that environmental and random
factors also substantially contribute to stuttering tell us what
those factors might be. Well-powered genetic and epidemiolog-
ical studies are required to identify the specific genetic and
nongenetic risk factors for stuttering. Given that researchers
have established that stuttering is heritable and have estimated
the proportion of variance that is explained by genetics, the
next step is to identify the specific regions of the genome that
contribute to stuttering risk. To map these regions (step 3 of the
central process listed above) researchers utilize the data, con-
cepts, and approaches central to genetic epidemiology that are
reviewed below.
3.2 Introduction to Basic Genetics
Genetics is the field of study investigating how traits are inher-
ited from parents to oﬀspring. In 1865, Gregor Mendel investi-
gated characteristics of green peas, such as their shape and size,
and demonstrated that these characteristics were inherited.
More recent molecular experiments have shown that DNA is
the hereditary material and within the last 20 years the
complete human genome was sequenced. The central dogma of
genetics is as follows: DNA encodes molecular instructions,
which are transcribed into a messenger molecule, ribonucleic
acid (RNA), which is translated into protein, which in turn form
the building blocks of all cellular functions.
3.2.1 DNA
DNA resides in the nucleus and mitochondria of cells and is
present in most cells in your body. The fundamental role of
DNA is to encode all the information necessary to create the

vast array of proteins required for cellular function. DNA is a
polymer of nucleotides, each consisting of a deoxyribose, a
phosphate group, and a base. Nucleotides are often noted by
shorthand using the first letter of the base—adenine (A), thy-
mine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The nitrogenous bases
pair with each other (adenine pairs via two hydrogen bonds
with thymine, and guanine via three hydrogen bonds with
cytosine) forming a double helix of two strands of DNA. The exact
sequence of these bases specifies the proteins that can be built.
3.2.2 Chromosomes
Each long strand of DNA is called a chromosome. Each human
chromosome has a short arm ("p" for "petit") and long arm ("q"
for "queue"), separated by a centromere. The ends of the chro-
mosome are called telomeres. Ploidy is the number of complete
sets of chromosomes in a cell. Humans are diploid, meaning
your genetic code is in pairs of chromosomes with one set of 23
chromosomes inherited from each parent. Mutations that occur
in somatic cells can aﬀect the individual but are not passed to
oﬀspring. On the other hand, reproductive cells called gametes,
namely, sperm and egg cells in humans, are haploid, meaning
they contain only one set of chromosomes, and mutations
present in these cells may be passed to oﬀspring. Chromosomes
are visible through a microscope when condensed before cell
division ("chromosome" comes from the Greek words for
"colored bodies"); the number and visual appearance of the
chromosomes are called a karyotype (see ▶Fig. 3.1).
The study of the number and morphology of chromosomes,
called cytogenetics, is common in clinical diagnostic labs and is
useful for identifying large abnormalities. The detection of
many chromosomal abnormalities is made possible by staining
chromosomes with a dye, which creates the appearance of
horizontal black and white stripes called cytogenetic bands.
Each chromosome has its own unique pattern which can be
analyzed for abnormalities and used as a map for the location
of genes on chromosomes. ▶Fig. 3.1 depicts stained chromo-
somes, with visible cytogenetic bands.
3.2.3 Genes
Genes are functional units of the genome that are often tran-
scribed into RNA, which is then usually translated into protein.
Genome refers to the complete set of genetic material present
in an organism. In 2003, The Human Genome Project completed
a 13-year-long international collaboration between thousands
of investigators to assess the content of a complete human
genome comprising approximately 3 billion base pairs and
made these data immediately available to the public. The scien-
tists set out with the anticipation to find between 50,000 and
140,000 genes but were surprised to identify only between
20,000 and 25,000. The task of identifying these genes remains
challenging, and it is likely that more will be found. Technological
advancements that have made assessing the content of genomes
eﬃcient and inexpensive have resulted in a tidal wave of data
and propelled the field of genetics into new territory.
3.2.4 RNA
An essential activity for RNA is protein synthesis, a universal
function in which RNA molecules direct the synthesis of pro-
teins. Inside the nucleus, DNA is transcribed into mRNA, a type
of nucleic acid that is chemically similar to DNA, which is then
shuttled out of the nucleus and is subsequently translated into
protein on ribosomes. In translation, mRNA forms a template
for the synthesis of proteins. Amino acids cannot bind directly
to the mRNA, rather the interaction is mediated by molecules
called transfer RNA (tRNA), a cloverleaf shaped molecule of
RNA that contains an amino acid on the "stem" and a three-
base region opposite the stem called an anticodon. A ribosome
slides along the mRNA strand using tRNA to assemble a grow-
ing string of amino acids into a polypeptide chain that may

ganism or species. (Courtesy: National Human
Genome Research Institute, public domain, via

eventually become a functional protein in the cell. As a result
of this process, every three bases in an exon (the nucleotide
sequences that bond to create mature mRNA) translates to a sin-
gle amino acid in a protein. Thus, a single swap of one nucleotide
for another (one kind of mutation) in a gene can result in a
change of an amino acid in the resulting protein, potentially
altering its function and subsequently impacting risk of a disease,
modifying a trait, or changing behavior.
As we have already discussed, approximately 99% of DNA is
never transcribed into RNA. Similarly, although the function of
many RNA molecules is providing a template for building
proteins, most RNAs are never translated into protein: approxi-
mately 97% of the transcriptional output is nonprotein-coding
in humans! Although it has been known for some time that
proteins can regulate gene expression, it turns out that some
noncoding RNA (ncRNA), such as microRNAs, long ncRNAs, and
enhancer RNAs, can also play a range of functional roles in
translation and gene regulation.
3.3 Genetic Variation
Through collective study of a range of human genomes, a
consensus reference genome was established. As additional
large samples of people have been studied, public databases of
observed diﬀerences from the reference genome, as well as
how often these diﬀerences are observed in populations (their
frequency), have become available. Today millions of alterations
from the reference genome have been recorded including
chromosome abnormalities, single nucleotide changes (or SNPs,
for "single nucleotide polymorphisms"), insertions, deletions,
inversions, and copy number changes, in which a segment of the
genome is repeated a diﬀerent number of times relative to the
reference (also called CNV for "copy number variant"). A given
variant can be extremely common in populations or so rare that it
has only ever been observed in a single person. Because of natural
selection, although any genetic variant can have an impact on dis-
ease or eﬀect a condition, often common variants have more
modest eﬀects, while very rare variants can be highly deleterious.
Because most of the genome is nonprotein coding, much of
the variation in the genome is of uncertain consequence. This
facilitates rare events in which gene segments are shuﬄed,
or genes or chromosomal segments are duplicated, creating
redundancy and the opportunity for mutations to diﬀerentiate
their functions in new ways, such as becoming new members of
a gene family or whole new kinds of genes. Genetic variation can
have no eﬀect at all (silent variation), change the content of
protein (coding variation), or change the amount of RNA or
protein that is expressed (regulatory variation). On average,
your personal genome diﬀers by only about 1% from any other
human on earth, and studies of human populations have dem-
onstrated that the amount of genetic variation within popula-
tions is markedly greater than variation between populations.
Because people from diﬀerent populations can be more genet-
ically similar to each other than to other members of their
own populations, caution is necessary when using labels for
groups of people in biomedical settings, including in personal-
ized medicine and pharmacogenetics. In this context, it is impor-
tant to stress that race is a social construct, not a biological one,
and human variation is continuous across geographic clines
within and across continents.
In this section, we focus on two kinds of genetic variation:
chromosomal abnormalities and SNPs. We briefly review how
they are measured and how we can establish the eﬀect they
can have on human health generally and stuttering specifically.
3.3.1 Chromosomal Abnormalities
Atypical karyotypes are often referred to as chromosomal
abnormalities and are the cause of a wide array of conditions.
They can take several forms including complete duplications or
deletions of whole or partial chromosomes, or translocation of
a portion (or entirety!) of one chromosome to another chromo-
some. Like all genetic variation, chromosomal abnormalities can
occur in all or just a portion of cells in the aﬀected individual.
Although many abnormalities are possible, most large abnormal-
ities are inconsistent with life.
For example, Prader-Willi is a syndrome typically caused by
deletion of a part of chromosome 15 passed down by the father.
Trisomy, having three copies of a chromosome, is only observed
on 13 (Patau syndrome), 18 (Edwards syndrome), and 21
(Down syndrome), and sex chromosomes (X and Y). Notably,
speech disfluencies are more often observed in people with
several chromosomal abnormalities including Down syndrome,
fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Turner syndro-
me than in the general population.13 Although the exact genetic
mechanism of increased risk is not yet known, the estimated
prevalence of stuttering in individuals with Down syndrome
has been reported to range from 15 to 45%, much higher than
the general population prevalence.14 These findings suggest
that there may be genes that reside on these chromosomes that
impact risk of stuttering and other speech disfluencies.
3.3.2 Another Variation in the Human
Genome: Single Nucleotide
Polymorphism (SNP)
Although variation in the human genome can take several
forms, SNPs (pronounced "snip") are the most common. A SNP
is a DNA sequence variation that occurs when a single nucleo-
tide (adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine) in the genome
sequence is altered.
On average, SNPs occur once in every 1,000 base pairs
throughout a person's DNA, resulting in roughly 4 to 5 million
SNPs in any given person's genome.15 Today, more than 781
million SNPs and 62 million short insertion/deletion variants
have been found across humans from multiple populations.16
Most SNPs reside in portions of the genome that have unde-
fined functionality and have no measurable eﬀect. Even SNPs
located within genes may have no impact on the amount or
type of protein made. For example, many intronic SNPs have no
eﬀect on gene expression or resulting protein. Synonymous
SNPs do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence in
the resulting protein. These are often referred to as "silent" in
that they cause no diﬀerence in the polypeptide sequence of
the resulting protein. On the other hand, nonsynonymous SNPs
do lead to alterations in the resulting protein by swapping one
amino acid for another. Additionally, so-called "nonsense" SNPs
can cause the transcription machinery to stop early, leading to
a truncated protein. SNPs at the junction of introns and exons
Genetic Processes
40

can impact the splicing process in which introns (a portion of a
gene that does not code for amino acids) are cut out of mRNA
ahead of transcription, leading to changes in the protein that
can be made from a single gene. Finally, SNPs that reside in
transcription factor binding sites or enhancer regions can lead
to changes in the amount of protein made. SNPs such as these,
which are associated with the expression of genes, are called
expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs.
3.4 Strategies for Measuring
Genetic Variation
To identify genetic changes that are too small to visibly alter
chromosomal banding patterns, geneticists have developed
technologies which measure the exact pattern of nucleotides in
the genome such as microarray-based genotyping and genome
or exome sequencing. The specific genetic variants that are ob-
served in a given site in the genome, such as a gene or base pair
position, are called alleles. If you have the same allele at a given
location in the human genome (or locus) on both chromo-
somes, you are said to be a homozygote, and if your alleles are
diﬀerent from one another, you are a heterozygote. The exact
combination of alleles in a given locus is called a genotype.
There are two main techniques for analyzing DNA. One uses
genotyping microarrays, which are a collection of microscopic
spots of single-stranded DNA of known sequence (called
probes) tacked down to a solid surface called an array. By
detecting the probes that have become bound to sample DNA,
the genetic content of the sample can be determined. Next
generation sequence technology, on the other hand, determines
the exact order of nucleotides in entire genomes or targeted
regions, such as the exomes (all exons within the genome) of
DNA or RNA. Although sequencing remains comparatively
expensive ($200-$300 for high-quality whole-exome sequencing
and $500-$800 for high-quality whole-genome sequencing) it
can capture extremely rare alleles and even new mutations.
3.4.1 Epigenetic Factors in the
Expression of DNA
Although genes play a critical role in our health and develop-
ment, so do our experiences and the environment in which we
live. Epigenetics is the study of how behavioral and environ-
mental factors alter the expression of DNA without changing
the DNA sequence itself. Three epigenetic mechanisms have
been identified: DNA methylation which can essentially turn
oﬀgene expression, histone modification which can change the
accessibility of portions of the genome to the transcriptional
machinery, and ncRNA-associated gene silencing in which small
pieces of RNA bind to DNA and block it from being expressed.
Although changes to the sequence of DNA (e.g., mutation) occur
rarely, social and environmental conditions can lead to big
changes in epigenetic factors, with profound eﬀects on traits
and disease. In this way, nongenetic factors such as diet, exer-
cise, social interactions, infectious disease exposures, drugs,
economic status, stress, exposure to pollution or toxins, among
many others can interact with a person's specific genotype to
influence the risk for a trait like stuttering.
3.5 Transmission Models of
Inheritance
As defined earlier, a phenotype is an observable characteristic
resulting from the interaction of an individual genotype with
the environment (see Definitions). When a particular pheno-
type is observed at a higher rate within a family than in the
general population, it suggests a genetic or environmental fac-
tor is putting that family at greater risk. Therefore, one way to
find genetic factors linked to a disorder such as stuttering is to
study the inheritance patterns of the disorder in families
(▶Fig. 3.2). Tracking the inheritance of a disorder alongside the
inheritance of DNA allows geneticists to identify regions of the
genome which may contribute to risk.
Fig. 3.2 Transmission models of inheritance. Example of a family enriched with developmental stuttering showing an autosomal dominant inheritance
pattern with incomplete penetrance.
3.5 Transmission Models of Inheritance
41

Many genetic diseases are caused by a mutation in a single
gene. As of this writing, the Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man resource (http://omim.org) lists nearly 7,000 phenotypes
with a known molecular genetic basis including more than
4,500 genes with a known phenotype-causing mutation. The
pattern of inheritance of single-gene disorders in families
depends on whether the mutation is autosomal (carried on chro-
mosomes 1-22) or X-linked (carried on the X chromosomes) and
the model of inheritance.
3.5.1 Autosomal Dominant Inheritance
In an autosomal dominant inheritance model, a single copy of
the disease-causing allele, inherited from either the mother or
the father, is suﬃcient to result in an aﬀected oﬀspring. Autoso-
mal dominant inheritance is characterized by vertical transmis-
sion of the resulting phenotype through a family with a 50%
chance that an aﬀected parent will have an aﬀected oﬀspring.
3.5.2 Autosomal Recessive Inheritance
In a recessive model of inheritance, both copies of the disease-
causing allele are required for the phenotype to be expressed.
A recessive disease allele will not typically result in a disease
phenotype in a heterozygous carrier. An exception to this rule
occurs when a person carries two diﬀerent disease-causing
mutations impacting the function of the same gene or molecular
pathway. When two diﬀerent mutations lead to recessive disease
in this way, the carrier is said to be a compound heterozygote.
Recessive inheritance is characterized by clustering of disease
among siblings, without a requirement that the disease is
observed in the parents or other family members. Recessive
diseases are observed with greater frequency in the presence
of consanguinity (inbreeding).
In addition, some homozygous carriers of recessive disease
alleles and some heterozygous carriers of dominant disease
alleles may not express the associated disease. The rate of aﬀec-
tion in people with a disease-causing genotype is called pene-
trance. Penetrance may be altered by other modifying genetic
or environmental factors. Additionally, not all genetic disorders
are expressed from birth; age-dependent penetrance refers to
the changing rate of expression of a phenotype in people carry-
ing the disease-causing genotype by age, such as Alzheimer's
disease. In stuttering, because many people recover at an early
age, stuttering may exhibit reduced penetrance in families due
to true lack of stuttering in mutation carriers or due to transient
stuttering that was not clinically noted.
3.5.3 Approaches to Mapping Disease
Genes: Linkage Analysis
Two common approaches to mapping disease genes are linkage
analysis and association study. In linkage analyses, given a spe-
cific genetic model, the co-transmission of disease and genomic
segments through a pedigree is measured to find regions of the
genome that are "linked" to disease.
Because each transmission event (meiosis) in a family con-
tributes to the statistical evidence for or against linkage, linkage
is exceptionally well-powered to find causal genes in large
families or by summing together the evidence from multiple
smaller families in which causal variants fall in the same locus.
Genome-wide significance can be achieved in a single family
with as few as 12 people. Because very rare or even private
genetic variants are frequent within a given family, linkage is
exceptionally well-powered to detect even the rarest genetic
risk factors, and because evidence of linkage of diﬀerent muta-
tions in the same gene region can be combined across families,
linkage is well-powered even when diﬀerent families carry dif-
ferent causal mutations in the same gene (allelic heterogeneity).
Several factors can severely limit the success of linkage stud-
ies. First, families enriched for disease are often diﬃcult and
expensive to ascertain. Second, if the transmission model is
miss-specified, the analysis can be confounded leading to a
failure to detect the causal variant. Linkage can be performed
without specifying a model of inheritance (so-called nonpara-
metric linkage); however, these studies are considerably less
well-powered than parametric linkage in which the transmis-
sion model (e.g., dominant or recessive) is accurately specified.
Third, reduced disease penetrance and age-dependent pene-
trance both dramatically reduce power in linkage analyses. Fourth,
linkage is highly sensitive to phenotypic miss-specification—a
single case labeled as a control or vice versa can severely impact
evidence of linkage at the causal variant. And finally, linkage has
very little power to detect disorders that are caused by multiple
diﬀerent genes within or across families (genetic heterogeneity).
▶Fig. 3.3 depicts results of a linkage analysis for stuttering.
3.5.4 Association Studies
In an association study, genetic variants are tested for a statistical
relationship with a disease or trait in a sample from a general
population. If an allele occurs more frequently in people aﬀected
with a disease than it does in the general population, the variant
is said to be associated with the disease. When variants from
across the entire genome are tested, the analysis is called a
genome-wide association study (GWAS). Unlike linkage studies,
GWAS is much less sensitive to model miss-specification (most
assume an additive model where each additional copy of a variant
confers equal additional risk), tolerates some degree of case/
control mislabeling without large losses in power, and is not
impacted by genetic heterogeneity—GWAS can detect risk asso-
ciations from multiple genes and variants in the genome. GWAS
is typically performed on very dense genetic data (millions of
SNPs), with the hope that the causal variant itself, or a variant in
close physical proximity to the causal variant will be tested.
However, although GWAS can identify genes and variants that
contribute only modestly to risk of disease or trait, GWAS
requires much larger samples to reach genome-wide significant
levels of association. Today, it is not uncommon for GWAS to
comprise samples of over a million people. GWAS is also mark-
edly susceptible to bias due to patterns of ancestry or relatedness
within the sample.
3.6 Genetic Studies of Stuttering
To date, published literature investigating genetic contributions to
developmental stuttering has primarily drawn on family-based
analyses and studies of population isolates, yet for developmental
stuttering, identifying the causal gene(s) within and across fami-
lies has proven challenging. Below, we review the findings of
genetic analyses of stuttering in families that have been published
to date, which are also listed in ▶Table 3.2.

3.6 Genetic Studies of Stuttering
43

3.6.1 Stuttering Risk: GNPTAB and
Lysosomal Transport Genes
In 2005, Riaz et al17 performed linkage analyses in 46 consan-
guineous (i.e., common ancestry) Pakistani families where
stuttering occurred in at least two generations and diagnosis
was confirmed independently by two diﬀerent clinicians. They
discovered a region with developmental stuttering in a single
family but failed to pinpoint a causal gene. After 5 years in
2010, Kang et al18 reported the results from a follow-up study
of 77 unrelated Pakistani individuals who stutter plus unrelated
cases from the same 46 Pakistani families included in the study
by Riaz et al in 2005.17 Their investigation identified three
genes that likely contribute to the risk of developmental stutter-
ing: GNPTAB, GNPTG, and NAGPA. GNPTAB produces the enzyme
that works to prepare lysosomes for transportation. In 2018,
Kazemi and colleagues performed sequencing and gene map-
ping in 25 Iranian families with high prevalence of developmen-
tal stuttering and identified an additional three gene variants in
GNPTAB and GNPTG that co-segregated (i.e., transmitted on the
same chromosome) with stuttering.19
3.6.2 DRD2: A Potential Role for
Dopamine in Stuttering Risk
Research has identified three additional candidate risk genes
for stuttering: DRD2,20 AP4E1,21 and CYP17A1.22 Familial studies
of stuttering in patients with Tourette's syndrome had previ-
ously implicated DRD223 and more than 10 years later Lan et al
published an association study focusing specifically on dopami-
nergic gene haplotypes and allele frequencies in stuttering
cases and controls from a population of Han Chinese in which
both risk and protective alleles were identified in DRD2.20 These
results were not replicated in 2011 study by Kang et al24 in a
case-control cohort from Brazil and western Europe.
DRD2 encodes a dopamine receptor. Dopamine is a type of
chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) that the nervous sys-
tem uses to send messages between nerve cells and plays a role
in how people feel and experience pleasure. As a key player in
cellular response of dopamine, it is hypothesized that DRD2
plays a role in reinforcing and rewarding behaviors by altering
how we feel after stimulation. As with most biological systems,
there are genetic variants that can make typical function go awry,
and the same is true here. For example, variants in DRD2 have
been associated with addictive behaviors,25,26,27,28,29,30 but have
also been implicated in neurologic disorders such as Tourette's
syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder,31 and schizophrenia.32
In addition, DRD2 variants have been implicated in Parkinson's
disease33 and movement disorders. Although the evidence of a
role for DRD2 as a risk factor for stuttering is far from conclusive,
the idea that neurotransmitters may be involved is alluring
because it opens the doors for development of targeted phar-
macologic approaches in treatment.
3.6.3 AP4E1: Intercellular Traﬃcking
and Stuttering Risk
In 2015, Raza et al21 identified two heterozygous AP4E1 variants
linked with persistent developmental stuttering in a large
Cameroonian family (using the same family as published in
their earlier work from 201334); they also observed these same
two variants in unrelated Cameroonians with persistent stutter-
ing. Although Raza et al21 also reported 23 additional rare
variants (including loss-of-function variants) within AP4E1
among unrelated stuttering individuals from Cameroon, Paki-
stan, and North America, their findings have yet to be replicated
by another group. AP4E1 is a member of a protein complex that
plays a key role in intercellular traﬃcking by sorting and organ-
izing membrane proteins. Recessive mutations in AP4E1 cause a
type of slow progressing neurodegenerative disorder called
spastic paraplegia.35 People with spastic paraplegia usually have
developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability,
impaired or absent speech, small head size (microcephaly),
seizures, and progressive motor symptoms.
3.6.4 Hormone Regulation May Explain
Biological Sex Diﬀerences in Stuttering
Risk
In 2017, Mohammadi et al22 performed a case-control study of
the Kurdish population aged 3 to 9 years from western Iran,
specifically focusing on the sexually dimorphic nature of stut-
tering and identified an allelic polymorphism associated with
stuttering susceptibility in CYP17A1, a gene integral for the

synthesis of steroid hormones. CYP17A1 encodes a key enzyme
in the pathway that produces the hormones progestin, mineralo-
corticoid, glucocorticoid, androgen, and estrogen. As reported by
Domingues et al in 2019, these results were not replicated in an
independent case and population-matched control association
study from the United States, Brazil, Pakistan, and Cameroon.36,37
3.6.5 Introducing Genetic Mutations
into Animal Models of Stuttering
After Kang et al pinpointed three genes critical for the lysosomal
targeting pathway (GNPTAB, GNPTG, and NAGPA) in Pakistani
individuals who stutter, the mechanism of why specific muta-
tions in these genes might cause stuttering remained obscure.18
To investigate plausible mechanisms, the authors worked to
build a mouse model of stuttering. In 2005, Shu et al successfully
demonstrated that introducing human FOXP2 mutations into the
orthologous Foxp2 gene in mice altered ultrasonic vocalizations
in mice, mimicking vocalizations observed in humans with the
FOXP2 mutation, which set the precedent for using mice as a
model of human speech and language traits.38 In 2016, Barnes
et al developed a mouse model of stuttering for mice carrying a
human stuttering mutation in GNTAB in the orthologous mouse
GNPTAB gene and found diﬀerences in the timing of vocaliza-
tions, namely, increased pauses between bouts of syllables and
abnormally long pauses in homozygous mutant mice when com-
pared to control mice.39 Several years later in 2019, they intro-
duced another human mutation in GNPTAB into mice and once
again demonstrated that the mutant mice displayed vocalization
abnormalities compared to control mice.40 Moreover, they com-
pared brain images from the mutant and control mouse groups
and saw a decrease in the number of astrocytes in the corpus
callosum of mutant mice, suggesting a role for neurological cell
deficit in the genesis of persistent developmental stuttering.
Although intriguing biological processes have been highlighted
by these analyses, there is a remarkable lack of consensus across
studies, and the molecular underpinnings of developmental stut-
tering in general populations remain obscure. Taken together,
these studies suggest that there is no single gene or molecular
pathway that explains the risk of developmental stuttering in
families or populations. Rather, it appears that diﬀerent families
have diﬀerent genetic risk factors and not everyone in a family
who carries the risk genotype stutters. We can conclude that
stuttering is likely a complex trait, meaning that risk of stuttering
in general does not follow simple Mendelian inheritance pat-
terns. Instead, it is likely that the prevalence of stuttering in gen-
eral populations is polygenic, meaning that risk eﬀects combine
across many genes and may be modified by the environment.
As we have learned, complex, polygenic traits are challenging to
study with family-based designs. Instead, approaches that are
well-powered in the presence of genetic heterogeneity and can
identify variants with modest eﬀect sizes such as GWAS are
needed to identify the genetic variants at play. But, as discussed
earlier, GWAS often requires thousands or even millions of study
participants to identify genetic risk factors, posing a significant
challenge for investigators. Building such a cohort for the study of
stuttering from scratch would likely take many years and cost
many millions of dollars. In the following section, we describe
some sources of genetic data for thousands or millions of people
for the purpose of understanding risks of stuttering.
3.7 Sources of Large-Scale Genetic
Data from People Who Stutter
3.7.1 The International Stuttering Project
The International Stuttering Project (ISP) formed a global
collaboration to study stuttering at a population level. Investiga-
tors collected DNA specimens from a diverse global population
of individuals who stutter and then performed a case-control
GWAS.41 Published in 2021, this inaugural population-level
study of almost 1,500 stuttering cases and about 6,800 controls
identified one significant variant. This genetic variant occurred
in SSUH2, a gene previously reported to play a role in tooth for-
mation (association results from the study are summarized in
▶Fig. 3.4).36 Although it remains unclear how this genetic
association might impact stuttering risk this study found an
enrichment of top genes, including SSUH2, involved in biologi-
cal processes including extracellular matrix and structure
organization, cell adhesion, anatomical structure development,
nervous system development, ossification, neurogenesis, cell
migration, and bone morphogenesis. Studies to replicate this
finding and understand its function are ongoing.
3.7.2 Biobanks
Under traditional genetic study designs, investigators usually
acquire case data by directly recruiting subjects with a pheno-
type of interest. This process can often be time intensive, cost
ineﬃcient, and result in small sample sizes that are insuﬃ-
ciently powered for genetic discovery in complex traits.
Biobanks are large repositories of biological specimens, often
suitable for genotyping, that can facilitate genetic analysis.
Some biobanks have been linked to participant's electronic
medical records making them especially powerful for biomedical
research. These resources provide unmatched sample sizes (with
some biobanks exceeding 500,000 participants) and a quick and
comparatively cost-eﬃcient method for identifying relationships
between patient genetics and any phenotypes of interest.
Additionally, these large-scale health record sets can provide an
agonistic approach to studying relationships between conditions
(e.g., in analyses to identify) and genotype-phenotype relation-
ships across the entire set of medical traits (phenome).
3.7.3 Phenome Wide Association
Studies (PheWAS)
In direct recruitment studies, investigators typically define and
measure all comorbidities they will study. This hypothesis-
driven approach limits the relationships that can be estab-
lished. Research into comorbidities of stuttering prior to 2020
performed analysis on only a handful of hypothesis-driven
phenotypes, typically motivated by prior literature, such as
neurological conditions (autism, motor coordination, etc.).
Because electronic health records include notation of all medical
billing through a health system, comorbidity analyses in these
data allow for the discovery of potentially novel disease associa-
tions that were previously unstudied.
In direct recruitment studies, enrolled participants must meet
the phenotypic definitions of the study. When utilizing electronic
3.7 Sources of Large-Scale Genetic Data from People Who Stutter
45

health records to define cases and controls, investigators derive
case and control information from the hospital billing codes, clin-
ical notes, and laboratory results. For many pathologies that are
likely to be noted in a medical setting, this is a straightforward
process; however, identifying a robust case cohort for stuttering
in health record data is diﬃcult for a number of reasons: (1) iden-
tification and treatment of stuttering typically occurs in speech
pathology clinics and schools rather than in a medical setting,
and consequently, records of stuttering evaluation and treatment
are not often included in medical databases; (2) because severity
of stuttering can vary greatly from subject to subject, stuttering
may be unnoticed or considered irrelevant by medical practi-
tioners; (3) most people who stutter (approximately 80%) fully
recover by adolescence, meaning any visit to the doctor after this
period will not result in a clinical diagnosis. This challenge dispro-
portionately impacts identification in health records of females
who stutter because of their elevated rate of recovery and often
reduced severity in stuttering relative to males. For example,
although stuttering is a relatively common condition, aﬀecting
roughly 5 to 10% of the population at some point during their life-
time, within Vanderbilt University Medical Center's heath record,
only 0.01% of subjects have a diagnostic code for stuttering. As a
result, in 2020, investigators turned toward comorbidities of stut-
tering that are better captured within these databases to under-
stand the biology of stuttering.
3.7.4 Additional Considerations:
Analyzing Comorbidities Associated
with Stuttering
A comorbidity is an additional health condition that occurs
concurrently with another diagnosis. Comorbid conditions exist
simultaneously but independently of the primary diagnosis, in
contrast to a syndrome where several symptoms occur together
that characterize a specific disease. Greater understanding of
stuttering comorbidities may not only improve clinical care, but
also our understanding of causes of stuttering.
Historically, investigations of stuttering comorbidities have
focused on the presence of co-occurring speech and language
impairments, or behavioral or psychological conditions like
ADHD, anxiety, and social anxiety.42,43 However, it can be diﬃcult
to disentangle the cause-and-eﬀect relationship between stutter-
ing and other comorbid conditions. For example, social anxiety
may be caused by feared speaking situations due to stuttering or
may exist fully independent of stuttering. Mapping comorbidities
through common genetic factors is one way to reveal shared path-
ways between stuttering and other conditions.
Understanding comorbidities can be particularly important if
concurrent disorders predict clinical outcomes or influence risk
for a condition. Although medical conditions outside the realm
of speech-language pathology are not routinely discussed with
a speech pathologist, electronic health records oﬀer a depth
and breadth of medical information experienced throughout a
lifetime. Using these records, we can attempt to replicate previ-
ously identified comorbidities and explore latent, unstudied
comorbidities.
A recent study utilizing electronic health records identified po-
tential novel comorbid conditions for developmental stuttering.44
In the study by Pruett et al, medical records of people who
stutter were significantly enriched with 38 distinct clinical phe-
notype groups.44 These included broad phenotype groups that
encompass traits noted in prior literature as associated with
stuttering such as developmental delays and disorders,42,45,46
tics and stuttering,7 hearing loss,47 sleep disorders,48 and a
variety of codes related to the skin and lung inflammation.49,50
Fig. 3.4 Manhattan plot summarizing stuttering
genome-wide association study (GWAS) results.
In this GWAS, genetic variants were tested for a
statistical relationship with stuttering status (case
or control). Variants represent a specific nucleobase
at a location in the human genome (e.g., adenine
or "A," guanine or "G"). Each assessed variant is
plotted as a dot by chromosome/position (x-axis)
against log transformed p-values (y-axis) from the
association analysis. Blue and red lines denote
suggestive (⍺= 5.0e-6) and genome-wide
(⍺= 5.0e-8) significance respectively. Genome-
wide significance threshold was set according to
field standards, which assumes that ⍺= 0.05 and is
then corrected for each independent test
(⍺= 0.05/1,000,000 or 5.0e-8). The field assumes
there are approximately one million independent
variants genome-wide. The suggestive threshold
(⍺= 5.0e-6) assumes an expectation of one false
positive association per GWAS (i.e., one/total
number of independent variants). This plot
revealed that a variant on chromosome 3 within
the gene SSUH2 reached genome-wide significance
in this analysis of clinically validated stuttering cases
collected through the International Stuttering
Project and self-reported stuttering cases collected
from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
to Adult Health (Add Health).
Genetic Processes
46

Other statistically significant comorbidities included previously
unreported comorbidities such as infections, neurological defi-
cits, aphasia/speech disturbance, obesity, metabolism, and meas-
ures of development. Some of these comorbidities are no doubt
surprising to see. Importantly, this approach detects associations,
so we cannot make assumptions about causality from these data,
but it serves to generate new hypotheses about how complex
traits manifest clinically and lays the groundwork for future
studies designed to validate these associations and determine
causality.
In addition to providing biological insight to the pathophysi-
ology of stuttering, these comorbidities can be utilized to amass
the sample sizes required to provide meaningful results from a
GWAS within large-scale genetic biobanks. In 2021, Shaw et al
built a stuttering prediction machine-learning model based on
the Pruett et al stuttering-associated clinical diagnoses that uses
diagnostic history of patients to identify clusters of symptoms
that predict stuttering.51 With this prediction algorithm, they
were able to infer cases and controls for an analysis of stuttering
in approximately 100,000 participants in Vanderbilt University's
biobank, BioVU. The algorithm predicted that approximately 10%
of participants stutter, resulting in a sample size of >9,000 geno-
typed stuttering samples to be analyzed through GWAS. In addi-
tion, using a comorbidity-based GWAS, Shaw et al identified two
genetic variants that were associated with the predicted stutter-
ing phenotype.51 These variants mapped to two genes: FAM49A
on chromosome 2 for subjects of European ancestry and ZMAT4
on chromosome 8 for stuttering in subjects of African ancestry.
Neither ZMAT4 or FAM49A had been previously implicated in
developmental stuttering.
ZMAT4 is a zinc finger protein highly expressed in the brain.
Zinc finger proteins work to maintain the health of neurons.
The specific functions of this protein family are extraordinarily
diverse. They act to facilitate transcription, lipid binding, and
regulation of cell death. ZMAT4 has been previously implicated
in African Americans for nearsightedness and higher fasting
blood glucose levels. FAM49A is a signaling protein and is also
abundantly expressed in the brain regions. Previous studies of
FAM49A in Asian and Brazilian populations have found associa-
tions with cleft palate.
3.7.5 Summary of Findings from
Genetic Studies in Stuttering
Because they represent population-level genetic eﬀects derived
from well-powered case-control studies from genome-wide
analyses, the identification of SSUH2, ZMAT4, and FAM49A are
key discoveries in developmental stuttering genetics. These
studies did not strongly replicate the eﬀects seen in prior genes,
but this is expected since the variants in those genes linked to
stuttering were extremely rare mutations unlikely to be present
in general populations with suﬃcient frequency to be detected
by association analysis. However, independent replication of ef-
fects of very rare mutations in GNPTG in an unrelated cohort as
well as animal models have provided additional support, and
the field is beginning to make headway. Like the initial findings
from linkage studies, these newly identified genes from GWAS
require further study in independent datasets. The nature and
function of these genes are complex and diﬀuse, acting on a
wide variety of systems within the body. Investigating network
pathology, comorbidities, and the function of solute carriers,
zinc finger proteins, signaling proteins, and the lysosomal tar-
geting pathway will hopefully yield some answers to the biol-
ogy that underlies stuttering.
3.8 Applying Research Findings to
Models and Characteristics of
Stuttering
Identifying the genes and variants that may contribute to risk of
stuttering in families and in populations is a landmark advance
for the field to be sure, but how much have we really learned
about the cause of stuttering? How can we apply this new
knowledge to predict who might stutter or improve speech and
quality of life for people who stutter? Below, we review several
exciting approaches to interpret and apply the findings of
genetic studies of stuttering.
3.8.1 Modeling Polygenic Risk of
Stuttering
For most of the population, we have learned that genetic risk of
stuttering is driven by a large set of small eﬀect variants rather
than a small number of mutations with large eﬀect. Recently,
geneticists have used data generated from GWAS to measure
complex genetic risk through an approach that summarizes all
the eﬀects from across the genome in a person into a single,
individual risk score. To do this, geneticists develop polygenic
risk score (PRS) models, which are calculations of an individual's
disease liability or risk based on the individual's genetic code.
As previously discussed, most phenotypes, including stutter-
ing, cannot be fully explained by a single mutation within our
genetic code. Instead, genetic heritability of these phenotypes is
explained by multiple genetic variants. It is important to note
that not all variants equally impact stuttering. Although there
do exist regions of our genetic code where one mutation can re-
sult in drastic changes in a person's phenotype, most variants
have a low impact on someone's phenotypic status. Although
these eﬀects can be small, if many of these low impact variants
are present within a patient's genetic code, the combined
impact could be substantial, resulting in an altered phenotype.
Simply put, this equation can quantify the overall impact of all
the variants in the genome to assess a person's genetic risk of a
disease or condition.
Although the development of PRS models is an important
step toward understanding the role that genetics play in the
development of stuttering, it is critical to understand that these
models are never used to diagnose stuttering, or for that matter
used in any clinical context in their current state. They simply
provide an additional means to study the collective eﬀects
of the genome on an individual's risk of stuttering, and there-
fore can be very informative in a research context. Like the
comorbidity-based
imputation
approach
discussed
above,
developing stuttering PRS models within one dataset allows us
to infer the phenotypic status based on individual genetic risk
in other datasets. For example, Shaw et al used this approach to
show that a PRS developed in the GWAS results from Vanderbilt
University's biobank could significantly predict case/control
3.8 Applying Research Findings to Models and Characteristics of Stuttering
47

status in the International Stuttering Project dataset (▶Fig. 3.5).
Even in the absence of a stuttering diagnosis, PRS allows inves-
tigators to utilize biobanks where stuttering is underreported
to estimate genetic risk of stuttering and then study the diag-
nostic history of subjects with higher risk and compare to those
with lower genetic risk.
Importantly, most PRS models are built around GWAS results
and capture common, low-eﬀect genetic predictors, and there-
fore generally do not model rare or family-specific mutations
which can drive the stuttering phenotype within pedigrees.
With PRS models in stuttering, we can also identify scenarios
where people who do stutter have a low PRS. These interesting
cases may be explained by (1) the model not adequately captur-
ing all the common genetic eﬀects associated with stuttering,
(2) these subjects may carry a rare, higher impact variant, or (3)
other environmental eﬀects are contributing to their stuttering
phenotype. Using PRS models to identify cases of stuttering
with low genetic risk can therefore help researchers identify
people for further follow-up by exome sequencing or deeper
assessments of other potential nongenetic risk factors.
3.8.2 Correlations between Stuttering
Risk and Related Traits
In a yet unpublished data, researchers have found that PRS
models developed from GWAS of other traits can predict stut-
tering. For example, a soon-to-be published study by Niarchou
et al identified SNPs associated with a person's ability to keep
rhythm and showed a genetic correlation of rhythm with
breathing function, motor function, processing speed, and
chronotype.52 Analysis of a PRS model developed to predict
rhythm ability applied in the International Stuttering Project
data shows that those who stutter are genetically predicted to
have significantly worse rhythm than those who do not, illus-
trating a shared genetic architecture across these two traits and
an as-yet uncharacterized underlying biological mechanism
connecting them. Indeed, these findings are supported by and
provide a molecular basis for prior work that reported a rhythm
perception deficit in children who stutter.53 Identifying the
specific genetic loci driving this correlation will be key to under-
standing the common genetic etiology of rhythm and stuttering.
Still, demonstrating that PRS models can predict genetic liability
in alternative phenotypes and establishing shared etiology have
immediate relevance for new research avenues that may lead to
therapeutic advances.
3.9 Conclusions
Today, the genomes of many millions of people from around
the world have been studied, enabling discovery of associations
between regions of the genome and human traits. These sophis-
ticated new technologies have helped us unravel the genetic
bases of complex diseases and disorders like language impair-
ment, autism, and stuttering. Genetics has come a long way! At
the same time, there is a long way yet to go in unraveling the
complexity and specific mechanisms that underlie stuttering,
but as laid out in this chapter, we have already learned a tremen-
dous amount.
We know that stuttering often runs in families and have esti-
mated the proportion of variance in stuttering that comes from
genetics. We have mapped rare mutations in genes that may be
the cause of some familial forms of stuttering and have explored
the eﬀects of these mutations in other populations and animal
models. We have also established from these analyses that there

according to these polygenic risk score models compared to controls (red violin). This means that the model captures polygenic risk of stuttering (i.e.,
stuttering cases have a higher burden of genetic risk for stuttering compared to controls). The receiver operator curve (ROC) (right plot) shows the
classification performance of the model, demonstrating that the model performance (solid red line) does better than randomly assigning stuttering
status (dashed black line). The area under the curve (AUC) calculated from these ROC plots indicate how well the model can guess stuttering status of
individuals. These model performance scores range from perfect performance (AUC = 1) to being no better than random chance (AUC = 0.5). An AUC
= 0.6152 indicates moderate model performance.
Genetic Processes

is no single gene or mutation that explains all cases of stuttering,
but rather we have searched for genetic risk factors throughout
the genome in GWAS of population-based clinically ascertained
stuttering case and control data and found an array of common
variants that are associated with stuttering. We have also used
large-scale existing biobank data to study comorbidities of stut-
tering and built predictive models to identify people who are
likely to stutter, even in the absence of a clinical record of stutter-
ing, and found additional genetic variants associated with this
trait. We have seen that polygenic risk scores that summarize
the genome-wide genetic risk of stuttering into a single genetic
liability score can predict people who stutter and established
genetic correlations between stuttering risk and rhythm ability.
Thanks to the eﬀorts of the participants and researchers who
worked together on these studies, the remarkable steps that have
been made toward characterizing the genetic basis of stuttering
pave the way forward for future research that will shape how
stuttering is perceived, managed, and prevented.
Understanding the heritability and molecular basis of stutter-
ing can alleviate stress or worry that individuals or families may
have about the cause of stuttering. For example, some individu-
als who stutter (and the parents of children who stutter as well)
may believe that stuttering is caused by a genetic abnormality
leading to low intelligence, mood, or personality disorders
(nature). On the other hand, parents of children who stutter may
believe that their parenting style or other aspects of the environ-
ment are to blame. When these concerns are expressed in the
clinical setting, speech-language pathologists can say with confi-
dence that findings from diﬀerent lines of research, including
genetics, point to stuttering as a complex and polygenic trait
caused by an array of genes and variants, as well as environmen-
tal and even random factors. Simply put, stuttering can best be
considered as the result of a complex interaction between the
environment and what the child brings to it. Even so, there is
much yet to learn about the genetic factors that underlie the high
heritability of stuttering. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile to envi-
sion what possibilities exist for treatment approaches and
prevention strategies built around the function of the genetic
risk factors identified to date. For example, given the correlation
with rhythm, future research will be needed to explore whether
an intervention to strengthen rhythm abilities may be associated
with an increased recovery rate or prevention of stuttering in
those at risk. Furthermore, the positive identification of genes is
monumental to people who themselves stutter, their families,
and the community. Genetic discoveries can provide answers,
reduce stigma, shame, or blame that often results from not
knowing the cause of developmental stuttering.

4 Speech, Language, and Cognitive Processes
Julie D. Anderson, Katerina Ntourou, and Stacy Wagovich
Abstract
The objective of this chapter is to provide a concise overview of
speech, language, and cognitive processes in developmental
stuttering. We will begin with an introduction to the topic, fol-
lowed by a discussion of linguistic constraints on stuttering—
that is, linguistic factors that influence which words and/or
utterances are likely to be stuttered. The speech and language
abilities of individuals who stutter will then be considered,
along with the potential impact of executive function and at-
tention. By the end of this chapter, the reader will have a basic
understanding of these tripartite processes as they relate to the
onset and development of stuttering, as well as some of the
theory that undergirds our knowledge of the interrelationships
among stuttering, speech, language, and cognition. We will also
consider the extent to which our knowledge of these processes
assists with clinical decision-making, setting the stage for
▶Chapter 13 Language and Phonological Considerations.
Keywords: stuttering, fluency disorder, language, phonology,
articulation, cognition, executive function, attention
4.1 Introduction
Humans speak to communicate, a process that occurs quite rap-
idly. In fact, speakers produce, on average, about two to four
words per second. Since the average word has more than two
phonemes, this translates to about 10 to 15 phonemes per sec-
ond or upward of 1,000 phonemes per minute!1 The rate at
which humans can produce speech is quite remarkable consid-
ering the complexity of the speech and language production
process that must take place to produce a single word.
Most psycholinguists agree that word production involves
at least four stages: semantic processing, lexical processing,
phonological processing, and speech-motor programming and
execution2 (▶Fig. 4.1). Word production begins with the initial
intent to communicate. For example, let us say that a speaker is
thinking about a cat and wants to say something about it. This
thought triggers the retrieval of the conceptual features associ-
ated with a cat, such as furry, whiskers, tail, four legs, meows,
etc. (this is what is called semantic processing). These features
collectively distinguish it from other similar concepts (e.g., dog),
leading to the selection of the word that best matches the
description: cat (lexical processing). Once the word has been
selected, the individual sounds (i.e., phonemes) associated with
it—[k æ t]—must be retrieved and linked together (phonological
processing). These phonemes serve as input to the motor sys-
tem, which produces the programs that eventually enable us to
articulate the intended word (speech-motor programming and
execution; see ▶Chapter 5 for more information about speech-
motor programming and execution). Throughout this process,
speakers can monitor the accuracy and appropriateness of their
speech both before and after they produce it. If a speaker
detects an error, then they can repair it by interrupting ongoing
speech.1
This model is simplistic in that it only illustrates how single
words are spoken; the process is considerably more complex
when multiple words must be retrieved and strung together to

form sentences that conform to the rules of language (syntactic
processing). When preparing multiword utterances, speakers
can vary the amount of time between the phonological process-
ing of a word (i.e., when the sounds are chosen and joined) and
its articulation, such that sometimes they may produce the
word immediately and at other times, they may hold it in stor-
age (also known as buﬀering) until it is time to produce the
word.3 The more speech that is planned in advance, the more
likely it is that the utterance will be fluent,4 but this also
increases demands on working memory (the ability to tempo-
rarily store and manage information in mind).5 Thus, planning
an utterance in advance safeguards fluency. This implies that
when a speaker does not plan ahead, disfluencies are more
likely to result.
Most of the time, we use our speech system seamlessly to pro-
duce fluent speech. This is true not only for individuals who do
not stutter but also for those who do. Occasionally, however,
glitches occur somewhere in the system, resulting in a disfluency.
Although disfluencies can have causes that are unrelated to the
speech production system (e.g., lapses in attention, holding the
floor during a conversational exchange, etc.6), many disfluencies—
namely, interjections or filled pauses, unfilled (silent) pauses,
revisions, and repetitions—have long been associated with dif-
ficulties in semantic, lexical, or phonological processing and
cognitive control (i.e., executive function;7 see ▶Chapter 1 for
a description of diﬀerent types of disfluencies).
Whether or not these struggles could also be responsible for
the disfluencies associated specifically with stuttering—that is,
part-word repetitions, sound prolongations, and blocks—is not
clear. Nevertheless, given how quickly we can speak, it seems
reasonable that even a slight delay or disruption in semantic,
lexical, and/or phonological processing could disrupt the for-
ward flow of speech. For example, it has been estimated to take
75 milliseconds to select a single word during lexical process-
ing.8 Thus, if a speaker experienced a 200-millisecond delay in
this process due to, for example, diﬃculty suppressing compet-
ing semantically related lexical items (e.g., if the target word is
cat, other semantically related words, such as dog, would need
to be inhibited), then this might disrupt ongoing speech, result-
ing in a disfluency.
Linguistic demands can influence a person's ability to be fluent,
as we discuss later. However, whether speech and/or language
diﬃculties are directly implicated in the onset and development
of stuttering is less clear. Cognitive processes—namely, executive
function and attention—may also play a role in some yet
unknown way. It is important to note that when we refer to
cognitive processes, we do not mean intelligence. That is, there
is no evidence to suggest that children who stutter (CWS) or
adults who stutter (AWS) are less intelligent than those who
do not stutter; studies have been consistent in showing that the
intelligence quotients of people who stutter fall well within the
average range for the population.9
In the following sections, we will explore linguistic con-
straints on stuttering, the speech and language abilities of
individuals who stutter, and cognitive factors associated with
stuttering. We will also consider the theoretical, diagnostic,
and treatment implications of these findings. We will focus
mainly on CWS, as the onset of stuttering generally occurs in
childhood, but, where relevant, we will also consider research
findings for adults.
4.2 Linguistic Constraints on
Stuttering
As indicated in ▶Chapter 1, stuttering is not a randomly occur-
ring event. Rather, there is marked consistency both in where
stuttering is likely to occur within an utterance and in the types
of words that are more likely to be stuttered. Among the earliest
observations were that adults are more likely to stutter on (1)
content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs); (2) longer
words (five or more letters); (3) sentence-initial words (the first
three words); and (4) words beginning with a consonant.10
Subsequent research revealed that these characteristics also
hold true for children, with one possible exception. Although
older children, adolescents, and adults are more likely to stutter
on content words, some have noted that young children tend to
stutter disproportionally on function words (e.g., determiners,
conjunctions, prepositions, pronouns).11 This tendency on the
part of young English-speaking children, however, may be more
related to sentence position than grammatical class, since func-
tion words are also more likely to occur at the beginning of a
sentence.12
Since the early work of Brown10 with AWS, researchers have
identified many other phonological, lexical, and syntactic con-
straints on instances of stuttering. ▶Table 4.1 summarizes find-
ings in this area. As noted in the table, some language factors
have been observed only in children or only in adults. For
example, syntactic complexity appears to have less of an eﬀect
on stuttering over time, as some studies have failed to find any
relationship between syntactic complexity and stuttering in
adolescents and AWS.13 It should be noted that ▶Table 4.1 fea-
tures the constraints observed across the literature, capturing
results of most studies; we do not imply that findings of every
study reveal these overall patterns. For that matter, many of
these constraints also apply to individuals who do not stutter.
For example, like CWS, children who do not stutter (CWNS) are
more likely to be disfluent on newly emerging and/or more
complex sentence structures.14
Why is stuttering more likely to occur on certain word types
and places within utterances? The first possibility is that lin-
guistic constraints simply make some words and sentences
more challenging to produce and therefore more vulnerable to
disruption. That is, they place more cognitive and linguistic
demands on the speaker. For example, take the following
sentences: "Donkeys are good" and "Dogs are good." A speaker
would be much more likely to stutter on the word donkeys than
dogs because the former does not occur frequently in language,
making it harder to retrieve, and it has more phonemes, requir-
ing additional phonological processing and speech-motor pro-
gramming. For a young child in the midst of early language
development, the increase in demand associated with using
more complex language may result in disfluency as more resour-
ces are diverted away from fluency and directed toward lan-
guage processing.16
Another possibility is that individuals who stutter have diﬃ-
culty with speech-language processing (i.e., semantic, lexical,
phonological, and/or syntactic processing), so when they expe-
rience challenges to this already vulnerable system, the result is
stuttering rather than a typical, nonstuttered disfluency. If CWS
have diﬃculties with speech-language processing (discussed in
4.2 Linguistic Constraints on Stuttering
53

the following sections), the places in which stuttering occurs
could point to specific areas of greater processing diﬃculty for
the child. For example, stuttering at the beginning of a long,
complex dependent clause could reflect diﬃculty with syntac-
tic processing. In fact, there is some evidence that specific
processing limitations may result in distinct types of disflu-
ency. In several studies, researchers found evidence to suggest
that part-word repetitions and sound prolongations may be
related to diﬃculty with phonological processing, whereas
single-syllable word repetitions may result from disruptions in
other nonphonological processing operations, such as lexical
processing.17
Although one or both possibilities could explain why certain
words and sentences tend to be more susceptible to stuttering,
we currently do not have a definitive answer to this question.
Nevertheless, the fact that there are linguistic constraints on
stuttering does suggest, more generally, that developmental
stuttering is related—indirectly or directly—to the process of
language planning.
4.3 Speech and Language Abilities
and Stuttering
As noted in ▶Chapter 1, the average age of stuttering onset is
33 months, and can range widely between 30 and 60 months.
Thus, children typically do not begin to stutter until they are
able to string words together to form phrases or sentences. Dur-
ing this period, children are also rapidly developing their
speech and language skills, prompting some to consider
whether stuttering could be a consequence of diﬃculties with
speech and language development.
Speech and language skills in CWS can be examined in sev-
eral ways. First, we can consider how CWS perform on formal
standardized, norm-referenced tests of speech and language
and/or in informal spontaneous language samples. Second, we
can examine children's linguistic processing abilities using
experimental tasks that are designed to "tap into" diﬀerent
semantic, lexical, phonological, and syntactic processes. For
example, children might complete a picture-word interference
task in which they name a target picture in the presence or
absence of a semantic or phonological prime (e.g., seeing
the target picture dog while hearing the word cat), to examine
the extent to which the prime impacts processing. Observable
measures from tasks like this include accuracy (e.g., correctly
saying dog vs. incorrectly saying cat), reaction time (e.g., how
long it took to name the picture), or neural activity (e.g., event-
related potentials). Experimental tasks like this allow us to look
beyond static measures of performance, such as language tests,
to explore underlying processes. We might learn, for example,
that CWS perform similarly to CWNS on a particular language
test and perhaps even on an experimental task of language
processing, but it takes them much longer to do so or they
arrive at answers in a diﬀerent way. In this way, experimental
tasks are better at identifying subtle diﬀerences in language
abilities than standardized tests.
Although findings from some studies have suggested that
CWS may be more likely to exhibit concomitant speech and lan-
guage disorders (e.g., having both stuttering and a phonological
disorder) than their typically fluent peers,18,19 a recent study
showed that this was not the case.20 (For further discussion of
the topic of concomitant speech and language disorders in
CWS, see ▶Chapter 13). For the remainder of this chapter, we
will be focusing on CWS who do not have concomitant speech

and language disorders. That is, we will be considering the
speech and language abilities of CWS who are otherwise within
normal limit. We will first turn our attention to examining the
articulation/phonological abilities of young CWS and then con-
sider their vocabulary/morphosyntactic abilities.
4.3.1 Articulation and Phonology
Formal and Informal Measures
The relationship between articulation/phonology and child-
hood stuttering has been a topic of interest among investigators
and clinicians alike for well over 30 years. In this discussion, we
will use the terms articulation and phonology interchangeably,
even though they are not synonymous, with the former refer-
ring to the motoric processes of speech production (i.e., pho-
netic) and the latter to linguistic processes (i.e., phonemic). We
use these terms interchangeably because they have not always
been diﬀerentiated in the stuttering literature.
Most of the investigations that have used standardized,
norm-referenced tests of articulation (e.g., the Goldman-
Fristoe Test of Articulation-2)21 to compare the speech sound
production of young CWS and CWNS have failed to detect dif-
ferences,22,23,24,25,26 although this is not true of all studies.27
Most of this research, however, was not explicitly designed to
examine speech sound production; rather, these studies had
diﬀerent goals and were simply ruling out the possibility of
phonological diﬃculties prior to exploring the goals of interest.
Therefore, measures were designed to screen performance
rather than fully explore children's phonological skills.
CWS who otherwise do not have clinically significant coexist-
ing speech sound disorders appear to perform similarly to
CWNS on tests of articulation/phonology. There does appear to
be a relationship between articulation/phonological develop-
ment and whether children recover naturally from stuttering,
however. That is, young CWS who have weaker articulation/
phonological skills have a greater risk for stuttering persistence
than CWS who have stronger abilities (see ▶Chapter 7).28
Only a handful of studies have examined phonological aware-
ness, or the ability to analyze the speech sound structure of oral
language, in CWS and CWNS using standardized tests such as
the Phonological Awareness Test-Second Edition.29 Common
tasks that assess children's phonological awareness require
them to segment words (e.g., cupcake) into their constituent
syllables (e.g., cup-cake) or sounds/phonemes (e.g., c-u-p-c-a-
k), contrast words that sound similar (e.g., seat-sheet), or blend
syllables (e.g., snow-man = snowman) or sounds/phonemes
(e.g., a-p-l = apple) to make words. These tasks are important
because they provide a window into children's phonological
representations
(i.e.,
how
phonological
information
about
words is stored and accessed in long-term memory). Findings
from studies that have investigated these skills in CWS have
been mixed. Some studies have reported significantly lower pho-
nemic awareness skills in younger (5- to 6-year-old)30 and older
(10- to 14-year-old)31 CWS compared to their typically fluent
peers, but other studies have not observed diﬀerences.32,33
Experimental Measures
To date, research that has focused on the phonological process-
ing abilities of CWS is relatively limited and results have been
mixed. These studies use a range of experimental procedures,
including phoneme elision (i.e., repetition of a nonword or a
real word with the omission of a phoneme), auditory rhyming
judgment (i.e., deciding whether auditorily presented words
rhyme or not), and phonological priming (i.e., hearing the first
phoneme /b/ of a picture [bed] just before naming it), to name a
few. This is a burgeoning area of study, and conclusions should
be reached with caution. Nonetheless, two observations based
on this work are the following:
●Young (5-year-old) CWS may rely on a developmentally less
mature phonological processing system than their typically
fluent peers.23,34
●There may be subgroups of school-age CWS who have
diﬃculty with phonological processing.35,36
There is some suggestion that AWS may have diﬃculty with
phonological processing as well, especially when cognitive
processing demands are high.37,38,39 However, findings are
inconsistent, as some studies have not found diﬀerences
between AWS and adults who do not stutter.40
4.3.2 Vocabulary and Morphosyntax
Formal and Informal Measures
Language weakness can impact speech fluency. In fact, as a
group, children with developmental language disorders have
been shown to produce substantially more disfluencies—both
stuttered and nonstuttered—in their spontaneous speech than
children who do not exhibit developmental language disorder.41,42
These disfluencies, however, are often quantitatively and qual-
itatively diﬀerent from those associated with developmental
stuttering in that they may be produced without tension or
struggle, secondary behaviors, or avoidances. Further, not all
children with language disorders show a pattern of greater
disfluencies relative to their peers. Thus, while language weak-
nesses can impact speech fluency, this relationship is not
observed in all children.
Since language weakness can impact speech fluency, a relevant
question is whether CWS are more likely to exhibit weaknesses
in language. Some studies have explicitly examined whether
CWS diﬀer from CWNS on standardized, norm-referenced meas-
ures of expressive or receptive language, and, for the most part,
have revealed that CWS perform more poorly on these measures
than their typically fluent peers.26,27,43,44,45 These results are also
consistent with a meta-analysis (including some of these studies)
in which CWS were found to score lower than CWNS in receptive
and expressive language, as well as vocabulary.46
Not only have CWS shown weaker language skills on average,
but also their performance reveals dissociations (i.e., imbalan-
ces or mismatches) across speech and language areas. For
example, a child with a dissociation might have above-average
overall expressive language skills coinciding with average to
below-average expressive vocabulary skills. CWS are at least
three times more likely to exhibit these dissociations in their
speech and language skills than their normally disfluent
peers.43,47 Observations of dissociations among CWS reveal that
language weaknesses are more complex than a single language
score indicates. Rather, the language weaknesses observed in
CWS reflect the interrelationships among diﬀerent components
of the speech and language system.
4.3 Speech and Language Abilities and Stuttering
55

It is much less clear whether CWS diﬀer from peers in spon-
taneous language. Using measures such as lexical diversity and
mean length of utterance, some studies have revealed diﬀeren-
ces, with CWS scoring lower than CWNS.46 Further, some inves-
tigations have reported that CWS score near or above age-level
expectations compared to CWNS.48,49 Taken together, research
findings using informal measures of spontaneous speech and
language are somewhat conflicting, making it diﬃcult to draw
conclusions. Although this is the case, the findings related to
formal testing suggest that, on average, CWS perform less well
compared to their nonstuttering peers. What might account for
between-group diﬀerences in performance observed in formal
versus informal language testing? It may be that formal testing
is a more robust evaluation of children's language skills.
Although language samples are more functional measures of
language ability, in some cases they may not be sensitive
enough to detect more subtle weaknesses relative to peers. For
example, a child's lexical diversity in a conversation with a
parent might not fully tap the extent of the child's expressive
vocabulary, as the context may be limiting in detecting this
knowledge.
When considering these findings, there are several points to
keep in mind. First, even when research findings reveal that
CWS perform more poorly than CWNS, results still show that,
in general, the performance of both groups is within normal
limits. That is, CWS do not have clinically significant language
delays or disorders.*
Rather, observed language diﬃculties are more subtle in
nature. Second, not all CWS have weaknesses in their language
skills or present with dissociations across language areas.
Indeed, some CWS have stronger language skills than their typ-
ically fluent peers! Therefore, in sum, CWS, as a group, are more
prone to such weaknesses and dissociations, although sub-
groups displaying diﬀerent patterns may be evident, as well.
Experimental Measures
Far fewer studies have examined the language processing abil-
ities of CWS using experimental and/or electrophysiological
measures. Although findings from these studies have been
inconsistent, two broad conclusions are warranted:
●CWS may be delayed in their ability to develop more complex
or adultlike approaches to language processing.50,51
●CWS appear to be slower than CWNS in processes associated
with lexical and/or syntactic processing.22,25,51
Like studies with children, studies of AWS have yielded incon-
sistent results. However, it would seem that whatever diﬃcul-
ties CWS have in their language processing skills may persist in
some form into adulthood.39,52 Some studies have found that
the language processing systems of AWS may be more vulner-
able to increases in timing and/or cognitive demands (e.g., they
may have more diﬃculty formulating utterances when being
rushed to speak or when trying to avoid, by way of circumlocu-
tion, saying a feared word).37 Thus, it may be that any diﬃcul-
ties AWS have with language processing may not be evident un-
til they are under conditions of high cognitive demand.
4.3.3 Summary
All aspects of speech and language processing (phonological,
lexical, and syntactic) have been implicated as a potential
source of diﬃculty for both CWS and AWS. However, when one
considers that stuttering typically does not develop until chil-
dren begin to string words together to form phrases or senten-
ces, it is likely that syntactic processes are involved to at least
some extent—either in the way they interact with phonological
and lexical processes (e.g., diﬃculty accessing or organizing
words in sentences) or as a source of linguistic demand (i.e.,
processing linguistic stimuli concurrently).
It is also clear that studies conducted by diﬀerent research
groups have yielded inconsistent results, with some finding dif-
ferences between CWS and AWS and their peers in speech and
language and others not. Some of these disparities may simply
be due to diﬀerences in the way the studies were conducted.
For example, some studies may have relied on small sample
sizes or used tasks that were not sensitive enough to detect dif-
ferences. It is important to note that the assumption that
underlies all of these studies is this: If children or adults have
problems with speech or language processes, such diﬃculties
should be apparent at all times in all tasks. One might ask
whether such an assumption is reasonable given diﬀerences in
the communicative demands across a range of contexts.
Consider that we all produce disfluencies in our speech—both
nonstuttered and stuttered—and most of us do not have a diag-
nosis of stuttering. As indicated in the introduction to this
chapter, nonstuttered disfluencies can have many diﬀerent
causes. They may allow us to maintain the floor during a con-
versational exchange, or they may signal to the listener that we
are having language processing diﬃculties (e.g., having trouble
finding a specific word). In addition to these typical disfluen-
cies, individuals who do not stutter also occasionally produce
stuttered disfluencies.
Why are disfluencies produced? Many years of research have
shown that this is a complex question to answer. There are
explanations that focus on the linguistic processing limitations
we all experience to a greater or lesser extent. For example, an
individual may have diﬃculty with word retrieval (i.e., lexical
processing) or planning the grammar of a sentence (i.e., syntac-
tic processing). Although those who stutter may experience
these diﬃculties more often, all of us share them to a degree.
Challenges in diﬀerent aspects of language processing may lead
to a disruption that "freezes" the forward flow of speech,
resulting in disfluent speech. The nature of the diﬃculty (i.e.,
whether the disruption occurs during semantic, lexical, pho-
nological, or syntactic processing) could also result in diﬀerent
types of stuttered disfluencies.17 This linguistic explanation
could be used to explain the disfluencies experienced by all of
us but especially by those with a fluency disorder.
Both stuttering and typical disfluency are complex phe-
nomena, and it is unlikely that strictly linguistic models are
adequate to explain the full range of speech disruptions
observed in individuals who stutter and those who are typically
fluent. In the next section, we examine the role of cognitive

normal limits are excluded from participation

processes, foundational for speech and language, as a way to pro-
vide a more robust explanation of the development and occur-
rence of stuttering.
4.4 Cognitive Processes and
Stuttering
4.4.1 Executive Function
Executive function refers to a set of cognitive skills that are crit-
ical for learning and performing goal-directed tasks in everyday
life (e.g., searching for information about a product on the
computer).53 Although the nature of executive function contin-
ues to be debated, there is some consensus that at least three
components are involved: inhibition, working memory, and
cognitive flexibility.54 ▶Table 4.2 provides definitions and
examples of these three executive function components.
Executive function emerges during infancy and continues to
develop throughout adolescence; however, exponential growth
in these skills occurs during the preschool years.58 Executive
function helps children control their thoughts, emotions, and
behaviors so they can plan, solve problems, and complete
tasks.59 For example, let us say that a little girl is playing with a
kitchen set, while her brother and sister are playing patty-cake
in the background. The child must focus on what she is doing
while also ignoring her siblings; she must remember the steps
involved in "cooking" play food and use objects in a diﬀerent
way when needed (e.g., using a paper towel roll as a rolling
pin). If a parent tells the child that it is time for dinner, the child
must also resist the desire to keep on playing and shift her
attention to the new activity. See ▶Fig. 4.2 for another example
of executive function processes at work in a child's everyday
life.
The importance of executive function during early develop-
ment cannot be overstated; it is a factor in virtually all aspects

attention demands for Sam, a boy who stutters,
during a typical conversational interaction. Sam
talks with his friend (1, 2, 3; selective attention)
while ignoring environmental distractions (e.g.,
girls chatting in proximity) and inhibiting any
action related to his thought "what are those girls
talking about?" (4; inhibition). Furthermore, Sam
held in memory the list of foods that his friend
said he could have as a trade while considering
his choices and picking his favorite item (2;
working memory). Finally, Sam was able to
readily switch from the topic "food" to "toy"
when his friend asked him whether he had shown
him his new toy (3; cognitive flexibility). Source:

of development from learning language to acquiring motor
skills.59 Furthermore, a wide variety of childhood disorders
have been associated with diﬃculties in executive function,
such as anxiety disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
autism spectrum disorder, deafness, developmental language
disorder, and speech sound disorder.60,61,62,63,64 This suggests that
weaknesses in executive function may be a common characteris-
tic of many neurodevelopmental disorders.65
Although at first glance it may seem odd to consider execu-
tive function as a factor in stuttering, it is a foundational skill
that supports all of the processes that have been implicated in
the development of stuttering—namely, language, motor, sen-
sory, and emotional processes. Therefore, understanding execu-
tive function in CWS should lead to a richer understanding of
the disorder itself. Findings from studies that compared CWS to
their peers in executive function have been conflicting. To some
extent, contradictory findings are to be expected. This is espe-
cially true because of the variability in sample size across stud-
ies, as well as the measures used, the modality in which the
stimuli are presented (auditory vs. visual), the domain being
assessed (verbal vs. nonverbal), the outcome measure (accuracy
vs. speed), the context in which the child is being examined
(naturalistic vs. laboratory experiment), the level of task diﬃ-
culty, and the response modality (manual vs. verbal). However,
when we consider the studies collectively, most evidence points
toward CWS having lower levels of inhibition, short-term mem-
ory (a component of working memory), and cognitive flexibility
compared to CWNS (see ▶Table 4.2 for examples).66,67 Some
studies have also shown that CWS are up to seven times more
likely than their peers to have clinically significant deficits in
executive function.68
Although more research is clearly needed, it is interesting to
consider how executive function (and attention) might theoret-
ically play a role in developmental stuttering. We will expand
on this idea later, but for now, it is important to emphasize that
the relationship between executive function and the processes
associated with language, motor, sensation, and emotion is
thought to be bidirectional.69 This means that weaknesses in
language and/or motor function, for example, could lead to
weaknesses in executive function and vice versa. Furthermore,
since executive function is shared across the diﬀerent domains
(i.e., language, motor, etc.), it is also possible for a weakness in
one process (e.g., language) to aﬀect other processes (e.g., mo-
tor) by way of these shared cognitive resources.
4.4.2 Attention
In 1890, the psychologist William James declared that "everyone
knows what attention is."70 Indeed, we all have an intuitive
understanding as to what attention is; however, researchers who
study it for a living cannot always agree on a working definition
for the purpose of careful study of the construct. Nevertheless,
investigators have made progress in identifying diﬀerent types
of attention, of which there are many.71 Some have suggested
that attention may be best described as "attentions," meaning
that there is likely more than one type of attention and, conse-
quently, any attempt to arrive at a single definition will be
fruitless.
It is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss all the var-
iants of attention; rather, we will focus on those that have been
examined within the developmental stuttering literature. There
are three types of attention that undergo substantial growth
during the period in which stuttering typically develops: sus-
tained attention, selective attention, and alternating/shifting at-
tention. Attention is crucial to the development of executive
function, as it allows children to exercise more control over
what they pay attention to and how much attention they
devote to it.55 The diﬀerent aspects of attention also become
more integrated throughout the preschool years. ▶Table 4.3 pro-
vides definitions and examples of the three types of attention.
Attention has been shown to predict a variety of cognitive,
language, academic, and social skills in typically developing
children, such as executive functioning, narrative production,
academic achievement, mathematical abilities, literacy, verbal
ability, knowledge attainment, social competence, and emotion
regulation.82,83,84 Likewise, deficits in attention have been
reported in children with developmental language disorder,
speech sound disorder, and autism spectrum disorder.85,86,87

Speech, Language, and Cognitive Processes
58

Of course, clinically significant attention diﬃculties are ob-
served in children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactiv-
ity disorder.
Given the importance of attention for a variety of outcomes
and behaviors, it is perhaps not surprising that investigators
have examined the attention skills of CWS. There is some sug-
gestion that CWS may be more prone to clinical or subclinical
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which is characterized
by symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity.88
Direct observation and parental report have also found that
CWS tend to perform more poorly than their peers on behavio-
ral tasks of sustained and/or selective attention, and alternating
attention.67,89,90
Not all CWS have problems with attention. Indeed, many do
not. But for those who do, the question is, what does attention
have to do with stuttering? At this point, there is no clear
answer to this question. However, we do know that, like execu-
tive function, attention is crucial to the development of a wide
range of skills in early childhood, including speech and lan-
guage. Children learn the sounds and words of their native lan-
guage and how to create sentences by listening and attending
to those around them. If speech production involves planning
an utterance and monitoring it for errors prior to production,
attention skills may impact these processes, resulting in the
production of speech that is not fully "ready" for execution and
is therefore produced disfluently. Of course, this suggestion is
speculative but may explain, in part, the link between attention
and stuttering. Alternatively, symptoms of inattention and
hyperactivity/impulsivity could lead to behavioral diﬃculties
that are known to exacerbate fluency, such as diﬃculty with
turn-taking and topic maintenance.
4.4.3 Summary
Although the findings of studies are sometimes contradictory,
much of the evidence suggests that, like children with other
neurodevelopmental disorders, CWS have subtle to not so
subtle diﬃculties with executive function and attention. The
mechanism by which these cognitive processes contribute to
developmental stuttering, however, is less than clear. Neverthe-
less, it has been suggested that diﬀerences in executive function
and attention could help explain the multifactorial nature and
heterogeneity of stuttering.66
Multifactorial models of stuttering posit no single cause of
stuttering (see ▶Chapter 2 for more in-depth discussion).
Rather, multiple factors (e.g., linguistic, motor, sensory, cogni-
tive, and emotion) are thought to come together in divergent
ways to contribute to the onset and/or development of stutter-
ing. These models embrace individual diﬀerences, recognizing
that the factors that contribute to stuttering in one individual
may not be the same as those that contribute to another indi-
vidual's stuttering. Multifactorial models have emerged because
individuals who stutter have been shown to display diﬀerences,
usually subtle ones, in a wide range of skills, yet the etiology of
stuttering has remained elusive. Indeed, if there were gross dis-
turbances in the speech, language, motor, and other processes
of individuals who stutter, the cause of stuttering would, no
doubt, have been revealed long ago, as researchers have
intensely scrutinized and compared them to those of typically
fluent speakers for many years. Regardless, one important
question remains: how could individuals who stutter have
weaknesses in so many diﬀerent processes?
The answer to this question is complex. Recall that emerging
research has revealed that, like CWS, children who have pri-
mary deficits in specific domains (e.g., a sensory deficit in deaf-
ness, a language deficit in developmental language disorder,
etc.) also have weaknesses in other domains (e.g., motor skills),
including executive function and attention. We see deficits in
other domains, both in CWS and those with other speech-
language disorders, likely because processes that are domain
specific (i.e., those having to do with a single process, such as
language, motor, sensation, or emotions) are interconnected
with the domain-general cognitive processes of executive func-
tion and attention (see ▶Fig. 4.3 for a visual depiction of the
relationship).69 For example, it is possible for weaknesses in
executive function to impact motor performance and conversely
for weaknesses in language to impact executive function. More-
over, limitations in language processing could aﬀect motor proc-
essing and vice versa by way of their shared cognitive processes.
To put it another way, these processes do not exist in isolation;
what influences one process can influence another.
In short, then, weaknesses in executive function and/or
attention are good candidates for explaining the multifactorial
nature of stuttering, that is, limitations in cognitive processes
could result in modest deficiencies in a wide range of skills (e.g.,
semantics, auditory processing, etc.), given that these cognitive
processes are shared across multiple domains. Of course, as
noted earlier, whatever "weaknesses" CWS have in executive
function and/or attention need not be clinically significant or
even substantially diﬀerent from that of CWNS. Rather, a CWS
could have strong executive function and/or attention skills
relative to other children his or her age, but weaker skills rela-
tive to the child's other domain-specific strengths. This discon-
nect across domains could, theoretically, contribute to diﬃculty
maintaining fluent speech production.
4.5 Implications for Theory and
Clinical Practice
4.5.1 Theoretical
As a result of evidence suggesting that CWS and AWS may have
atypical or depressed linguistic abilities, as well as findings that
the linguistic characteristics of stuttering events in children and
adults are highly predictable, theorists have speculated that stut-
tering may result from diﬃculties with language processing. Some
psycholinguistic theories, such as the covert repair hypothesis91
and the vicious circle hypothesis,92 associate fluency breakdowns
with diﬃculties in language processes (e.g., phonological process-
ing) or the speech monitoring system. Other theories, such as the
EXPLAN theory,93 neuropsycholinguistic theory,94 suprasegmental
sentence plan alignment Model,95 and fault-line hypothesis,96
attribute stuttering to dyssynchronies in timing
within or
between speech-language production processes.
Of the theories that have been proposed, the covert repair
hypothesis91 has garnered the most attention. This theory
acknowledges that all speakers, regardless of whether they
stutter or not, occasionally produce errors during language
processing. If speakers detect an error before speech is
4.5 Implications for Theory and Clinical Practice
59

produced, they can correct it by interrupting speech. It is this
process of correcting the error prior to speaking that results
in both normal and stuttered disfluencies. Individuals who
stutter, however, diﬀer from individuals who do not stutter
in that their phonological processing systems are thought to
be impaired. As a result, they will produce more errors dur-
ing language processing. The resulting increase in errors will,
in turn, create more error correction opportunities, resulting
in even more disfluencies.
The vicious circle hypothesis92 also proposes that stuttering
occurs when internal errors in language processing are repaired.
However, instead of asserting that individuals who stutter pro-
duce more errors, this theory suggests that they are hyper vigi-
lant in their attempt to identify errors; consequently, even slight
errors, which would otherwise go unnoticed by typically fluent
individuals, are repaired. In fact, even the disfluencies them-
selves may be identified as errors, serving to further aggravate
the situation (hence the "vicious circle"). Thus, it is the internal
speech monitoring system that is presumed to be impaired, not
the phonological processing system.
Some theorists have suggested that disfluencies may result
from a dyssynchrony between utterance planning and assembly,96
whereas others have alluded to the possibility of dyssynchrony in
the alignment of a revised utterance with its original supraseg-
mental (i.e., rhythm, melody, and stress) plan.95 The neuropsycho-
linguistic theory,94 however, speculates that disfluencies result
from dyssynchrony between linguistic (i.e., lexical and phono-
logical) and suprasegmental components of the language
system. The resulting disfluency will only become stuttered,
however, if the speaker experiences time pressure to continue
speaking and the sensation of "loss of control."
According to the EXPLAN theory,93 the dyssynchrony associ-
ated with disfluency and stuttering is between language plan-
ning and motor execution: when language planning processes
are slower than the rate at which speech is executed, disfluen-
cies ensue, as the delay leaves the speaker with no speech to
execute. Thus, to "buy time" for further processing, typically
fluent speakers will adopt a "stalling process" in which they
repeat the previously executed word or insert a filled or un-
filled pause until they are ready to proceed. People who stutter,
however, are thought to adopt an "advancing process" where
they repeat fragments of a word that is currently being proc-
essed, leading to part-word repetitions, blocks, and presumably
sound prolongations.
There is both support and conflicting evidence for nearly all
these psycholinguistic models/theories, but none have gained
widespread acceptance. This is partly because many of these
theories do not lend themselves to experimental manipulation,
although some are more testable than others. It is also the case
that many of these theories are lacking in their ability to
account for the marked variability of stuttering within and
between individuals, as well as its onset and development,
spontaneous or unassisted recovery, and many other phenom-
ena associated with stuttering. These problems, however, are
not unique to psycholinguistic theories; rather, they are endemic
to all etiological accounts of stuttering.

Speech, Language, and Cognitive Processes
60

4.5.2 Diagnostic
When we assess and treat an individual for stuttering, or any
other communication disorder for that matter, we should do so
based on our knowledge of the problem, which should, of
course, be up-to-date and evidence based. In other words, what
a clinician does, both diagnostically and therapeutically, is
explicitly and/or implicitly based on their understanding of the
disorder.
We have emphasized in this chapter that CWS, as a group,
may have weaknesses in speech, language, and/or cognitive
processes and some of these children may even have clinically
significant diﬃculties in these areas (i.e., disorders that co-
occur with stuttering). Thus, when children with suspected flu-
ency disorders are evaluated, clinicians should always assess
the other speech and language skills of these children and, if
needed, screen executive function and/or attention, especially
when parents express concern. That is, they should be evaluat-
ing more than just the fluency characteristics of the child's
speech and his or her cognitive and aﬀective reactions hereto.
For a child who is suspected of stuttering, the assessment of
speech and language skills (1) helps the clinician determine if
the child has other concomitant disorders (e.g., phonological
disorder, language impairment, etc.) that also need to be
addressed in treatment and (2) informs the clinician about
aspects of the child's speech or language that could be contribu-
ting to his or her disfluency. For example, perhaps the child stut-
ters more when producing syntactically complex utterances or
has word finding problems that interfere with his or her ability
to maintain fluent speech production. The reader is referred to
▶Chapter 8 for additional discussion of the benefits of compre-
hensive assessment of the speech and language skills of CWS.
Although speech-language clinicians cannot diagnose execu-
tive dysfunction and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
screening these skills in children, when needed, can serve as a
basis for referral to a licensed pediatric psychologist or neuro-
psychologist for further assessment and diagnosis. If a child has
clinical or subclinical disturbances in executive function and/
or attention, the clinician needs to be aware that they can
negatively impact the intervention process and treatment
outcomes88,97 (see ▶Chapter 4.5.3 for more information).
Children's executive function and attention skills can be
screened using behavioral observation and rating scales.
Behavioral observation is one tool that clinicians can use to
gain some insight into children's executive function and atten-
tion skills. When administering a standardized speech or lan-
guage test, for example, the clinician can observe how well the
child follows verbal instructions even with reminders (working
memory), the percent of time the child is able to attend to the
test (sustained attention), how many times the child speaks out
of turn (inhibition), and how the child responds as the test
becomes more diﬃcult (cognitive flexibility). When adminis-
tering multiple tests, the clinician can also observe how well
the child shifts from one test to another (cognitive flexibility).
Behavioral rating scales of executive function and/or attention,
which are completed by observers (parents and/or teachers) or
the child (depending on his or her age), can be easily incorpo-
rated into an assessment. These scales provide information about
a child's executive function and attention skills in everyday
"real-world" contexts. A variety of behavioral rating scales of
executive function and attention have been developed for chil-
dren and adolescents and are shown in ▶Table 4.4.
Behavioral rating scales have several limitations. For example,
results may represent the biases of the observer. Many studies
have also demonstrated that the results of behavioral rating
scales do not always correspond well with the results of per-
formance-based tests. This is likely because the behavioral rat-
ing scales and performance-based measures are measuring
the same skills (e.g., inhibition) but in dissimilar contexts
where they are exhibited diﬀerently.67,68 For this reason, it has
been suggested that executive function and attention should
be assessed using a variety of diﬀerent measures, with per-
formance-based tests administered by a psychologist or other
professionals with appropriate credentials and expertise.
4.5.3 Treatment
There are three implications for treatment based on the speech
and language research discussed in this chapter. First, if a child
who stutters is determined to have a concomitant speech and/or
language disorder, the clinician will need to treat not only the
stuttering but also the other concern(s) (see ▶Chapters 11 and 13
for treatment suggestions). Second, many of the parent-
focused intervention approaches (see ▶Chapter 10) that clini-
cians use to treat early childhood stuttering are implicitly
based on the notion that stuttering is associated with a mis-
match between the child's capacities for fluent speech produc-
tion (e.g., speech motor, language) and the internal or external
demands placed on them for speech fluency. For example,
when we encourage parents to use a slower rate of speech or
to speak using shorter, less complex utterances, we are assum-
ing that these strategies reduce the time pressure and/or lin-
guistic demands on the child. Thus, if parents give the child
more time to plan and produce speech and/or reduce the lan-
guage load of utterances the child hears or is expected to pro-
duce, the child will be more likely to be fluent. Third, when
working directly with CWS, clinicians should consider the
speech and language demands of the material they are using to
teach children either fluency shaping or stuttering modification
techniques. Based on a hierarchy of increasing complexity (see
▶Fig. 4.4 for an example), the clinician would introduce a tech-
nique using reduced communicative demand and gradually
increase linguistic complexity as the child progresses (see
▶Chapters 11 and 13 for further discussion).

4.5 Implications for Theory and Clinical Practice
61

Earlier in the chapter, we considered the literature on execu-
tive function and attention in childhood stuttering, noting that
CWS may have weaknesses in these cognitive processes. Even
so, we may need to consider these skills when planning treat-
ment, even when the child does not present with suspected or
diagnosed concomitant executive function and/or attention dif-
ficulties. Executive function and attention do not have to be
clinically significant to be clinically relevant and worthy of con-
sideration in treatment planning.
For preschool children, some of the suggested indirect treat-
ment modifications (e.g., turn-taking, parents pausing between
phrases, etc.) not only reduce time pressure and linguistic
demand but also executive function and/or attention demands.
For example, as illustrated in ▶Table 4.5, when parents insert
pauses at sentence boundaries, it can reduce working memory
demands on the child and facilitate language comprehension.
Some indirect treatment approaches may even promote exec-
utive function and attentional skills. For example, in many
parent-focused intervention approaches, parents are instructed
to wait for 1 to 2 seconds before responding to their child's ques-
tion or comment and children are encouraged to do likewise
(e.g., "listen while others are talking," "wait your turn while
others are talking," and "be quiet while others are talking"). This
behavior not only gives the child more time to formulate a res-
ponse but also promotes the development of sustained attention
and inhibition.
When older children acquire and use fluency shaping and
stuttering modification techniques in treatment, they are also
drawing on executive function and attention skills. For exam-
ple, pausing, phrasing, slow rate of speech, and cancellations all
require inhibition, as children must overcome the natural ten-
dency to speak as they typically do. When children use these
techniques outside the therapy room, they must also be more
vigilant and engage in a higher level of self-monitoring. Helping
children change their thoughts about stuttering requires cogni-
tive flexibility, whereas high levels of worry and anxiety about
talking and stuttering can tax working memory. The point here
is that clinicians need to be aware that stuttering therapy
can pose a challenge for children, particularly those who have
clinically significant weaknesses in executive function and/or
attention.
Finally, if children have clinical or subclinical symptoms of
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, clinicians need to
consider that these symptoms can exacerbate stuttering and,
if needed, address them in therapy.98 Some of these symp-
toms include rapid rate of speech, diﬃculty with conversational
turn-taking, and production of long utterances that often lack
clarity, organization, and cohesion. Clinicians should also be
mindful of how to keep the child with clinical or subclinical
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder engaged, motivated,
interested, and focused during therapy sessions by establish-
ing predictable routines, creating visual reminders, using concise
and simple instructions, repeating instructions frequently, incor-
porating topics that are interesting and motivating to the child,
and introducing frequent practice blocks during the session.
4.6 Future Directions
The astute reader will no doubt realize that despite having
made progress, researchers still have much to learn about
speech, language, and cognitive processes in developmental
stuttering. Such progress is undoubtedly hampered by the fact
that individuals who stutter are, by nature, heterogeneous and
stuttering is a complicated disorder. Nevertheless, this should
not be construed as a weakness, as science often progresses
incrementally. Yet with each new study, the field continues to
move forward, even if slowly.
There are several specific areas of research that would con-
tribute to our knowledge base and help us better understand
how speech, language, and cognitive processes contribute to
Fig. 4.4 Example of a linguistic hierarchy.
Speech, Language, and Cognitive Processes
62

developmental stuttering. Areas of future research include the
way in which language and cognitive factors interact with stut-
tering persistence and biological sex. First, it is important to
determine whether executive function and/or attention influ-
ences stuttering persistence. As previously indicated, research
suggests that CWS who have weaker articulation/phonological
skills have a higher risk of being among the 20 to 30% of chil-
dren whose stuttering persists.28 There is also evidence to
suggest that persistence may be higher for CWS with weaker
expressive and/or receptive language skills99 and lower atten-
tion spans.28 Although we have some knowledge of the impact
of articulation/phonology, language, and attentional skills on
stuttering persistence, research on the eﬀect of executive func-
tion on persistence lags far behind.
A second area of future research is examining the impact of
biological sex on speech, language, and cognitive processes in
CWS and CWNS. Few studies have examined biological sex dif-
ferences in developmental stuttering, which is somewhat sur-
prising given that it is well known that boys are more likely to
persist in stuttering than girls. Nevertheless, without more
research, we cannot simply assume that girls who stutter are
the same as boys who stutter. In fact, the findings of one recent
study suggest that they may not be entirely the same in at least
some skills. In this study, the investigators found that boys who
stutter were more impulsive than boys who do not stutter, but
there was no diﬀerence between the girls who do and do not
stutter.100 These findings illustrate the need for further study of
biological sex diﬀerences in developmental stuttering.
The ongoing study of speech, language, and cognitive processes
in individuals who stutter is also critical for the development
and/or delivery of eﬀective therapies. As previously indicated,
given that fluency shaping and stuttering modification techni-
ques utilize executive function and attention skills, it stands to
reason that if a child has clinical or subclinical deficiencies in
these areas, it will negatively aﬀect the extent to which they may
benefit from treatment. Only a few studies have examined this
possibility, both of which demonstrated that CWS who have more
attentional diﬃculties require more treatment sessions to achieve
typical fluency88 and have reduced treatment outcomes.97 Clearly,
more studies are needed to further examine how executive func-
tion and attention might impact treatment outcomes and, per-
haps, the eﬃcacy of the techniques that children use to achieve
fluency and/or modify their stuttering.
4.7 Conclusions
The production of words and multiword utterances requires a
complex series of events, beginning with the retrieval of the
semantic features associated with the intended word(s) and
ending with the articulation of the selected word(s). Given the
rapid rate at which these events unfold, it seems as if break-
downs in fluency should occur for all of us more often than they
do! For millions of individuals who stutter, this is indeed the
case. Disfluencies are not random; some words and locations
within an utterance are more likely to be disfluent, reflecting
increased cognitive and linguistic demands on the speaker or
vulnerabilities in the speech-language production system.
Although findings from studies of the articulation/phonology
and language abilities of CWS have been mixed, we can make
several broad conclusions from this work. First, while CWS do not
appear to appreciably diﬀer from CWNS on tests of articulation/
phonology, they do tend to perform more poorly (albeit still
within normal limits) on standardized, norm-referenced tests
of language. Second, the phonological and language processing
abilities of at least some CWS may be slower and/or develop-
mentally less mature than CWNS. Psycholinguistic theories of
stuttering point to dyssynchronies in the simultaneous timing
of diﬀerent aspects of speech-language production. Further,
there is growing evidence that cognitive processes may play a
role in developmental stuttering, with some studies reporting
that CWS have subtle to not so subtle diﬃculties with executive
function and attention. Therefore, speech, language, and cogni-
tive factors should be considered when evaluating and treating
a CWS.
Although much progress has been made in our understand-
ing of the role of speech, language, and cognitive processes in
developmental stuttering, more work needs to be done. Speech
production is as complex as the neural systems that subserve it,
Table 4.5 Examples of indirect stuttering treatment strategies and their impact on executive function and attention
Pausing between conversational turns: Parents wait for 1-2 seconds before
responding to their child's question or comment
Reduces attention and working memory demands on the child,
giving them more time to process the message and formulate their
response. Learning to pause and wait for their turn also promotes
the development of sustained attention and inhibition
Balancing utterance ratio: Parents maintain a balance between the number
of spoken utterances they produce and the number of utterances their child
produces during each conversational turn (~1:1)
Reduces working memory demands on the child
Adjusting language input: Parents use language that is within their child's range
of linguistic competence (e.g., shorter and/or less complex language)
Reduces working memory demands on the child
Modifying questioning: Parents avoid asking frequent rapid-fire questions and
questions that require complex, lengthy responses
Reduces working memory and cognitive flexibility demands on the
child, especially if questions are about different topics
Following the child's lead: Parents talk about what their child is doing and
respond to the child's conversation topic of interest
Fosters sustained attention and, when talking about the "here and
now" (instead of something more abstract), reduces working
memory demands
Maintaining conversation topic: Parents avoid introducing multiple
conversational topics during the same interaction
Decreases cognitive flexibility demands on the child
Pausing between phrases/clauses: Parents insert short pauses between phrases
or clauses (e.g., "Please come here [pause] I need your help.")
Reduces working memory demands on the child, giving them
more time for information storing and processing
4.7 Conclusions
63

making it likely that any quest to attribute a single cause to stut-
tering will remain elusive. In fact, in his classic textbook, Charles
Van Riper101 described stuttering as "...a puzzle, the pieces of
which lie scattered on the tables of speech pathology, psychiatry,
neurophysiology, genetics, and many other disciplines... we
suspect that some of the essential pieces are not merely mis-
placed but still missing." These words are just as apt today as
they were in 1971, for even though stuttering has been
studied extensively, its puzzling and enigmatic nature is and
will continue to be a worthy challenge for students, clinicians,
and researchers, now and for the foreseeable future.

5 Neural and Physiological Processes
Deryk Beal, Evan Usler, and Anna Tendera
Abstract
Over the past century, investigations into the underlying mecha-
nisms of developmental stuttering have advanced considerably
to reveal a complex neurophysiology. A greater understanding of
the neural and physiological processes associated with stuttering
is relevant not only for those with a natural curiosity of the theo-
retical neurophysiological underpinnings of the disorder but also
for those who seek to improve client education and treatment. A
clear description of the neurophysiology of stuttering will shed
light on potential causes, developmental trajectories, and may
improve the eﬀectiveness of stuttering treatment. The purpose
of this chapter is to describe and discuss the neural and phys-
iological processes underlying developmental stuttering. The
chapter begins with an introduction to how the brain controls
stuttering, followed by a multileveled analysis across the vari-
ous levels of physiology: (1) perceptual disfluency; (2) articula-
tory, laryngeal, and respiratory dynamics; (3) neuromuscular
activation; (4) electrocortical activation; and (5) brain regions
and networks. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the
theoretical and treatment implications of these findings, as well
as a glance into potential future research directions regarding
the neural and physiological processes of developmental
stuttering.
Keywords: stuttering, fluency disorder, speech motor control,
neuroanatomy, neurophysiology
5.1 Introduction
Developmental stuttering is a neurodevelopmental and multi-
factorial fluency disorder whose neural mechanisms remain
unclear. In other words, we know its characteristics quite well,
but we are less certain about how and why the brain and body
produce stuttering behavior. Speech fluency is the product of
the consistent, smooth, and rapid movement of the speech
motor system, even in the face of linguistic, cognitive, and emo-
tional demands. To achieve these movements, the brain must
rapidly and accurately execute various neural and physiological
processes associated with speech motor control.
Developmental stuttering has been considered by some to be
primarily a disorder of speech motor control and coordination.1
From this perspective, we will focus on how the brain controls
movement, a process that assumes that the brain stores repre-
sentations of movement sequences, commonly known as motor
programs, in memory.2 Speech motor programs allow for the
quick selection of learned, sequential movements that facilitate
the production of phonemes and syllables.3 Thus, according to
this viewpoint, diﬃculty with the timing and/or sequencing
of these programs, which are also influenced by cognitive and
linguistic abilities, would result in the production of stuttering
disfluencies (sound/syllable repetitions, prolongations, and
blocks), the most salient symptom of the disorder.3,4
Developmental stuttering is a disorder that is often misun-
derstood because its neurophysiological nature is complex, and
stuttering behaviors often diﬀer across people who stutter (PWS)
and even within a person over time. As shown in ▶Fig. 5.1, PWS
may appear fluent in one situation but not another. Others may
only have diﬃculty saying certain sounds or words. This variabil-
ity in stuttering behaviors makes it challenging for researchers to
elucidate the neurophysiological underpinnings of developmental
stuttering. Nevertheless, to improve the well-being and diverse
needs of PWS, it is helpful for clinicians to have at least some
understanding of the complex neurophysiological events associ-
ated with stuttering.
Almost a century ago, Lee Travis and his colleagues at the
University of Iowa proposed that developmental stuttering was
associated with a lack of cerebral dominance.5 As discussed in

▶Chapter 2, the cerebral dominance theory of stuttering posited
that if one hemisphere failed to dominate over the other, the two
hemispheres would function independently, resulting in poor
synchronization of the speech musculature. During this time,
many left-handed children were forced to write with their right
hand. This change in handedness was thought to prevent the
development of a dominant hemisphere for speech and lan-
guage, thereby contributing to the emergence of stuttering. This
early theory was largely incorrect, in part, because most children
who were forced to change handedness did not develop stut-
tering, but the notion that biases in hemispheric activation were
associated with stuttering would turn out to be influential.
Over the past five decades, neurophysiological explanations
have implicated areas of the brain responsible for the control
of speech-language production in the development of the dis-
order and/or the elicitation of stuttering behaviors.6 Empirical
research has revealed considerable neural and physiological
diﬀerences between PWS and their fluent peers, including
atypical brain anatomy and connectivity. To make sense of these
findings and interpretations, we will describe the multiple
interrelated levels of neural and physiological processes under-
lying developmental stuttering (▶Fig. 5.2).
5.2 Level 1: Perceptual Disfluency
As stated in ▶Chapter 1, stuttering disfluencies are perceptual
disruptions in the acoustic speech signal, often characterized by
type, frequency, and duration. PWS may also exhibit secondary
behaviors (such as lesser eye contact or circumlocutions), covert
behaviors for avoidance or escape from feared speaking situa-
tions, and/or atypical habits to produce certain words. Analysis
of these behaviors provides useful information about overall
severity, but it tells us relatively little about the neural and
physiological processes underlying the disorder. A nice analogy
by Smith7 is that studying when and how often disfluencies
occur is similar to studying the flow of lava coming out of a vol-
cano. Although we are not volcanologists, it seems self-evident
that understanding plate tectonics and other activity under the
earth's surface would give us more valuable information on
when and why a volcanic eruption will occur, compared to just
studying surface phenomena such as the speed and direction of
flowing lava. Thus, let us dig a little deeper into the subsystems
of speech in our investigation about what underlying factors
play a role in stuttering.
5.3 Level 2: Articulatory,
Laryngeal, and Respiratory
Dynamics
As mentioned earlier, stuttering disfluencies may occur when
diﬃculties in the initiation and execution of speech motor pro-
grams disrupt the coordination of the articulatory, laryngeal,
and respiratory subsystems necessary for fluent speech. Meas-
uring the movement of these speech subsystems allows for a
quantification of speech motor control processes beyond what
we can normally perceive with our eyes and ears. Research us-
ing speech acoustics and kinematics, which measure speech
movements, has revealed that PWS exhibit speech motor sys-
tems that operate diﬀerently from their fluent peers, particu-
larly during times of increased cognitive-linguistic demands or
environmental stress. For example, even during perceptually
fluent speech (speech that sounds fluent), PWS exhibit higher
articulatory variability across utterances compared to fluent
peers, particularly under increased task demands.8 Interest-
ingly, some adults who stutter may also adopt more restricted
articulatory movements when producing utterances, perhaps
as a way to safeguard speech fluency.9

iological processes associated with developmen-
tal stuttering. Source: Image created by Rae

Neural and Physiological Processes

Young children who stutter, and males in particular, have
also been shown to exhibit deficits in articulatory movement
compared to typically developing children.10 Increased articu-
latory variability also distinguishes school-age children with
persistent stuttering compared to peers who had previously
recovered.11 Finally, as a measure of motor learning across
utterance repetitions, articulatory variability of adults who
stutter has been shown to decrease from early to later utteran-
ces. This dynamic was not observed in fluent controls.12 These
reported deficits in the control of articulation may represent
an underlying instability of the speech motor control proc-
esses in PWS.4
In addition to articulation, stuttering has also been related to
disruptions in laryngeal and respiratory muscle coordination.
Acoustic measures of laryngeal function, such as fundamental
frequency, jitter, and shimmer, are diﬀerent in PWS compared
to their fluent counterparts.13,14 Stuttering has also been associ-
ated with discoordination in respiratory movements, resulting
in diﬃculty maintaining constant levels of subglottal pressure
during speech.15 Even when fluent, adults who stutter exhibit
atypical levels of subglottal pressure compared to fluent adults.16
In sum, atypical articulatory, laryngeal, and respiratory
dynamics appear to contribute not only to stuttering behaviors
but also to the perceptually fluent speech of PWS. However,
these diﬀerences in respiratory, phonatory, and articulatory
control are subtle. That is, there are no gross or obvious abnor-
malities in the speech subsystems of PWS. Furthermore, it is
diﬃcult to determine if these physiological diﬀerences are
causally associated with stuttering or are a symptom of or a
reaction to the stuttering.
5.4 Level 3: Neuromuscular
Activation
When the moment of stuttering is described by PWS, they often
report feeling tension in facial, mandibular, and laryngeal
muscles.17 This characteristic of the disorder has been long
known and suggests that stuttering may be the result of aber-
rant muscle physiology. The disruptions in speech coordination
that were summarized earlier in ▶Chapter 5.3 Level 2: Artic-
ulatory, Laryngeal, and Respiratory Dynamics can also be
measured at the level of the muscles themselves using electro-
myography (EMG). Depicted in ▶Fig. 5.3, EMG is a technique
for recording electrical activity, usually from electrodes placed
on the skin, produced during muscle contraction.18 Although
some have suggested that stuttering disfluencies may result
from atypical contraction of the facial, mandibular, and/or
laryngeal muscles,19,20 activity recorded by EMG does not
appear to diﬀer during fluent and disfluent speech in PWS.21,22
This indicates that aberrant muscle physiology is not likely to
play a causal role in stuttering disfluencies.
A little understood behavior associated with stuttering is an
involuntary, rhythmic movement (i.e., tremor) that can be
measured across the muscles of the jaw, lip, and larynx during
stuttering disfluencies.23,24 Tremor is not observed in young
children who stutter, nor is it universally present in all adults
who stutter or in every instance of disfluency.24 The reason
why some PWS develop tremor and whether it could be related
to anxiety remains unclear. Nevertheless, given that tremor
emerges in later childhood—years after the typical onset of
stuttering25—it is clear that tremor does not cause stuttering.
A greater understanding of how neuromuscular activation
may diﬀer between PWS and their fluent peers may be
achieved by examining the brain. Transcranial magnetic stimu-
lation is a noninvasive method that can be used to explore the
interaction between the left and right hemispheres and the
excitability of the brain. The use of this technique has revealed
that adults who stutter exhibit decreased motor excitability in
left
hemisphere brain
areas
associated
with
speech
and
language production, while fluent speakers present with the
opposite pattern (i.e., increased excitability).26,27 Although evi-
dence is still being accumulated, it seems that PWS may have
atypical neuromuscular activation from the motor cortex to the
speech muscles. However, to fully appreciate the neuromotor
processes involved in stuttering, we must have a better under-
standing of how the brain controls speech.
5.5 Level 4: Electrocortical
Activation
If, as stated in the Introduction, stuttering disfluencies are the
result of aberrant timing and sequencing of motor programs,
processes within the brain must play a central role. Fluent
speech requires the rapid coordination of multiple brain regions
that have distinct, yet related processing tasks. According to
psycholinguistic models, it takes approximately half a second
from the conceptualization of a word to its articulation (see
▶Chapter 4).28 Stuttering disfluencies emerge during this short,
dynamic period of time. How do we study this fleeting activity
in a noninvasive way? Electroencephalography (EEG) measures
brain function by directly recording electrical activity in the
Fig. 5.3 Electromyography (EMG) allows for the quantification of
speech muscle activity associated with developmental stuttering.

5.5 Level 4: Electrocortical Activation
69

cortex (▶Fig. 5.4),
while magnetoencephalography (MEG)
detects magnetic fields that are associated with electrical brain
activity. Both EEG and MEG, which are recorded from electro-
des on the scalp, have a high temporal resolution. This means
that these methods are very sensitive to millisecond changes in
brain activity associated with speech. A limitation of EEG and
MEG is that both provide relatively low spatial resolution,
meaning that it is diﬃcult to know exactly where the brain
activity is occurring.
Two EEG/MEG approaches that have been used to study stut-
tering are time-frequency analyses and event-related potentials
(ERPs) or event-related fields (ERFs). Time-frequency analyses
reflect changes in the strength of ongoing electrical activity,
which are referred to as modulations. Studies that have exam-
ined modulations both before the onset of speech and during
its execution have revealed that adults who stutter may have
reduced coordination in the motor system relative to their
fluent peers.29,30
If an event (such as auditory or visual stimuli) is repeatedly
presented to a participant, EEG/MEG activity can be time locked
(i.e., lined up in time) to this event and averaged across trials.
This averaging process creates an ERP waveform, which can
reveal important information about brain processes associated
with sensory perception (detecting and interpreting sensory
information from the environment), sensorimotor prediction
(predicting the sensory consequences of speech), speech moni-
toring (monitoring the accuracy of speech before and during its
production), and other cognitive activities (e.g., remembering,
paying attention, etc.).
ERPs/ERFs elicited after seeing or hearing a stimulus (i.e.,
before speech is produced) have revealed that adults who stut-
ter demonstrate abnormalities in auditory-motor integration
and preverbal speech monitoring (they may perceive their
speech plans as incorrect even if they are correct).31,32 ERP
studies have also revealed that PWS may have diﬃculties with
various cognitive processes, such as inhibitory control (see
▶Chapter 4).33,34 A particular type of ERP, the contingent
negative variation (CNV), may be generated by the basal gan-
glia and is a measure of cortical excitability associated with
the preparation of speech.35 Although previous findings have
been mixed, the CNV measured right before speech appears to
be greater in adults who stutter compared to fluent peers and
this eﬀect is largest for adults with severe stuttering.36 Fur-
thermore, CNV amplitude was observed to be increased before
fluent words compared to stuttered words.37 These diﬀerences
in the CNV suggest that the basal ganglia may be overactivated
during speech motor preparation in adults who stutter, which
may represent a successful, albeit taxing, cognitive strategy for
producing fluent speech.37 ERPs/ERFs that are elicited to a
sound, also known as auditory evoked potentials, have been
used to examine the interactions between auditory processing
and speech in PWS and their fluent peers.38,39 Although both
PWS and their peers demonstrate reduced brain activity dur-
ing speech when compared to passive listening, adults who
stutter exhibit shorter auditory evoked potential latencies in
the right hemisphere during speech.40 In other words, diﬀer-
ences in cortical activation associated with auditory processes
may contribute to stuttering.

5.6 Level 5: Brain Regions and
Networks
Although the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological basis of
speech production is not fully understood, we know that
speech production is driven by a complex network of brain
regions. This speech network plans, coordinates, and executes
articulatory movements and connected speech sounds (see
Levels 1 and 2). In the broadest of terms, the brain can be seg-
mented into its two hemispheres. The brain network for speech
and language spans both hemispheres, as regions across both
are active during typical speech and language tasks. However,
subtle diﬀerences in anatomic landmarks and brain function,
especially for language, indicate that the networks are largely
lateralized to the left hemisphere. In fact, approximately 94% of
right-handed people and 84% of left-handed people are left-
hemisphere dominant for language.41 The lateralization of brain
activity in PWS has been of interest since the 1920s, with early
theories (e.g., the cerebral dominance theory) positing that
stuttering was caused by an abnormal hemispheric imbalance
in the speech production network. However, most modern
views, informed by the latest in neuroimaging data, recognize
the complex characteristics of brain activation across the
speech networks and that hemispheric diﬀerences in PWS are
likely dependent on the experimental task used and when the
data are collected (i.e., childhood vs. adulthood).42
Here we briefly summarize current knowledge of typical
speech production. The speech network spans the brain and
includes several cortical and subcortical gray matter regions
(composed of nerve cell bodies and dendrites) that are intercon-
nected by numerous white matter fiber pathways (composed of
myelinated axons). ▶Fig. 5.5 displays the left hemisphere of the
brain. The key speech and language areas are color coded and
labeled accordingly. There is a large degree of overlap in the
brain networks that support speech and language, and it is very
diﬃcult to tease them apart. Some studies have attempted to
examine only speech-motor control by creating stimuli with
minimal linguistic information for production, such as simple
syllables. Based on work using stimuli like this, a minimal speech
production network has been identified that relies on the inte-
gration of motor, somatosensory, and auditory information.43,44
The cortical areas that contribute to speech motor control, pre-
cise timing, and prosody of speech sounds include the inferior
frontal gyrus (IFG), motor cortex, supplementary motor area,
supramarginal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus. Subcortical
areas (e.g., basal ganglia and thalamus) and the cerebellum also
play a role.
A widely cited neurocomputational model of speech produc-
tion, named the Directions Into Velocities of Articulators (DIVA)
model (see ▶Chapter 2), posits that when we start speaking,
neurons in the posterior IFG activate a representation of the
sound and create an articulatory map that specifies, for exam-
ple, where the sound is made in the mouth and whether the
vocal folds vibrate, the sounds in a word or utterance that we
want to produce.45 This articulatory representation is then
passed to neurons in the motor areas that send signals to
the articulatory muscles, which initiate speech vocalizations.
The supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and basal ganglia
control the sequencing and timing of the speech sounds. When
sounds are articulated, the superior temporal gyrus and supra-
marginal gyrus receive the articulatory representation and then
forward it to the posterior IFG, which monitors the quality of
production and detects potential errors.46
Advances in noninvasive neuroimaging over the past 30 years,
especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; see ▶Fig. 5.6), have
allowed for an unprecedented surge in our ability to observe
human brain structure and function. Structural imaging techni-
ques allow us to visualize the size and shape of the brain to
determine whether abnormalities are present, whereas func-
tional imaging measures patterns of brain activity associated
with perceptual, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional proc-
esses. Much of what we have learned is based on observations
averaged across groups of PWS who volunteer to participate in

neuroimaging studies. It is important to note that there is cur-
rently no known "stuttering spot" in the brain that causes
developmental stuttering. That is, there is no single region in
the brain that is grossly abnormal in any given individual who
stutters or across all PWS. To obtain most of the observations
discussed below, quantitative metrics must be averaged across
many participants to reveal diﬀerences. At the group level, we
have learned that there are diﬀerences between PWS and
fluent speakers in various gray matter regions and white
matter tracts.
5.6.1 Structural Diﬀerences in Brain
Regions and Networks of PWS
Gray Matter
Structural MRI has been widely used to collect images of the
brain with high spatial resolution. When we say that MR images
of the brain have high spatial resolution, it means that more
anatomical details are visible. Structural MRI measures of the
brain commonly include gray matter volume and thickness.
Accumulating evidence indicates that the parts of the brain that
are associated with speech planning processes have reduced
gray matter volume in PWS.47,48 A study of cortical thickness
across development in male school-age children who stutter
revealed an abnormal pattern of development in the left IFG.49
Specifically, typical development of cortical thickness in this
area involves a peak in thickness in childhood with a slow and
steady decline with age. These patterns are thought to reflect
maturational processes in gray matter related to the growth
and increased eﬃciency of neuronal networks. Incredibly, the
pattern of left IFG thickness in the males who stutter was flat,
indicating that, unlike their peers who do not stutter, these
children did not experience the typical burst in left IFG devel-
opment, which may be related to their stuttering behaviors. A
similar abnormal pattern of cortical thickness development has
been found in the left premotor cortex, which lies just posterior
to the IFG, in school-aged children who stutter.50
These developmental diﬀerences are not necessarily causal
but may reflect changes in how the speech network matures.
Other important brain regions for speech production have also
been found to diﬀer in structure in PWS relative to fluent
peers.51 For example, children who stutter have been shown to
have increased gray matter volume in the middle prefrontal
gyrus, postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and the infe-
rior parietal lobule and motor cortex in the right hemisphere
relative to their fluent peers.52
Taken together, it is evident that structural diﬀerences occur
across several critical regions involved in speech production in
PWS relative to people who do not stutter. As one considers
these diﬀerences across various gray matter regions in the
speech network, it is only natural to wonder how these regions
are connected structurally and then ultimately how they func-
tion together. The current view is that cognitive, linguistic,
emotional, and speech-motor processes and their interactions
across regions may be of more interest than the individual
brain regions themselves. However, the posterior IFG, premotor
cortex, and motor cortex are important for integrating auditory
information (i.e., what you heard yourself say) and motor
information (i.e., what you planned to say) and timing the
movements of the speech articulators. In the following sections,
we will discuss how these brain regions are connected and
function for these important processes.
White Matter
Examining structural diﬀerences in the integrity or volume of
the white matter pathways that connect the gray matter
regions of the brain in individuals who stutter is also important.
The gray matter of the brain network for speech is intercon-
nected via the underlying white matter pathways. These path-
ways are analogous to a system of highways, roads, and streets
for automobile traﬃc in that they merge into major pathways
to carry information over long distances in the brain and
diverge into smaller regional pathways before reaching their
destination. Fractional anisotropy is a common measure used
to infer information about the "integrity" or myelination of the
white matter pathways linking language and speech motor
regions of the brain. Using this measure, several studies have
shown
that
both
adults
and
children who
stutter have
decreased white matter integrity in the parts of the brain (e.g.,
left arcuate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus) that are
thought to be involved in the mapping of speech sounds to
motor plans.6,53 Smaller volumes of white matter in these brain
areas may reduce the eﬃciency of the language and speech
mechanisms that are necessary for fluent speech.
5.6.2 Functional Diﬀerences in Brain
Regions and Networks of PWS
Diﬀerences in brain structure may be related to how speech is
produced in PWS. Brain activity can be measured using various

cation of structural and functional brain characteristics associated
with developmental stuttering. Source: Image created by Rae

Neural and Physiological Processes
72

functional imaging techniques, such as positron emission
tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
These techniques commonly detect changes in blood flow, glu-
cose consumption, or oxygen utilization, for when the brain is
active, more blood, glucose, and oxygen are needed for it to
function properly. To date, several studies have reported anom-
alous brain function in PWS during speech and/or nonspeech
tasks, indicating that stuttering may be associated with atypical
speech and language planning processes.54,55 For example, there
is evidence that the motor cortex, which is responsible for
motor execution, is engaged earlier than the IFG in stuttering,
which is the opposite of the typical speech production proc-
ess.56 Similarly, atypical activity in the IFG, which is also impor-
tant for language, has been found in adolescents and adults
who stutter during speech production tasks.52,57
Reminiscent of the cerebral dominance theory of stuttering
(see ▶Chapter 5.2 Introduction above and ▶Chapter 2), some
investigators have argued that stuttering may be associated
with an imbalance in hemispheric functioning during speech
production.58 Indeed, findings from some studies have revealed
that the typical left lateralization of the motor cortex during
speech preparation may not be present in adults who stutter.59
Other studies have reported hemispheric diﬀerences in the
activity of the right IFG, with more activity occurring in this
area during stuttered speech and less activity following fluency
shaping treatment.48 However, it remains unclear if these dif-
ferences in hemispheric activation are a compensatory mecha-
nism that facilitates speech production.
Aberrant activity in subcortical structures—namely, the basal
ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor circuit—that are important for
making smooth transitions between syllables and words has
also been reported in adults who stutter (see ▶Fig. 5.7 for an
image of the structures associated with this circuit).60,61 To
compensate for this aberrant activity, the cerebellum, which
fine-tunes the timing of motor commands during speech pro-
duction, may become more activated. Indeed, in adults who
stutter, increased activity in the cerebellum has been associated
with fluently produced utterances and the completion of
fluency shaping therapy.48,62 Taken together, neuroimaging
techniques have given us the tools with which to investigate
the neural pathways involved in stuttering. These studies have
demonstrated an array of possible abnormalities in the neural
network for speech production in PWS. However, more
research is clearly needed to better understand the neural
and physiological processes of developmental stuttering.
5.7 Discussion
5.7.1 Theoretical Implications
The heterogeneity of stuttering behaviors across PWS, the situa-
tional variability in the elicitation of stuttering disfluencies, and
the multiple levels of neurophysiological processes implicated in
the disorder should underscore its intrinsic complexity. Despite
the complexity, a growing consensus among researchers has
resulted in several empirically supported assumptions about the
etiology of developmental stuttering. First, empirical research of
neural and physiological processes supports the view that devel-
opmental stuttering may be a disorder of speech motor perform-
ance, although influenced by multiple internal and external
factors. The linguistic processes underlying fluent speech involve
a complex series of events including the selection and retrieval
of words from the mental lexicon, the retrieval and linking
together of phonemes associated with the words, and the con-
struction of syntactic phrase structure (see ▶Chapter 4). All this
must occur before the initiation of speech production. The motor
control processes underlying fluent speech involve the retrieval
of a learned representation of articulatory targets (commonly
referred to as a motor program), the continuous and smooth
articulation of these motor programs, and the online updating of
these motor programs via sensorimotor adaptation.63 The motor
skills necessary for fluent speech are acquired through pro-
tracted practice during childhood, resulting in refined, eﬃcient,
and stable movement patterns that are predictable over a wide
range of environmental conditions.64

thalamo-cortical motor circuit appears to be

5.7 Discussion
73

Despite the complexities of speech, the seemingly little eﬀort
most individuals expend to produce fluent speech is due, in
part, to increasing psychomotor eﬃciency—that is, better motor
execution using fewer brain resources.65 For novices (i.e., very
young children and adults learning a new language), limitations
in speech motor performance are most evident when capacity
is stressed under increased processing demands. In the case of
PWS, we speculate that these demands may disrupt the timing
and sequencing of neural representations of articulatory move-
ment commands (i.e., motor programs) to the speech muscles.
To this point, some scientists have posited that PWS may reside
on the lower end of a spectrum of speech motor skills.66
The functioning of speech-language processes in PWS may be
indistinguishable to people who do not stutter under optimal
conditions; however, PWS may exhibit a "fragile" speech motor
system that breaks down under environmental stressors. This
dynamic would account for the multileveled disruptions across
neural and physiological processes described in this chapter.
This dynamic would also be consistent with multifactorial theo-
ries of developmental stuttering and therapeutic approaches
that aim to increase capacities and reduce demands in children
who stutter.4,67
Second, empirical research of neural and physiological proc-
esses supports the view that developmental stuttering may be
a disorder of dysfunction within the basal ganglia-thalamo-
cortical motor circuit.3,68 This includes brain areas whose func-
tion includes the appropriate timing and initiation of speech
sounds (or motor programs), which are then driven by the
motor cortex to motor neuron pools in the brainstem, and then
to the articulatory muscles. The potential instability of the
speech motor system in PWS, even when perceptually fluent
and revealed during articulation (see Level 2), may be related to
how speech motor programs were learned in early childhood.4
More specifically, a model of speech sound sequencing related
to the DIVA model, the Gradient Order Directions Into Velocities
of Articulators (GODIVA; see ▶Chapter 2), proposes that a lack
of white matter integrity within the basal ganglia-thalamo-
cortical motor circuit may hinder the appropriate timing and
sequencing of motor programs.69 Interestingly, the produced
acoustic output from computational simulations of such a brain
deficit is similar to some stuttering disfluencies.70
Third, empirical research of neural and physiological proc-
esses supports the view that developmental stuttering may be a
neurodevelopmental and multifactorial disorder. Neurodeve-
lopmental disorders reflect atypical growth processes in the
brain and are represented by individuals with autism spectrum
disorder, fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome, dyslexia, de-
velopmental language disorder, and developmental stuttering.71
Across the multiple levels of neurophysiological processes
explored, a consistent finding is that (1) PWS are a very hetero-
geneous population, (2) stuttering behaviors can change in an
individual both suddenly and sometimes over years of exhibit-
ing the disorder, and (3) some of these changes in young
children represent neurodevelopmental trajectories toward re-
covery or persistence. Thus, there is a need to understand both
the nature of risk factors for persistence and the mechanisms
by which they may be related to stuttering in young children.
Stuttering is thought by some to emerge from a complex combi-
nation of factors (e.g., motor, linguistic, emotional) and their
interactions that ultimately lead to breakdowns in speech-
motor processes and speech fluency (i.e., it is multifactorial).
5.7.2 Treatment Implications and
Future Directions
Current and future research in neural and physiological proc-
esses may contribute to the innovation of new treatments that
target excitation or inhibition of key brain areas (e.g., IFG, pre-
motor cortex, motor cortex, supplementary motor area, supra-
marginal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus) in stuttering.
Understanding the precise characteristics of the neurophysiol-
ogy of developmental stuttering can yield causal insights into
speech disfluencies and lead to a new generation of neuromo-
dulation treatments for PWS. Noninvasive neuromodulation
techniques, such as transcranial electrical stimulation or trans-
cranial magnetic stimulation, alter nerve activity by applying
electrical stimulation to the brain, spinal cord, nerves, or
muscles. Although neuromodulation applications for develop-
mental stuttering have not been extensively studied, there is
some evidence to suggest that focal stimulation may improve
speech fluency as a stand-alone treatment or in combination
with behavioral techniques.72,73,74 Such treatments may reduce
stuttering severity and/or increase chances for recovery in chil-
dren and facilitate more eﬀective compensatory brain activity
to alleviate stuttering disfluencies in adults. Future studies may
also use transcranial alternating current stimulation to boost
EEG activation at targeted frequencies (see Section "Level 4:
Electrocortical Activation") to enhance brain activity associated
with speech-motor processes. However, more research studies
and ethical deliberation are needed to determine if these treat-
ments are appropriate for children.
The most salient characteristic of developmental stuttering
is, of course, the occurrence of stuttering disfluencies during
speech production. If, as we suggest, these disfluencies repre-
sent disruptions in speech motor programming that result from
interactions between neural systems for cognitive, linguistic,
and emotional processes, it makes sense that some PWS may
exhibit atypical abilities in these nonmotoric domains. As
revealed in ▶Chapters 4 and 6, PWS often demonstrate diﬃcul-
ties in executive function (e.g., working memory), linguistic
processes, and emotion regulation. Considerable work has been
done to understand how these processes may aﬀect the speech
motor systems of PWS, as described in Level 2. Still, much work
remains to better understand the multitude of variables that
contribute to stuttering, especially at the individual level. Speech
is a complex and highly variable phenomenon and understand-
ing the neural and physiological processes that aﬀect, or are
aﬀected by, this disorder requires much ingenuity and persever-
ance among professionals with wide-ranging expertise who are
dedicated to helping individuals with developmental stuttering.
For example, research into the neurophysiology of stuttering has
expanded beyond speech science and speech-language pathol-
ogy, with new lines of research focusing on computational
models, genetics/genomics (see ▶Chapter 3), pharmacology
(see ▶Chapter 15), and animal modeling.70,75,76,77
Stuttering severity is often exacerbated in situations of high
stress or when cognitive or linguistic complexity is high. These
intertangled processes may stem from the atypical interaction
Neural and Physiological Processes
74

of complex neurophysiological systems. The previously dis-
cussed research findings demonstrate that stuttering is likely a
multifactorial problem. Neurophysiological research in stutter-
ing often focuses on specific brain areas or systems. However,
there is still a lack of large-scale studies that compare speech
and nonspeech brain functions in PWS and fluent speakers.
Furthermore, to better understand speech production in stut-
tering, future studies should use a whole-brain analysis or a
combination of neurophysiological research methods to reveal
diﬀerences at multiple levels (e.g., articulatory, neuromuscular,
electrocortical, etc.). For example, combining EEG/ERP and fMRI
methods would provide an analysis of both electrocortical and
neural activation of the brain simultaneously.
Another important issue that needs to be addressed is the
relation between neurophysiological abnormalities and how
they may change over time. As discussed earlier, neurophysiolog-
ical diﬀerences are evident in childhood; however, most findings
rely on cross-sectional studies where data are collected at a given
moment in time. It is still unclear whether these abnormalities
persist in the long term and which play a role in recovery versus
persistence. Longitudinal studies that track the development of
children who stutter are likely to reveal more insights into the
maturation processes in stuttering and its recovery.
5.8 Conclusion
The purpose of this chapter was to provide the reader with an
overview of the neural and physiological processes that are
associated with stuttering. Of course, there are disagreements
among
neuroscientists,
speech
scientists,
speech-language
pathologists, and other researchers on the exact nature of stut-
tering neurophysiology. This is the dynamic nature of science,
especially when trying to understand the complexity of human
social behavior of which stuttering is a part. Still, our knowl-
edge of the neural and physiological basis of stuttering is
increasing faster than ever before, with theoretical perspec-
tives moving away from simple, univariate, homogeneous
explanations to those that are more complex, multifactorial,
and heterogeneous.
Revealing every scientific finding concerning neural and
physiological processes is beyond the scope of this chapter,
but we hope that this summary has shown that stuttering
behaviors extend beyond the perceptible moments, such as
stuttering disfluencies. Beyond the surface are a multitude of
neural processes underlying speech, language, cognition, and
emotion that contribute to the disorder, processes that may
not be evident using behavioral measures alone. In our view, it
is not adequate to simply say that stuttering is a "mystery" or
that the "cause of stuttering is unknown." Rather, we believe
that stuttering disfluencies may result from aberrant timing
and sequencing of neural representations for speech within
the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor circuit and interac-
tions between linguistic, cognitive, and emotional neural
systems. Because of the dynamic, multifactorial, and complex
nature of the disorder, stuttering behaviors may be dependent
on the specific characteristics and capacities of the individual
within their environment. For the clinician, understanding the
neurophysiological bases of developmental stuttering may
elucidate the development of the disorder, the likelihood of
recovery or persistence, and the potential for neuroplastic
changes with treatment. Future advances in the treatment of
developmental stuttering are likely to be influenced by new
knowledge of its neural and physiological basis.

6 Temperamental and Emotional Processes
Robin Jones, Kurt Eggers, and Hatun Zengin-Bolatkale
Abstract
The purpose of this chapter is to describe and discuss temper-
amental and emotional processes that are associated with
developmental stuttering. In doing so, the chapter will provide
a definition, brief history, and broad overview of tempera-
ment, as well as emotional reactivity and regulation processes,
serving as the foundation for readers to better understand the
relation between these processes and stuttering. Building on
this foundation, the chapter will review empirical evidence
and theoretical perspectives on the role of temperamental and
emotional processes in developmental stuttering along with
potential clinical considerations for assessment and treatment.
At the outset, it should be noted that while this chapter
is designed to cover the lifespan, it will primarily focus on
children because this age range has been studied the most
with regard to temperamental and emotional processes.
Keywords: stuttering, fluency disorder, temperament, emotion,
regulation
6.1 Brief Overview of
Temperament and Emotional
Processes
6.1.1 Temperament
Historical Perspective on Temperament
The construct of temperament has been considered throughout
history. The ancient Greeks, for example, used a temperament
model to explain behavioral characteristics. According to this
view, behavior was the result of biological diﬀerences in bodily
fluids, referred to as the four humors (blood, yellow bile, black
bile, and phlegm). Individual diﬀerences in behavior resulted
from the balance or imbalance of these humors, leading to four
behavioral types: melancholic (sad), choleric (irritable), san-
guine (optimistic), and phlegmatic (calm; ▶Fig. 6.1). Thus,
according to this typology, individual diﬀerences in behavior
were linked to underlying physiological mechanisms.1 Recent
studies on the biological basis of temperament, showing the
relation between emotions and the endocrine system,2,3 have
provided support for this ancient conceptualization.
Depiction of Temperamental Typologies
In the 20th century, there was renewed interest in studying
temperament. Some researchers tried to explain individual dif-
ferences in terms of physiological constructs, based on a wide
range of empirical studies,4 whereas others concentrated on
maturational aspects, which supported the role of heredity,
separate from environmental influences.5 In the latter half of
the 20th century, the nature-versus-nurture debate emerged
in response to increased emphasis on individual diﬀerences
in behavior. Scholars who supported the nature perspective
argued that individual diﬀerences were a product of genetics
and biology, whereas those who embraced the nurture point of
view stressed the importance of early environmental influences
on behavior.6 Both, however, acknowledged that the behavioral
expression of temperament characteristics is influenced by
situational factors.
During the last few decades, temperament has been concep-
tualized in diﬀerent ways, depending on the perspective of the
researchers. For example:
●Thomas and Chess viewed temperament as representing
individual diﬀerences in behavior (e.g., activity level,
attentional characteristics, adaptability, mood, approach/
withdrawal).7
●Buss and Plomin defined temperament as diﬀerences in
emotionality, activity, and sociability.8
●Goldsmith and Campos characterized temperament from an
emotion-oriented point of view—namely, individual
diﬀerences in the experience and expression of emotions,
such as distress, fear, anger, sadness, pleasure, and surprise.9
●Kagan's concept of temperament referred to inherited
behavioral and biological profiles that underlie reaction
patterns, primarily focusing on inhibited (e.g., shy, reserved,
timid) and uninhibited (e.g., social, spontaneous, low fear)
temperaments.2
Although some of these conceptualizations focus mainly or even
exclusively on emotion-oriented traits and others on behavioral

types. Source: Image created by Lucia Fabiani.

style, they are similar in that they all refer to characteristics in
which individuals diﬀer.
Contemporary Perspective on Temperament
At present, most theorists agree that temperament refers to bi-
ologically based individual diﬀerences that are relatively stable
over time, and appear early in development.10 Recent models
further acknowledge that temperament develops over time,11,12
incorporates motivational and self-regulatory systems,13 and is
influenced by environmental interactions.14,15
Rothbart's temperament model, which defines temperament
as constitutionally based individual diﬀerences in reactivity
and self-regulation, has gained much popularity among child-
oriented researchers.12,16 Reactivity refers to the arousability of
physiological and sensory response systems (e.g., getting frus-
trated about something), and self-regulation are processes that
can modulate (facilitate or inhibit) one's reactivity (e.g., shifting
one's attentional focus away from the frustrating stimulus).
Constitutional refers to the biological basis of temperament
(i.e., it is something you are born with), which is influenced
over time by genetics, maturation, and experience. In other
words, the temperament structure changes over time, from a
predominantly reactivity-driven concept in infants to a struc-
ture with more emphasis on self-regulatory processes in older
children. For example, when infants are distressed, they will
cry, much to the dismay of their parents; older children, on
the other hand, can deal with distress using a broader range of
tools, such as shifting their attention away from that which
they find distressing.17
Rothbart12 developed a framework specifying the role and
interactional patterns of reactivity and self-regulation (▶Fig. 6.2).
When a child is confronted with a stimulus, this stimulus might
lead to positive (e.g., smiling) or negative (e.g., fear, anger) reac-
tivity within the child. As the child grows older, he or she will
be able to consciously (hence the term "eﬀort" in the figure)
modulate this reactivity by using self-regulation processes to
increase positive reactivity and/or decrease negative reactivity.
Note that an increase in positive reactivity does not necessa-
rily correspond with a decrease in negative reactivity and vice
versa. Children can, for example, become less fearful without
smiling and laughing. Self-regulation processes include execu-
tive attention variables (e.g., consciously driven attention
shifting) and eﬀortful control (the ability to inhibit a dominant
[motor] response in order to perform a subdominant response,
detect errors, and engage in planning).18

regulation framework. Children with more positive reactivity and strong self-regulation skills may become excited and approach the door when the
doorbell rings. On the other hand, children with negative reactivity and strong self-regulation skills may stand behind mom when the doorbell rings.

6.1 Brief Overview of Temperament and Emotional Processes
79

Positive and negative reactivities are expressed via somatic
(e.g., facial expressions), autonomic (e.g., increase in heart rate),
cognitive (e.g., alerting), and neuroendocrine (e.g., cortisol re-
lease) reactions and can be experienced as pleasure or distress.
When the intensity of the stimulus is high, children who are
more prone to react negatively will experience greater distress,
whereas children who are less likely to react negatively will ex-
perience feelings of pleasure. These reactions (i.e., somatic,
autonomic, cognitive, and neuroendocrine) do not follow the
same time course:19 cognitive reactions may be initiated within
a few milliseconds, whereas neuroendocrine reactions take
anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.12
Children have diﬀerent levels of reactivity—some react with
more intense feelings of distress or pleasure, whereas others
react more mildly. Children also diﬀer in the ease with which
they are able to apply attentional (e.g., looking toward [atten-
tional orienting] or away from [attentional shifting] an exciting
or distressing event) and motor control processes (e.g., self-
soothing by thumb sucking) to regulate their reactivity.12,20
Self-regulation is triggered by the positive or negative reactions
experienced by a child (e.g., negative reactivity elicits withdrawal,
while positive reactivity elicits approach) and by stimulus charac-
teristics (such as high vs. low intensity). These self-regulatory
processes will, in turn, modulate (facilitate or inhibit) reactiv-
ity, showing a bidirectional relationship between these two
processes.
6.1.2 Measurement of Temperament
Since there is no consensus among researchers as to how tem-
perament should be defined, there is no commonly accepted
view of how temperament should be measured.1 Several
approaches have been used to measure temperament in chil-
dren, including caregiver/parent questionnaires and surveys,
self-reports for older children, (semi-) structured interviews,
home observational measures and laboratory measures, and
psychophysical and psychophysiological measures. Every method
has its relative advantages and disadvantages,21,22 which
underscores the benefit of using multiple approaches to assess
temperament (▶Table 6.1).
Rothbart et al developed a set of validated temperament
questionnaires (caregiver report or self-report depending on
age group), such as the Children's Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ)
16 aimed at 3- to 7-year-old children. The CBQ consists of 15
scales (▶Table 6.2), clustering under the three broad dimen-
sions of Rothbart's temperament model, labeled as extraver-
sion/surgency (or positive reactivity), negative aﬀectivity (or
negative reactivity), and eﬀortful control (or self-regulation). As
we describe later, these measures have been used in the empiri-
cal study of developmental stuttering and can also be used in
the clinical assessment of stuttering.
Temperament plays an important role in the experience and
expression of emotions such as distress, fear, anger, sadness,
pleasure, and surprise. How easily does a child get frustrated?
How does a child respond to frustration? Does he or she use
physical aggression, cry, or seek help? Temperament relates to
children's in-the-moment emotional states, and their emotional
states determine their behavior. Therefore, it is important to
investigate emotions, emotional reactivity and regulation, and
how they relate to behavior.
6.1.3 Emotion
Emotions are critical for survival and adaptation as they
motivate human behavior. Although there is no consensus on
a single definition, the present most widely accepted view is
that emotions are neurally based aﬀective states that involve
conscious experience and overt or internal physical responses
that facilitate or inhibit behaviors.
Historical theories are important for our present understand-
ing of emotions as they guide how the empirical work in the
field of psychology has been conducted in the past century. In
this section, we will briefly discuss some of the more promi-
nent ones, including the James-Lange theory and Papez circuit.
According to the James-Lange theory, which was developed in
the 19th century, emotions result from changes in physiological
arousal.23 For example, when we see a snake while out hiking,
our pupils will dilate, our heart rate will go up, and we will start
running away. These physiological changes lead to the subjec-
tive experience of fear.
Considerable progress has been made in the field of psychol-
ogy after Papez improved and expanded on the earlier theories
and proposed a set of structures, known as the "Papez circuit,"
that are responsible for the emotional experience.24 Papez
suggested that sensory input concerning emotional stimuli is
transmitted from the thalamus into two streams: the upstream
("thought stream") and the downstream ("feeling stream"). The
upstream directs the sensory input to the parts of the brain that
transform the sensation into perceptions, thoughts, and memo-
ries. The downstream conveys the sensory input to the body for
emotional expression.24,25
Researchers also started taking cognitive interpretations into
consideration in the emotional experience after Schachter and
Singer26 proposed that emotions involved two key components:
physiological arousal and cognitive label. For example, if you
saw a burglar enter your home, your heart rate would begin to
race, and you might start to sweat. This physiological response,
however, can also occur in other situations, such as when you
catch sight of someone you are in love with. So, why do you
experience fear when you see the burglar and not happiness?
The answer, according to Schachter and Singer, is that your
brain must also determine why the physiological arousal is

occurring—that is, a cognitive label must be applied to the situ-
ation (e.g., "the burglar is scary"). It is the cognitive label that
determines which emotion is experienced.25
Current theories of emotion propose that multiple compo-
nents are involved: physiological changes, feelings and thoughts,
and expressive behavior (▶Fig. 6.3). Therefore, the American
Psychological Association defines emotion as "a complex reac-
tion pattern, involving experiential, behavioral, and physiological
elements."27 Emotional arousal to external stimuli can result in
significant physiological changes in the body such as increased
heart rate, increased sweating, and pupil dilation. Emotional
arousal (i.e., reactivity) also involves feelings and thoughts about
the impact of the external stimuli (e.g., perceiving it as a reward
or punishment) and how it makes us feel depending on the
context (e.g., anxious, threatened, thrilled, nervous, etc.).
Apart from physiological changes, emotional arousal can also
result in overt behavioral responses such as running, freezing,
or facial responses such as frowning, smiling, and grimacing.
Types of Emotions
There has been much debate in the psychology literature over
the classification of emotions. The two major models used to
classify the types of emotions are dimensional models and cate-
gorical models. Dimensional models categorize emotions based
on two or three dimensions. Schlosberg28 and colleagues, for
instance, suggested that emotions are defined according to three
dimensions: (1) pleasantness-unpleasantness, (2) level of activa-
tion/arousal (sleep-tension), and (3) acceptance-rejection. For
example, "disgust" and "depressed" are both unpleasant emo-
tions that diﬀer in level of activation/arousal (depressed is closer
to "sleep" and disgust is closer to "tension") and acceptance-
rejection (depressed is closer to "acceptance" and disgust is closer
to "rejection").29
Categorical models of emotions are based on discrete emo-
tion theory, which proposes that there is a set of basic emotions
that are universally experienced by all humans: anger, disgust,
fear, sadness, happiness, and surprise.30 All other emotions
experienced result from various combinations of these emo-
tions. These basic emotions are not only cross-cultural but
are observed in other animals as well. Categorical models also
posit that emotions and dimensions of temperament and per-
sonality traits are highly related to each other.31 Further, it is
proposed that each of the basic emotions impacts cognition32
(e.g., executive functions, thoughts) and behavior in particu-
lar ways and individual diﬀerences in "emotion thresholds"

At present, it is widely accepted that both models of catego-
rizing emotions contribute to understanding and studying emo-
tions, and the adoption of one of these models does not negate
the other.34 Further, although there is abundant evidence to
support the existence of cross-cultural emotions, it is also
acknowledged that certain emotions are influenced by cultural
norms and practices. For example, for people who grew up in
America, happiness is a high-arousal positive emotional state,
while people who grew up in China tend to associate happiness
with low-arousal positive emotional states, feeling solemn, and
reserved.35
Emotional Development and Regulation
An important concept regarding emotion relates to regulation.
Emotion regulation, also referred to as self-regulation, relates to
"the ways individuals influence which emotions they have,
when they have them, and how they experience and express
these emotions" (p.557).36 There are several ways emotions
can be regulated. Some of the most popular emotional regula-
tion strategies are (1) the cognitive-linguistic strategy, which
involves reappraising a stimulus or condition in a diﬀerent/
more positive light; (2) the suppression of negative emotions
and reduction of associated physiological and behavioral reac-
tivity; and (3) distraction, which refers to directing attention
away from emotional stimuli.
The successful use of these emotional regulation strategies is
highly dependent on age and maturation,37 given that they
depend on the development of the prefrontal cortex, executive
function skills (e.g., inhibitory control),38 and linguistic skills.39
The use of the cognitive-linguistic strategy tends to appear at
around 5 years of age; infants and toddlers rely more on distrac-
tion and social support from others.40 Preschool-age children use
simple regulation strategies such as suppression, while children
older than 5 years of age use the cognitive-linguistic strategy,
which further develops with increasing age.37 Between childhood
and adulthood, during mid-adolescence, there is a temporary
decline in the use of advanced emotion regulation strategies, such
as cognitive-linguistic strategy and social support seeking, and
more reliance on suppression and dysfunctional rumination.41
This is thought to be associated with greater emotional instability
due to intense neurological and hormonal changes, greater
desire to please peers, and increased conflicts with parents.42
For example, when dealing with sadness or anger, adolescents
might be less likely to choose an adaptive emotion regulation
strategy, such as social support seeking, due to their perceived
lack of support from their family or their desire to maintain a
strong, positive social image among peers. Further, there are
significant gender diﬀerences in the development of emotion
regulation, with females being more likely to successfully use
various emotion regulation strategies earlier than males.37,41
Measurement of Emotions
Although there are plenty of standardized measures available
for the assessment of cognitive and linguistic skills, emotional
measures are relatively scarce. The measurement of emotions
in children is significantly more challenging than assessment in
adults. Nevertheless, a growing base of evidence and advances
in technology has enabled emotions to be measured from
infancy through adulthood. Given the multidimensional and
complex nature of emotions, various methods have been used
to measure emotions—namely, self-report measures, behavior
observations, and psychophysiology.43

Self-report measures in the form of paper-and-pencil or online
surveys or interviews are used to assess emotional traits (i.e.,
dispositions) or states,44 such as subjective experiences, thoughts,
and feelings. Self-report measures have good face validity and are
cheaper and easier to administer than other methods. However,
they also require a high level of self-awareness, which may be dif-
ficult for young children, and depend on the individual's ability
and willingness to truthfully and openly report their emotional
experiences.45 Another method of assessing emotions is by
observing individuals' nonverbal behaviors such as their vocal
characteristics (e.g., higher levels of arousal has been associated
with higher-pitched voice),46 body movements and gestures (e.g.,
greater pride associated with bigger and more expansive body
posture and movements),47 and facial expressions (e.g., coding
emotions based on anatomical landmarks and associated muscle
movements such as raising of the eyebrows, upward movement of
the lips, etc.).48 Behavioral observations can be particularly useful
when participants are not able or willing to report their emotional
experiences, but they can be impractical and expensive, as well as
time-consuming.44
It has become increasingly popular to measure emotions via
psychophysiology, such as measurement of autonomic and cen-
tral nervous system activity. The autonomic nervous system is
primarily responsible for the "fight or flight" response and it
consists of sympathetic (responsible for activation/reactivity)
and parasympathetic (responsible for relaxation/regulation)
activity.43,44 As discussed earlier, the brain is responsible for both
somatic arousal and emotional experience. Therefore, measuring
central nervous system activity43 using tools such as electroence-
phalography and neuroimaging is getting increasingly popular.
For an example of the experimental setup for the psychophysio-
logical measurement of emotion, see ▶Fig. 6.4.
Psychophysiological measures of emotion can provide objective,
stable, and reliable information. They are particularly useful when
an individual is not able or willing to openly provide accurate
representations of their emotional experience. However, like
behavioral observations, these methods can also be impractical,
time-consuming, and expensive.
6.1.4 Role of Temperament and
Emotion
Temperament exerts an important influence on the child's
social-emotional development, personality development, and
family system.49 It also has a profound eﬀect on the way in
which children interact with their environments.50 First, a
child's temperament shapes how other people in the environ-
ment react to them. Children high in negative emotions, for
example, tend to evoke more negative parental attempts to
exert control, whereas extraverted, self-controlled children are
more likely to elicit parental warmth.51 Second, environmental
experiences are interpreted by children in diﬀerent ways
depending on their temperament. For example, children who
are high in anger/frustration tend to perceive negative events
in their lives as more threatening compared to children with
lower levels of negative emotions. Temperament traits can also
make some life outcomes more or less likely to occur. For exam-
ple, children who are more inhibited have a somewhat greater
chance of developing social anxiety or depression, while
children who are high in eﬀortful control tend to develop more
social competence and are less likely to develop behavior
problems.51,52
To better understand the relation between temperament and
emotions, consider the following analogy: emotions are to tem-
perament as weather is to seasons. We expect more rainy or
stormy weather during winter, whereas summer typically
brings forth more bright and sunny weather. Accordingly, we
would expect children who have temperament profiles of high
anger/frustration (i.e., negative aﬀectivity; winter) to be more
likely to experience emotional outbursts (i.e., rain and storms)
than those who exhibit temperament profiles associated with
extraversion/surgency (i.e., positive aﬀectivity; summer).
6.2 The Association between
Temperamental and Emotional
Processes and Developmental
Stuttering
To date, there have been several reviews of the relation between
temperament, emotions, and developmental stuttering.53,54,55
For a broad overview of the main "takeaways" from these
reviews, see ▶Table 6.3. Notably, each review concluded that
there is likely an association between temperamental and
emotional processes and developmental stuttering, although
the exact nature of this association is less than clear. Since
these reviews were published, more studies have been con-
ducted, the results of which are briefly described below. We
begin with a discussion of the findings of studies that have
compared people who stutter to people who do not stutter,
with a specific focus on young children. We then discuss
research on the association of temperamental and emotional
processes with stuttering frequency and severity (i.e., the
behavior of stuttering) within people who stutter. These two lines
of investigation provide multiple points of view on the potential
contributions of temperamental and emotional processes to
stuttering and have implications for clinical management, as
discussed in the Section "Theoretical and Clinical Implications."

6.2 The Association between Temperamental and Emotional Processes and Developmental Stuttering
83

6.2.1 Diﬀerences between People
Who Stutter and People Who Do Not
Stutter
The main findings of studies that have examined emotional
reactivity and regulation in people who do and do not stutter,
based on data from caregiver reports and behavioral and psy-
chophysiological measures, are shown in ▶Table 6.4. To date,
findings pertaining to reactivity have indicated that young
children who stutter, compared to young children who do not
stutter, may be more emotionally reactive and exhibit more
negative emotions.56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63 These processes may also
be associated with persistence.64,65 Relative to regulation, a
growing body of studies have demonstrated that children who
stutter have lower emotion regulation than children who do
not stutter58,60,66 as well as diﬃculties in the processes that sup-
port regulation, such as shifting/focusing attention and inhibi-
tory control.56,58,67,68,69,70 Therefore, while there is no perfect
consensus (i.e., several studies71,72 have not found group diﬀer-
ences), there is a growing body of evidence to suggest salient
diﬀerences between children who stutter and children who do
not stutter in temperamental and emotional processes, with
children who stutter having increased reactivity and more diﬃ-
culty with regulation.
Emerging research on temperament and emotion in adults
has demonstrated lower positive aﬀect scores in adults who
stutter than those who do not.73 Physiological processes
have been studied in the adult population with mixed
results. Some studies have indicated that adults who stutter
exhibit increased reactivity,74 while others have reported no
diﬀerences.75 During speaking tasks, adults who stutter have
demonstrated
less
marked
physiological
responses
than
adults who do not stutter.76,77,78 Although this may seem par-
adoxical, Alm79 argued that these findings may represent
"anticipatory anxiety resulting in a freezing response" prior
to and/or during speaking. As we mentioned at the outset,
there are fewer studies on temperament and emotion in
adults who stutter and further research is necessary to draw
more firm conclusions.
6.2.2 Association with Stuttering
Frequency and Severity
In addition to studying between-group diﬀerences, the study of
the association between stuttering behaviors and emotional
processes is of interest, given that it potentially links emotions
directly to moments of stuttering. ▶Table 6.5 provides an
overview of the findings from studies that have investigated
the relation between reactivity and regulation and stuttering
frequency and severity. Numerous studies have shown that
increased reactivity, both positive and negative, is associated
with increased stuttering frequency and/or stuttered utterances
(compared to fluent).57,78,80,81,82,83,84 In a similar vein, empirical
studies on regulation have found that decreased regulation
is associated with increased stuttering
frequency and/or
severity.59,85,86,87,88 Taken together, these findings provide
evidence that temperamental and emotional processes may
be importantly linked to stuttering, which may in turn impact
an individual's communication, thus providing motivation for
speech-language pathologists to consider these processes in
assessment and treatment.
6.2.3 Summary of Empirical Evidence
and Takeaways
As indicated by the above review, there is substantial evidence
to support an association between temperamental and emo-
tional processes and developmental stuttering. Taking the
broadest view, these can be summarized as follows: (1) children
who stutter, compared to children who do not stutter, may
exhibit increased reactivity and decreased regulation and (2)
increased reactivity and decreased regulation appear to be
associated with increased stuttering severity and/or frequency
for children who stutter. However, this broad view certainly
does not tell the whole story. There are areas for which there
are many studies and replicated findings (e.g., diﬀerences in
negative emotion and/or attention), other areas that are newly
emerging (e.g., cortical reactivity diﬀerences), and still others
where there are no diﬀerences or insuﬃcient evidence to make

a strong determination. Also, these findings apply to groups,
not individuals, an important consideration given that people
who stutter tend to be heterogeneous.64,89 Therefore, while
there have been many advancements since previous reviews on
this topic were published, continued study, replication, and
extension are necessary to develop a better understanding of
the nature of temperamental and emotional processes in devel-
opmental stuttering.
6.3 Theoretical and Clinical
Implications
6.3.1 Directionality of the Eﬀect
An often discussed and still unresolved issue regarding the con-
tributions of temperamental and emotional processes to devel-
opmental stuttering is that of the directionality of the eﬀect (for
a comprehensive discussion, see Conture et al90). Said another
way, are temperamental and emotional processes causal con-
tributors to developmental stuttering, or are diﬀerences in
these processes caused by experiences with stuttering? There
are several alternative possibilities as well. First, a bidirectional
relationship may exist whereby temperamental and emotional
processes contribute to stuttering, but experiences with stutter-
ing also influence an individual's temperament and/or emotional
responses. Second, temperament and emotion may be associated
with developmental stuttering by virtue of a "third-order"
variable, such as sex (e.g., more males stutter and males may be
more likely to exhibit certain temperamental characteristics).
Considering the nature of temperament—namely, that it is a
genetically influenced set of individual diﬀerences19,22,91—it
would seem unlikely that experiences with stuttering would be
solely responsible for diﬀerences in young preschool-age chil-
dren who do and do not stutter, as these children are close to
the age of stuttering onset and have relatively little experience
with stuttering.56,60,65,66 However, it also seems unlikely that
temperament and emotional processes would be completely
immune to experiences associated with stuttering. This is espe-
cially true for school-age children and adults who have been
stuttering for many years, a perspective that is generally sup-
ported by evidence of increased (speech-related and/or social)
anxiety in adolescents and adults who stutter.92,93 Therefore,
we suggest that a bidirectional association (i.e., temperament
and emotion impacting stuttering and vice versa) that varies by
the individual's characteristics is the most likely to be true, at
least based on our current understanding of the evidence.
6.3.2 Theoretical Implications
Conture and Walden's recent Dual Diathesis-Stressor Model
of Stuttering is arguably the most contemporary theoretical
account that includes temperament and emotion as potential
causal factors in developmental stuttering.94 Specifically, this
model suggests that some children who stutter have emotion-
related vulnerabilities (i.e., diathesis), such as heightened nega-
tive emotional reactivity and decreased regulation, that can be
activated by challenging environmental situations or events
(i.e., stressors) and that these processes contribute to the onset
and development of stuttering. Children who exhibit emotional
diatheses may be more likely to have their attention and other
cognitive
resources
diverted
during
emotionally
arousing
speaking situations (social-emotional stressor) and, conse-
quently, be more likely to stutter. These children may also be
more likely to react to diﬃculties with speech production, lead-
ing to a worsening of stuttering. Although temperament and
emotion are central in this model, the authors recognize the
heterogeneity of stuttering and specify that for some children
these processes may play little to no role in stuttering.
The Multifactorial Dynamic Pathways Theory of Stuttering by
Smith and Weber95 also posits that temperament and emotion
may play a key role in the onset, development, and/or persistence
of stuttering. This model focuses on the interaction between
speech-motor, linguistic, and emotional processes, emphasizing
the concurrent development of these processes over the period
when stuttering first emerges and pathways of persistence and
recovery are developing. They note that while the precise role of
temperament and emotion in the onset and development of
stuttering is not clear, one possibility is that negative emotion
related to speech disruption may further destabilize speech
motor performance, thereby contributing to stuttering.
In sum, this brief overview demonstrates how temperamen-
tal and emotional processes could potentially contribute to
stuttering. Some perspectives suggest that these processes play
a causal role (at least for some people who stutter) in the onset
and development of stuttering, whereas others suggest that
these processes may serve to worsen or exacerbate stuttering
caused by other factors (e.g., speech-motor, linguistic, etc.).
Regardless, there is significant justification to consider these
processes in comprehensive etiological accounts of develop-
mental stuttering.
6.3.3 Diagnostic Implications
Although speech disfluencies are the most characteristic symp-
tom of stuttering, the assessment of stuttering involves more
than these overt (behavioral) symptoms. Rather, covert aspects
of stuttering, such as underlying emotional and cognitive
reactions, and the impact that stuttering has on the client's
day-to-day functioning also need to be assessed. This is crucial
because behavioral symptoms may fluctuate (e.g., depending
on the situation), resulting in an (overt) stuttering severity
that may not fully capture the severity and impact of the disor-
der on the individual client.96
Covert symptoms refer to feelings and thoughts, such as high
levels of concern for listener reactions, fear of stuttering, frus-
tration when stuttering, anxiety related to specific speaking si-
tuations, and feelings of guilt and shame. These reactions to
stuttering often result in an increase in secondary behaviors, in-
cluding struggling, avoidance, or postponement. It is often as-
sumed that this mainly occurs with older clients and that young
children are not aware of their stuttering. The extent to which
children who stutter are aware of their stuttering and how they
emotionally react to it are highly variable;97 however, some
studies98,99 have shown that, prior to 3 years of age, children
may have some awareness that their speech is diﬀerent from
that of other children. Although some children may respond in
very subtle ways to their speech diﬃculty by withdrawing from
speaking or the speaking situation (e.g., very outgoing, talkative
at first but now much quieter, whispering), with only mild
Temperamental and Emotional Processes
86

noticeable emotional reactions, other children react more visi-
bly by becoming emotionally frustrated and demonstrating
struggle behaviors. The extent and nature of a child's response
to his or her stuttering is likely related to his or her tempera-
ment (e.g., see Manning100), since it plays a crucial role in
emotional regulation.
The assessment of a child who stutters should, therefore,
include the evaluation of aﬀective (feelings, emotions, etc.), behav-
ioral (tension, struggle, avoidance, etc.), and cognitive (thought
processes) reactions to stuttering. Understanding how a child
reacts in certain situations and how he or she regulates these
emotions provides the clinician and parents with important
insights into why their child may react strongly to moments
of stuttering and develop secondary behaviors and/or more
negative speech attitudes.
Assessing emotions and temperament can be done informally
during an interview, or more formally using surveys and ques-
tionnaires. For preschool children, an informal gathering of infor-
mation is based on parent interview, parent-child interaction,
and/or child-clinician interaction. See ▶Table 6.6 for example
interview questions probing emotional reactions and tempera-
ment. Those working with older children may choose to inter-
view the child directly, instead of or in addition to interviewing
parents, and possibly teachers as well. Although interviewing
has many advantages, it can be time-consuming and inconsistent
because parents vary in how much detail they provide when an-
swering questions. Parents may also present biased information
about their children and answer questions for social desirability.6
Parent-child or child-clinician interactions may overcome some
of these concerns, but they can also be very time-consuming and
limited in that they can only provide information about reactions
in the clinic, not other contexts.
Because of the limitations of interviews and observations,
more formalized procedures, such as surveys and question-
naires, have been developed, not only for the evaluation of the
client's beliefs and feelings about his stuttering101,102,103,104,105
but also for temperament.16,106 For example, the Communica-
tion Attitude Test for Preschool and Kindergarten Children
Who Stutter (KiddyCAT)103 is a questionnaire developed to
assess communication attitudes in preschool-age children
who stutter, and the Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Expe-
rience of Stuttering (OASES)107 measures similar constructs as
well as the functional and emotional "impact" of stuttering in
adults. As we have already mentioned, the CBQ16 is useful in
measuring temperament. There are also shorter versions of the
CBQ available, versions available for various age ranges (e.g.,
adults108), and alternative brief options (for an alternative
option, see Kristal6). The Short Behavioral Inhibition Scale
(SBIS) has recently been used to study temperament in young
children who stutter, is readily available, and easy to score,
representing a viable option to assess behavioral inhibition.109
6.3.4 Treatment Implications
Until the underlying mechanisms associated with tempera-
ment, emotions, and stuttering have been fully unraveled,
formulating treatment recommendations based on these
associations may be premature. However, several approaches
developed for working with children's temperaments6 are
applicable to children who stutter.110 Examples are strategies
for creating a better parent-child alliance such as anticipat-
ing how children will react in certain circumstances and
changing/adjusting environmental
contexts, or
providing
problem-solving/coping strategies (e.g., teaching parents to
co-regulate the child's emotions—in the case of limited frus-
tration tolerance, a parent may encourage a child to count
while waiting, think of something fun instead, or vent emo-
tions). In the past, some authors in the field of stuttering have
emphasized the importance of evaluating and improving
the child's vulnerabilities and reducing emotional stressors,
such as high expectations and sensitivity.111,112 More recent,
evidence-based approaches have described diﬀerent ways of
working with temperament and emotions in young children
who stutter.113,114 For example, clinicians can work on desen-
sitizing children to moments of stuttering, using problem-
solving strategies to decrease emotional arousal to stressors,
counseling and training parents to react appropriately to
stressors, and evaluating and changing parenting styles.
Druker et al115 demonstrated that training parents to improve
self-regulation in their children contributed to the successful
management of fluency and the emotional impacts of the
disorder.
Perhaps somewhat more speculative, but in line with find-
ings in other populations,116 temperament may impact treat-
ment outcomes. Preliminary data117 have shown that children
with more "expressive temperaments" (i.e., lower behavioral
inhibition) exhibited greater long-term decreases in stuttering
frequency following indirect treatment than children with less
"expressive temperaments" (i.e., higher levels of behavioral
inhibition).
Table 6.6 Example informal interview questions probing emotional reactions and temperament
A clinician probing a child's emotional reactions could ask the parent(s):
●"Has your child shown signs of being concerned or embarrassed about the way he speaks?"
●"Does he sometimes get frustrated when he cannot get the words out?"
●"Is he avoiding or acting fearful in certain speaking situations?"
A clinician probing to gain more insight into a preschool child's temperament could ask the parent(s):
●"Is he easily distracted by surrounding activities or can he get so focused on an activity that all else is blocked out?"
●"Is he more hesitant with new situations, people, or things—or does he dive right in, seeking out novelty?"
●"When he is building a tower with Lego blocks and it falls down, how does he react—does he persist and start building the tower again, does he ask
for help, or does he become angry and frustrated and quit if it is too difficult?"
●"If he is watching a cartoon and you ask him to turn off the TV because you have to go somewhere, can he easily do that and switch his attention to
putting on his shoes and jacket or does he have difficulty with that?"

6.4 Future Directions
As we have discussed, there have been significant advances in
our empirical, theoretical, and clinical understanding of the role
of temperamental and emotional processes in developmental
stuttering, especially over the past 10 years. As is often the case,
new research questions have emerged as well as areas of poten-
tial interest for clinical practice. Below, we briefly discuss some
of these research and clinically related future directions.
From a research perspective, researchers should use a
comprehensive, diverse multimethod approach for studying
temperamental and emotional processes in developmental
stuttering. Such an approach will advance our knowledge in
areas of empirical and theoretical interest. The following two
areas of research exemplify ongoing eﬀorts designed to further
our understanding of the link between temperament, emo-
tion, and developmental stuttering:
●One emerging research eﬀort that has begun to receive
attention is on emotion-related mechanisms that may help us
to understand how emotions and temperament contribute to
stuttering. For example, it has been speculated that changes
in emotional processes may impact the planning and
production (i.e., linguistic, cognitive, and speech-motor)
processes that are necessary for fluent speech. Research in
both young children118 and adults who stutter119,120,121,122 has
demonstrated that emotion impacts their speech-motor
processes to a greater degree than in similarly aged
nonstuttering participants. This emerging research is
important because it may lead to novel insights into the
mechanisms by which emotional processes contribute to
stuttering—advancing our understanding of the nature of
stuttering and development of treatment approaches.
●Another emerging area of research has focused on the
influence of temperamental and emotional processes on the
impact of stuttering and speech-related anxiety. Temperament
influences how children adapt to life20 and cope with
stressors,18 thereby impacting their overall well-being.123
Thus, it may come as no surprise that some studies have
shown that adolescents124,125 and adults73,126 who stutter
who exhibit more negative reactivity are not only more
anxious but also more impacted by their stuttering. In
contrast, adolescents who have more positive reactivity are
less impacted by their stuttering and have lower anxiety.
These studies, which demonstrate that temperament and
emotion may play a role in how individuals respond to
stuttering, have the potential to lead to advances in clinical
management. For example, techniques may be developed to
support the ability of individuals to better cope with
stuttering based on their unique temperament profile.
From a clinical perspective, clinicians should expect to see stud-
ies of temperament and emotions to continue to emerge in the
stuttering literature. As is always the case with new research,
clinicians should cautiously interpret these findings and care-
fully consider how best to apply, if at all, the results to practice.
From the authors' perspective, there are at least a few areas of
development that would significantly advance the translation
of research findings to clinical practice. First, it is imperative
that researchers continue to use methodological approaches
that can also be employed in the clinic—for example, using
caregiver report and behavioral measures in addition to psy-
chophysiological, neuroanatomical measures, etc.—because the
latter approaches are not readily accessible to most clinicians.
A comprehensive approach such as this will not only facilitate
our understanding of stuttering but also provide insight into
which clinically accessible measures relate to laboratory-based
approaches (physiology, neuroanatomy) and which do not.
Second, systematic assessment of individual diﬀerences and
subtypes in temperamental and emotional processes could
potentially yield significant advances to clinical practice. For
example, as has been speculated,54 some children may re-
spond diﬀerently to diﬀerent types of intervention based on
their temperamental profiles. Finally, future work should
strive to identify and develop guidelines for the application of
temperament- and emotion-related diagnostic and treatment
tools (e.g., establish cutoﬀs for high/low values of reactivity
and regulation) to facilitate their clinical utility and potential
for application.
6.5 Conclusions
In the 21st century, there have been significant advances to the
empirical study, theoretical understanding, and potential clini-
cal application of temperamental and emotional processes to
developmental stuttering. From 2000 to 2010, this work was
newly emerging and focused, almost predominantly, on care-
giver report of temperament. Beginning in 2010 and extending
to the present day, this work has focused on using a broad range
of methodological approaches to comprehensively study tem-
peramental and emotional processes in developmental stutter-
ing. Both past and present works have provided evidence to
suggest that increased reactivity and decreased regulation are
associated with developmental stuttering. Despite these advan-
ces, there are still many theoretical and empirical applications
that must be pursued to further our understanding of the role
of temperamental and emotional processes in developmental
stuttering and translate these advances to clinical practice.
6.6 Definitions
Arousal:
A state of physiological or psychological excitation in
response to an external or internal stimuli.
Attention regulation:
Attention regulation refers to the abil-
ity to self-monitor one's deployment of attention, which
includes maintaining attention, ignoring distracting or
irrelevant stimuli, staying alert to task goals, and coordi-
nating one's attention during a task.
Behavioral inhibition:
A term introduced by Kagan that refers
to a temperamental trait characterized by the tendency to
show reluctance, withdrawal, and fearfulness especially
when encountering novel situations, objects, or people.131
Eﬀortful
control
(or
self-regulation):
A
temperament
dimension indicated by the capacity to refrain from a desired
or dominant behavior while also maintaining attention on a
task and resisting distraction.
Emotion: Aﬀective states with neurological underpinnings
involving conscious experience. Emotions may lead to internal
or overt physical responses and they may inhibit or facilitate
behaviors.
Temperamental and Emotional Processes
88

Endocrine system:
The glands/organs that make hormones
and release them directly into the blood so they can travel
all over the body.
Extraversion/surgency (or positive reactivity):
A tempera-
ment dimension indicated by impulsivity, intense pleasure
seeking, high activity level, and low levels of shyness.
Negative aﬀectivity (or negative reactivity):
A temperament
dimension indicated by mood instability, angry reactivity,
and dysregulated negative emotions.
Parenting style:
The levels of expectations, performance
demands, attentiveness, and style of discipline parents use
in child rearing. Diﬀerent styles can lead to diﬀerent child
development and child outcomes.
Physiology: Functioning of the systems, organs, and tissues of
the body.
Psychophysiological measures:
Measures studying the rela-
tionship between physiological and psychological phenomena.
Reactivity:
Responsiveness to an external or internal stimuli.
Emotional reactivity may be experienced as internal physio-
logical states or overt physical responses.
Reappraisal:
Reinterpretation of internal or external stimuli
under a diﬀerent light.
Regulation: Changes that may be in the form of suppressing
(decreases) or intensifying (increases). Emotional regulation
refers to changes in the intensity, valence, or duration of
emotional activation for the internal emotional states or
physiological processes.
Rumination:
Negative perseverative thinking that can result
in emotional or physiological stress.
Somatic: Relating to or aﬀecting the body.
Suppression:
Downregulation,
reducing
the
intensity or
duration of emotional states or physiological responses.
Temperament: Constitutionally based individual diﬀerences in
reactivity and self-regulation.

Abstract
Stuttering, or childhood-onset fluency disorder, begins in early
childhood (between the age of 2 and 5 years) at a time when
children are rapidly growing and acquiring skills across speech,
language, social, motor, and emotional domains in multiple
contexts, most especially within the family. Parents and/or oth-
er caregivers play important roles in supporting their children's
development by providing models for verbal interactions and
support across domains, including communication in all its
complexities. In this chapter, we provide the rationales, quanti-
tative and qualitative methods and measures, decision-making
guidelines, and possible recommendations we would oﬀer in a
comprehensive assessment of preschool stuttering. Tools are
provided for analyzing speech disfluencies, interviewing and
obtaining questionnaire/survey data from parents/caregivers,
evaluating risk for stuttering persistence, interviewing children
about talking and stuttering, and discerning "next steps" for
each child and family based on the results of the assessment
process. Foundational to our methods is a focus on building
strong, supportive relationships and therapeutic alliances that
will best serve young children who stutter and their families
over the short and long-term. We encourage the reader to make
use of the tables, figures, and appendices in their own assess-
ments of preschoolers referred to them for stuttering.
Keywords: stuttering, assessment, preschool, children, fluency,
fluency disorder
7.1 Purpose
In this chapter, we provide guidelines for a comprehensive
assessment of stuttering, related communication skills and
challenges, and progress in other significant developmental
domains in young children referred for stuttering. Our methods
derive from a current understanding of childhood stuttering
and of overall child development within the family context.
We present methods for interviewing the child and parents/
caregivers, gathering information from surveys and question-
naires, and both making observations and conducting formal
testing with the child. Suggestions are provided for summarizing
and interpreting results to make relevant clinical diagnoses
and provide recommendations best suited to the child and
family.
7.2 Setting the Stage for Assessing
Preschoolers Who Stutter
7.2.1 Multidimensional Assessment of
a Multifactorial Disorder
As outlined in ▶Chapter 1 and expanded upon in subsequent
chapters, we know stuttering emerges early in childhood during
a period of rapid growth and development, with many factors
playing important roles in its onset, development, exacerbation,
persistence, and/or improvement.1 In general, we think of stut-
tering development as reflecting the interplay between genetic
predisposition and its interaction with experience and the envi-
ronment. Stuttering, genetics, experience, and environment
impact and are impacted by the emergence and developmental
course of the child's own skills and abilities (e.g., language,
speech production, speech motor, speech fluency, temperament,
social communication, etc.). In turn, the child develops within
the communicative contexts in which they live, learn, and grow
(i.e., the family, especially parents/caregivers, and the daily expe-
riences the child has at home, day care, or preschool).1,2,3
▶Fig. 7.1 broadly illustrates the factors that contribute to stutter-
ing in preschool children, suggesting that assessment likewise
warrants a multidimensional approach.
Each of these influences will be taken into consideration not
only as it relates to the initial appearance of stuttering but also
how it may contribute to stuttering that continues into adult-
hood (i.e., risk for persistence; see ▶Chapter 10 for more infor-
mation). Each variable will also be integrated into the content
of our assessments, resulting diagnoses, and recommendations
to parents/caregivers and other important interactants in child-
ren's communicative environments. Under each area are what
are commonly called the "ABCs" of stuttering:
●Aﬀective:
- Emotional makeup of the child and their responses.
●Behavioral:
- What a child who stutters does (e.g., [dis]fluencies) or does
not do (e.g., avoidances).
- What others do and/or do not do in response to the child's
stuttering.
●Cognitive:
- Thoughts and/or attitudes about stuttering and/or
communication, in general.4
The ABCs are used as a framework for the assessment process
and resulting diagnoses, and shape the recommendations for, and
goals and procedures of, any subsequent therapy (▶Fig. 7.1a).
▶Fig. 7.2 provides a general outline of the first portion of the
assessment process we use for preschoolers who are suspected of
stuttering.

7.3.1 Considering "Risk Factors" for
Persistent Stuttering
The accumulation of evidence over decades has helped us
better understand a number of variables that influence a
child's likelihood of natural recovery (i.e., recovery without
treatment) from stuttering versus a child's risk for continuing
to stutter over time (i.e., stuttering persistence). These have
95

been identified and explained in earlier chapters and later in
▶Chapter 10, and are among the variables we keep in mind
when assessing children, counseling parents/caregivers, and
making recommendations about "next steps" (e.g., monitor-
ing, reevaluation, treatment, etc.) for preschoolers who are
stuttering.5 To summarize (see ▶Chapter 10 for other detail),
the current state of our understanding of risk for stuttering
persistence indicates that children who are at risk for con-
tinuing to stutter are those who:
●are biological males.
●have a family history of stuttering (with some studies
suggesting a history of persistent stuttering of greater
import).6,7
●have been stuttering for more than a year.
●begin to stutter at or after the age of 3.5 years.
●exhibit a trajectory of stuttering that increases over time, fails
to decrease, or decreases initially but then continues at levels
higher than expected of nonstuttering children.
Further, we know that children who persist in stuttering are
more likely than children who recover to show delays, ineﬃ-
ciencies, and/or diﬀerences (from nonstuttering children) in
speech motor control (i.e., are more variable and imprecise),8
speech sound articulation (i.e., have less "clear" speech),9 lan-
guage comprehension and production (i.e., achieve lower scores
on standardized measures),10,11 speech/language processing
(i.e., show slower, less eﬃcient processing),12 and temperament
(i.e., exhibit poorer self-regulation, reactivity, and negative
aﬀect).13 Although the strength of evidence for individual risk
factors varies,14 ▶Table 7.1 provides a general checklist for
identification of risk-related variables that are important to
consider when evaluating stuttering and related speech, lan-
guage, and temperament variables in young children. Using this
checklist reminds us to consider the possible contributors to
and maintainers of a child's stuttering, which we will learn
more about by obtaining information from parents/caregivers
and the children themselves during the evaluation.

7.3.2 Assessing the Child
When children suspected to be stuttering are referred for an
evaluation, our first step is to "look at, listen to, and learn
about" the child's communication skills, abilities, and chal-
lenges, at the same time as we observe their verbal interactions
with parents or caregivers. We can learn a great deal about not
only their stuttering but also other aspects of their communica-
tion (e.g., speech sound production, expressive and receptive
language, social communication, speech motor structures and
functioning, etc.) and developmental attributes (e.g., tempera-
ment and, relatedly, behavior and attention, etc.) by observing
them interacting with parents/caregivers and with us. Thus, we
always begin our assessments by asking parents/caregivers and
the child (and sometimes siblings) to play and talk while we
observe and record our observations, collect related data, and
generate hypotheses about the child's strengths and challenges.
In addition, we always engage the child ourselves to help them
acclimate to us, the setting, and the assessment process, and to
gather valuable data about these same variables.

Collecting and Analyzing Speech Samples
As shown in ▶Fig. 7.1c, our initial sampling of the child's conver-
sational interactions with parents/caregivers (and/or with us)
provides information about the child's speech fluency, language,
speech sound production and speech motor skills, temperament
(including emotions, attitudes, attention, etc.), and social com-
munication abilities with reference to the ABCs of communica-
tion. Initially, we make notes about what we observe. ▶Table 7.2
includes some of the questions we ask ourselves, and the data
we collect at the beginning of our evaluation.
To begin, for many reasons we recommend that students and
practitioners take at least 3 to 5 minutes in this initial observa-
tion. First, unless we are looking at the child, we are likely to
miss subtle and not-so-subtle stuttering behaviors that the
child might exhibit (e.g., inaudible sound prolongations or
"blocks"; looking away, facial grimaces/tension, stopping or al-
tering talking; gesturing, carrying on undeterred, etc.). Second,
a child and/or the child's parents/caregivers may also exhibit
visible reactions to the child's stuttering (e.g., leaning in or
looking away when the child stutters, finishing the child's sen-
tences or waiting while the child finishes, frowning or smiling,
etc.). Third, while watching the child and parent interacting,
you will get a "feel" for the child's stuttering pattern, language
skills, speech sound production abilities, social communication,
and
temperament.
These
observations
might
include
the
following: whether the child is initially reluctant to talk and
warms up gradually; whether they monologue nonstop and/or
are oblivious to others and/or to their own stuttering; whether
the child tolerates mistakes in general, and/or with regard to
stuttering, or responds negatively to them; whether the child
stays with a task until completion in an age-appropriate manner,
or quickly changes focus and tasks as if "driven by a motor"; and
how the child responds to suggestions or corrections by a parent.
These observations allow us to generate initial hypotheses (e.g.,
whether or not the child stutters, exhibits articulation errors/
phonological patterns that interfere with the ability to be under-
stood, has an outgoing/uninhibited temperament, and/or has
language skills that appear at or above age-level expectations),
and guide our selection and sequencing of follow-up testing, sur-
vey/questionnaire administration, and interview procedures.
After the initial 5 minutes or so of looking, listening, and
learning, we begin to formally collect samples of the child's
conversation for analyses of disfluencies. Using a disfluency
count sheet (▶Fig. 7.3), adapted slightly from Conture15 and a
disfluency count summary chart (▶Fig. 7.4), we tally the fre-
quencies of stuttering-like disfluencies (SLDs), including Sound
or Syllable Repetitions (SSRs; e.g., "duh-duh-dog"), Monosyllabic
Whole-Word Repetitions (Mo-WWRs; e.g., "I-I-I"), Audible Sound
Prolongations (ASPs; e.g., "mmmmy"), and Inaudible Sound Pro-
longations or Blocks (ISPs; e.g., "...[silent pause]what"), as well
as non-stuttering-like disfluencies (NSLDs) including Multisyllabic
Whole-Word
Repetitions
(Mu-WWRs;
e.g.,
"wanna-wanna"),
Phrase Repetitions (PRs; e.g., "I can - I can"), Interjections (INTs;
e.g., "um"), and Revisions (REV; e.g., "I have - I want"). A sample
of at least 300 words or syllables of conversation is recommended
to capture natural variations occurring in the interactions
between the child and others. In general, an average/mean
frequency of 3 or more SLDs per 100 words or syllables (i.e., 3%
SLDs) is considered indicative of stuttering; however, no one
measure, such as frequency of SLDs, should be used in isolation
when making a diagnosis of stuttering.
Measuring the duration of SLDs is also recommended, as it
provides a more complete picture of a young child's stuttering.
For example, we are more concerned if a child prolongs a sound
for 2 seconds versus fleetingly, and/or if a child produces four
extra units, or iterations of repetition (e.g., "buh-buh-buh-buh-
ball") rather than one iteration of an SSR or Mo-WWR. Duration
measures may be obtained via stopwatch or timer (e.g., on a
smartphone), and by making note of the number of iterations
(i.e., extra units of repetition) a child produces during SSRs
and Mo-WWRs produced during speaking (e.g., "I-I-I" has two
iterations). An important index of duration as well as stuttering
severity is the weighted SLD that takes into consideration the
average number of iterations of SSRs and Mo-WWRs and the
average frequency of ISPs/blocks and ASPs. The formula for
calculating the weighted SLD is the following:
[(SSRs+ MoWWRs) × average no. of iterations of SSRs/MoWWRs]
+ [(2× (ISPs + ASPs)].
It is recommended to include at least 10 instances of SSRs and/or
MoWWRs when calculating the average number of iterations.
Duration measures are included in several commercially
available stuttering assessment tools, as well. For example, the
average duration of the three longest SLDs a child produces are

required components of the Stuttering Severity Instrument,
4th edition (SSI-4).16 The SSI-4 combines data on stuttering
frequency, duration, and physical concomitants (i.e., nonspeech
behaviors associated with moments of stuttering) that equate to
a severity rating. Data are gathered from speaking and, when
appropriate, reading, including the average frequency of per-
cent syllables stuttered, average duration of the three longest
SLDs, and evidence of physical concomitants (i.e., distracting
sounds, facial grimaces, head movements, and/or movement of
the extremities). Likewise, a judgment of the frequency with
which the child repeats a sound or syllable more than once is
made when an observer (e.g., parent/caregiver, teacher, speech-
language pathologist [SLP]) completes the Test of Childhood
Stuttering Observational Rating Scales (TOCS ORS; see the sec-
tion "Obtaining Parent/Caregiver Input" later in the chapter for
more information).17

We also make note of any signs of visible tension/struggle or
physical concomitants (e.g., eye blinking, head nodding, press-
ing lips together, craning the neck, etc.) that may accompany
SLDs, and any other information that paints a more comprehen-
sive picture of the child's stuttering (e.g., stops talking when
stuttering or continues talking whether stuttering or not).
Observations about parent/caregiver responses are also noted
(e.g., whether eye contact is maintained, corrections are oﬀered
[e.g., slow down, take your time, take a deep breath, etc.],
empathy is provided [e.g., that's okay, I'm listening], turn taking
is positive [e.g., minimizes talking for or "over" the child],
language is contingent [e.g., responds to the content of the
child's utterances], etc.).
Formal Assessment: Speech Sound Production,
Language, Speech Motor, Temperament and
Social Communication Skills
Referring back to the questions in ▶Table 7.2, observation of
initial conversational interactions also allows us to note any
speech sound production errors and related error patterns, and
to evaluate the child's speech intelligibility (i.e., ability to be
understood by others). Informal observations of the child's
receptive (i.e., comprehension or understanding) and expressive
(i.e., production or expression) language abilities, social interac-
tions (e.g., reciprocal conversational exchanges, engagement,
etc.), speech motor skills, and temperament (e.g., shy/inhibited,
outgoing/uninhibited, fast or slow to warm up, etc.) are also
noted.
▶Table 7.3 contains examples of more formalized assessment
tools that may be used to ascertain the child's stuttering,
language, speech sound production, speech motor structure/
function, and temperament (including behavior and attention).
Given the potential risk factors for stuttering persistence as pre-
viously outlined (see ▶Table 7.1), we suggest inclusion of one
or more screening or full-scale assessment instruments for each
domain in order to provide a comprehensive view of the child's
skills and abilities as well as challenges (▶Table 7.3). We are
not suggesting that all of these need to be utilized in every case;
observations during the initial interactions with the child will
help SLPs select and prioritize the subsequent assessment
measures. Individual practitioners will know best which tools

are suited to the demographics of the child and family (e.g., age,
sex, race, ethnicity, background, etc.), the characteristics of the
instruments (e.g., standardization norms), and the nature of
their clinical settings (e.g., whether parents/caregivers are
present), time constraints, and personal preferences.
There are few formal instruments that directly tap children's
own perceptions of the ABCs (aﬀective, behavioral, and cogni-
tive) of communication, so most of this information is gleaned
from interviewing the child. One exception—a valid, reliable
instrument for which normative data are available—is the
Communication Attitudes Test of Preschool and Kindergarten
Children Who Stutter (KiddyCAT).18 The KiddyCAT includes
12 yes/no questions asked of preschool or kindergarten-age
children about their perceptions of, or attitudes about, talking.
These questions elicit the child's perceptions of whether talking
is hard in general, whether words are hard to say, whether they
talk "right," whether or not it is "easy" to talk, whether they like
to talk, as well as their perception of how others view their
talking. There are also questions that refer specifically to
stuttering in that the child is asked whether words sometimes
"get stuck" in their mouth, or come out "easily." The child's
responses can be compared to those obtained from preschoolers/
kindergartners who do and do not stutter. In the initial
normative19 and subsequent replication and extension study,20
analyses of KiddyCAT results indicated that, on average, young
children who stutter (CWS) have more negative attitudes, self-
perceptions, and perceptions of others' attitudes toward their
talking (i.e., score higher on the KiddyCAT) than do children who
do not stutter (CWNS). Most significantly, CWS were more likely
than CWNS to identify speaking as diﬃcult (e.g., talking is hard,
words stick in my mouth, words are hard to say, etc.). We often
utilize the KiddyCAT as a springboard for conversation about
talking and stuttering with the child.
●Child interview: While we talk to the child, we learn more
about their perceptions of their communication abilities and
challenges as well as their stuttering (or whatever they may
call it, if they have a name for, or words describing, it). In
general, we think of this conversation as having (at least)
three parts that proceed from more general to more specific,
including (1) learning about the child, (2) learning about the
child's communication, and (3) learning about the child's
stuttering. We begin by learning about the child—likes,
dislikes, favorite things to do, people in the family, friends,
etc., as a means for establishing a positive therapeutic
relationship, and for learning about the child's makeup and
view of the world. Moving toward discussing communication
and stuttering, we ask the children why they came to see us.
Some children say they do not know, shrug their shoulders,
or look at their parents/caregivers for answers, while others
tell us that our meeting has something to do with their
talking (e.g., they have trouble talking, or "can't talk"), or may
say something specifically about their talking diﬃculties (e.g.,
can't say their words or "get stuck" when they try to talk), or
that they "stutter." We never assume children understand or
interpret the word "stutter" or "stuttering" as we do, so we
follow their lead and ask what they mean by "stutter" or
"stuttering" and if they can show us what happens or what it
sounds like. This opens the floor to a conversation about

when stuttering occurs (where, with whom), why they think
they "stutter" (or whatever word(s) they use), and what they
do to help themselves when they do. Conversations like these
also provide an opportunity for us to compliment and
reinforce how much the child knows (i.e., that they are
experts) about themselves, their talking, and their stuttering,
thereby modeling for them, and their parents/caregivers, that
stuttering is something that can be discussed clearly and
openly.
At times, children do not seem to be aware or concerned
about the way they talk or their stuttering. At other times,
they may say little but indicate nonverbally that they are
bothered by or uncomfortable with their stuttering, and/or by
others drawing attention to it. This is evidenced by behaviors
such as diverting eye contact, changing the subject of a
conversation, seeking attention or comfort from a parent, and
so forth. A child's reactions to their stuttering may give us
indications of both how they are perceiving stuttering and
how others perceive and/or react to it. When children seem
unaware or unwilling to talk about stuttering, we sometimes
wait a bit and then, in the course of play-based interactions,
model some easy, eﬀortless SLDs in our own speaking (e.g.,
SSRs and/or ASPs) and see how the child responds.
Sometimes, there is no response. At other times, the child will
look at us curiously or show signs of discomfort (e.g., avert
their eyes, blush, squirm in their seats, etc.). When children
appear to notice, we may then say something like "Oh, I got a
little stuck there. I said m-m-my tower has a blue block on
top," and leave it there. We may then do it again, adding the
comment, "Does that ever happen to you?" For some
children, this invites a discussion about their own stuttering
and/or speaking diﬃculties. During one evaluation in our
clinic, after modeling some easy SSRs and commenting on
them, an alarmed preschooler responded, "Don't do that.
Daddy said never do that." A glance at the father revealed a
look of embarrassment and uncertainty—something
addressed later with him in the context of parents, quite
naturally, not knowing how to react to or help their child who
is stuttering. During these brief interviews with children, we
often hear some very creative explanations about what
happens when they stutter (e.g., "My throat locks up and
throws away the key"), why they stutter (e.g., "I swallowed a
penny when I was a baby"), and what helps (e.g., "I talk like a
Jedi"). The information we gather in this manner provides
both a broader picture of the child's personal story (in general
and with regard to communication and stuttering), and
establishes the beginning of positive, supportive relationships
with the child and family that will facilitate sharing findings
and diagnoses, making recommendations, and providing
subsequent therapy services as needed.
Obtaining Parent/Caregiver Input
In addition to the more general or standardized intake form(s)
particular to each clinical setting, there are a variety of useful
instruments that may be completed by parents to broaden
our understanding of their children's skills and abilities across
domains, their stuttering and communication in everyday con-
texts, and parents'/caregivers' own knowledge and/or assump-
tions about and responses to their children, in general, and with
regard to stuttering (▶Table 7.3). We may include, exclude,
and/or administer any of these orally depending on the pa-
rent(s)'/caregiver(s)' language abilities (e.g., if English is a non-
primary language for them and/or we are evaluating the child
with the help of an interpreter) and literacy skills (as self-
reported or observed, e.g., parent/caregiver is struggling to
complete a form). We let parents/caregivers know that the
forms may contain professional language or terms that are un-
familiar and we would be happy to answer questions or give
them more information at any time, making it easier for anyone
who may be uncertain or reluctant to ask for assistance.
Our general intake form for parents/caregivers (Early Childhood
Onset Stuttering [ECHOS] Intake Form), includes specific questions
(part B) about the child's stuttering behavior at its onset and over
time, and any family history of stuttering (see Appendix 7.1).
Obtaining this information (along with that pertaining to other
familial and developmental variables) facilitates consideration of
the risk factors for stuttering persistence. It also informs us of any
personal knowledge of and/or experiences with stuttering (or oth-
er challenges) in the family that may impact perceptions, reac-
tions, questions, and needs as we assess the child's stuttering
and communication, obtain from and provide information to the
parents/caregivers, and make collaborative decisions about next
steps for the child and family.
There are a variety of helpful parent/caregiver report instru-
ments that help us learn about the child's stuttering and the
ways in which parents respond to it. Practitioners may elect to
administer one or more of these instruments based on their
clinical judgments of what might be most useful for obtaining
such information from a particular child and family. When lan-
guage and/or literacy issues are a factor, instruments may be
presented orally (and/or through an interpreter) or omitted in
favor of more in-depth parent/caregiver interviews. Of the four
described below, the first three (ISPP, Palin Parent Rating Scales
[Palin PRS], VRYCS) are cost free:
●Impact of Stuttering on Preschool Children and Parents (ISPP):
The ISPP,21 adapted for ease of completion (Appendix 7.2) by
Dr. Katerina Ntourou (another contributor to this volume),
provides information about parents'/caregivers' perceptions
of the impact of stuttering on their child's talking, confidence,
play with other children, emotional reactions (e.g., mood
changes, withdrawal, frustration), reactions of other children
(e.g., teasing, changes in play), and impact on parents/
caregivers themselves (e.g., emotionally, knowing/not
knowing what to do/say). The 19 questions include items that
require selection of "yes" or "no" responses, followed by more
specific choices, and open-ended questions requesting
parents/caregivers to comment on their observations and
perceptions.
●Palin PRS: If you have use of a tablet, laptop, or desktop
computer, parents (of children of any age who are stuttering)
can register online and complete the 19-item Palin PRS22 to
rate (1) the impact of stuttering (or "stammering" as it is
called in the United Kingdom) on the child, (2) the severity
of the child's stuttering and its impact on parents, and
(3) parents' knowledge of stuttering and confidence in
managing it (https://www.palinprs.org.uk/secure/
pprs_connect.php). Results may be used to identify areas of
diﬃculty for the child and related parent concerns, inform
counseling and recommendations, and monitor progress over
Preschool-Age Children
102

repeated evaluations and/or the course of therapy. Scores
may be compared to those obtained from 259 parents of CWS
(ranging in age from 2.6 to 14.6 years) for each of the three
factors.
●Vanderbilt Responses to Your Child's Speech (VRYCS):23
Recently, we developed the VRYCS rating scale to obtain
parents'/caregivers' perceptions of their own responses to the
speech of their children who are stuttering (see Appendix 7.3).23
The VYRCS contains 18 items pertaining to five factors or
categories of parent responses including the following:
(1) requesting the child to make changes when speaking
(e.g., to think about what he or she is saying, take a deep
breath, slow down, or relax); (2) talking for the child (e.g.,
finish what the child was saying, fill in words for the child);
(3) supporting the child's talking (e.g., letting the child lead
conversations, waiting for the child to finish, praising what
the child said); (4) slowing and/or simplifying their own
talking (e.g., pausing before responding, asking simple
questions); and (5) responding emotionally (e.g., becoming
tense, remaining relaxed, worrying about the child's talking).
Parents rate their use of each of the 18 items (e.g., "How often
do you ask your child to slow down when talking?") from
0 ("never") to 4 ("always"). Results may be used to
compliment and reinforce parents for positive responses (e.g.,
waiting for the child to finish speaking), discuss and redirect
less helpful responses (e.g., filling words in for the child), and
inform decisions about recommendations, including the type
and content of intervention.
●TOCS ORS17: The TOCS ORS, including both the Speech Fluency
Rating Scale (TOCS ORS-Fluency) and the Disfluency-Related
Consequences Rating Scale (TOCS ORS-Consequences), is a
1-page form to be completed by parents/caregivers (and/or
other SLPs or teachers). Using the TOCS ORS-Fluency,
respondents score each of nine items on a scale from 0
("never") to 3 ("always"), reflecting their judgment of how
often the child exhibited the behavior over the previous
2 months. Results provide information about the
characteristics of the child's stuttering (e.g., repeats parts of
words, prolongs sounds, gets stuck or blocked, etc.) and when
and with whom it occurs (e.g., when addressing parents,
peers, siblings, groups, etc.). The TOCS ORS-Consequences
also contains nine items scored by respondents (i.e., using the
same 3-point scale) to rate their judgments of the child's
physical and emotional reactions to stuttering across the
previous 2 months (e.g., becomes tense, runs out of breath,
avoids words, becomes concerned, embarrassed, or
frustrated, etc.), as well as whether or not the child was
rejected by other children because of stuttering. These ratings
are used to indicate the severity of the child's stuttering
(TOCS ORS-Fluency) and any stuttering-related consequences
the child experiences (TOCS ORS-Consequences); however,
the published test only contains comparison data for children
ranging in age from 7 to 12 years. Because TOCS ORS was
developed for children between 7 and 12 years of age, we use
the ratings from both questionnaires (fluency and
consequences) as a useful inventory of preschoolers'
stuttering severity and their responses to it, observed over
the past few months in environments outside of the clinical
setting. Since variability is a hallmark of stuttering (as
discussed elsewhere in this volume), the TOCS ORS gives us a
broader understanding of children's stuttering and related
behavior in real-world contexts. This is especially important
when the child's stuttering on the day of (or even during) our
assessment is diﬀerent from (e.g., less evident and/or severe
than) what prompted parents/caregivers to schedule the
appointment. Such a mismatch between in- and outside-of-
clinic observations can contribute to parent/caregiver
concerns that we doubt or disagree with their
characterizations of their children's stuttering. By having
parents/caregivers complete the TOCS ORS, we acknowledge
that (1) we expect their children's day-to-day stuttering and
communication, and reactions thereto, to be more varied and
complex than what we might observe during our brief
assessments; (2) we rely on their input as experts about, and
close observers of, their children; and (3) we are seeking a full
picture of their children's stuttering in everyday contexts
where they communicate naturally (and may be impacted by
stuttering).
We use several other instruments, along with our intake
form(s) and interviews, to obtain additional parent/caregiver
input about children's language, preliteracy, social pragmatic,
speech intelligibility, speech motor, and temperament
characteristics. Next, we provide a brief discussion of some of
these measures, also listed in ▶Table 7.3.
●Language/preliteracy skills and social pragmatics: For language
and literacy, we ask parents to complete the Clinical
Evaluation of Language Fundamentals Preschool-3 [CELF-P:3]
Emerging Literacy Scale), and for social pragmatics abilities,
the CELF-P:3 Descriptive Pragmatics Profile.24 Results are
compared to criterion scores for preschool-age children and
help us identify areas of possible concern that may require
further assessment.
●Speech intelligibility: We administer the Intelligibility in
Context Scale (ICS),25 a quick, standardized parent-report
measure of functional speech intelligibility, available in 60
diﬀerent languages (see Appendix 7.4 for the English
version). Parents are asked to rate the degree to which
diﬀerent communication partners (i.e., themselves, others in
the immediate family, extended family members, friends,
acquaintances, teachers, and strangers) are able to
understand the child. Ratings of the seven items are made on
a 5-point scale from 1 ("never") to 5 ("always"). This
indication of children's abilities to be understood in everyday
contexts by those with whom they interact most, when
added to our own observations, helps us to both provide a
better understanding of the child's speech sound production
abilities and guide our selection of follow-up questions and
additional assessment procedures (e.g., whether a single-
word naming articulation test is appropriate and/or
suﬃcient).
●Speech motor structure and function: Included in our
assessment is examination of the structure and functioning of
the child's speech sound production mechanism (e.g., Oral
Speech Mechanism Screening Examination [OSMSE-R]).26 We
look for any signs of structural or functional abnormalities
when we initially "look, listen, and learn" while the child
interacts with parent(s)/caregiver(s) and/or with us, and then
look a little more closely at the child's face, neck, lips, teeth,
tongue, and soft and hard palates, at rest, during movements
(e.g., puﬃng the cheeks, pursing and puckering the lips,
7.3 Preschool Stuttering Assessment: Look, Listen, and Learn
103

moving the tongue up, down, and side to side, etc.), and
during production of vowels and (non)nasal consonants. We
also ask the child to produce rapid repetitions of sequences
(i.e., diadochokinetic syllable rates or DDKs) of monosyllables
(20 repetitions), bisyllables (15 repetitions), and trisyllables
(10 repetitions; e.g., "puh," "puhtuh," puhtuhkuh") to further
ascertain speed and coordination of oral motor movements.27
During the DDK task, as children produce the sounds and
syllables the clinician can observe (and/or audio/video record
to analyze later) the child's productions for discoordination,
distortions, motor fatigue, or groping behaviors. Inclusion of
the Nonword Repetition Test (NRT)28 permits more formal
examination of speech motor proficiency during the
production of novel phonological sequences. We use this test
because recent research has shown greater variability and
discoordination in speech motor production among some
young CWS that does not resolve in those children whose
stuttering will persist.8
●Temperament: We also explore parent(s)'/caregiver(s)'
perceptions of their children's temperament, behavior in
everyday situations, and attention (e.g., ability to focus, shift
attention and to be flexible) by observing and by
administering the Short Behavioral Inhibition Scale (SBIS)28
and the very short form of the Children's Behavior
Questionnaire (CBQ-VSF).29 The SBIS focuses specifically on
behavioral inhibition, or the child's tendency to process and
respond reluctantly, cautiously, and/or avoidantly to novelty,
change, and/or diﬀerences in the environment. These
tendencies are often seen when the child meets new people
(e.g., warming up easily or with diﬃculty), interacts in a
group, or tries out new activities. The parent is asked to
consider each of five items in light of their child's behavior
during the interval from birth to 4 years of age. Assigned
scores range from 1 to 5 for each item (maximum total score
= 25), with lower scores reflecting greater behavioral
inhibition and higher scores reflecting an unreserved,
engaging, or outgoing temperament. Ntourou et al29
compared results from parents of preschoolers, including
225 CWS and 243 CWNS between the ages of 2.10 and
6.3 years, finding greater behavioral inhibition among CWS.
Further, CWS with higher levels of behavioral inhibition
stuttered more often (% SLDs) and more severely (SSI-3 or
SSI-4 and TOCS ORS-Fluency; see ▶Chapter 7.3.2),
experienced more disfluency-related consequences (TOCS
ORS-Consequences), and had more negative communication
attitudes (KiddyCAT, see Formal Assessment section), than did
CWS with lower levels of behavioral inhibition. We recommend
inclusion of all of these measures (SSI-4, TOCS ORS, KiddyCAT,
SBIS) in assessments of preschoolers who stutter, allowing for
consideration of possible relations between and among
variables (see ▶Table 7.3).
The CBQ-VSF30 is a 36-item instrument designed to tap three
broad domains of temperament including surgency/
extraversion (e.g., impulsive, high activity, outgoing, etc.),
negative aﬀect (e.g., sadness, fear, anger/frustration, etc.), and
eﬀortful control (e.g., inhibition, attentional control, perceptual
sensitivity, etc.). It was derived from the more comprehensive,
195-item CBQ.30 The 36 items describe reactions children may
have to various situations (e.g., "seems always in a hurry to get
from one place to another," "takes a long time in approaching
new situations," "is quite upset by a little cut or bruise"). Thus,
the CBQ-VSF is useful for general screening of temperament,
attention, and behavior in 3- to 7-year-old children, and is
available in a variety of languages. Parents/caregivers are
asked to rate each item on a 7-point scale ranging from 1
("extremely untrue of your child") to 7 ("extremely true of your
child"), based on their observations of the child over the past
6 months.
Knowing how young children respond to situations they
may encounter in daily life enriches our understanding of the
ways they may react to challenges (positive and negative) they
may experience. These challenging situations might include
starting a new school year, moving, welcoming a new sibling,
getting or not getting their own way, visiting an amusement
park, learning new skills, stuttering, having diﬃculty being
understood, and so forth. We typically look for response
patterns corresponding to each of the three domains (surgency,
negative aﬀect, and eﬀortful control) and note items that are
rated as "extremely true" for particular children that may
warrant follow-up during the parent/caregiver interview.
Children's temperaments not only may impact the ways they
respond to what their parents/caregivers (and others) do, or do
not do, in response to their stuttering, but also guide our own
interactions with them, and inform our recommendations.
By including a variety of instruments, we obtain a
comprehensive understanding of the ABCs and impact of
stuttering on children and their parents or caregivers within
the developmental contexts in which they relate, grow, and
learn.
●Parent/caregiver interview: We conduct an interview with
parents/caregivers after we have had the opportunity to look,
listen, and learn as they interact with their child, but before
we administer any more comprehensive formal assessment
procedures to the child. Interviewing parents or caregivers
helps us (1) to obtain additional information and insights that
broaden our own observations and hypotheses and inform
our selection of assessment tools (e.g., family history of
stuttering and/or other communication, developmental, and/
or health conditions); (2) to provide opportunities to
compliment the parents/caregivers and ask questions about
their child and their own interactions (e.g., models of
language and communication, parenting styles, presence of
communication disorders, e.g., stuttering and/or speech
sound production errors); and (3) to discern whether or not
what we observed is consistent with their perceptions of and
expectations for their child's developmental skills/levels and
challenges, communication abilities and concerns, and,
specifically, the ABCs of stuttering and their impact on the
child and family (▶Fig. 7.1b).
We begin our interview by thanking parents/caregivers for
taking the time to bring their child to see us and to provide an
idea of what the child's speech, language, and stuttering is like
in interaction with important listeners. This is followed by
a general question such as, "How can we be helpful to you
and your child today?" or "What do you most want to learn
from this assessment?" or "What questions would you like
answered as part of today's evaluation?" or "What are your
best hopes for our time together today?" That last example is
from solution-focused interviewing and therapy, an approach
Preschool-Age Children
104

that centers on clients' and/or parent(s)'/caregiver(s)' most
important hopes or goals for themselves and their child.31
Frequently, parents/caregivers talk about their concerns for
the child's communication (e.g., stuttering), revealing worries
about what may have caused the problem(s) (especially anything
that they may have done or failed to do), whether or not the
problem will resolve on its own or necessitate therapy, what
the impact on the child might be should stuttering continue into
the future (e.g., peer relationships, teasing or bullying, academic
and/or career impact, etc.), and what they can do to help their
child. Oftentimes their best hopes are that the child will over-
come stuttering (e.g., grow out of it or resolve it with treatment)
and/or that it will not interfere with their future growth and
development, relationships, happiness, and life accomplishments.
The questions parents/caregivers usually have for us correspond
to these same concerns, worries, and hopes for the future as they
journey to a better understanding of their child's stuttering and
how best to help. For one family where the mother and three of
the children stutter, the parents sought evaluations only when
they observed their children avoiding speaking and/or exhibiting
negative reactions to their stuttering. The parents' perceptions
were that it was not the stuttering itself that was problematic,
but any impact it might have on their children's social inter-
actions and achievements of academic, career, and life goals.
Once we have an idea of what brought the family to see us,
we follow up with questions that our conversation and their
responses on the intake form(s) suggest are important, espe-
cially about development, health, and/or family history that
will help us to better understand the child and the factors that
may relate to the onset and development of stuttering. We are
especially interested in learning about the onset of the child's
stuttering—when, where, how (i.e., what the child's stuttering
was like when it was first noticed), and any explanations the
parents/caregivers may have for it beginning. We also ask about
their child's and their own reactions at that time, those of
others, and the progress and/or changes in stuttering that have
occurred since then. This conversation includes attention to the
potential risk factors for stuttering persistence outlined earlier
(see ▶Table 7.1), especially concerning the trajectory of the
problem and whether or not there are others in the child's
biological
family
who
stuttered
and
recovered
or
who
continued to stutter into adulthood. This conversation may
involve extended inquiry and include mapping out, on paper,
members of the child's biological family (on both the maternal
and paternal sides), their relationships to the child (e.g., sibling,
parent, aunt, uncle, grandparent, etc.), whether or not they
stuttered (and recovered or persisted, if known), and if they
have any other health or developmental concerns of note.
If a parent/caregiver stutters, we briefly ask about their own
experiences with stuttering (e.g., history, therapy, impact, etc.)
and how they think those aﬀect their views of their child's stut-
tering, as well as their hopes for both our assessment and rec-
ommendations for the future (e.g., therapy, school placement,
referrals, etc.). As illustrated earlier, we have worked with
parents who stutter and are unconcerned about their child's
stuttering behavior, but worried that it might interfere with
communication, happiness, and future plans. In contrast, we
have worked with parents who stutter who hope we can
quickly help their child overcome stuttering to prevent any pos-
sible negative consequences that might occur in the future,
some of which they may have experienced themselves. For
example, one young boy's father recounted being teased,
bullied, and ostracized by peers and mocked by teachers as a
youngster, contributing to his trying to hide stuttering at all
costs and making choices (e.g., about education and career
paths) to minimize the necessity of talking. While he supported
his son in the short and long-term, he hoped to spare him
from the anxiety, negative self-perceptions and communication
struggles he experienced himself, and the impact stuttering
might have on his child's life choices. We welcome all points of
view and use them to guide our presentation of findings and
recommendations, especially as they influence our manner and
focus in counseling the family and including them in the ther-
apy process. We see the shared experience of stuttering within
the family as a positive element of our partnership over the
short and longer term.
The
information
we
gain
from
talking
with
parents/
caregivers helps us to refine our selection of assessment proce-
dures for the child (see ▶Table 7.3). While we engage the child,
we have parents/caregivers complete the parent-report instru-
ments described earlier, letting them know they are free to ask
any questions as they proceed. If at all possible, we like to have
the parents/caregivers in the same room with us so that they
may observe and ask questions. Because they are present in the
room, sometimes we have to ask them not to interfere when we
are administering a test to their child; for example, by rephras-
ing questions we ask their child, repeating models or instruc-
tions, or adding information to help their child choose the
correct answer. At the same time, their presence allows them to
learn, along with us, about their child's skills, abilities, and chal-
lenges, and gives them an opportunity to think of questions for
us, or provide additional information that might be helpful.
Once testing is finished, we typically give the family a 10- to 15-
minute refreshment and self-care break while we score and
compile our results.
7.3.3 Compiling and Synthesizing
Results and Making Recommendations
The process of providing parents/caregivers with recommenda-
tions includes (1) compiling and synthesizing our assessment
results, (2) making diﬀerential diagnoses, (3) presenting our
findings, (3) delivering our recommendations, (4) providing
referral sources, and (5) following up on our recommendations
and/or referrals (▶Fig. 7.5).
●Assessment: As shown in ▶Figs. 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3, the
assessment process leads to our understanding of possible
risk factors for stuttering persistence (▶Table 7.1), answers
questions about the child's skills and abilities, and helps
reveal the ways in which the child and parents/caregivers
interact (▶Table 7.2). It also provides results of formal
assessment procedures through conversations with the child,
administration of screenings and/or comprehensive testing
protocols, completion of intakes and surveys by parents/
caregivers, and interviews of the child and parents/caregivers
(▶Table 7.3). When considering our findings, we ask
ourselves what communication challenges the child has, if
any, when compared to age and culturally appropriate
developmental expectations. Throughout our assessment,
7.3 Preschool Stuttering Assessment: Look, Listen, and Learn
105

we have considered the child's speech fluency, language,
speech sound production and speech motor skills,
temperament (including emotions and attitudes, behavior,
attention, etc.), and social communication abilities with
reference to the ABCs of communication. We have observed
and reflected upon the child's awareness and reactions or
responses to communication breakdown, and those of their
parents/caregivers, along with parents'/caregivers' knowledge
and expectations, concerns and assumptions (e.g., about their
own roles), regarding stuttering, communication, and
development. In addition to comparing results to objective
norms and standards (e.g., cultural, linguistic, etc.), we view
our results in light of each child growing and developing
within unique family and community environments
(▶Fig. 7.1). Our primary objective is to help the child and
family obtain knowledge and tools to foster eﬀective,
spontaneous, comfortable, eﬃcient, and joyful
communication,32,33 and reduce negative and enhance
positive impacts the child's communication challenges and
skills may present now and in the future.
●Diﬀerential diagnoses: During our assessment we accumulate
and analyze a great deal of evidence that forms the basis for
our diagnoses of deficits in speech fluency, speech sound
production, expressive/receptive language, and/or motor
speech coordination, while also gaining a greater
understanding of the child's social communication,
temperament, and family dynamics. We also discern the
concerns, knowledge, assumptions, behaviors, and hopes of
parents/caregivers in relation to their child's strengths and
challenges. As a result, at the end of the evaluation, we know
the deficits or challenges the child has and how they impact
and are impacted by the child's developmental skills and
trajectory (within and across domains), as well as important
elements of family history and interactions. We also have
taken the time to forge the beginnings of a strong, confident,
and trusting therapeutic relationship with the child and
family that will help the parents/caregivers comprehend and
digest our findings and recommendations and facilitate their
active partnership with us throughout the therapeutic
process. We find most children can be characterized as
presenting with typical/age-appropriate fluency skills, a
stuttering disorder, or a stuttering disorder with a
concomitant speech and/or language disorder. We use
▶Table 7.4 to summarize our findings and related diagnoses
as we prepare to share them with the family.
●Presenting findings: Prior to presenting our findings, we
thank the parents/caregivers and the child for coming to see
us, their participation in the assessment, and for helping us to
learn extensively about the child's communication abilities
and challenges. We then ask what would be most important
for them to know or gain from the time we spent together.
Typically, we are asked to share whether or not their child
(1) has a problem with stuttering (and/or other challenges);
(2) whether the problem(s) will persist; (3) if the child needs
therapy and, if so, about the particulars; and (4) how they can
best help their child. We begin by answering their questions,
from most to least pressing for them, interweaving the results
of our assessment. We often highlight those skills that are
relative strengths for the child and the family, as this provides
an opportunity to share positive findings in anticipation of
applying them to addressing diagnoses of delays, disorders,
and/or diﬀerences and related recommendations for
intervention. Most of the time, when we present an area of
identified challenge for the child, we are simply confirming
what the parents/caregivers have already recognized; at
these times, we are able to say, "As you told us, your child...."
This confirms their expertise about their child and solidifies
our partnership for the present and future.
After sharing the results and before we oﬀer our
recommendations, we ask for any additional questions or
other information the parents/caregivers would like to share.
We also ask the parents/caregivers what they have learned
from the assessment results we have provided. If they lack
clarity about and/or misunderstood any of the findings we
Fig. 7.5 Preschool stuttering assessment
overview: part 2.
Preschool-Age Children
106

presented and/or their implications, this gives us an
opportunity to expand, clarify, and/or rectify any areas, as
needed. Most importantly, if parents/caregivers are able to
describe to us the content and implications of the findings
from their child's assessment, we know they have understood
and are ready for specific recommendations about what they
can do to help.
●Making recommendations: We tailor our recommendations to
the results of our collaborative assessment as well as the
family's needs and preferences. At times, we are in the
position of advising the family that the child is typical/age
appropriate in skills/abilities. When this occurs, we provide
education about developmental timelines and expectations
and how the parents/caregivers have and will continue to
play a critical role in their child's healthy development. We
always leave the door open for future contacts by telephone
or email in case concerns arise and/or they have questions as
their child ages.
Treatment is indicated when the child has one or more
communication disorders, delays, and/or deficits that are
interfering with everyday activities in family, academic, and/
or social environments. One, not infrequent, combined
diagnosis is that of speech sound disorder or delay and
childhood-onset fluency disorder.34 This co-occurrence
requires clinical judgment about the relative impact of each
problem on the child's communication. For some children,
their inability to be understood is of major import, while for
others, the tension and struggle characteristic of their
stuttering, and their negative reactions to it, take precedence.
For still others, the two concerns appear to be of equal
importance. There are a variety of therapy options to consider
with families whose children both stutter and have speech
sound deficits. These include group or individual therapy and,
within either context, (1) a focus on speech sound errors or
error patterns with support for the family with regard to
stuttering (e.g., tips for responding positively and
supportively to communication and empathizing with any
frustration with stuttering); (2) a focus on family-based
intervention for stuttering (see ▶Chapter 10) while also
modeling correct speech sound production for the child; or
(3) an alternating or cycles approach to providing stuttering
and speech sound production therapy.35,36,37
●Providing referral sources: Another option is to recommend
the family return with the child for a reassessment in a set
number of months (e.g., 3 or 6 months) or, if indicated, only
as needed (i.e., suggest the family contact us if stuttering
reemerges or worsens). The length of time until the follow-up
assessment is typically selected by mutual agreement
between the parents/caregivers and the SLP as they consider
the findings we presented, where they are in their thinking

given what we have discussed, and the family's schedule and
needs over the next 3 to 6 months. This recommendation is
appropriate, for example, in cases where there seems to be a
known disturbance that led to the stuttering increase.
●Following up: When we leave any follow-up assessment
unscheduled, it is typically because the child does not show
signs of stuttering (e.g., was stuttering at the time the family
scheduled the appointment, but it has since resolved) or
there has been a downward trajectory in stuttering over time
(e.g., stuttering is less severe when it occurs and the interval
between episodes is widening; the child is less concerned, or
unconcerned, about talking; and/or the parents/caregivers
are less concerned than they were earlier in the course of
their child's stuttering). As always, we oﬀer the option for
parents/caregivers to contact us if the child's stuttering or
reactions to it change. Sometimes a phone conversation or
e-mail exchange is all that is needed to talk through a "bump
in the road," which might include a move, new baby, changes
in school, day care or babysitter, or a new school. At these
times, the parents/caregivers might be concerned that the
child's stuttering will worsen and desire suggestions for how
best to help their child through the transition. Sometimes
when we suggest reevaluation at a future date, parents
express a desire for additional guidance from us for
responding to stuttering and/or supporting their child's
communication and development in the family context.
When this is the case, we may oﬀer them a follow-up visit to
spend more time outlining, discussing, and/or modeling
recommendations, and/or the option to enroll in a short-term
family-based treatment, as described in the next section.
Our assessment results may reveal the child has needs other
than those specifically related to stuttering. Some are within
our scope of practice (e.g., language, speech sound production,
feeding/swallowing, and/or social pragmatic challenges), and
we are able to inform the family what is available in our setting,
should that be the best option for them, or provided in other
settings by SLPs (e.g., at school). Some questions or concerns
necessitate connecting the family with other, non-SLP pro-
viders. This may include referral to the child's pediatrician for a
medical need or question; a mental health professional for eval-
uation (e.g., when parents suspect a child has an attentional
deficit or anxiety disorder) or help with parenting diﬃculties; a
physical or occupational therapist for fine and/or gross motor
development challenges, or a developmental preschool or pro-
gram (e.g., head start), etc. For these purposes, we maintain a
list of relevant referral sources within our geographical area.
For some families, in-person treatment, when recommended,
poses too great a burden for their work, school, transportation,
childcare, and other responsibilities. We provide these families
with resources closer to home and/or discuss the possibility of
services delivered via telepractice, when available.
7.4 Closing the Visit
Our assessments end with our thanking the child and family for
coming, asking if they have any other questions they would like
addressed now (time permitting) or the next time we connect,
what their major "take home" was from the visit, and whether
there was anything we could have done to serve them better.
We provide our contact information, resources (e.g., handouts,
links, referral information), and an idea of when they can
expect to receive a report summarizing our findings.
We do our best to ensure the family leaves with a clear
understanding of the "next steps" for their child, especially by
confirming recommendations in our conclusory comments. At
times, we have provided options to the family to which they
are not yet ready to commit. They may want to talk it over
with a partner or family member, consider financial resour-
ces, or just "sleep on it." We welcome their taking time to dis-
cern what is best for their child and family. We learn whether
they would like us to contact them (and, if so, when) or if they
would prefer to contact us with their decision. If we have
oﬀered to follow up on any questions for which we did not
yet have an answer (e.g., a particular referral source in their
area), we let them know how soon to expect us to reach out
to them and discern their contact preferences (e.g., by tele-
phone call, text, or e-mail, and to whom). We also welcome
them to contact us if they have questions or concerns when
they receive the report summarizing our results and recom-
mendations. By attending to these details, the clarity of the
assessment process, results, and recommendations is enhanced,
and the client-/family-clinician relationship both forged and
strengthened.
For every child, we walk the family through the options, pro-
viding descriptions, answering questions, and obtaining family
input. If there is a particular option that we do not consider to
be potentially helpful to the child, we exclude it from our dis-
cussion, and/or help families to understand our decision should
it be something they ask about (e.g., an approach they read
about on the internet that, given our findings, is not appropriate
to their child's needs). Thus, we combine our professional
expertise with the input of informed parents/caregivers to
determine next steps for the child and family. We have found
that including parents/caregivers as key participants in decision-
making contributes to their commitment to and engagement in
the therapy process, yielding a true partnership that helps bridge
the gap between the clinical setting and real-world communica-
tion. All early intervention approaches for stuttering include key
roles, albeit with diﬀerent emphases, for parents/caregivers, as is
explained in detail in ▶Chapter 10.
For all preschoolers who are stuttering, we provide some
version of family-based support. We consistently provide tips,
videos (or links thereto), handouts, and examples of how to
respond to stuttering, communication, temperament diﬀeren-
ces, behavioral and/or attentional challenges, and develop-
ment, in general, at the conclusion of the assessment. When a
course of therapy is warranted, we often begin with what we
call our "first line of defense"—a program of family-based inter-
vention that educates and empowers parents to respond to
their child's stuttering and communication in helpful ways,
and addresses aspects of child development and family interac-
tions, including parenting strategies, that fit the needs of the
individual child.38,39,40
7.5 Case Studies
The following section provides two case examples describing the
stuttering assessment procedures and findings for preschool
children.
Preschool-Age Children
108

7.5.1 Case 1: "M"
Speech
fluency: M
(3.8
years
old)
was
referred
for
an
assessment by her mother after beginning to repeat and
prolong sounds at the beginning of words when M started day
care. During the evaluation, M produced 3% SLDs, primarily
comprised of Mo-WWRs and SSRs.
Speech and language skills: M performed in the average or
high-average range for all speech sound production and
language testing.
Risk to persist: She began stuttering at 3.6 years, but does not
exhibit any other risk factors.
Temperament/attitude: M received a 2 (out of 12) on the
KiddyCAT (similar to scores for CWNS) and a 5 (out of 25) on
the SBIS, indicating she does not find talking very diﬃcult and
is behaviorally inhibited.
Social communication: M's mother reported M expresses her
needs eﬀectively to familiar friends and family members, but
her day care teacher reports she often plays by herself and
rarely talks to other children.
Results and recommendations: Based on the above results,
M's stuttering has increased dramatically with acclimation to a
new environment (e.g., day care), and the child has an
inhibited, slow-to-warm-up temperament. In cases like M's, we
might agree that some time (shorter or longer) for adjustment
to preschool would give us a better indication of whether
speech fluency might naturally improve as M's comfort level
increases and she experiences success acclimating to a new
environment and new peers and adults. We would provide the
family with suggestions for empathizing with, supporting, and
guiding M by taking small, manageable, positive steps to
foster adjustment to and thriving in her new environment,
involving day care personnel in the process. Some of these
recommendations include ideas for supporting communication
(e.g., focusing on message/content [i.e., what the child is sharing/
talking about], rather than manner [i.e., whether the child
stuttered
or
not
when
speaking],
empathizing
with
any
frustration with communication and/or stuttering, etc.), and are
presented in greater detail in ▶Chapter 10. A helpful resource for
families that describes and provides relevant examples of positive
communication and support is the video, 7 Tips for Talking
with the Child Who Stutters, available, free of charge, from the
Stuttering Foundation (https://www.stutteringhelp.org/content/
7-tips-talking-child-who-stutters), in English or Spanish, along
with pdf documents containing the tips.
7.5.2 Case 2: "J"
Speech
fluency: J
(4.0
years
old)
was
referred
for
an
assessment by his pediatrician after parents expressed concern
that the speech of his peers is becoming easier to understand
while his is not and that his stuttering had not resolved since it
began 12 months ago. According to the mother, J's stuttering
had improved after about 6 months, but not since then. During
the evaluation, J produced 7% SLDs, primarily comprised of SSRs,
ASPs, and Mo-WWRs. Some of the ASPs were accompanied by a
rise in pitch and widening of his eyes.
Speech and language skills: J scored one standard deviation
below age-level expectations on standardized assessment of his
articulation and phonological skills, was consistent with age-
level expectations for receptive and expressive vocabulary and
receptive
language
abilities,
and
just
below
average
for
expressive language (with scoring impacted by omission of
final consonants and reduced intelligibility due to articulation
errors and phonological processes). His mother noted that she
and his older sister are able to understand him better than his
father, that peers and teachers have more diﬃculty, and that
unfamiliar adults are unable to understand him.
Risk to persist: J began stuttering at 3.0 years and has
continued to stutter for 12 months with an initial decrease and
then plateaus in frequency and severity without improvement.
His speech articulation skills are below age-level expectations.
His mother and brother had therapy for speech sound errors in
early elementary school, and his father stuttered briefly at
about the same age as J.
Temperament/attitude: J obtained a 6 (out of 12) on the
KiddyCAT indicating that he is aware that talking is diﬃcult,
does not like how he talks, and thinks others do not like the
way he talks. His mother commented that she thought his
answers might be related to his diﬃculties being understood
rather than to his stuttering. He received a score of 20 (out of
25) on the SBIS indicating he is behaviorally uninhibited or
outgoing.
Social communication: J's mother reported J struggles to
express his needs eﬀectively to anyone but her and his sister.
J's preschool teacher informed the parents that peers will
walk away from J when they cannot understand what he
says. His mother commented that he has become less
talkative as he has realized that others are having diﬃculty
understanding him.
Results and recommendations: Based on the above results,
J
both
stutters
and
has
speech
sound
articulation
and
phonological skills that are below age-level expectations.
Combining the results of assessment and parental and teacher
input, J's communication is most negatively impacted by his
diﬃculties being understood by peers, teachers, his father,
other relatives, and unfamiliar adults. Stuttering is a secondary
concern, as it has been present for about a year without
resolving. Thus, the first option identified earlier—a focus on
speech sound errors or error patterns with support for the
family with regard to stuttering (e.g., tips for responding
positively and supportively to communication and empathizing
with any frustration with stuttering, as well as diﬃculties being
understood)— would be a prudent recommendation to the
family. By focusing on improving J's ability to be understood,
his
communication
will
be
enhanced
with
familiar
and
unfamiliar
listeners.
This
may also
positively
impact
his
attitudes about speaking and his willingness to do so. Support
for the family (e.g., Palin Parent-Child Interaction [PCI] therapy,
as presented in detail in ▶Chapter 10) could be included to

simultaneously address stuttering in the context of J's overall
communication development. It will be important to reassess
J's
expressive
language
abilities
once
his
speech
sound
production skills improve to ensure age-appropriate skills in
this area.
7.6 Conclusions
Assessing young children suspected of stuttering is a complex,
multifaceted, and dynamic process. It involves comprehensive
analyses of the child's skills and abilities as well as an examina-
tion of the child's communication within the context of the
family while considering the processes and intricacies of child
development. In this chapter, we have provided rationales,
steps, tools, and guidance for completing a thorough stuttering
assessment, in partnership with the child and family, that will
provide all participants with a clear understanding of the pre-
schooler's skills/abilities and challenges, and guidance for the
future. At the conclusion of our collaborative assessment, we
have the quantitative and qualitative data needed to confi-
dently present the family with our findings, address the ques-
tions and concerns that brought them to us, and provide rec-
ommendations that will facilitate maximization of the child's
communication skills and enjoyment in the family, and other,
contexts. In so doing, we have established a partnership with
the preschooler and family that fosters mutual trust, coopera-
tion, and teamwork for the short and long-term.

Abstract
This chapter presents an overview of methods and strategies
that are used in contemporary clinical practice when assessing
stuttering in school-aged children. The chapter is designed to
guide clinicians through an assessment process that takes into
account the school-aged child's functioning, impairment, activity
limitations, and participation restrictions, as well as personal and
environmental factors that can influence communication per-
formance. Application of assessment information to stuttering
diagnosis, severity determination, and, if appropriate, treatment
planning are discussed as well.
Keywords: stuttering, assessment, school-aged children, diagnosis,
speech fluency
8.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we describe the processes and procedures used
to assess stuttering in school-aged children. Assessment is the
foundation of clinical practice. School-aged children typically
are referred for assessment of stuttering when someone—
usually a parent or a teacher—is concerned that stuttering may
be present and limiting the child's spoken communication, aca-
demic performance, educational access, or social acceptance.
The clinician's assessment goal is not only to diagnose a child's
stuttering but also to determine how stuttering aﬀects the
child's communication functioning at home, in school, and in
other settings, and more generally, to determine how it aﬀects
the child's quality of life and sense of well-being. After acquiring
this information, the clinician works with the child, caregivers/
parents (hereafter parents), and teachers to formulate a plan for
what should happen next, including whether referrals to other
professionals are warranted.
This chapter is organized into five main sections. First, we
present a framework for planning and implementing assessments.
Next, we describe an assessment protocol that provides clinicians
with a comprehensive menu of assessment options, including
tools and strategies for collecting background information and for
obtaining informal and formal norm-referenced descriptions of
fluency performance and its impact. Next, we discuss how to
interpret assessment data for the purposes of diagnosing stutter-
ing, determining its severity and impact on a child, and forming
treatment recommendations. We then provide a case study of a
school-age child who presents with stuttering and other concerns
to help readers apply information from the chapter to assessment
planning. We close the chapter with a discussion of future direc-
tions in the assessment of school-aged children who stutter.
8.2 A Framework for Assessing
Stuttering in School-Aged Children
We organize stuttering assessment around the International Clas-
sification of Functioning and Disability, and Health (ICF),1 which
is a tool developed by the World Health Organization to provide
health care professionals with a framework for classifying and
describing the health-related functioning of people. When
applied to people who stutter, the ICF oﬀers a template for
designing an assessment that is likely to yield a description of not
only a person's fluency disorder but also how the fluency disor-
der fits into the broader context of a person's life.2
In the ICF framework, an individual's functioning is described
in three main ways: (1) body structure and function (i.e.,
anatomical and physiological characteristics); (2) activities
and activity limitations (i.e., daily activities, how they are per-
formed, and performance diﬃculties that are demonstrated);
and (3) participation and participation restrictions (i.e., the
type and extent of engagement in daily activities, and the
extent to which engagement is limited).
There are several key concepts that are essential for under-
standing the ICF framework and its application to children who
stutter. The concept of functioning focuses on characteristics a
child has and on what a child does, regardless of whether it is
"typical" or not. Thus, it has a positive connotation. Functioning
is contrasted with disability, which refers broadly to impairment
in body structure or functioning, limitations in the ability to
perform daily activities, and restrictions in the extent of partici-
pation in daily activities. Thus, disability refers to those aspects
of functioning that are atypical or diﬀerent from what people in
the general population do. Both perspectives—functioning and
disability—are important to examine during stuttering assess-
ment as each provides unique information about a child. These
concepts and several others from the ICF model are presented
in ▶Table 8.1. As shown, the table is organized around the two
broad components of the ICF framework: (1) functioning and
disability and (2) contextual factors; several more specific
concepts are introduced and explained under each component.
▶Table 8.1 also includes examples of quantitative (i.e., numerical,
objective) and qualitative (i.e., impressionistic, subjective)
measures that a clinician can obtain to gather information
about a child's functioning and disability.
When assessing school-aged children who stutter, one main
goal is to describe the child's current fluency performance and,
in doing so, to identify evidence of fluency impairment (i.e., stut-
tering) as well as any concomitant communication disorders that
may exist. The clinician then seeks to refine this description by
determining how contextual factors aﬀect the expression of a
child's stuttering in daily life. As shown in ▶Table 8.1, contextual
factors include a mix of personal and environmental variables.
Ideally, the clinician will collect information about home and
school speaking situations, as well as other speaking situations
that are important to the child and family (e.g., speech during an
after-school sporting activity). This leads to the identification
and description of situations with the most and least severe stut-
tering, the most and least participation, and so forth.
8.2.1 School-Age Children and Stuttering
There is little justification for taking a "wait-and-see" approach
when deciding whether to assess concerns about stuttering in
school-aged children. Stuttering onset typically occurs during
the preschool years. Most school-aged children with stutter-like
speech are likely to have been showing signs of the disorder for
119

several years and, thus, are beyond the age at which unassisted
recovery from stuttering typically occurs.3,4,5,6,7 Onset of stut-
tered speech during the school years also is a concern, because
an older-than-average age of stuttering onset is associated with
an increased risk of persistent stuttering.8,9 Consequently, when
a school-aged child is referred for concerns about stuttering,
the assessment should take place promptly, and if treatment is
warranted, then it too should commence promptly.
Although it may seem counterintuitive, the length of time a
child has stuttered does not strongly predict how much
stuttering-related disfluency will be produced.10 For example,
some children exhibit a relatively high frequency of stuttering
soon after the onset of stuttered speech appears, only to see it
decline later. Other children show the inverse pattern, and still
others exhibit relatively stable amounts of stuttered speech
over time. The more important point is that stuttering severity
consists of more than the number of stuttered syllables a child
produces; as shown in ▶Fig. 8.1, associated symptoms (e.g.,
extraneous physical movements and physically tense speech
musculature) and coping and concealment strategies (e.g., word
substitution and speech avoidance) are prominent components
of the disorder in many older school-aged children, especially
as compared to preschool and early school-aged children.8,10
▶Fig. 8.1 also illustrates that increases in these stuttering-
related behaviors coincide with increased self-awareness of
stuttered speech as children age. These data are consistent with
findings from other studies that show that the communication-
related attitudes of children who stutter become increasingly
less positive with age11 and that their speech becomes increas-
ingly eﬀortful, as evidenced by the emergence of muscle tremor
during speech in older children.12 The relationships between
children's speech disfluencies and the ways in which they
respond to and cope with them are important to clarify during
assessment.

8.2.2 An Assessment Protocol for
School-Aged Children Who Stutter
In the context of fluency assessment, the term protocol refers to
the procedures and practices that the clinician uses to collect
information about an individual's communication functioning.
With the school-aged population, an assessment protocol pro-
vides a format for answering relevant clinical questions about a
child. A sample protocol for assessing school-aged children who
stutter is presented in ▶Fig. 8.2. As shown, the protocol in
▶Fig. 8.2 has seven primary components. It may not be neces-
sary to include all protocol components in every assessment.
Rather, the clinician can adjust the protocol to fit the needs of
individual children and/or accommodate time constraints. That
said, we recommend that, as much as possible, clinicians use
similar procedures from one case to the next. This approach
provides clinicians with a standard context for evaluating child-
ren's stuttering, which will help the clinician build a mental
database of how children who stutter typically perform and
how their performance can vary. Clinicians are also likely to
find that repeated administration of a core set of assessment
tasks will increase the accuracy and eﬃciency of their assess-
ments. ▶Table 8.2 adds to the information in ▶Fig. 8.2 by pro-
viding an overview of key questions to ask when assessing
stuttering in school-aged children who stutter, as well as
examples of specific procedures or tools the clinician can use
when attempting to answer those questions.
▶Fig. 8.3 oﬀers details about specific analyses that a speech-
language pathologist (SLP) can perform when assessing stut-
tering in a school-aged child. As shown there, a child's speech
production can be measured in terms of its continuity, rate,
rhythm, and eﬀort. Each of these measures is relevant to under-
standing a child's fluency functioning. Analysis of continuity and
rhythm yields information about the connectedness and prosody
of speech, whereas analysis of rate yields information about the
speed with which information is communicated, and analysis of
eﬀort yields information about the how hard a child "works" to
produce spoken utterances. Analysis of these aspects of speech
across the various activities in a child's life provides insight into
the extent to which activity limitations and participation restric-
tions are present.13
Tools and Procedures for Collecting
Background Information
Concepts presented in ▶Table 8.2 and ▶Fig. 8.3 are described
in more detail in the following sections.
The Case History Form
The case history form is a tool that organizes information
around questions pertaining to the child's functioning and
experiences. Examples of case history forms and formats for
stuttering assessments are available in various sources.13,14,15 In
many work settings, however, clinician-developed forms are
used. Ideally, the clinician sends the case history form to the
parents prior to the assessment so they can complete it
thoughtfully and accurately. When stuttering is the presenting
complaint, the case history form should include questions about
age of stuttering onset, types of symptoms observed, changes in
symptom presentation over time, the child's and others' reactions
to stuttering, outcomes from previous assessments or therapy,
family history of stuttering and other communication disorders,
and so forth. Case history forms also commonly include ques-
tions about the child's developmental history, current and past
performance in other aspects of communication and academics,
emotional, behavioral, and attentional characteristics, as well as
medical history and current health (e.g., illnesses, injuries, medi-
cations, general health). Case history forms also typically include
questions about the child's family context and extracurricular
activities and interests.
The Clinical Interview
The clinical interview is a clinician-directed discussion that is
organized around questions and prompts pertaining to the
child's past and current functioning and experiences. With
the school-aged population, the clinician typically seeks to
Fig. 8.2 A sample assessment protocol for use with school-aged
children who stutter.

121

interview both the child and parent(s), depending on factors
such as parent accessibility, time constraints, and the child's will-
ingness and ability to talk about their speaking experiences. The
goal of the interview is to elicit a rich description of the child's
past and current functioning with regard to the presenting
complaint, medical history, academic history, and general devel-
opmental history, as well as the context within which the child
lives (e.g., family structure, family members' history of com-
munication disorders and responses to the child's fluency
diﬃculties).

During the clinical interview, the SLP can follow up on infor-
mation provided on the case history form and can explore
topics that arise incidentally during the clinical interview. The
SLP should attend to the emotional tone that parents and chil-
dren use while describing their experiences, as this can provide
insight into the degree or intensity of diﬃculties that the child
has faced, as well as the parent's or child's comfort level with
discussing stuttering and the parent's or child's level of enthusi-
asm about participating in intervention.
▶Table 8.3 includes examples of questions and prompts that
clinicians can present during a clinical interview to inquire
about the child's stuttering-related experiences. The questions/
prompts are phrased in two ways: one for use with parents
and the other for use with children. Obviously, it is important
to adjust the wording of these questions/prompts to fit the
situation. Older school-aged children are likely to be better in-
formants than younger ones; however, age is not a perfect pre-
dictor of how much information a child will provide or how
accurate the information will be. Accordingly, we are hesitant
to suggest a minimum age for conducting clinical interviews
with school-aged children. The questions/prompts in ▶Table 8.3
can be expanded as needed to obtain information about topics
such as family history of communication disorders, the family/
household structure, and the child's developmental, medical, and
educational histories.
As shown in ▶Table 8.3, clinical interviews typically begin
with an open-ended question about the parent's or child's
chief concerns and, with parents, the primary reasons for
seeking a speech-language evaluation. For example, with a
mother who is concerned that her child might be stuttering,
the SLP can ask her to describe or demonstrate the speech
behaviors that are creating concern. As parents talk, the SLP
listens for mention of stuttering symptoms, how the symp-
toms have changed over time, which parts of stuttering are
most concerning, and which daily activities are most and least
impacted by stuttering. When parents mention limitations in
their child's communication participation, the clinician must
try to separate aspects of a child's temperament, such as
shyness or sensitivity, from communication avoidance that is
associated with stuttering.

8.2 A Framework for Assessing Stuttering in School-Aged Children
123

The SLP also attempts to elicit information about how the child
and others react to the stuttering. Information about the child's
awareness and concern about stuttering are obtained, along with
information about how the child's speaking environment aﬀects
communication performance. The SLP listens for evidence of sup-
portive environmental elements (e.g., speaking partners who wait
for the child to finish a stuttered word, school-based accommo-
dations for graded speaking assignments) and nonsupportive ele-
ments (e.g., speaking partners who interrupt stuttered speech or
who oﬀer unsolicited advice or assistance with stuttered speech).
Synthesis of this information helps the clinician and family
determine the extent to which environmental factors need to be
addressed in a treatment program that follows the assessment.
Information about the child's family context such as the num-
ber of people in the household, number and age(s) of siblings,
family routines, and schedules can provide insight into the
types of communication demands the child encounters each
day and the extent to which family members can support the
goals of intervention.
Clinicians should also ask about family history of stuttering
and other communication disorders. Although this information
does not factor into the diagnosis of stuttering, it may help the
clinician estimate the child's risk for persistent stuttering, as a
positive family history of stuttering is a risk factor for persis-
tence, particularly when the aﬀected relative exhibits persistent
stuttering.15 (See ▶Chapter 3 in this book for more about the
genetic bases of stuttering.)
Clinical interviews also usually address the child's past as-
sessment and treatment experiences. Such information helps
the SLP put the present assessment into perspective and may
shape any treatment recommendations that are made. In the
cases where treatment is recommended following the evalua-
tion, clinicians should collaborate with the child and the
parents to shape both the treatment goals and approach,
rather than to prescribe them to the family. The clinician can
begin this process during the clinical interview by asking
children who stutter and their parents what they hope to
gain from the assessment and what goals they think they
might want to work toward in any subsequent treatment.
Children who stutter sometimes present with co-occurring
disorders that aﬀect other aspects of speech-language function-
ing as well as general academic performance2 (see ▶Chapter 4
and ▶Chapter 13 for more information). For example, speech
sound disorder and language disorder are two of the most com-
mon diagnoses that co-occur with stuttering in children, and
social anxiety disorder has emerged as a relatively common
co-occurring diagnosis in teens and adults who stutter.21,22
Thus, the SLP needs to inquire about functioning in these domains
to appropriately plan for assessment, and to consider them
when designing treatment and making referrals (Box 8.1).
Box 8.1 Recommended Interviewing Practices
1. Create a context for the interview. Preface the clinical interview with a brief explanation of the goals for the assessment and the role of
the interview in the assessment. The SLP should then ask the parent or child if they have any questions about the assessment, as
well as what they hope to learn from it.
2. Define terms that may be unfamiliar. Clinicians should limit the use of professional jargon when interviewing parents and children.
When professional terms (e.g., disfluency) are used, a brief, simple explanation should follow. Most parents and many school-aged
children will be familiar with the term stuttering, so it is fine to use that word when discussing speech fluency performance. In the
cases where a diagnosis of stuttering is uncertain or a child seems unfamiliar with the term, alternate wording should be used (e.g.,
"speech problem," "repeating a word," "getting stuck when talking").
3. Begin each interview topic with an open-ended, neutrally worded question. For example, when asking parents about their child's speech
symptoms, it is preferable to ask What have you observed about your child's speech? rather than Tell me about the problems your child
experiences when talking. The first prompt is worded neutrally and thus allows for the possibility that the child has had only positive
experiences or a mix of both positive and negative speaking experiences. The SLP can follow up with questions that elicit details
about whatever positive or negative experiences are mentioned in the initial response.
4. Engage in active, empathetic listening. When engaged in active listening, the clinician should occasionally make statements to assure
the parent or child that they not only heard the content but also empathized with the accompanying thoughts and feelings.16
Imagine a scenario where the mother of a child who stutters tells the clinician that she feels helpless and upset when her son
stutters and this has led her to attempt to help him by talking for him. Although the mother's behavior is not a practice SLPs would
recommend, the clinician nonetheless should refrain from correcting it during the interview. Doing so might lead the parent to feel
guilty, which in turn would make it less likely that she will answer the remaining questions completely or honestly. Instead, it is
preferable for the clinician to deliver an empathetic response such as, "It sounds like you've come up with something to do when
your son has diﬃculty speaking. Yet, despite your eﬀorts, you still feel overwhelmed and upset about what you should do."
5. Prepare for how to respond to children who are reluctant to talk about their stuttering. Some children may not be ready to talk openly
about stuttering and the feelings and emotions associated with it, especially to a clinician they have just met. For many children who
stutter, their fluency diﬃculties are a source of daily frustration and embarrassment. Over time, this can lead to emotions such as
fear, anxiety, and shame, which can be of suﬃcient intensity to cause children to feel uncomfortable when discussing the behaviors,
thoughts, feelings, and emotions that surround their stuttering. Such children may downplay the severity of their stuttering and the
impact it has on their quality of life.
One way to overcome a child's reluctance to share personal experiences with stuttering is to depersonalize the discussion. This
can be done by asking the child questions about other children who stutter.17,18 For example, the clinician can show the child
informational materials featuring other children who stutter and then ask questions like "What do you think other kids who stutter
feel when they are talking to friends?" As the child responds, the clinician can acknowledge and validate the content and feelings in
the child's response, and then follow with questions like, "Do you ever feel that way when you are talking to friends?" If the child
remains reluctant to talk, it is best not to press for an answer. The child's lack of responsiveness may provide the clinician with about
as much information on how they feel about stuttering as a lengthy response would provide.

Informal Approaches to Assessing Fluency
SLPs have developed a variety of measures to describe speech
fluency performance. Some of these measures are informal and
can be used instead of or in addition to measures found on
norm-referenced tests such as the ones described later in this
chapter. Informal fluency analyses often are used with samples of
connected speech that are elicited in conversational and narrative/
monologue (e.g., storytelling) contexts. Informal measures are par-
ticularly useful when applied to speech samples that are elicited
from beyond-clinic situations. The informal assessment data can
be used to complement findings from norm-referenced tests and,
in doing so, provide clinicians with a more complete understand-
ing of the child's speech fluency. In the remainder of this section,
several informal measures are described. It takes practice to
implement some of the informal measures described below accu-
rately, reliability, and eﬃciently. FluencyBank, listed in the Further
Readings section at the end of this chapter, provides speech sam-
ples that can be used for practice with informal measures.
Speech Continuity Measures
Measurement of speech continuity is the most common type of
informal fluency analysis. In the context of stuttering assess-
ment, speech continuity is measured by determining the fre-
quency with which various types of disfluency are produced.
Methods for computing disfluency frequency are explained in
Box 8.2.
Box 8.2 Speech Sample Elicitation Strategies
Informal speech sample analysis is usually conducted with either conversational or narrative speech (i.e., monologue, storytelling).
Either type of sample is acceptable to use; however, conversation may oﬀer a better representation of school-aged children's commu-
nication skills since that is the speaking context they primarily use to express their thoughts and ideas. Sample lengths of at least 300
to 600 syllables are recommended to obtain a valid representation of fluency performance.2 With younger school-age children, conver-
sational samples are best elicited in a play setting, using topics that pertain either to the ongoing activities or to other things that
interest the child.
An alternative to play-based conversation is to use a text-free picture book such as Mercer Mayer's "Frog, Where Are You?"22 or
David Wiesner's "Flotsam"23 as a stimulus for eliciting speech. The clinician guides the child through pages of the book, making
remarks as needed to maintain conversation with the child. The setup for an activity like this is shown in ▶Fig. 8.4a, b. The use of
simple comments and open-ended questions and requests in combination with ample periods of silence usually is suﬃcient to elicit an
adequate conversational sample. As shown in ▶Fig. 8.4b, when obtaining a speech sample with children in the middle elementary
grades and older, the clinician can identify topics beforehand that are familiar and of interest to the child, such as favorite games,
books, extracurricular activities, hobbies, and pets, and then talk with the child about them. Topics that relate to a past or future event
often elicit more speech than those that deal with immediately present objects or events.
Clinicians sometimes may find that a child does not stutter to the degree that the case history or clinical interview suggests. In such
instances, the clinician can introduce mild forms of communicative pressure or stress during the speech sample. Examples of such
clinician-administered strategies include breaking eye contact with the child as the child talks (see ▶Fig. 8.4c, d for depictions of these
strategies), increasing the pace by posing a series of questions in rapid succession, and increasing speech rate.
Measuring Frequency of Speech Disfluency
Speech disfluency frequency is a quantitative measure of
speech continuity that captures the amount of speech disflu-
ency a child produces in relation to the size of the speech sam-
ple. Data are reported as either "disfluencies per 100 syllables"
or "disfluencies per 100 words." Although the two measures do
not yield equivalent frequency scores, in most cases the dis-
crepancy between them is unlikely to be great enough to aﬀect
decisions about stuttering diagnosis or severity.24 We advise
clinicians to select a base unit (i.e., syllables or words) and use it
consistently.
Disfluency frequency measures can be based on typed or
handwritten verbatim transcripts, but this approach can be
very time-consuming. Unless a written transcript is needed for
another purpose (e.g., to analyze a child's expressive language),
it is preferable to use a coded form of transcription in lieu of a
verbatim written representation. A grid for conducting a coded
analysis of fluency is presented in ▶Fig. 8.5. Each of the 100
cells in the grid corresponds to either a syllable or a word,
depending on the clinician's preferred unit of analysis. Syllables
or words that are said without disfluency are coded with a dash
(i.e., "-"). Syllables or words produced with accompanying
disfluency are described either generally (e.g., with the letter
"D," for disfluent) or with a set of more specific codes that
indicate the types of disfluency produced. When conducting a
detailed analysis of speech disfluency, a clinician may report
frequency scores for specific types of disfluency, such as the
following:
●Part-word repetition (sounds, syllables, or part of words are
repeated, e.g., y-you; be-be-because; Washing-Washington).
●Monosyllable word repetition (e.g., She-she-she said it).
●Multisyllable word repetition (e.g., Josie-Josie-said it).
●Phrase repetition (e.g., After school, after school, I went to my
aunt's house).
●Audible sound prolongation (e.g., Wwwe went to my aunt's
house).
●Inaudible sound prolongation or block (articulatory postures
are fixed or held such that speech appears to be "blocked",
e.g., {holding the /b/ posture silently for 1 second}boy).
●Interjection (e.g., um, uh).
●Revision (e.g., She-he said it).
As shown in ▶Fig. 8.5, a total of 9 syllables were preceded
by interjection (I), 13 featured either audibly prolonged (P)
or inaudible, blocked (B) speech sounds, 7 syllables featured
8.2 A Framework for Assessing Stuttering in School-Aged Children
125

part-word (sound or syllable) repetitions (R), and there was
1 instance of revision (Rv). The first six codes shown in row 1
in the analysis grid correspond to an utterance such as [Rrr]
ain is [um] in the forecast, where the first syllable, rain, fea-
tures prolongation of /r/ and the interjection um is assigned
to the following syllable (i.e., the third syllable, in). A blank
300-syllable or word count sheet is provided in ▶Chapter 7.
When using a syllable-based analysis, only one disfluency is
counted per cell. For example, if a child began a syllable with a
repetition of the initial consonant and then prolonged the vow-
el within the same syllable (e.g., dog →[d-d-d-oooo]g), the clini-
cian could enter one code for sound/syllable repetition and one
code for sound prolongation into the cell that corresponds to
"dog." This would be counted as one disfluent syllable, with
two codes used to describe the disfluency. Alternately, the clini-
cian could simply code the syllable as containing one "complex"
disfluency (in this case, a disfluency cluster that includes both
repeated and prolonged speech. The clinician could use a
unique code to show that a cluster of stutterlike disfluencies
has occurred (e.g., CSLD).
After the coding is complete, disfluency frequency scores are
computed for each disfluency type by dividing the number of each
disfluency type by the number of coded syllables and then multi-
plying by 100. This yields the percentage of syllables with each
type of disfluency. As shown in ▶Fig. 8.5, if each cell represents
one syllable, then a total of 95 syllables were coded. The frequency
scores, expressed as "percent of syllables," for the four disfluency
types observed in the sample are computed as follows:
●Interjection frequency: = (9/95) × 100 = 9.47%.
●Revision frequency: = (1/95) × 100 = 1.05%.
●Prolongation/block frequency: = (13/95) × 100 = 13.68%.
●Part-word repetition frequency = (7/95) × 100 = 7.37%.
Repeated speech sounds and syllables or prolonged/blocked
speech sounds diﬀerentiate children who stutter from children
with typical fluency. For this reason, clinicians often refer to
them as "stutter-like disfluencies" (SLDs) and compute the
combined frequency with which a speaker produces them. For
example, in ▶Fig. 8.5, there are 20 SLDs (13 prolongations/
blocks and 7 sound/syllable repetitions) and 10 "other" (also

information from ▶Fig. 8.5 as an example, the frequencies for
these categories of disfluency are computed as follows:
●Frequency of SLDs = (20/95) × 100 = 21.05%.
●Frequency of other (non-stutter-like) disfluencies =
(10/95) × 100 = 10.53%.
The frequency across all disfluency types is computed as follows:
●Overall frequency of disfluency (all types) =
(30/95) × 100 = 31.58%.
Clinicians also commonly report the percentage of all disfluen-
cies that are stutter-like. In this example, where 20 of the 30
disfluencies are stutter-like, this is computed as follows:
●Percent of total disfluencies that are stutterlike =
(20/30) × 100 = 66.7%.
The analysis described earlier and shown in ▶Fig. 8.5 is based
on coding syllables. However, word-based analyses can also be
used. Computation procedures are mostly the same as those
used with a syllable-based analysis; however, for children who
produce words that contain more than one instance of disflu-
ency, the "percentage of words stuttered" metric will under-
count the amount of disfluency produced (e.g., [mu-]multi[pli-]
plication for "multiplication" is scored as one disfluent word,
which misses the fact that the word contains two instances
of disfluency). To account for this possibility, it is best not to
report a word-based analysis as a percentage, but instead as
"number of disfluencies per 100 words." Finally, it also is impor-
tant to note that although disfluency is a common marker of
stuttered speech, it is not the only marker of stuttered speech.
For example, a word that sounds fluent may be judged as
"stutterlike" if a speaker exhibits rhythmic finger tapping (a
"physical concomitant" of stuttering) leading into the start of
the word. In such instances, additional codes can be added to
the clinician's disfluency analysis system to document the
occurrence of such behavior. After continuity data are collected,
they can be compared to the normative data in ▶Table 8.4 for
children who stutter and typically fluent peers.
Measures of Rate and Rhythm
SLPs may wish to supplement disfluency frequency measures
with measures that capture the rate and rhythm of speech.
Several options are available.
Measuring Speech Rate
Speech rate is computed by determining the number of sylla-
bles or words a speaker produces per second or per minute of
speech.26 To compute speech rate, the clinician first randomly
selects at least 10 utterances from a recording of the child's con-
versational speech. The clinician then measures the duration
of each utterance, including any disfluent speech and within-
utterance pauses. Next, the clinician counts the number of syl-
lables (or words) in each utterance, excluding any syllables that
occur in disfluent portions of the utterance. For example, in the
utterance [On-] on the table the first iteration of the word on is
excluded from the count of the utterance's syllables, but it is
included in the timing of the utterance duration. Syllable (or
word) counts and durations are summed across utterances and
then divided to yield the average speech rate for the set of
sampled utterances.
In most cases, the more disfluency a child produces, the
slower the speech rate will be. This is because disfluency
consumes time that a child would otherwise spend producing
fluent words to communicate. In one study of school-aged
children's speech rates during conversation, narration, and sen-
tence production tasks, children who stutter spoke significantly
slower than children who did not stutter.26 Across the three
tasks, the mean speech rate for children who did not stutter
was 172.87 syllables/min (SD = 30.50) and for children who
stutter, it was 151.20 syllables/min (SD =30.6).
Speech rate is a potentially useful way to gauge a child's com-
municative competence. Not only does it provide information
about the pace at which a child articulates, but it also provides
information about the pace at which the child conveys informa-
tion to others. Speech rate reductions that result from frequent
disfluency may help explain research that shows poorer listener
recall of auditorily presented information in presentation con-
ditions that feature frequent stuttering compared to those with
infrequent stuttering.27 The reasons for this are not completely
understood; however, slow, highly disfluent speech may tax a
listener's working memory to a greater extent than minimally
disfluent speech, thus making the speech more challenging and
more eﬀortful to process.
Disfluency Duration
Disfluency duration is another useful measure when assessing
stuttered speech. Longer disfluencies disrupt speech rhythm

and information flow to a greater extent than those of rela-
tively brief duration. To compute the average duration of a
child's speech disfluencies, the clinician randomly selects at
least 10 speech disfluencies from a recording of a child's
speech. The selected disfluencies should be limited to part-
word or monosyllabic word repetitions, and prolonged or
blocked sounds. Using a stopwatch, the clinician measures
the interval between the start and end of the disfluency. For
example, the italicized segments of the following utterances
would be measured:
●b- bank (the unsuccessful attempt at advancing through the
/b/ in "bank" is timed).
●mmmoney (the duration of the prolonged /m/ is timed).
●t—-alking (the duration of the blocked /t/ is timed).
●at- at night (the initial, unsuccessful attempt of "at" is
timed).
To compute the average duration, the clinician sums the dura-
tions of each measured disfluency and then divides by the total
number of disfluencies measured. Studies of preschool- to
early-elementary-aged children who stutter show mean dura-
tions for SLDs to be in the range of 0.65 to 0.90 seconds.28,29 In a
study of teens and adults who stutter, minimum durations for
instances of stuttering averaged 0.41 seconds and maximum
durations averaged 4.32 seconds.30
Another approach to quantifying disfluency duration is to
determine the mean number of repetition units in repetitions of
sounds, syllables, or one-syllable words. For this measure, the
clinician randomly selects at least 10 disfluencies from a sample
of the child's speech. For each disfluency, the clinician counts
the number of unsuccessful attempts the child makes at com-
pleting the syllable. For example, [g-] go features one unsuc-
cessful attempt at saying the target go; thus, this repetition has
one repetition unit. Similarly, the disfluency on the word can in
the utterance "[Can- Can- Can-] Can I go home?" has three repe-
tition units. The number of repetition units in each of the ana-
lyzed disfluencies is summed and divided by the total number
of disfluencies analyzed, yielding the average number of repeti-
tion units per disfluency (Box 8.3).
Box 8.3 A Weighted Index of Stutterlike Disfluency
Ambrose and Yairi described the use of a Weighted SLD Index (WSI),32 which is a composite measure of disfluency that can diﬀerentiate
children who stutter from children who do not stutter. WSI is computed using the following formula:
[(frequency of short-element repetitions) × mean RUs per repetition] + (2 × frequency of dysrhythmic phonations).
As the formula shows, the index takes into account the frequency of two SLD categories: short-element repetitions (i.e., part-word
and monosyllable repetitions) and "dysrhythmic phonation" (i.e., sound prolongations, blocks, breaks in vowel production). The
repetitions are weighted by multiplying their frequency by the mean number of repetition units (RUs) per repetition. The dysrhythmic
phonations are weighted by multiplying their frequency by a factor of 2.
In a study of preschool-aged children, Ambrose and Yairi reported that all 54 typically fluent children had WSI scores of ≤3.99, while
all 90 children who were diagnosed as stuttering had WSI scores of ≥4.00.32 Ambrose and Yairi suggested that WSI scores of 4.00 to
9.99 were indicative of mildly severe stuttering, 10.00 to 29.99 of moderately severe stuttering, and ≥30 of severe stuttering.
Although the WSI seems to reliably diﬀerentiate preschool-aged children who stutter from those who do not, it has not, to our
knowledge, been applied to school-aged children who stutter. Nonetheless, in school-aged children in whom a diagnosis is uncertain
and the clinician lacks access to a standardized diagnostic test like the Test of Childhood Stuttering (TOCS),14 the WSI measure may be
useful for this purpose.
Measures of Speaking Eﬀort
Speaking eﬀort can be measured from two perspectives: physical
eﬀort and mental eﬀort. Researchers have used various instru-
mental approaches to assess physical eﬀort, including measures
of muscle activation (i.e., electromyography) and physical force
(e.g., strain gauges). Because these types of equipment are
unavailable in many work settings, SLPs are more likely to imple-
ment informal tools such as rating scales (described in the
following section) to assess physical eﬀort. These types of
clinician-designed data collection tools can be implemented to
examine the extent to which extraneous movements are present
during speech or immediately prior to speech initiation. This
approach can also be used to assess the extent of extraneous
sounds, excessive physical tension, atypical speech breathing,
and atypical phonation during speech.
As shown in ▶Fig. 8.1, children become increasingly aware of
their stuttering as they age. Along with this, they become
increasingly likely to respond to their stuttering with the use of
self-devised stuttering management strategies that require sub-
stantial mental eﬀort to implement. For example, children may
use strategies such as word substitution and avoidance, as well
as others like them (e.g., postponement/stalling strategies,
pretending to think about or remember something) to conceal
stuttering. Extensive use of any of these strategies requires
near-continuous self-monitoring of one's speech, as the speaker
scans upcoming speech for words that may be stuttered upon.
SLPs can collect information about the amount or nature of
mental eﬀort a child expends by using self-designed checklists
and rating scales. These instruments can be administered to
children who stutter, parents, or teachers to obtain multiple
perspectives on this aspect of stuttering. As will be discussed in
the following section, there are also normed instruments with
items or sections that address speaking eﬀort and coping strat-
egies for stuttering.
Informal Rating Scales
Informal rating scales are useful for evaluating many aspects
of stuttered speech; however, most commonly, they are used
to make global ratings of stuttering severity. Parents' and
clinicians' severity ratings are especially useful because they
School-Age Children
128

provide the clinician with information about children's stuttering
in settings beyond the clinic.33 Scores from these rating scales
have been shown to be both reliable and highly correlated with
SLPs' stuttering frequency and severity measures.34,35 ▶Fig. 8.6
contains an example of a 9-point rating scale that has text labels
attached to some of the scale numbers. On the scale, a rating of 1
corresponds with typical speech, 2 corresponds with relatively
mild stuttering, and 9 corresponds to very severe stuttering.
Examples of other aspects of stuttering that can be rated
include stuttering frequency, disfluency duration, muscle tense-
ness, and speaking eﬀort. Informal rating scales can also be
adapted to assess the frequency and intensity of emotions such
as fear and anxiety during speech, as well as speakers' level of
satisfaction with their speech or success in managing stuttering.
Ratings of speech naturalness are particularly helpful to use
near the completion of a stuttering treatment program, espe-
cially when the intervention has heavily emphasized the use of
controlled articulation rate to manage stuttered speech.36 The
clinician uses the rating to provide the child with feedback
about the extent to which speech sounds "natural" (i.e., rate,
prosody, and inflection sounds like a typical speaker). Natural-
ness ratings can also be used to describe a child's speech in
various settings (e.g., during a specific speaker task, over the
course of an entire day).
Norm-Referenced Tests of Speech Fluency
Norm-referenced tests that are used in the assessment of stut-
tering incorporate standard procedures for collecting and ana-
lyzing speech samples and they provide the clinician with
standardized scores such as percentile ranks. These features
allow clinicians to compare the performance of the child who is
being assessed against a reference group (e.g., children who do
stutter, children who stutter) and to evaluate changes in a
child's stuttering over time.
Stuttering Severity Instrument, Fourth Edition
The Stuttering Severity Instrument, Fourth Edition (SSI-4)20 is a
norm-referenced test that clinicians use to rate the severity of a
speaker's stuttering. The SSI-4 contains separate norms for
preschool-aged, school-aged, and teens/adult-aged individuals
who stutter. The stuttering severity rating on the SSI-4 is organ-
ized around a speaking task and, for children who read at a min-
imum of a third-grade level, a reading task. The speaking task
on the SSI-4 uses pictures and verbal prompts to elicit speech
samples in and outside of the clinic. After these samples are
obtained, the clinician analyzes them to compute the percentage
of stuttered syllables per task (see the section Speech Continuity
Measures). The speech samples are also used to determine the
average duration of the three longest instances of stuttering that
occur. The child's stuttering frequency and duration measures
are converted to weighted "task scores" using tables on the SSI-4
scoring form. The clinician also rates the child's speech for the
presence of "physical concomitants" using four 6-point rating
scales that capture the extent to which behaviors such as dis-
tracting sounds, facial grimaces, and extraneous head and
extremity movements accompany instances of stuttering. The
score from the physical concomitants scale is added to the
weighted frequency and duration scores to yield a total score,
which is then compared to SSI-4 norms to yield a percentile rank
and a corresponding "severity equivalent" (i.e., a descriptive label
such as "very mild," "mild," "moderate, and so forth).
The SSI-4 is normed only on speakers who stutter. Thus, the
main use of the test is to compare the person who is being as-
sessed to other people who stutter for the purpose of obtaining
a severity rating of the person's stuttering. Because the SSI-4 is
not normed on typical speakers, it is less useful for diﬀerentiat-
ing stuttering from typical disfluency. Nonetheless, the frequent
presence of disfluencies that are characteristic of stuttering,
lengthy disfluencies, and disfluencies that are accompanied by
physical concomitants are usually suﬃcient to help a clinician
decide independently whether a child should be classified as a
person who stutters.
Test of Childhood Stuttering
The TOCS21 is normed on 4- to 12-year-old children to diagnose
stuttering and determine its severity. The TOCS has two norm-
referenced assessment components: the Speech Fluency Measure
and the Observational Rating Scales (ORS). The test also includes a
third, optional section, Supplemental Clinical Assessment Activities,
which contains materials and methods for conducting clinical
interviews and informal quantitative analyses of speech fluency
like those described previously in this chapter (i.e., disfluency fre-
quency scores, disfluency duration scores, speech rate, stuttering
frequency scores). Scales for rating speech naturalness and docu-
menting the frequency with which various associated behaviors
are provided as well.
The Speech Fluency Measure portion of the TOCS takes about
20 minutes to administer and features four types of talking
tasks: rapid picture naming, sentence production, conversation,
and narration. The ORS portion of the TOCS, completed by pa-
rents and teachers, includes two nine-item subscales, one that
measures the extent to which stuttering symptoms are present
in the child's speech and another that measures the consequen-
ces of stuttering (e.g., social and communicative penalties
resulting from disfluency). The ORS, which provides the clinician
with a norm-referenced measure of the child's speech fluency
and consequences of stuttering in settings beyond the immediate
testing environment, is further described in the norm-referenced
assessment section later.
In contrast to the SSI-4, the TOCS is normed on both typical
children and children who stutter. This makes it possible not
only to obtain an estimate of stuttering severity but also to
make statistical conclusions about the extent to which a child's
Fig. 8.6 Example of a 9-point rating scale that
can be used for rating stuttering severity.
8.2 A Framework for Assessing Stuttering in School-Aged Children
129

speech fluency is like that of children in the general population.
On the TOCS' Speech Fluency Measure, a child's performance on
the speaking tasks is compared to both typical children (i.e.,
children without a diagnosis of stuttering) and children who
stutter. These comparisons are based on the frequency with
which children produce part-word repetitions, whole-word
repetitions, and prolonged or blocked speech sounds (i.e., the
disfluency types that are most characteristic of stuttering).
Because children who do not stutter rarely produce repetitions
of sounds, syllables, and words and prolonged/blocked speech
sounds, an individual who produces even a modest number of
these disfluencies on the test will drop outside of the normal
range. Data from the ORS are used similarly. That is, compari-
sons between a child's rating scores and the test norms provide
both diagnostic and severity information that is based on
parent and teacher perspectives—individuals who interact with
the child regularly outside of the assessment setting.
Norm-Referenced Scales of Stuttering
Experiences
Behavior Assessment Battery for School-Aged
Children Who Stutter
The Behavior Assessment Battery for School-Aged Children who
Stutter37 contains three stand-alone rating scales, each of which
is normed. The first of these, the Speech Situation Checklist (SSC)
consists of two 50-item self-rating scales. The essential content
of the items on these two subscales is the same; however, on
the SSC-Emotional Reactions version, children rate the extent to
which they are afraid to talk in various situations. On the SSC-
Speech Disruption version (SSC-SD), children rate the amount of
"trouble" that they have with their speech in various situations.
Examples of contexts that children rate on both subscales
include talking with certain types of people (e.g., adults,
same-age boys and girls), performing various speech acts (e.g.,
answering questions, making a class presentation), and talking
in specific contexts (e.g., on the telephone, arguing with a
friend). The SSC is normed on children with typical fluency
(ages 6-13 years) and children who stutter (ages 6-15 years).
The norms consist of mean scores for each age level and their
associated standard deviations.
The second component of the Behavior Assessment Battery for
School-Aged Children who Stutter, the Behavior Checklist (BCL), is
also a self-rating instrument. It consists of 50 items that deal
with specific stuttering-related behaviors. Children are asked to
indicate via a yes/no response whether they do various behav-
iors "to help (their) sound or words come out without trouble."
Examples include pressing the lips together, clicking the tongue,
and tightening stomach muscles. Like the SSC, norms for the
BCL consist of means and associated standard deviations, for
each year from ages 6 through 13 years for children who do not
stutter and 6 through 15 years for children who stutter.
The third component of the Behavior Assessment Battery for
School-Aged Children who Stutter, the Communication Attitude
Test (CAT) is also a self-rating instrument. Children indicate
their agreement with 33 statements via true/false responses.
Examples of test items include the following: "It is hard for me
to talk to people" and "People worry about the way I talk." The
norms for the CAT are structured like the norms for the SSC and
the BCL. There is a revised version of the CAT (Children's
Attitudes About Talking-Revised, or CAT-R),38 consisting of 32
items, many of which are worded similarly to items on the CAT.
Norms for the CAT-R feature mean scores and associated stand-
ard deviations for each year from ages 7 through 11 for children
who do not stutter and children who stutter.
Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience
of Stuttering-Student Version
The Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering-
School-Age version (OASES-S)39 is a norm-referenced rating
scale designed for use with 7- to 12-year-old children who stut-
ter. It is designed to provide information about the impact of
stuttering from the speaker's perspective. The OASES-S contains
60 items, which are organized into four sections: General Infor-
mation (15 items), Speaker's Reactions (20 items), Daily Commu-
nication (15 items), and Quality of Life (10 items). Each item is
accompanied by a 5-point rating scale. Children who stutter are
asked to read each test item and then circle the number on the
scale that corresponds to their perspective on the item's con-
tent.
In the General Information section, children rate test items
such as the extent of their stuttering-related knowledge and
feelings about speaking. In the Speaker's Reactions sections,
children rate how often they experience various emotions
when thinking about stuttering, how often their stuttered
speech is accompanied by physical and avoidance behaviors,
and the extent to which they agree with various statements
about stuttering. In the Daily Communication section, children
rate the degree of stuttering-related communication diﬃculties
they experience in various speaking situations at school, home,
and during social activities. In the Quality of Life section, they
rate the extent to which stuttering adversely aﬀects their life.
Test of Childhood Stuttering: Observational
Rating Scales
As mentioned previously, the ORS portion of TOCS includes two
nine-item subscales that parents and teachers complete to
provide the SLP with information about the child's stuttering.
Nine items are rated to indicate how frequently the child has
exhibited the described stuttering behavior(s) during the pre-
vious 2 months. Six of the nine items pertain to disfluency char-
acteristics that align with stuttering and the remaining three
items pertain to the frequency with which the child's speech is
disfluent in diﬀerent settings. Alternately, on the Disfluency-
Related Consequences section, parents and teachers rate the fre-
quency with which the child exhibits physical movements,
emotions, coping mechanisms, and social penalties because of
stuttering. Findings from one recent study show that parents'
ratings of their child on the TOCS-ORS align well with direct
observations of the child's stuttering-related behavior made by
experienced SLPs.40
Additional Areas for Assessment
Phonology and Language
A significant percentage of children who receive treatment for
stuttering in school-based settings will also qualify for treatment
School-Age Children
130

of concomitant disorders that aﬀect either speech sound produc-
tion and/or receptive and expressive language.13 Thus, during an
assessment, the clinician should be alert for diﬃculty in these
areas. In the cases where there is cause for concern, the SLP can
select from a range of formal, norm-referenced tests and informal
procedures to examine the child's functioning in greater detail.
Children who stutter—even those with typically developing
speech and language—are more likely to stutter when saying
utterances that are motorically or syntactically complex.29,41
Clinicians can design speech tasks that feature varying degrees
of motor complexity (e.g., a picture-naming task with one-,
two-, and three-syllable target responses) or language complex-
ity (e.g., a sentence imitation task with stimuli that diﬀer in the
syntactic diﬃculty). Such tasks can provide valuable informa-
tion about how the child's fluency varies with speech and
language complexity.
Another way of examining the relationship between fluency
and language complexity is for the clinician to intentionally
vary the types of utterances they use during conversation with
the child. For example, a clinician's closed-ended requests for
information are likely to elicit short, simple responses from the
child (e.g., SLP: What color is it? →Child: Red), while statements
and open-ended requests for information tend to elicit longer,
more complex utterances (e.g., SLP: I like turtles because they
move slowly. Child: I like cheetahs because they are fast. SLP: Tell
me about your birthday party. Child: It was really fun. First, we
played games and then we opened presents. After that, we had
cake). Informal probes like these are straightforward to design
and administer, and thus easy to embed in an assessment pro-
tocol. They can provide useful information about fluency varia-
bility with any type of case, even those for whom articulation
and language functioning are not identified as areas of concern.
Stuttering occurs within the context of utterances that
require phonological, syntactic, and semantic planning. SLPs
should also consider the possibility that a child who is referred
for stuttering assessment may, instead, be demonstrating signs
of an undiagnosed language impairment. Several researchers
have reported that children with language impairment produce
revisions, interjections, long silent pauses, and even SLDs more
frequently than children with typical language skills.42,43,44
With such cases, the frequency of SLDs is usually not suﬃcient
to warrant a diagnosis of stuttering. The presentation of this
type of "borderline" disfluency profile may be a sign of lan-
guage impairment rather than stuttering and thus might
prompt the clinician to conduct a comprehensive language
assessment.
Temperament
Temperament is a biological construct that accounts for individ-
ual diﬀerences in emotional, motor, and attentional reactivity,
and the extent to which a child is capable of self-regulating
these reactive components.19 Some recent theories of stuttering
include temperament as a key factor in both the onset and
development of the disorder.45,46 There are diﬀerent views on
whether temperament should be considered in assessment or
treatment of stuttering in children.47 One main argument for
assessing temperament is that information about this aspect
of a child's functioning may help in making decisions about
stuttering therapy. For example, a treatment program that
emphasizes parent corrective feedback to the child about their
stuttering may not be the best choice for a child who reacts
strongly to any sort of evaluation or correction. More broadly, it
is best practice to adjust assessment or therapy procedures for
children who are extremely shy, visibly uncomfortable in a
clinical environment or with an unfamiliar adult, or who show
concern about their own performance during an evaluation or in
therapy (see ▶Chapter 11 School-Age Children in this volume for
descriptions of therapy approaches for stuttering in school-aged
children). An opposing view is that presently, there is not enough
evidence to support the routine assessment of a child's tempera-
ment as part of a stuttering evaluation or treatment.47
When a clinician plans to evaluate temperament as part of a
broader assessment, several options are available for the
school-aged population. The first is to informally collect infor-
mation about the child's emotional, behavioral, and attentional
characteristics through a case history form or clinical interview
(▶Table 8.2). Clinicians could ask about how the child responds
to new situations/people, positive/exciting events, diﬃcult
tasks, losing a game, not getting one's way, and being corrected.
Some of these situations often occur during the assessment,
allowing the clinician to observe whether the child has strong
reactions (e.g., withdrawal, expressions of anxiety) or diﬃculty
coping with such reactions. A second option, available for
younger school-aged children up to 8 years old, is to administer
the Children's Behavior Questionnaire-Very Short Form (CBQ-
VSF).48 This formal, norm-referenced tool provides information
about temperament. Children demonstrating behaviors indica-
tive of strong reactions and low levels of regulation may not
only benefit from stuttering treatment that gently introduces
challenges but also strategies for regulating such reactions,
especially if communication related.
Drawing Conclusions and Making
Recommendations
Diagnosing Stuttering
Diagnosis of stuttering in the school-aged population generally
is a straightforward process. For most children who are diag-
nosed with stuttering, the following three criteria will be met
within a 300- to 600-syllable sample: (1) repetitions of sounds,
syllables, or words and prolonged or blocked sounds (i.e., SLDs)
on ≥3% of syllables; (2) the combined frequency of these disflu-
ency types will constitute the majority of all disfluencies the
child produces (i.e., >50%); and (3) one of these SLD types
will be the most frequent disfluency type the child produces.
▶Table 8.4 contains additional information about what is
typical of children's fluency.
As children progress through the elementary school years,
they tend to become increasingly aware of their disfluencies
and can describe the experience of stuttering accurately and in
detail. In fact, during the assessment, a school-aged child may
be able to tell the clinician that they stutter. In these cases, the
clinician's primary job is to determine the accuracy of the
child's self-diagnosis and, when stuttering is present, describe
its characteristics, severity, and impact on communication.
Occasionally, there are cases where the diagnosis of stutter-
ing is unclear at the conclusion of the assessment. For example,
a child's frequency of SLD may not be particularly high, and the
8.2 A Framework for Assessing Stuttering in School-Aged Children
131

child does not seem to be able to describe speaking experiences
in detail. In the cases where the frequency of the child's stutter-
ing is borderline, the clinician can look for other markers of
stuttered speech, detailed in the previous section on informal
measures, such as mean RUs, SLD duration, presence of behav-
iorally complex or clustered SLDs, or marked presence of physi-
cal concomitants during speech, to clarify the diagnosis.
In the cases where parents report that their child stutters at
home but the child does not stutter during the standard assess-
ment tasks administered in clinic, the clinician can use the com-
municative stressors discussed earlier in this chapter and other
beyond-clinic speech samples (i.e., school-based speech sample)
to see if the behaviors that are causing concern can be elicited.
Alternately, the clinician can use normed parent- and teacher-
based rating scales (e.g., the TOC-ORS) or data from clinical
interviews to confirm that the child stutters. Parental concern
about stuttering has been shown to be a reliable indicator of
the presence of stuttering in children, so much so that it has
been used as an inclusionary criterion for stuttering group clas-
sification in many research studies. Finally, a child's responses
on self-rating measures that assess the severity and/or impact
of stuttering on quality of life, participation, and so forth (e.g.,
OASES-S, Behavior Assessment Battery, CAT-R) can help the
clinician arrive at a diagnosis by providing information about
the extent to which stuttered speech adversely aﬀects the child.
Determining Severity
Stuttering
severity
is
a
multidimensional
construct.
One
approach to describing it is to quantify the extent to which SLDs
and accompanying behaviors are observed and measured in the
child's speech. Norm-referenced tests such as the SSI-4 and
TOCS provide this type of quantitative measure of severity, as
do normed self-rating scales like the SSC-SD and speech fluency
measures
obtained
from
samples
of
the
child's
speech.
Although this information helps the clinician, child, and parent
get a sense of how the child speaks, quantitative measures of
speech fluency do not always accurately reflect the extent to
which stuttering adversely impacts a child's day-to-day life. For
example, a child might earn a rating of "mild" on the SSI-4, yet
report experiencing moderate to severe participation restric-
tions and elevated anxiety in classroom situations that require
speaking. In this case, a more thorough statement of severity,
such as "mildly stuttered speech that has a moderate negative
impact on communication and psychological well-being," is
needed. The main point here is that the combination of speech-
based measures of stuttering severity along with measures that
capture the cognitive and emotional consequences of stuttering
will yield the most valid severity rating and will better inform
recommendations for therapy.
Making Recommendations
At the conclusion of an assessment, the clinician conveys
assessment results and accompanying recommendations to the
parent and, when applicable, the child. At this point, the thera-
peutic process commences. The clinician begins by sharing with
the parent and child the most helpful things to do in the coming
weeks and months. The presentation of recommendations at
the end of the assessment provides an opportunity to educate
parents and the child about stuttering and what can be done to
help the child reach their goals. Such education is important as
research indicates that people are more likely to engage in help-
ful behaviors when they hold accurate beliefs about stuttering.49
Assessment recommendations for school-age children typi-
cally address the following issues:
●Is treatment recommended? If so,
- Why is it necessary and what are the general goals?
- What type and intensity of treatment is recommended, and
who will be involved in the process?
- Is the child's or family's participation in a stuttering support
group recommended?
- Are there other concerns related to stuttering that need to
be addressed (e.g., bullying)?
- Are there barriers to delivering treatment (e.g.,
transportation or scheduling problems)?
●If treatment for stuttering is not recommended:
- Is assessment or treatment for other speech-language
disorders needed?
- Is a reassessment of the child's speech fluency needed in
the future? If so, when?
- What should the parent or child do if concerns about
stuttering persist or worsen?
●Regardless of whether treatment is recommended:
- Are referrals to other professionals warranted?
Treatment Eligibility Considerations in Public
School Settings
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which is
a federal law in the United States, indicates that public educa-
tion should provide free and appropriate services to children
with disabilities so that they are "prepared to lead productive
and independent adult lives, to the maximum extent possible"
(c5 Aii).50 Considering the ways that untreated stuttering can
adversely impact children's lives, addressing stuttering is con-
sistent with the IDEA's aim. Relative to assessment, IDEA stipu-
lates that the evaluation should "use a variety of assessment
tools and strategies to gather relevant functional, developmen-
tal, and academic information, including information provided
by the parent" (b2 A). The law also states that the local educa-
tional agency should "not use any single measure or assessment
as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child
with a disability or determining an appropriate educational
program for the child" (b2 B). For this reason, clinicians in the
United States who work in settings where qualification for serv-
ices is linked to a disfluency frequency threshold can point to
this stipulation in federal law (which supersedes local policies)
as support for considering more than one type of assessment
measure to determine whether a child qualifies for services.
As we have detailed in this chapter, a multidimensional
approach to assessment is useful when evaluating school-aged
children who stutter.51 Such an approach is needed when the
goal is to demonstrate that a child who is doing well academi-
cally may not be functioning well educationally. In the language
of IDEA, the term "educational" has been interpreted as including
learning in the domains of social, emotional, and interpersonal
development. Thus, even though a student may be passing, or
even excelling, grade-wise in their academic work, the child's
stuttering still may negatively impact educational performance.
For example, stuttering may result in the child being excluded by
School-Age Children
132

classmates from academic activities, and it may cause the child
to withdraw from speaking situations, thereby limiting their
ability to fully benefit from social, emotional, and interpersonal
experiences that are central to public education.52
8.3 Case Scenario
The following case study of a school-aged child, "Jake," illus-
trates key concepts from this chapter. It includes information
from the intake form completed by the parents and information
from the clinical interviews with the parents and Jake. While
reading the case description, notice what questions need to be
addressed. After the case information is presented, you will be
asked what should be included in the remaining components of
the assessment.
8.3.1 Intake Information
Jake is an 8-year-old boy and a rising third grader at the time
of his current assessment. His parents scheduled him for a
90-minute evaluation at a university speech-language-hearing
clinic to address concerns that they had about his long-standing
diﬃculties with stuttering.
8.3.2 Clinical Interview
In the clinical interview, the clinician began by asking the
parents to describe their concerns about Jake's speech fluency.
The parents indicated that they first noticed symptoms of stut-
tering—primarily repetitions of sounds and syllables—in Jake's
speech when he was 4 years old, but stated the symptoms
seemed to resolve within about 6 months. They stated that Jake
began showing symptoms of stuttered speech again after start-
ing first grade, but the stuttered speech was mainly limited to
"stressful situations." Symptoms at the start of first grade
included repeating word-initial sounds and syllables as well as
prolonging and blocking on consonant sounds, sometimes for
several seconds. The parents reported that at the midpoint of
second grade (about 4 months prior to the third grade assess-
ment), the frequency of Jake's stuttering increased significantly,
was present in most situations, and consisted primarily of pro-
longed and blocked consonant sounds, which were sometimes
accompanied by eyelid closing, "tense looking muscles," and
facial grimacing. His parents stated that they and Jake became
concerned about the changes in his stuttering, spurring them to
schedule the present evaluation.
Jake's parents reported that, during the 6 months preceding
the current assessment, he had become very aware of his stut-
tering and that, when he was unable to communicate, he some-
times sighed loudly, groaned, and said, "Never mind." They
also reported that he occasionally reacted to his stuttering by
running away to his bedroom. Overall, however, Jake's parents
reported that he displayed appropriate social skills when inter-
acting with peers and that he participated in most or all com-
munication situations.
Related to family history, Jake's mother reported that her
brother (Jake's uncle) stuttered noticeably from childhood
through adolescence. Although the uncle's stuttering im-
proved greatly by early adulthood, Jake's mother stated that
her brother still stutters in some situations and that he
"avoids speaking in front of large groups." In addition, Jake's
father reported that he had received services from an SLP as
child because of diﬃculties with "pronouncing some of his
speech sounds."
The parents reported no major concerns about Jake's devel-
opment other than his stuttered speech and his sounding "a
little less mature" than his classmates because he "says certain
sounds wrong." Although the parents described Jake's overall
academic abilities as "average to above average," they expressed
concern about his reading comprehension, observing that he
sometimes does not recall details about what he has read. They
also indicated that in the past few months he "does not explain
things as clearly" as he previously did.
When the clinician interviewed Jake about how he felt about
his stuttering and his ability to communicate with others, he
reported that he felt "great." However, when the clinician
depersonalized the interview by asking how other children
might feel when they stuttered in a conversation with friends,
Jake reported they would feel upset and embarrassed.
8.3.3 Clinical Application Questions for
the Case Study
1. Which questions from ▶Table 8.2 did the intake and case
history help to answer?
2. What questions remain after reading this case summary?
3. Based on the remaining questions, use ▶Table 8.2 to develop
an assessment battery.
4. After developing your assessment battery, check ▶Table 8.1
to see that all components of the ICF model are being
evaluated.
8.4 Future Directions
Although research has led to the development of useful tools
for assessing stuttering in school-aged children, there is room
for improving the accuracy, reliability, and eﬃciency of these
clinical instruments and measures. We expect that, in the near
future, advances in speech recognition technology will lead to
widespread use of automated analyses of stuttered speech sam-
ples. Such analyses will be performed much faster and more re-
liably than today's manual analyses and should yield detailed
information about not only stuttering-related disfluency but
also other relevant aspects of communication performance such
as speech rate, disfluency duration, and language functioning.
In the absence of fully automated tools, current web-based
tools, such as those associated with FluencyBank,58 provide
computer-based analyses that are created from clinician-
entered transcripts and other learning tools for speech fluency
and rate analysis.
It is also worth considering that although linguistic context
and demand are included in most multifactorial models of stut-
tering, there is a lack of evidence for including formal language
assessment, beyond a basic screening, as a standard component
of a stuttering evaluation for school-aged children. Similarly, it
is unknown whether routine formal assessment of tempera-
ment is necessary for this age group. Further research will help
clinicians gain clarity on these issues.
8.4 Future Directions

8.5 Conclusion
Assessment is the bedrock of the clinical management of stut-
tering. Use of an assessment battery that is based on the WHO's
ICF model helps clinicians develop a comprehensive under-
standing of a child's speech fluency by yielding information
about factors necessary to diagnose stuttering, describe its
severity and life impact, and weigh the need for treating it. Clini-
cians can develop a comprehensive understanding of children's
stuttering by conducting a combination of formal and informal
measures. Although the SLP assumes primary responsibility for
planning and administering an assessment, school-aged children
and their families should be involved in the process so that issues
that are important to them are addressed. Their perspectives on
stuttering will not only provide clinicians with information about
stuttering severity but also foster the development of treatment
plans that are aimed at improving not only children's speech
fluency but also their communication eﬀectiveness and general
quality of life.

9 Adolescents and Adults
Eric S. Jackson and Anthony DiLollo
Abstract
The purpose of this chapter is to describe procedures for the
assessment of stuttering in adults and adolescents, along with
the rationale for our approach to evaluation. Although stutter-
ing is conventionally considered to be primarily a disorder of
speech or speech fluency, most of what we will discuss relates
to key characteristics of stuttering other than observable
speech (dis)fluency. This focus on under-the-surface features
of stuttering is critical because, as we will detail, measuring
surface behaviors alone does not provide a comprehensive
picture of stuttering or its impact. In fact, relying on surface
measures can greatly underestimate the magnitude of the
stuttering problem. As such, for many teens and adults who
stutter, focusing on the overt behaviors of stuttering becomes
secondary in both the assessment and therapeutic processes.
After a brief introduction, which describes the purposes of
stuttering assessment for adolescents and adults, we will pro-
vide an outline of the essential components in the diagnostic
process. Resources to assist clinicians in assessment will be
discussed and examples, including a case study, will be pro-
vided. Our goal is for readers to understand the entirety of
both the principles and procedures in the assessment process
and how to implement them when working with adolescents
and adults who stutter.
Keywords: stuttering, fluency disorder, assessment, variability,
anticipation, adults who stutter, adolescents who stutter
Clinical Note
Some readers may take issue with the term "problem" when
describing stuttering, as it may ultimately contribute to the
stigmatization of stuttering. We use this term because if an
individual comes to us for therapy, stuttering is likely a
problem or challenge in their mind. Indeed, the purpose of
therapy for all adolescents and adults who stutter is to reduce
the magnitude of this problem rather than any individual
feature of stuttering (e.g., number of disfluencies).
9.1 Introduction
9.1.1 Basic Assumptions
To begin, it is safe to say that there is no universal agreement
about the best way to assess stuttering. The procedures dis-
cussed in this chapter are based on a number of assumptions
about adolescents and adults who stutter, derived from a
number of sources including, most importantly, people who
stutter. These premises direct the diagnostic process and influ-
ence the choices we make for assessment, including the ques-
tions we ask, the procedures we use, and our interpretation of
the findings.
The first, and arguably most important assumption is that
adolescents and adults who stutter—hereafter referred to as
"adults who stutter" or "people who stutter" because adoles-
cents have more in common with adults who stutter than with
children who stutter—have lived with the disorder for a decade
or more (see ▶Chapter 1 in this volume). Given the relatively
long duration of stuttering, we can reasonably conclude that
they are unlikely to completely recover.1 In other words, they
will experience at least some amount of stuttering for the rest
of their lives, regardless of therapy. This first assumption leads
to our second, which is that unless we discover during intake
and evaluation that the person exhibits cluttering or neurogenic
stuttering (see ▶Chapter 16 in this volume), we assume that
they began to stutter in early childhood (i.e., they exhibit
"developmental" stuttering). For these reasons, the information
in this chapter will focus primarily on the assessment of the
disorder of stuttering that begins during the preschool years.
One's history with stuttering is likely to have led them to try
various ways of dealing with the problem. These attempts can
include speech-language or psychologically oriented therapy;
advice from well-meaning (but often misinformed) relatives,
teachers, and friends; information found in books, booklets,
pamphlets, and on the Internet; or self-taught strategies.2
Individual experiences with stuttering have likely impacted their
educational, social, and vocational experiences.3,4 Although
not all of these things will be true for all people who stutter, at
least some of them will be true for most people who stutter.
9.1.2 Client Expectations: A Word about
Controlled Speech versus Spontaneous
Fluency
Many clients come to us with the primary goal of being fluent,
or not stuttering, and it is both reasonable and expected for
speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to adhere to their wishes.
Although the desire for increased fluency is easy to understand
(why wouldn't someone want to talk without stuttering and
without thinking about the mechanics of speech?), the clinician
must discuss with the client what is realistic. Although learning
to use diﬀerent speaking strategies can increase the control that
a speaker has over their speech mechanism, spontaneous or
natural fluency may not be attainable, especially for people
with long histories of stuttering, at least not all of the time.
Rather, the goal is controlled fluency, or "less eﬀortful stuttering,"
or "managed stuttering." That is, the speaker learns a diﬀerent
way of talking and stuttering, with less eﬀort, and this is
considered to be the optimal outcome of therapy.
It is important to appreciate that behavioral approaches such
as stuttering modification and fluency shaping do not directly
target increased spontaneous or natural fluency. As mentioned
earlier, they focus on teaching the person how to either stutter
more easily (i.e., with less physical tension or with shorter
duration) or produce controlled speech. It is also essential to
recognize that speech techniques used to intentionally change
how one uses their articulatory and phonatory systems to
produce speech are actually at odds with the automaticity that
underlies spontaneous fluency. Increased automatic or sponta-
136

neous fluency can emerge when these new ways of talking and
stuttering are consistently practiced over time. In this way,
fluency should be considered a distal, not immediate, goal of
therapy. All of this is to say that from the very beginning, it is
the responsibility of the SLP to provide information about the
nature of stuttering and stuttering therapy. It is not to limit
goals in therapy for people who stutter. Rather, goals should be
realistic and achievable. These early discussions are likely to
include education about stuttering, improving attitudes about
stuttering, changing one's self-concept as a person who stutters,
stuttering with less eﬀort, and increasing one's ability to say
what they want to say regardless of the amount of stuttering.
9.1.3 Impact of Stuttering and What
Needs to Change
An important goal of assessment is to help the person who stut-
ters to expand their thinking about therapy goals beyond
speech fluency. In our experience, when a client tells us that
they want to be fluent, or they want to stop stuttering, what
they often mean is that they want to speak without thinking
about stuttering. In other words, they want to be spontaneously
fluent. Most, if not all, of the stuttering clients we see will con-
tinue to stutter to some degree throughout their lives. And for
many individuals who stutter, all it takes is one instance of stut-
tering in a situation that they deem is especially important or
during which they do not want to stutter to experience the
negative thoughts, emotions, or impact on their quality of life
that were the very reasons they sought therapy in the first
place. Therefore, our position is that the primary goal of an
assessment should not be quantifying how much a person stut-
ters, but rather how they are responding physically, psychologi-
cally, and emotionally to stuttering. Identifying these responses
to stuttering will allow the SLP to develop an intervention plan
specific to the individual that is focused on how stuttering is an
obstacle or problem in the client's life.
9.2 A Clinical Definition of
Stuttering
A working definition of the stuttering disorder is critical to
assessment because it determines the variables we want to
observe and measure as we undertake the diagnostic process.
Our clinical definition reflects our view, described earlier in this
chapter, that stuttering is a complex phenomenon comprised of
a spectrum of features that range from unobservable to observ-
able and that vary both within and across individuals who stut-
ter. By the time a person who stutters reaches adolescence, they
have undoubtedly experienced many social interactions in
which their speech system has broken down—and they have
had to learn to cope with or manage these situations. For exam-
ple, how does one handle a situation in which they introduce
themselves in a classroom and stutter when saying their name,
and someone jokes that they "don't know their own name"?
They may not care, or they may remember this mocking the
next time they introduce themselves in a similar situation.
What do they do? Do they ask the teacher if they can opt out of
introducing themselves? Do they leave the room when it is
their turn so that they can avoid potential negative listener
reactions? Or do they forge ahead, potentially flooded with
anxiety until it is their turn to speak, and hope for the best? The
point here is that as a result of a neurobiological condition that
manifests itself intermittently (i.e., stuttering behavior), people
who stutter are forced to make decisions that nonstuttering
individuals do not have to make, particularly in reconciling their
desire to speak with potential listener or environmental reac-
tions. And this is what we, as SLPs, are assessing—the role that
stuttering plays in shaping an individual's everyday experiences.
Historically, the biggest challenge clinicians have faced is
finding ways to observe and quantify the unobservable or
"under-the-surface" characteristics of stuttering. These include
cognitive and aﬀective or emotional constructs such as antici-
pation, avoidance, fear, shame, guilt, and others. Listeners hear
and see surface disfluency and, as a result, this is what has typi-
cally been emphasized in assessment and therapy. The problem
with this focus is that there can be a discrepancy between what
is produced and seen on the surface and what is experienced
beneath the surface. Thankfully, in recent years a growing body
of research investigating these "unobservable" aspects of stut-
tering has led to a shift away from surface-centric approaches
to assessment, and one area that has received a significant
amount of attention due to its central role in how speakers
respond to stuttering is anticipation.
9.3 Anticipation: Stuttering Below
the Surface
Surface breaks in speech fluency do not always provide a
reliable measure of a moment of stuttering. This is because chil-
dren, teens, and adults who stutter frequently anticipate when
they are about to stutter and can quickly engage in strategies to
alter speech, such as avoiding or concealing, or using a speaking
strategy.5,6 Anticipation refers to the speaker's awareness that
something has gone wrong during speech-language planning
and that they will stutter overtly if they do not do something to
alter the ongoing process of speech production (e.g., by avoid-
ing or changing a word). ▶Fig. 9.1 presents a conceptual time-
line of the stuttering event for a single word.
Clinical Note
We currently do not have a good understanding of what goes
"wrong" in the speech-language systems of people who stutter
when they stutter. There are some data that suggest that this
glitch is represented at a neural level, but we are far from
understanding the neural processes that underlie stuttering
events. However, we find that using the term glitch is helpful
to the speaker because it indicates that something goes wrong
prior to actually producing the word, and the speaker can learn
to respond to this in a way that is helpful or adaptive to them.
We are hopeful that the coming years will shine light on the
neural and other processes that lead to the manifestation of
overt stuttering events.
As shown in ▶Fig. 9.1, the speaker first has intention to say a
word. During the processes of speech-language planning, there
9.3 Anticipation: Stuttering Below the Surface
137

is some sort of "glitch"—something goes wrong in the speaker's
speech-language system. The speaker then becomes aware that
something has gone
wrong, and is faced with a decision regarding how to respond
(e.g., stall, disguise, use a speaking strategy). The speaker then
produces the word. In many cases, the speaker may choose to
avoid the word, or speaking, completely, because the risk of stut-
tering overtly outweighs the benefit of saying what they want to
say, at least at that moment. Also, there may be many instances in
which the speaker is not aware that something has gone wrong,
and therefore does not anticipate stuttering. This could happen
due to the inherently rapid nature of speech (e.g., there is not
enough time to become aware), or because the speaker is simply
not paying attention to their speech. However, it is important to
note that given enough time, people can predict (or anticipate)
overt stuttering moments with a high degree of accuracy. As such,
anticipation is a central feature of stuttering because the things
that people who stutter do in reaction to, or to cope with,
impending stuttering shape both their observable stuttering
behaviors and their experience of stuttering in general. Thus, the
client's anticipation of stuttering is the problem that SLPs should
understand, explore, and identify.
Clinical Note
Dean Williams, an SLP, researcher, and person who stuttered,
wrote a lot about the stutterer's perception that stuttering is
something out of their control—that it just happens, they don't
know why, and as a result, doing anything about it is diﬃcult if
not impossible. This is a very passive perspective of the
problem—stuttering is going to happen and take me with it,
and there's little I can do about it. Williams encouraged SLPs to
help their clients develop a more active perspective of their
problem (i.e., "...stuttering is something that I am doing").
Although the initial breakdown in speech is not under the
speaker's control, how they respond to this breakdown certainly
is, or at least speakers can learn how to increase their sense of
control over how their stuttering physically manifests itself.7
Defining and measuring such unobservable stuttering charac-
teristics as anticipation is challenging. Most of what we know
about these under-the-surface experiences and coping strat-
egies comes from people who stutter themselves. In particular,
many people who stutter report that the intermittent and in-
voluntary nature of stuttering—or at least their belief, feeling, or
sense that stuttering is involuntary and "just happens"—leads to
a variety of coping behaviors that may become the most detri-
mental feature of the problem.8,9,10,11,12 For example, due to
uncertainty about whether or when they will stutter, a speaker
may choose not to approach a romantic partner or not ask for a
raise at work due to a fear of stuttering. These situations are
inherently challenging for many people, but for people who stut-
ter, this challenge is compounded by the possibility of stuttering.
Clinical Note
The reader may be wondering how a stutterer can experience the
ability to anticipate moments of stuttering with high accuracy, as
well as the intermittency of stuttering (sometimes it happens and
sometimes it doesn't). This is indeed a challenging problem for
stutterers, and for those who work with stutterers. One way to
think about this challenge is that intermittency, or variability, of
stuttering is contextual—the social milieu is constantly changing
and with these changes when and where a person stutters also
changes. Thinking about the social milieu prior to being in a
speaking situation, for example, can bring with it a looming sense
of anticipatory anxiety that is not specific to certain words, but a
more general anxiety about impending danger (i.e., stuttering).
In contrast, people who stutter also have a shorter-term and
more specific sense regarding which specific words will be
stuttered, which typically occurs just prior or close to the actual
production of that word.
One final note related to anticipation and other covert features
of stuttering is the dissociation that people often experience be-
tween the overt speech behaviors of stuttering—the repetitions
and prolongations of sounds, for example—and their covert
Fig. 9.1 Timeline of the stuttering event.

coping strategies and cognitive or aﬀective experiences. For
example, there are some individuals who present, on the
surface, with a mild stuttering problem (i.e., low frequency of
observable stuttering), but report that stuttering has a signifi-
cant adverse impact on the quality of their life. For other people
who stutter, the opposite dissociation is true—a high frequency
of observable stuttering yet a limited eﬀect on their overall
quality of life. The observation that severe stuttering on the sur-
face does not always align with a negative life experience—and
vice versa—is a strong indication for the need to examine these
under-the-surface aspects of stuttering during the assessment
process. As many have pointed out, there is much more to
stuttering than meets the eye, particularly in adolescents and
adults.3,13,14
9.4 Measuring the Unobservable
and Observable: A Framework for
Stuttering Assessment
As Yaruss18,19 has pointed out (and describes in ▶Chapter 11
of this text), the World Health Organization's International
Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF),15 an
updated version of the earlier International Classification of
Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH),16,17 provides an
internationally recognized framework for assessing complex
human conditions—developmental, neurotypical, or disordered.
As such, it provides an appropriate structure for the assessment
of stuttering (▶Fig. 9.2).
The ICF takes into account the experiences of the individual
with any complex health problem, not merely the overt mani-
festation of the condition. Furthermore, the ICF model implies
that all people with a specific condition will not respond to it
in the same way; rather, a variety of factors both within the
individual and their environment play a role in one's lived
experience of the problem. The ICF framework can be used to
describe all aspects of an individual's health experience,
including both normal and disordered functioning. Therefore,
the ICF supports the consideration of a wide range of factors
that might be relevant for any one person who stutters; that is,
the factors that should be assessed during an evaluation (for a
more detailed discussion of stuttering and the ICF, see Yaruss
and Quesal20).
9.4.1 Impact of Stuttering
With the previous discussion in mind, we propose that the
main purpose of the stuttering evaluation is to determine the
impact of stuttering on the individual as opposed to the amount
of stuttering a person exhibits. Teens and adults who stutter
come to us for a variety of reasons. They may be having diﬃcul-
ties in school because they stutter. Stuttering may be impacting
their ability to achieve success at work. They might be feeling
held back socially because of stuttering. They may have had
previous therapy that focused largely or solely on changes in
surface fluency and, because they have been unable to maintain
the level of fluency that they achieved during therapy, they feel
like they are doing something wrong. They may feel guilty
because they are not able to achieve the level of fluency with
Fig. 9.2 The international classification of functioning, disability, and health (ICF) framework.

their teacher or boss that they can with their friend or spouse.
These experiences lead them, and those around them, to be-
lieve that they can or should be able to control their stuttering
"if they just tried harder." This, of course, is not true. Although a
person who stutters may learn to be largely in control of how
they respond to stuttering, they will have much less control
over when and where stuttering occurs.
9.4.2 Variability Not Frequency of
Stuttering
We suggest that the most useful way to consider the salience
of disfluency to the overall impact of stuttering is to shift the
focus away from the frequency and type of disfluency to the
intermittency or variability of stuttering. The contextual varia-
bility of stuttering is a hallmark characteristic of the disorder
(see ▶Chapter 1 for a detailed discussion of the contextual vari-
ability of stuttering) and the feature that challenges clinicians
who work with people who stutter, researchers who study stut-
tering, and, most importantly, people who stutter themselves.
Typically, the intermittency of stuttering is confusing to the
individual as well as to their family, friends, coworkers, and
colleagues. People who stutter often ask us why they are fluent
sometimes (e.g., speaking to a young child or pet) but not at
other times (e.g., meeting a potential partner on whom you
want to make a good impression). Imagine the confusion and
distress experienced by people who stutter when they can
produce the same speech sounds and articulatory gestures with
relative ease in one situation, but with great diﬃculty in another,
even immediately or a short time later. This aspect of stuttering
presents individuals who stutter with an incredible challenge—
navigating the "stuttering minefield." Responses from listeners
to unexpected fluency breaks in the speech of people who
stutter are challenging for both the speaker and the listener as
well because these seemingly random interruptions are diﬃcult
to understand ("You weren't stuttering before...why are you
stuttering now?"). Thus, an understanding (and acceptance) of
the intermittency of stuttering is likely the most critical if one is
to eﬀectively assess (and ultimately treat) stuttering.
In the following sections, we describe a contemporary
framework for assessing the covert and overt features of stut-
tering. We start with a useful way for clinicians to conceptual-
ize the covert and overt features of stuttering in terms of the
challenges they pose to both clients and the clinicians working
with them. This conceptualization provides us with useful
terminology that can help clinicians more clearly understand
their role in helping clients cope with the complexities of their
stuttering experience.
9.4.3 Reframing Overt and Covert
Aspects of Stuttering: Technical and
Adaptive Challenges
DiLollo and Neimeyer21 described the ways in which concepts
from adaptive leadership22,23 map onto therapeutic processes
in speech-language pathology. Of particular interest to us in
this current chapter are the concepts of "adaptive" and "techni-
cal" challenges, as these provide clinicians with a way to more
clearly conceptualize the needs and challenges associated with
the surface, speech-related aspects of their client's stuttering,
while also considering the more covert, aﬀective, and cognitive
aspects of the problem, and the overall impact that stuttering
has on the person's quality of life (▶Fig. 9.3).
As described by Heifetz and Laurie,22 technical challenges are
those that can be clearly defined by an expert, and strategies for
addressing these challenges are most eﬀectively implemented
through the application of expert knowledge. In the context of
stuttering, technical challenges include surface behaviors, such
as the types and duration of disfluencies, and accessory behav-
iors (see ▶Chapter 1). The corresponding technical solutions
are strategies to reduce or smooth out the overt stuttering
behaviors (see ▶Chapter 12 for a discussion of therapeutic
strategies for modifying speech and stuttering).
In contrast, adaptive challenges involve the less observable
aspects of problems. According to Heifetz and Laurie,22 adaptive
challenges are diﬃcult to identify, typically have no clear,
straightforward solution, and require changes in beliefs, life-
style, and ways of thinking. For persons who stutter, adaptive
challenges involve those cognitive and aﬀective aspects of the
disorder that impact the person's thinking, lifestyle, and self-
image. Importantly, whereas technical challenges are typically
addressed with a known solution, by someone other than the
person facing the issue (e.g., a professional such as an SLP),
adaptive challenges are addressed in more personal ways by
the individual. In the case of people who stutter, a technical sol-
ution for altering speech production so as to move through
speech in an easier way might address the immediate needs or
expectations of the client to reduce the overt signs of stuttering.
However, addressing the adaptive challenge of changing think-
ing and feeling is a process that, with the support of an SLP and
an extended network of social supports, must be led by the
person experiencing stuttering. In many cases, this involves
moving away from the "stutterer" identity—that is, not thinking
of oneself solely as a person who consistently struggles with
speech, but rather as an individual who is many things and
sometimes happens to stutter. In the case of the SLP, technical
solutions involve the things that they can observe, including
overt behavior, whereas adaptive solutions involve things that
the SLP can learn to see more of.
Heifetz and colleagues24 reported that one of the most
common mistakes in leadership is a failure to recognize both
adaptive and technical challenges in a situation, resulting in
attempts to address the problem only from a technical perspec-
tive. As previously discussed, this is also a common mistake in
the evaluation (and treatment) of stuttering, when clinicians
focus only on counting and cataloging overt speech disfluencies
as the measure of a client's stuttering. In such cases, the adaptive
aspects of the stuttering problem are ignored or minimized—
often because clinicians are unsure or uncomfortable with how
to assess the intrinsic, less observable aspects experienced by
the person who stutters and the ways in which they experience
and cope with them. Fortunately, there are a number of relatively
simple ways in which clinicians can assess the adaptive aspects
of a client's stuttering, starting with a more person-focused
approach to the diagnostic interview, followed later in the evalu-
ation session or sessions by the use of tools such as attitude and
self-eﬃcacy scales, more comprehensive inventories such as
the relevant form(s) of the Overall Assessment of the Speaker's
Adolescents and Adults
140

Experience of Stuttering (OASES),25 or other informal tools that
ask clients to reflect on their experience of stuttering.
Although we have just contrasted technical and adaptive
challenges, it is important to note that these are constructs that
are created to allow us to more easily understand and examine
complex processes like stuttering. In many ways, especially in
the everyday lived experience of persons who stutter, technical
and adaptive challenges are inextricably woven together. Think-
ing back to our earlier discussion of anticipation, the beginning
of the stuttering event is first known by the speaker, and how
the speaker responds to it is a very private experience—until
they decide to show (or not show) their stuttering to the world.
The manifestation of the behavior (i.e., the technical) is tightly
linked to the person's response to stuttering, and reflects the
adaptive experience of the breakdown. Therefore, the first step
in an assessment of stuttering is to learn about the person to
develop a foundation for understanding how they respond to
intermittent interruptions in speech production.
In the following section, we provide an outline of the assess-
ment process. A comprehensive evaluation will include a thor-
ough assessment of both covert and overt (or adaptive and
technical) features associated with the client's stuttering. We
discuss the various components of an assessment, from the ini-
tial case history to the closing interview. Importantly, this sec-
tion is only intended to provide the reader with a framework
for assessment of an adult who stutters. Ultimately, the SLP will
determine assessment techniques and protocols that they find
most useful for a comprehensive assessment that is individual-
ized for a specific client.
9.5 The Assessment Process
▶Fig. 9.4 summarizes the basic evaluation procedures showing
how they target aspects of the individual's stuttering along the
continuum of "technical" to "adaptive" challenges.
It is critical to assess both technical and adaptive aspects of
the clients' stuttering in order to gain a holistic understanding
of how they might successfully manage stuttering. Importantly,
however, it is not how many scales or tests you use that makes
an assessment "comprehensive." Rather, it is how you interpret
the information you obtain. That is, the ways in which the client
responds informs us not only about their stuttering-related
challenges but also where they are on their stuttering journey,
and how ready and motivated they are to make a change.
Consequently, all tests, scales, and other tools that are used
with clients should be viewed as a starting point for gathering
information, with the clinician not only discussing with the
client his or her overall scores/outcomes but also asking about
responses to specific items/questions that stand out as suggest-
ing a strength or an area that is particularly challenging.
9.5.1 Case History
Ideally, the SLP should obtain case history information before con-
ducting the assessment session. This information is often obtained
by sending a case history questionnaire to the client. The case
history provides us with a "mental snapshot" before we meet the
client in person. Case history information typically includes things
such as demographic information, therapy history, why the client

9.5 The Assessment Process
141

is interested in therapy at this particular time, whether the
client is self-referred or was referred by someone else (e.g., an
employer or teacher), and the impact that stuttering is having
on the person. Appendix 9.1 includes a sample case history form.
9.5.2 Diagnostic Interview
At the beginning of the evaluation, we ask open-ended questions
to allow the person who stutters to tell their story. Each story will
be diﬀerent. The goal, however, is to determine the ways in which
stuttering impacts the individual's life and what we can do in
therapy to help the client lessen the impact of stuttering on their
life. Although there are general questions we can ask (Box 9.1),
skilled SLPs will follow the client's lead during the assessment.
As a result, each client's assessment will be diﬀerent. Just like
there are no "cookbook" treatments for stuttering, there is no
"cookbook" approach to assessment. Box 9.1 presents guidelines
for the key areas of focus during the diagnostic interview.
Box 9.1 Sample questions that may be asked during interview of an adult stutterer
●Why are you here today? Tell me about your speech problem.
●When did you first notice that stuttering was a problem?
●Has your speech changed since then? How?
●Is your speech better or worse at some times than others? Give
me some examples.
●Do you have more trouble speaking in some situations than
others? Do certain words or sounds give you more trouble than
others? Are some people harder to talk to than others? Give me
some examples.
●Do you avoid certain situations? Words? Sounds? Listeners?
Give me some examples.
●Can you describe or show me what happens/what you do when
you stutter?
●If you think you are going to have trouble saying a word or
speaking in a particular situation, do you do anything to "help?"
(Alternative: Do you use any "tricks" when you stutter?)
●Have you ever had speech therapy? When? Where? What did
you do in therapy? Did it help? Why or why not?
●Do you have any idea why you stutter? Has anyone oﬀered any
suggestions, etc., regarding why you stutter?
●How has your life been aﬀected by stuttering? How would your
life be diﬀerent if you didn't stutter?
●What would you like to get out of this evaluation? Are there any
specific things that you are interested in or that I can do for you?
●Why have you decided to look for help now?
●When did you begin to stutter?
●Has it changed over the years?
●Does anybody you know stutter? Anybody in your family?
●What do you think caused your stuttering?
●Does your stuttering change from situation to situation?
●How would your life be diﬀerent if you didn't stutter?
●Do you avoid certain speaking situations/words?
●Do you make decisions based on the fact that you (might)
stutter?
●Have any of your relationships been aﬀected by the fact that
you stutter?
●What do you think other people think of your stuttering?
●Do you ever talk about stuttering with anybody?
●Do you have any questions for me?

Start with the Person not the Problem
When clients come to us for a stuttering evaluation, they
typically expect us to ask a lot of questions, get samples of their
speech, and maybe ask about attitudes. In other words, they
expect us to be primarily focused on the overt characteristics of
stuttering. Unfortunately, this approach remains anchored in
the "technical" aspects of the client's problem and provides
little to no accounting of the "adaptive" aspects of the problem.
Given the need to explore both the technical and adaptive
aspects of the client's stuttering, clinicians should plan their
diagnostic interview in a way that first signals the client that
we are interested in him or her as a whole person and not just
his or her stuttering.
Inviting the Person to Tell Their Story
The importance of personal narratives in understanding and
treating health problems has been widely discussed across health
care settings.26 Likewise, a number of authors have discussed the
value of eliciting the client's "story" in the assessment and
treatment of communication disorders in general,21,27,28 and
specifically for persons who stutter.14,29,30 In the context of the
evaluation of stuttering, the client's story includes all aspects of
the person's life—who they are, how they see themselves, what
they like and dislike, how they spend their time, etc.—and it is
not restricted to "stuttering's story," which provides only a lim-
ited account of the person who is seeking help. Consequently,
the first steps in a comprehensive evaluation for an adult who
stutters are the following:
1. Invite the person to tell his or her story. Do this by saying
something like, "Tell me about yourself" or "Tell me about
your life."
2. Listen. The only questions that the clinician needs to ask at
this time are to clarify something the client has said or to
request more detail.
Starting an evaluation in this way enables the client to direct
the initial content and provides the clinician with insights into
what the client views as the most important aspects of his or
her story. This is why it is important for the clinician to ask as
few questions as possible at this time (something that is diﬃ-
cult for many SLPs!) because asking questions takes control of
the story away from the client, focusing instead on what the
clinician believes to be important.
9.5.3 Adaptive Measures
In addition to the interview, a number of measures are available
to assess the less observable features of stuttering.
The Overall Assessment of the Speaker's
Experience of Stuttering
OASES is available for both adults (OASES-A)25 and teenagers
between the ages of 13 and 17 years (OASES-T).25 Both the
OASES-A and OASES-T include four sections: General Information
about Stuttering, Reactions, Functional Communication, and
Quality of Life. The OASES-A contains 100 items and the OASES-T
has 80 items; the items on both forms require the client to rate
the extent to which diﬀerent aspects of stuttering impact a
range of activities, responses, and goals (i.e., from "not at all" to
"completely"). These ratings are used to derive an "impact
score" for each of the four sections and an overall impact score
that reflects the degree to which stuttering adversely impacts
the speaker. As noted earlier, there is often a mismatch between
the frequency and severity of surface disfluency and OASES
scores; for example, some people who produce relatively few
moments of overt stuttering experience a severely adverse
impact of stuttering on their lives. The opposite can also be true
(e.g., high frequency of stuttering with mild or moderately
adverse impact).
The Stuttering Anticipation Scale
The Stuttering Anticipation Scale (SAS)6 is a nonstandardized
tool used to assess the extent to which individuals anticipate
stuttering, as well as how they respond to anticipation. The SAS
was developed as the result of a qualitative investigation of the
ways in which adults who stutter respond to anticipation.5 The
data collected in the study provided one of the first glimpses
into how people respond to the internal knowledge that they
are about to stutter. The 25 most common responses to antici-
pation revealed in the study were used on a questionnaire that
asks respondents to rate how often they anticipate stuttering in
general, and the frequency with which they use a range of
responses to the anticipation of stuttering. Sample items
include the following: How often do you switch words when
you know you are going to stutter? and How often do you stall
when you know you are about to stutter? The SAS is a flexible
tool such that it is not necessary for clients to complete all
25 questions, wording of questions can be altered to more
closely reflect the speaker's background, and new questions can
be added if the client indicates that they have responses to
anticipation not included in the SAS.
The Modified Erickson Scale of
Communication Attitudes
The Modified Erickson Scale of Communication Attitudes (S-24)31
assesses attitudes about stuttering through 24 true/false questions
(e.g., "I find it easy to talk with almost anyone"; "I find it very easy
to look at my audience while speaking to a group").
Perceptions of Stuttering Inventory
Stuttering inventory32 examines clients' self-rating of their
degree of avoidance, struggle, and expectancy, whereas the
locus of control of behavior33 measures the ability of a person to
take responsibility for maintaining new or desired behaviors.
Although the aforementioned scales developed by researchers
are readily available and empirically valid, individual clinicians
can create their own rating scales to gain information about any
aspect of stuttering that is relevant to any particular client (e.g.,
"How much do you avoid on a typical day?", "How hard is for
you to speak on a typical day?", and "How representative is
your current level of stuttering compared to what you experi-
ence on a normal day?").
Finally, DiLollo and Neimeyer21 provide a number of activities,
drawn from narrative therapy, that can facilitate the client's
9.5 The Assessment Process
143

expression of the adaptive challenges of stuttering. For example,
they describe having the client write an "autobiography of the
problem" in which the person who stutters writes from the per-
spective of stuttering, describing its relationship with the client,
what it wants from the client, and how it gets its way with the
client. Such creative writing activities help externalize the prob-
lem and have been shown to help develop new and alternative
insights into the impact of problems such as stuttering, and to
foster potential ways of dealing with the eﬀects of the problem.21
For example, writing about a time when stuttering was very dif-
ficult, but from the perspective of stuttering, can help the adult
and teen who stutters to take a step back and view their stutter-
ing in a diﬀerent, more objective way, opening up discussion
about how they might resist stuttering's negative influence on
their life and well-being.
9.5.4 Technical Measures
Following the client's telling of his or her story, the clinician can
ask questions about the history and course of the client's stut-
tering with reference to the broader story that the client has
just shared, thereby placing this information in a context that is
specific and unique to that particular client.
Throughout the interview, we have been "sampling" the
person's speech, in the sense that we have been observing the
client's overt stuttering behaviors as they tell their story.
Throughout our discussion with them, we are developing a
sense of how the client stutters—how often, what types, and
any accessory or associated behaviors accompanying their
stuttering. We record the session, not necessarily to go back
and analyze the frequency, type, and duration of stuttering
(although we may do that if needed) but to review what the
client said so that we are clear about what they have told us. In
some cases, measures of surface disfluency (e.g., frequency or
severity) may be asked for by other professionals, agencies, or
third-party reimbursors. Our position is that these measures
are most useful when they reflect how an individual stutters
more than how much the individual stutters. Our clinical expe-
rience has shown that when clinicians consider the frequency
of stuttering alone as a measure of progress, they often fail to
notice important qualitative changes in speaking behavior that
take place during therapy. For example, a client may enter ther-
apy using tense pauses or abrupt and physically tense speech
onset as their primary way of stuttering. Treatment may focus
on teaching an easier, more physically relaxed approach to
speaking, or being more open about stuttering (i.e., approaching
stuttering, stuttering openly without avoiding or attempting to
hide it; see ▶Chapter 12). As the person begins to use these
strategies, the result is a change from tense pauses to more
forward-moving or "easier" disfluencies in the form of sound or
word repetitions and smooth initiation of speech. In such a
case, it is likely that the overall disfluency count would actually
show an increase in stuttering as therapy progressed, at least in
the beginning stages of therapy, even though the client's speech
is becoming less eﬀortful. This is likely due to two things. First,
the person may feel more comfortable "letting stuttering out"
without avoiding or hiding it. Second, the individual may be
changing from a physically tense and static articulatory posture
(i.e., holding articulators still, ceasing airflow and phonation)
toward one that is characterized by movement across all the
subsystems of speech production. For these reasons, it is more
helpful to describe the type and severity, rather than the num-
ber of disfluencies. Related measures that describe what the
person is doing when they stutter also include duration of audi-
ble/inaudible prolongations and pauses, and the number of
iterations or repeated units in a sound or word repetition.
A major concern with speech sampling is that it is heavily
influenced by the variability of stuttering. As we previously dis-
cussed, for people who stutter speech fluency is quite unstable
from situation to situation and from time to time.34,35 Even the
tried-and-true "conversation, reading, monologue" samples
that have been the standard for many years provide unreliable
"data" upon which to make clinical decisions in that they are
obtained at a single point of time in a single context.
In addition to sampling specific characteristics of the per-
son's overt stuttering, we administer the Stuttering Severity
Instrument, Fourth Edition (SSI-4),36 probably the most well-
known of all stuttering assessment tools. The SSI-4 focuses
exclusively on what we have described as the technical aspects
of stuttering. It includes three sections that allow the clinician
to assess the frequency, duration, and physical concomitants
of stuttering. Stuttering frequency is determined by calculating
the percentage of syllables stuttered in samples of at least 150
syllables. Duration of stuttering is measured by averaging the
three longest stuttering events. Finally, the physical concomi-
tant score is determined using a 6-point Likert scale (from
most to least severe) to rate distracting sounds, facial grimaces,
head movements, and movements of extremities. The speech
samples that are elicited for analysis include a reading passage
and two spontaneous conversations. The authors suggest
collecting these data in diﬀerent contexts (e.g., on a phone call,
conversation with another speaker). Scores from the frequency,
duration, and physical concomitant sections are converted to an
overall severity rating score.
9.5.5 Closing Interview
Following the assessment, we share our preliminary findings
with the client. These observations most likely include measures
of the impact of stuttering on the client's overall quality of life, as
well as stuttering severity in terms of how the individual physi-
cally responds to stuttering (i.e., surface behaviors, responses to
anticipation). We want to make sure that we address the initial
concerns that the client described at the beginning of the session
to make sure those have been addressed. After describing our
understanding of the client's concerns and perspectives, and our
own interpretation of what we have observed during the evalua-
tion, we open the discussion to possible options for treatment.
We answer any questions the client has about the potential
avenues for therapy, and, if needed, we explain the similarities
and diﬀerences between various intervention approaches (see
▶Chapter 12 for description of treatment for teens and adults).
We also provide resources such as pamphlets, articles, videos,
and support-group opportunities that are oﬀered by such organ-
izations as the Stuttering Foundation, the National Stuttering
Association, and FRIENDS (the national association of young
people who stutter). Finally, we refer the client and/or family for
further assessment by other professionals (e.g., mental health pro-
fessional, neurologist, otolaryngologist, educational psychologist)
if we observe concomitant issues, or if we think the client's

stuttering is not developmental in nature (e.g., secondary to
physical or psychological trauma or illness, cerebral vascular
accident [CVA], or drug use), or if the fluency problem seems to
be related to something other than stuttering.
In the following section, we present a case study demonstrat-
ing one way to use the procedures and tools described in the
previous sections to conduct an assessment of a young adult
who stutters.
9.6 Case Study
Bernie is a 23-year-old man who contacted the clinic about
receiving therapy for stuttering, which he has reportedly been
struggling with since childhood. In response to questions posed
on a case history form, Bernie stated that he has had many
years of therapy. His primary reason for seeking therapy at this
point in time is that he wants to "be able to do [his] upcoming
interviews." Bernie says his stuttering has "never been so bad."
During the initial interview, we first want to get to know
Bernie—we want him to tell his story. Consequently, we invite
Bernie to tell us about himself, being careful to emphasize that
we are interested in his story, not stuttering's story of him.
Bernie starts by saying, "Well, I started stuttering when I was
around 4, I think, but the first time I really remember stuttering
was on the first day of school, when I tried to say my name. I
remember kids laughing at me." As Bernie pauses, we take the
opportunity to reorient his story by pointing out that what he
just told us was the start of "Stuttering's" story of him. We ask
Bernie if he can tell us "his" story by putting Stuttering's story
aside for a moment and just focusing on what Bernie likes,
thinks, wants, and dreams about. This approach helps us to
establish two things: (1) that we are interested in Bernie as a
whole person and not just his stuttering and (2) that Bernie in-
deed does have a story that is independent of stuttering and that
stuttering does not have to be the dominant feature in his life.
As a part of this initial conversation, we not only learn about
Bernie and his story but we also build empathy and trust—often
referred to as "rapport"—so that Bernie might be willing to
share personal details that may be diﬃcult, but which will
ultimately provide a comprehensive picture of his stuttering
experience. We accomplish this by engaging with Bernie using
active listening skills and our demonstration to Bernie that we
are interested in him as a whole person, and not just his stut-
tering. Active listening can be achieved by maintaining eye
contact and neutral facial expressions, relaxed posture, oﬀering
aﬃrmative responses such as head nodding, short phrases or
syllables/words (e.g., "I see," or "uh huh," or "I understand"),
and, most importantly, not talking! During this conversation,
we learn that getting a good job, maintaining close relationships
with family and friends, sports, and staying healthy and active
are all important to Bernie. Through some follow-up questions,
we find out that Bernie is in business school and is very proud
of his accomplishments, being named to the Chancellor's Honor
Roll every semester that he has been in college. Bernie shows
real excitement and engagement when he talks about his stud-
ies and it becomes increasingly clear that his excellence in his
field is an important aspect of his identity. At the same time,
Bernie confided that he is terrified about several interviews
coming up for summer internships. He is afraid that, because of
his stuttering, he might not perform well in the interviews and
this would be devastating for his career plans. Knowing this
information about Bernie provides us with an initial under-
standing of his thinking, and suggests that he is motivated to
make some change. Such readiness will serve him well as he
embarks on the journey to change both how he stutters and how
he responds to stuttering (i.e., if that's what he wants to do!).
Although we are not focusing on Bernie's speech patterns at
this point, we do note that he seems to enjoy communicating
except for those times when he stutters (e.g., he consistently
looks down when he overtly stutters). In addition, he tends to
"back up" when he experiences stuttering (e.g., restarts utter-
ances, uses filler words). These initial behavioral observations
will prime us to pay attention to how Bernie physically
responds to stuttering throughout the assessment.
We then ask Bernie questions specifically related to his stut-
tering, helping us to focus primarily on the technical aspects of
his problem while still listening for additional information
about the adaptive challenges posed by stuttering (e.g., avoi-
dances, emotional responses, etc.). Bernie tells us that he has
received "a lot" of speech therapy throughout his life, "though
none of it has been helpful," because he's "still stuttering." This
statement suggests that Bernie is very focused on the technical
aspects of stuttering, or what listeners can observe when he
stutters. We take this as an opportunity to explore his goals for
this assessment and possible therapy. Specifically, what does
Bernie hope will come from this evaluation? What would a suc-
cessful therapy look like for him? We ask him about his history
with stuttering: When did it start? How has it changed over the
years? Does it change in diﬀerent contexts? This last question
deals with variability—for example, is it easy to speak with
certain individuals (family/friends) and hard to speak to people
he doesn't know? Bernie tells us that situations like interviews
are the most challenging for him, which is an indicator that his
main motivation for coming to therapy may be due to the stress
caused by his upcoming interviews. This is a common feeling
for young adults about to begin their "professional" life, possi-
bly develop serious relationships, etc. When asked why he
thinks these contexts are most diﬃcult, Bernie replies that he
does not know, indicating a lack of awareness, or at least that
structured attention has not been paid to stuttering. We also
ask Bernie how stuttering impacts his life and whether he
makes life decisions based on stuttering. He indicates that he
thinks stuttering has forced him to become a more thoughtful
and patient person. He also reports that stuttering often dic-
tates who he decides to talk to (e.g., "...there have been many
women who I haven't approached due to the possibility of stut-
tering"). These responses indicate that Bernie feels that at times
his stuttering negatively impacts his life/participation, and also
that he is able to see the positive impact that stuttering can
have.
Throughout the interview, we noticed that Bernie avoided
eye contact (e.g., looked down) and to our trained eyes and
ears, appeared to use avoidance behaviors (e.g., word switching,
circumlocution) during moments of stuttering. These behaviors
indicated that Bernie has developed numerous "tricks" to
attempt to escape the moment of stuttering, and also that there
may be fear, shame, and embarrassment associated with
stuttering for Bernie. When asked if he knew why he used these
behaviors, Bernie said, "I don't really know...sometimes I know
I'm gonna stutter and I just want to get through it as fast as
9.6 Case Study
145

possible." This statement prompted us to use the SAS as a tool
to explore more about how Bernie responds to the sense or
feeling that he is going to stutter (i.e., anticipation). Of interest
is that completing the SAS helped increase Bernie's awareness
of these behaviors; he stated that "...I never really thought of
how many things I do to try not to stutter." Finally, it is impor-
tant to note that when we see and hear evidence of avoidance
strategies, we always follow up with the client to check the
accuracy of our observations. And, as previously stated, we also
use the client's responses to relevant items on the SAS and
OASES to corroborate our impression that they are using overt/
covert avoidance strategies.
Given Bernie's responses, we decided to ask him to write an
"autobiography of stuttering"21 to further explore his relation-
ship with stuttering. Box 9.2 shows Bernie's autobiography
of stuttering, reflecting a complex relationship that includes
stuttering's dominant role in decision-making, some positive
aspects of stuttering's influence, and how stuttering casts doubt
on Bernie's ability to stand up to it.
Box 9.2 Stuttering's Autobiography, as
written by "Bernie"
I have always been with Bernie. I was there as he spoke his first
words, even if no one else knew it at the time. Eventually, other
people started to notice me. Bernie didn't seem to care at first.
But then I started to make things hard for him. His friends at
school sometimes made fun of him because of me and he
became scared of talking. That is me! I did that to Bernie! I
started to get more and more control of him and I liked it! By
the time Bernie was in high school, I was in complete control.
I told him when he could talk, who he could talk to, and even
when and where he could go. I even stopped him from dating
for a long time!
Despite this, I think Bernie actually likes me! I have made
him more aware of others who struggle with a problem. I force
him to be more thoughtful about everything—partly because
he has to consider me in every decision that he makes. But he
is a more kind and patient person because of me!! I also
protect him. I am his excuse for not succeeding. I can keep him
safe from failure and rejection. With me, he doesn't have to
push himself or try to be someone that he is not!
Of course, despite this, Bernie has tried to fight me. He has
had lots of people try to help him fight me, too. But they all
failed! I am too strong! Or, maybe, Bernie is too weak? He likes
to think that he is smart and good at things, but he has never
been smart enough to beat me! He can try all he likes, but he
will never be rid of me! I will always be in charge and telling
him what to do. I will even destroy his chance of getting a good
internship and making a good career. I don't care if he fails,
because, if he fails, then I win! He will have to come crawling
back to me and let me have my way. We can stay safe in our
bubble. Once Bernie accepts this, I have won and he will always
be mine!
After Bernie read the autobiography to us (and provided us
with a written copy), we talked with him about what he
learned from the experience. He told us that it was really hard
for him to go back and read what he had written—that it made
him question if he really can "beat stuttering." As a part of this
conversation, we asked Bernie if he could think of times that
he had "stood up to" stuttering. We noted the examples that
Bernie provided and asked him, "How were you able to do that,
if stuttering is really too strong for you?" In this way, we plant a
seed that there might be an alternative to Bernie's story of stut-
tering being too strong for him to overcome.
We video recorded our conversation with Bernie so that we
could conduct our speech analysis after the interview. This
allowed us to focus completely on interacting with Bernie, as
opposed to splitting our attention between interacting with
Bernie and recording speech behaviors. If video recording is
not possible, the clinician will need to be flexible and find a
way to take notes during the evaluation without sending a
message to their client that they are uninterested. It was
observed that most of Bernie's overt stuttering consisted of
blocks with significant tension and eye blinking. That is,
Bernie appeared to use significant physical eﬀort in trying to
"fight" through stuttering moments. In addition, he relied on
starter phrases (e.g., "uh," "um," "ya know"), which we inter-
preted as his attempts to get through stuttering events and
avoid overt stuttering. Importantly, while significant physical
eﬀort and avoidance strategies were observed, the overall
frequency of Bernie's stuttering was limited (more below,
perhaps due to his use of avoidance strategies). When asked,
Bernie indicated that he felt "tight" during stuttering, but that
he was not aware where in his body he felt this tightness. After
receiving permission from Bernie to ask him about stuttering
events during the evaluation, following a stuttered disruption
we asked, "What did you do right before you stuttered...and
what were you thinking?," and Bernie identified both his
physical and cognitive responses (i.e., "...my throat tightened
and I got that feeling, you know, I knew I was gonna stutter on
that word and didn't really want to..."). This demonstrates
that given prompts, Bernie is very aware of his responses and
reactions to stuttering.
Regarding formal testing, we administered both the OASES
and the SSI-4. Bernie received a total impact rating of "moderate
to severe" on the OASES, indicating that stuttering has a moder-
ate to severe adverse impact on Bernie's life. For the SSI-4, we
used the interview during the evaluation to obtain a 500-word
spontaneous speech sample, and asked Bernie to orally read a
passage to obtain an additional speech sample. Based on these
two samples (conversation with the clinician during the inter-
view and oral reading) along with the physical concomitants
score, Bernie received a mild severity rating. As discussed previ-
ously, the discrepancy between the OASES (moderate to severe)
and SSI-4 (mild) scores further reflects the importance of focus-
ing on harder-to-observe aspects of Bernie's stuttering. In
addition to using the ratings from the OASES and SSI-4, Bernie's
responses to individual items on the OASES were reviewed with
him, targeting items that he rated particularly high or low and
asking him to elaborate further on why he responded in that
way. For example, Bernie indicated that he "strongly agreed"
with the OASES item, "If I did not stutter, I would be better able
to achieve my goals in life." We then asked Bernie, "Why do you
think you would be better able to achieve your goals if you
didn't stutter?" This provided us with a greater depth of under-
standing of Bernie's stuttering, how it impacts his daily life, and
how he reacts to it in various contexts.
Adolescents and Adults
146

Bernie was self-referred, and appeared to be motivated to
start making changes related to how he experienced stuttering.
Bernie was seeking therapy during a challenging time in his life,
as he was about to begin interviewing for potential summer
internships. He reported a long history of stuttering, and also a
long history of trying to conceal his stuttering and negative
emotions surrounding stuttering (e.g., anxiety, shame, embar-
rassment). Bernie indicated that he had allowed stuttering to
make major life decisions for him (e.g., not speaking to certain
individuals that he wanted to out of a fear of stuttering). The
cognitive and emotional responses to stuttering, as well as deci-
sions Bernie allowed stuttering to make for him, reflected adap-
tive challenges, which were also reflected in the OASES score
and the autobiography of stuttering. Bernie also exhibited an
engrained pattern of responding to his stuttering with tensing
and pushing, as well as relying on well-practiced strategies or
"tricks" to get through stuttering moments (e.g., switching
words, starter phrases). These visible physical characteristics
reflected additional technical challenges.
Given Bernie's experiences, background, and motivation, he
appeared to be a good candidate to begin therapy. The initial
focus in therapy was to explore with Bernie how stuttering was
impacting his life, and what decisions Bernie was making
because of stuttering. Through motivational interviewing (see
▶Chapter 12), we helped Bernie to begin to figure out why he
responded to stuttering in the ways that he did—an important
first step in therapy. Results from the evaluation suggested that
Bernie would benefit from openly talking about stuttering
and also working to desensitize to stuttering through, for
example, pseudostuttering, education, and stuttering openly.
We discussed our impressions with Bernie, and also provided
him with information about resources to explore on his own
(e.g., The National Stuttering Association (NSA), FRIENDS:
The National Association of Young People Who Stutter, The
Stuttering Association for the Young (SAY), StutterTalk pod-
cast). Finally, we asked Bernie if he had any specific ideas
about potential therapy, and we discussed possible treatment
approaches with him.
9.7 Conclusion
A comprehensive assessment of stuttering in adolescents and
adults requires the SLP to determine not only how much a
person stutters but also, more importantly, how they stutter
and the extent to which stuttering adversely impacts their
life. This is because measures of overt stuttering, particularly
frequency, are prone to misrepresent the extent of the indi-
vidual's stuttering problem—primarily because of the varia-
bility of stuttering and the individual's ability to anticipate
stuttering events. This is not to say that overt features should
be ignored. In fact, the covert features of stuttering mediate
overt features, such that how an individual responds to the
possibility of stuttering shapes how stuttering overtly mani-
fests itself. In this chapter, we presented a framework for
thinking about and developing an assessment that appropri-
ately balances attention paid to covert and overt features of
stuttering in adolescents and adults. We then applied this
framework to a case study and included some initial thoughts
about the direction of therapy.

Abstract
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the factors that
contribute to decisions about stuttering therapy for young
children, specifically whether treatment is both warranted and
recommended, and to describe three treatment approaches that
may be adopted. Readers will be provided with a global overview
of the motivating theory, principles, and methods of the
Palin Parent-Child Interaction Therapy, the Lidcombe Program,
and Restart-Demands and Capacities Model-based treatment, the
treatment approaches that presently have the highest levels of
research evidence to support their implementation by trained
therapists. It should be recognized, however, that as empirical
evidence emerges, there are likely to be additional therapy
approaches that may prove equally or indeed more eﬃcacious as
those discussed in this chapter. These approaches are intended
to be delivered by qualified clinicians. Across the globe, a range
of titles and terms are used to refer to such clinicians including
speech and language therapist, speech and language pathologist,
and logopedist, among others. Throughout this chapter, we will
use the term speech and language therapist (SLT) and therapist
to refer to these professionals, for the purposes of consistency.

10.1 Introduction
Compared to the long history of stuttering therapy with adults,
intervention with young children is in its infancy. While there
are now at least three evidence based interventions with young
children (Palin Parent-Child Interaction Therapy,1 the Lidcombe
Program,2 and Restart-DCM treatment3), because up to 80% of
stuttering resolves without intervention,4 and with little evidence
of the eﬀectiveness of treatment, there was a strong argument for
waiting until such unassisted recovery was unlikely. Further, the
"influential diagnosogenic theory that assigned the cause of stut-
tering to parents' attitudes toward a child's speech"5 led clinicians
to advise parents to ignore stuttering, with treatment often begun
if the child was still stuttering during the school years. However,
such advice did not lead to a reduction in stuttering prevalence
and as evidence emerged that early intervention with young
children is eﬃcacious, this perspective changed.
Presently, early intervention for young children who stutter
has become standard practice, although there is still discussion
about when treatment should begin. In the 1980s, Stark-
weather and colleagues advocated prevention and early inter-
vention as soon as possible after stuttering onset, arguing that
doing so would reduce the chances of a persistent problem.6,7
In contrast, Yairi and colleagues advised that treatment should
be delayed while actively monitoring the course of the child's
stuttering for 9 to 12 months.5,8 This recommendation was
based on their findings that the stuttering severity of children
who recovered from stuttering was significantly lower in the
final quarter of the first year compared to that observed shortly
after onset. This was not the case for children whose stuttering
would persist. Importantly though, these authors suggested that
such a monitoring phase should be shortened or even skipped
entirely if danger signs (risk factors for persistent stuttering) are
apparent.
There have been a number of longitudinal studies that have
sought to identify the factors that diﬀerentiate children at
greater risk of persistent stuttering from those whose risk is
small.9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 Evidence for the role of factors
such as child language ability, socioeconomic status, maternal
education, and stuttering severity is somewhat inconsistent
and inconclusive. While that is the case, a recent meta-analysis
combined the outcomes of 11 studies and identified the follow-
ing clinical characteristics to be associated with higher risk of
stuttering persistence: being male, being older at stuttering
onset, a family history of stuttering, higher stuttering fre-
quency, lower speech sound accuracy, and lower expressive and
receptive language skills.21 Discussing these predictors with
parents can facilitate the decision-making process when con-
sidered in the context of the child's and parents' needs and
wishes. It is important that these risk factors be interpreted as
probabilities and not absolutes, and the following limitations
should be considered so that the clinician may interpret and
apply the findings appropriately:
●There are inconsistencies across studies with respect to which
factors are considered predictive of outcome, likely reflecting
the complex nature of childhood stuttering, limitations of
sample size, and methodological diﬀerences across studies.
●It is not known if and how the findings from the nonclinical
populations studied (e.g., children who stutter but who do
not present at clinics) generalize to the clinical group of
children who receive therapy for stuttering.
●Group findings cannot be reliably or validly applied to
individuals. It is not possible to make a judgment about
whether that specific child is going to continue to stutter or
whether stuttering will resolve based on trends in the
population as a whole.
●The relative or cumulative risk of individual factors is not
known, and neither is the degree to which particular factors
might protect the child from developing persistent stuttering.
●For those children who continue to stutter, the early
experiences of stuttering and responses to it (by both parents
and child) will influence the behavior, experience, and impact
of stuttering in the long-term. Further, early childhood
experiences and family stressors can have long-term
implications for overall mental health and well-being.22
As clinicians, we have an opportunity to support the
development of positive stuttering management skills and
attitudes, with the aim of reducing the potential long-term
consequences of living with stuttering.
●Even though the majority of children may resolve stuttering
without intervention 2 to 3 years after the problem first
emerges, the experience at the time of onset is often
upsetting, alarming, and anxiety provoking (both for the child
and his or her parents). At the very least, if we as therapists
can reduce these negative consequences, we should.23
153

There is no evidence that the factors identified to be either risk
or protective for persistent stuttering are the same as those
which predict therapy outcome. In fact, in a recent study exam-
ining the eﬀectiveness of Palin Parent-Child Interaction (PCI)
Therapy, the authors did not find these factors to be relevant to
treatment outcome.24 Given these limitations, in practice there
has been a move away from trying to determine whether or not
an individual child is likely to resolve stuttering without inter-
vention as the main criterion informing the decision for ther-
apy. Rather, the experience of stuttering and the impact that it
has on both the child and parents holds greater significance
with regard to whether therapy is warranted. Presently, an
assessment of all children who have started to stutter is recom-
mended, regardless of the risk factor profile. Those who believe
that all stuttering experiences have potential to harm the young
child will recommend no delay of starting treatment.1,25 Alter-
nately, as the majority of children will recover without treat-
ment, others will recommend actively monitoring the child's
stuttering until 9 to 12 months after stuttering onset, when the
child and parents are not very concerned and there is no seri-
ous risk profile.5 The nature and extent of this monitoring will
vary according to the standards and availability of local serv-
ices. Besides, the dynamic and fluctuating nature of stuttering
over time means that its impact, and therefore the need for
therapy, is also subject to change. That said, once therapy is
indicated, the clinician has a choice of evidence-based interven-
tions that may be utilized. The three approaches described
below represent those with the strongest evidence, those that
are used internationally, and those for which structured training
for therapists has been developed. In the following sections, the
principles, methods, and empirical evidence for each approach
are described.
10.2 Therapy Approaches for
Preschool Children Who Stutter
10.2.1 Palin Parent-Child Interaction
Therapy
Palin Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (Palin PCI) is a therapy
approach developed over many years at the Michael Palin
Centre for Stammering in London, United Kingdom. The authors
refer to Palin PCI as an approach, rather than a program, to
reflect the flexible nature of its design and implementation.
The intention is that each family will experience a similar over-
all structure of sessions, while the content can be adapted to
the child's and family's individual needs. Therapist training is
required before Palin PCI should be undertaken, and while the
main elements of the approach are described here, the reader is
directed to the second edition of the therapy manual for further
detail regarding the theoretical underpinnings, principles, and
methods of the approach, and the existing evidence base.1
Palin PCI is based on the understanding of stuttering as a
multifactorial disorder (see ▶Chapter 1 and ▶Chapter 2),26
with some children born with the neurophysiological predispo-
sition to stutter.27,28 This genetic predisposition interacts with
physiological, linguistic, psychological, and environmental fac-
tors, which influence the moments of stuttering that are pro-
duced, along with the chronicity, experience, and impact of the
disorder on the child. These factors are discussed in detail in pre-
vious chapters and presented in ▶Fig. 10.1.
At the center of the model is the child who is born with the
predisposition to stutter, and the psychological, physiological,
and environmental factors that will influence its expression.
The stuttering itself and the speech motor system required
for the production of fluent speech are incorporated into the
bottom left corner of the triangle. At the top of the triangle
are the child's speech, language, and communication skills.
These will interact with neurophysiological vulnerability to
stutter, making it easier or harder for the child to communicate.
The child's other communications skills (e.g., appropriate eye
contact and turn taking) can further enhance or reduce their
ability to communicate or may indeed be aﬀected by stuttering.
At the bottom right of the triangle in ▶Fig. 10.1 are the child's
temperament and cognitive skills. These will also interact with
moments of stuttering and influence the child's emotional and
behavioral responses and reactions, as well as the development
of their emotional well-being.
As shown in ▶Fig. 10.1, the circles around the outside repre-
sent the child's communicative environment, which, in the case
of the preschool child, is by and large the parents. Childcare and
educational contexts may also be involved, but the primary
caregivers will have the greatest and most consistent influence
on the child, both in the short and long-term. Palin PCI is built
on the evidence that parents:
●do not cause stuttering.
●can make changes in their interaction style that support the
child's speech fluency and communication skills.
●have the skills and capacity they need to make eﬀective
change but may lack the knowledge and confidence to do so.
The aims of Palin PCI are the following:
●To help each child become a confident and competent
communicator, whether or not they continue to stutter.
●To reduce the impact of stuttering on the child and parents.
●To enhance the child's fluency.
●To increase the parents' and the child's knowledge about
stuttering and confidence to manage it.
Evidence Base for the Palin PCI Approach
In order to evaluate the parents' perspectives of change in their
child's stuttering and related reactions, Millard and Davis devel-
oped the Palin Parent Rating Scales,29 a standardized measure
that can be used with the parents of any child who stutters, and
any therapy program. To begin, they conducted a Delphi study
to identify what parents viewed as desirable outcomes from
therapy, yielding a series of statements that reflected what was
most important to the majority of the participants. A psycho-
metric evaluation of the resulting questionnaire revealed that it
measures three distinct components:
●Factor 1: the impact stuttering has on the child.
●Factor 2: the severity of stuttering and its impact on the
parents.
●Factor 3: parents' knowledge about stuttering and confidence
in managing it.

demonstrate that Palin PCI reduces the negative impact of
stuttering on the child, increases the child's fluency, reduces
parental anxiety, and help parents to feel more confident and
knowledgeable in how to support their child. These positive
outcomes reflect the specific aims of the program.
Essential Pieces
Initial Assessment
The assessment process is considered to be the foundation of
the Palin PCI approach. It is comprehensive and thorough.
Through this engagement and joint understanding, the parents
and therapist identify priorities for therapy and begin to establish
the therapeutic alliance that is crucial for successful therapy
outcome.40
When parents contact a therapist, it is because they are wor-
ried and are seeking support. In the first instance, the therapist
will provide the parents with information about stuttering such
as incidence, prevalence, and the factors that put the child at
risk
of
persistence,41
without
making
predictions
about
whether or not an individual child is likely to experience unas-
sisted recovery. It is important, however, to note that a decision
about whether to oﬀer therapy is not based on these risk-of-
persistence factors; rather, it is made on the basis of whether
the stuttering is having an impact on the child or parents.
Having heard the information about stuttering, some parents
will choose to wait for a few months to "see how it goes."
Other parents continue to express concern and wish to have
help, in which case a full assessment is oﬀered. Parental con-
cern is evidence that the child's stuttering is having an impact
on the family.
The assessment process reflects the multifactorial nature of
stuttering. The aim is to identify specific physiological, linguistic,
environmental, and emotional factors that are supporting the
child's communication and fluency as well as those that are mak-
ing communication more challenging. Using a range of formal
and informal methods (such as those described in ▶Chapter 7 of
this volume, alongside parent and child interviews1), the thera-
pist explores the perspectives of the child and their parents/
guardians (in Palin PCI, both parents who live in the home with
the child are involved).
Once the assessment is completed, the therapist explains the
findings from both the child assessment and parent case history
to the parents. ▶Fig. 10.2 provides an example of how the

10.2 Therapy Approaches for Preschool Children Who Stutter
157

assessments and the findings map onto the Palin PCI model
shown in ▶Fig. 10.1.
Using ▶Fig. 10.1 as a reference and visual aid, the therapist
explains that stuttering is complex and there are some factors
that make it easier for the child to communicate and be more
fluent, and some that make it harder for children who stutter to
talk easily, using the information from the assessment to high-
light the relevant factors for the individual child so that the
parents understand the nature of their child's stuttering, what
they are already doing that is helpful, and how therapy might
support this further.
There is a very particular style adopted by the Palin PCI thera-
pist. Palin PCI seeks to help parents to build on their knowledge
and develop their skills in a way that will empower them,
reduce their worries, and give them confidence to support the
child in the long-term. Strategies employed in Solution-Focused
Brief Therapy (SFBT)42 counseling have had a significant influ-
ence on the approach over recent years. SFBT assumes that peo-
ple have the resources they need to manage their problems and
it is the role of the therapist to help them identify those skills
and strategies that are helpful. As such, within Palin PCI there is
an assumption that parents will already have ways to support
their child and those may be built upon, so teaching, instruct-
ing, correcting, and modeling are not required. The therapist
shapes the conversations with parents in a way that helps them
to explore their hopes and expectations from therapy, while
also assisting them to focus attention on "what is going well"
and notice "small steps in the right direction." Working within
this framework, the Palin PCI therapist focuses on asking, not
telling; finding, not showing; and encouraging attention to
what is positive.
Therapy Structure
Therapy is delivered through six, once-weekly clinic sessions,
which last approximately 1 hour. The parents who live with the
child (including those who have a parenting role, such as step-
parents or guardians) attend all therapy sessions. At the end of
the six clinic sessions, the parents continue to implement the
strategies they have learned at home for an additional 6-week
period and provide feedback each week to the therapist. At the
end of this so-called home consolidation period, the child's
progress is reviewed and decisions about further therapy are
made.
The focus of the initial session is to help the parents explore
their "best hopes" with the therapist using the questions
described in SFBT methods42 as a way to elicit their hopes,
expectations, and priorities for therapy. In this first session, the
clinician introduces the structure of the program and observes
a PCI session that provides the basis for goal selection. This is
accomplished in the following ways:
●The family is introduced to the concept of "Special Time."
This is a 5-minute playtime that each parent will have with
the child between three and five times per week. The child
selects the toy/game and the parent's role is to play with
them, focusing on what the child says, not on how they are
saying it. Books, sports, and screen activities should be
avoided during Special Time because the PCI is reduced/
diﬀerent in these times. Special Time provides the time
at home for parents to practice what they have learned
(i.e., interaction targets, described in the following pages)
through the remainder of the program.
A video recording is made of each parent playing with the child.
The recording provides the therapist with insight into the
child's communication skills in a more familiar speaking con-
text, and is used in therapy for the parents to identify a commu-
nication strategy to pay attention to in therapy. The content
and focus of the remaining sessions are dependent on the
strengths and needs identified in the assessment and the hopes
and expectations expressed by the parents in session 1.
Therapy Strategies
Based on observations made during the assessment, the parent
interview, and the video-recorded play session therapy includes
three sets of strategies: interaction, family, and child strategies.
Interaction Strategies
Palin PCI does not assume that parents are doing something
"wrong" or that they diﬀer from other parents, but that there
are features of the way in which they interact with their child
that make it easier or harder for the child to communicate or
speak fluently. There is also an understanding that because they
are worried, behaviors/interactions may become distorted. For
instance, in their attempt to reduce pressure on the child and to
try to stop them from experiencing stuttering, parents may talk
for the child, interrupt, or take lengthy conversational turns.
Simply put, it is natural for our interaction to be influenced by
our emotional state.
Interaction strategies are chosen during the parents' observa-
tion of the recorded interaction with their child (typically in
session 2). The therapist asks each parent to identify "what are
you doing that is helpful for your child's communication?" or
"how are you helping your child's stuttering?" The parents are
then asked to identify something they could do more of, or do
diﬀerently that would further support their child's communica-
tion. The parent is asked to think about what they already know
that helps their child (e.g., letting the child finish their thought,
giving them time to respond), and the rationale for any change
they would like to make ("why would that be helpful?"; "what
diﬀerence would that make for your child?"). This helps the
parents to be explicit about the reasoning behind any change
they are proposing, making them specific and achievable. The
parents then practice these in Special Time at home, keeping a
record of what they did and the results they observed.
Parents typically focus on two to three Interaction Strategies
over the 6-week period. Each week, they make a new recording
of their interaction with the child in the clinic and use that to
reflect on the target-specific changes they have been working
on. Watching the recording gives the parents feedback about
the changes they are making and to consider whether they will
add a new strategy or not. Interaction strategies that are typi-
cally identified by parents are listed in ▶Table 10.2.
Family Strategies
One or two Family Strategies might also be introduced within the
first six sessions of therapy. These will have been identified dur-
ing the assessment as additional strategies to help the parents
Preschool-Age Children
158

and the child cope with stuttering in a more positive and proac-
tive way. For example, parents of children who stutter often
describe a loss of confidence in how to support their child and
may treat the child diﬀerently because they stutter. Because
stuttering is a multifactorial disorder, the child's development
and interaction with their environment will aﬀect how they
respond, react, and manage their stuttering in the short and long-
term. A child who is confident to talk, who is aware of their
emotions and able to regulate them and their behaviors, who is
resilient, has good problem-solving skills, is independent, and
secure is more likely to speak without struggle and cope with
their stuttering in the long-term. Family Strategies that might be
included in a Palin PCI program can be seen in ▶Table 10.2.
Child Strategies
For the majority of children, successful implementation of
Interaction and Family Strategies reduces concerns about the
child's stuttering. They support the child's speech fluency by
helping parents to have realistic demands and expectations for
behavior change while setting up practice sessions and building
confidence through reinforcement. If the child or parents continue
to be concerned about stuttering or if the child is showing
evidence of developing unhelpful strategies for coping with
stuttering (e.g., increased struggle or avoiding words), then
further therapy may include more direct Child Strategies. These
require the child to become more actively involved in therapy
by learning more about speech and communication and
developing their own helpful cognitive strategies for responding
to stuttering. The number of additional sessions depends on the
strategy required and the child's progress, but typically three to
four additional sessions would be oﬀered.
▶Fig. 10.3 shows how the Interaction, Family, and Child
Strategies work together to target the areas of need. Throughout
the therapy process, it is the therapist's role to help the parents
to notice the strengths in these areas as well as areas that can
be developed. The therapist does this using the solution-focused
style of questioning, and throughout the process, parents are
asked to keep a record of "what I am pleased to notice."
Follow-up and Monitoring
At the end of the initial 6-week in-clinic therapy phase, there is
a 6-week consolidation phase when parents continue with
Special Times and their strategies. During that time, they
provide the SLT with feedback about those tasks and at the end
of that period, the child's progress is reassessed. The parent's
and child's view of stuttering is considered (e.g., Palin PRS,
observation and conversation with the parents and child). If
the child is showing increased confidence to communicate,
stuttering is reducing, and the parents are feeling more confident
in their skills to support their child, the family is encouraged to
continue to implement the strategies at home. The process of
change continues over time, so the child's progress is monitored
over a 1-year period using the measures.
10.2.2 The Lidcombe Program
Evidence Base for the Lidcombe Program
The LP is a parent-delivered treatment for early stuttering. It
was developed in Australia in the 1990s and has grown in its
use across the globe, including (but not limited to) the United
Kingdom,
European
countries
such
as
the
Netherlands,
Germany, France, and Belgium, the Middle East, South Africa,
Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, New Zealand, the United States,
and Canada.
The theoretical underpinnings of the LP are behavioral, in
that the child's stuttering is targeted directly, with the aim of
reducing it. These behavioral roots come from research in the
1970s showing that stuttering in preschool children can be
reduced through operant principles—primarily contingent con-
sequences (e.g., verbal feedback following a moment or instance
of stuttering or fluent, stutter-free speech).43,44 This research
provided the basis for development of the LP, and parental verbal
feedback for both stutter-free speech and stuttering has always
been the core of the essential components of the treatment.
There is a significant amount of research evidence, including
randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence and long-term
follow-up data to attest to the LP's eﬃcacy and eﬀectiveness

Essential Pieces
Initial Assessment
The LP does not prescribe a particular assessment process or
standardized tools but is based on detailed discussion and di-
rect observation of the child's stuttering (see ▶Chapter 7 of this
text for details of the assessment process for preschool children
who stutter). The assessment marks the beginning of the col-
laborative process between the parent and the clinician and in-
volves both giving and gathering information.
Therapy Structure
As shown in ▶Fig. 10.4, the LP consists of two stages with dis-
tinct goals:
●Stage 1: achievement of zero or near zero levels of stuttering.
●Stage 2: maintenance of zero or near zero levels of stuttering
in the long-term.
In stage 1, weekly appointments are scheduled during which
the clinician works with the parent to individualize the treat-
ment so that it can be eﬀectively carried out in the family's
everyday life. This individualization occurs by integrating the
clinician's understanding of both the LP and stuttering in general,
with the parents' knowledge of their child and family. In stage 2,
once zero or near zero levels of stuttering have been achieved, a
maintenance program begins. Treatment at home is withdrawn
slowly and the frequency of appointments with the clinician
reduces while zero or near zero levels of stuttering are main-
tained. Should the child's stuttering reemerge, parents increase
treatment again until zero or near zero levels are reached and
treatment can be withdrawn again.
During the weekly visits to the clinician in stage 1 of the LP,
parents are taught how to conduct the essential components
that make up the treatment:
●measurement of stuttering severity.
●practice sessions at home.
●feedback for stutter-free and stuttered speech.
Treatment involves all these components; however, the way
each component is carried out is not rigidly defined and will
diﬀer from family to family. It is the clinician's responsibility to
work with individual parents to ensure individualization for
successful treatment. Each of these components and their indi-
vidualization is explained below.

Measurement of stuttering in the LP is accomplished using a
0 to 9 rating scale, where 0 = no stuttering, 1 = extremely mild
stuttering, and 9 = extremely severe stuttering. This tool is called
the Severity Rating (SR) scale and evidence has shown that
both parents and clinician can use it reliably with minimal
training.46,47,48 Reliability in using the SR scale is established by
the parent and the clinician listening to several minutes of the
child's speech and agreeing on a rating with no more than one
scale value diﬀerence. This reliability is checked at every
appointment with the same procedure. Throughout treatment,
the SR scale provides a measurement tool to track progress
or identify a lack of it. It is also used as a neutral and reliable
way of communicating about changes in the child's stuttering
severity, for example, instead of the parent saying the stuttering
"was terrible on the weekend," they can say "the stuttering was
a 7 on the weekend." Consistent use of the SRs is an essential
part of the treatment. The trends they show are an important
consideration in problem-solving and for any treatment deci-
sions throughout treatment. As with all components of the
LP, this measurement tool is used flexibly. Parents are asked
to rate their child's speech in everyday conversations on a
daily basis and plot this on the LP SR graph (see LP SR chart
in Appendix 10.1). The ways in which parents carry out these
daily SRs are negotiated to suit the family's routine and/or
the child's pattern of stuttering. For example, some parents
graph one SR for the entire day, while other parents might
elect to rate only the conversation at the dinner table, as this
is a time they focus on their child's speech. Another example
would be that some children typically stutter more in the
evening than in the morning, hence one rating does not capture
this trend appropriately and parents can graph two ratings, one
for the morning and one for the evening. During appoint-
ments with the clinician, the trends in the daily ratings from
home serve as the basis for decisions about how to maintain
the progress being made or how to remediate a lack of prog-
ress. In either case, the type and number of practice sessions
and the type and amount of feedback are discussed and eval-
uated by the clinician and parent in decisions about how to
proceed.
Toward the end of stage 1, the SRs are used to identify when
the child's stuttering is low enough to enter stage 2 of the LP.
Once daily SRs show a pattern of minimal stuttering (mainly 0
with some ratings of 1) for a period of 3 weeks, stage 2 of the
treatment commences. During stage 2, the parent and the SLT
continue to use the daily SRs to identify any signs of relapse
and adjust therapy accordingly.

language pathologist, SR, Severity Rating).

161

Practice sessions are another essential component of the LP.
Like measurement, practice sessions are a daily part of the
treatment in stage 1. During a practice session, which typically
lasts around 15 minutes, the parent selects an activity and
carries on a conversation that facilitates mostly stutter free
(e.g., an SR of 0 or 1). Although it is essential that parents con-
duct practice sessions with their children at home, exactly how
they do them depends on many factors including the child's
interests, their stuttering severity, and the family's routine.
The process of finding the best way for the parent and child
to engage in practice sessions begins during the first appoint-
ment where the clinician provides a model. Following on from
this, the clinician and the parent discuss and experiment with
various activities to identify those that are not only engaging
and fun for the child but also stimulate the kind of conversation
that is mostly stutter free. This is a balancing act, in that the
conversation should be as "simple as necessary" and at the
same time "as complex as possible" while eliciting mostly
stutter-free speech. To accomplish this, parents are taught com-
munication strategies that reduce the length and complexity of
their child's speech, but only to the extent that is necessary
to achieve very low stuttering during the practice sessions.
The conversation should not be too restricted. Every practice
session provides an opportunity to see how long and complex
the child's sentences can be while still remaining mostly stutter
free. When the practice sessions are balanced in this way, they
ensure the best context for the parent to give feedback and the
child to practice stutter-free speech. This is an essential skill for
the parent to learn and therefore is carefully explained and
modeled by the clinician.
Diﬀerent activities are selected not only on the basis of the
child's interests but also at a complexity level that is matched to
their current level of stuttering. As an example, a matching
game typically elicits much simpler language from the child
than a free-play activity, so it is best suited for children whose
stuttering is more frequent and severe. For example, at the
beginning of stage 1, a parent of a child with a significant level
of stuttering likely needs to select simple activities such as a
matching game or a coloring activity to stimulate conversation
that is in the here and now (rather than focused on imagination
or memory), and encourages utterances that are shorter and
less complex than might be customary for the child. Another
parent whose child is stuttering moderately may begin with
practice sessions in the context of picture books, allowing
conversation that is still in the here and now, but likely contains
longer sentences than would be the case in a matching game. In
the middle of stage 1, the stuttering severity of both these
children might have reduced to the extent that the parents can
select a pretend play activity with dolls or cars that allows for
some conversation with long sentences about abstract topics in
the child's imagination and memory. Finally, toward the end of
stage 1, both these children's speech might be mainly stutter
free and their parents can conduct practice sessions within
ordinary conversation without needing to manipulate the activ-
ity or their child's language.
During every appointment with the clinician, the parent
demonstrates the type of practice session they have conducted
at home during the previous week. It is the clinician's role to
provide feedback to the parent and demonstrate any changes in
the practice sessions that might be needed to suit changes in
the child's SRs, or any successes or diﬃculties the parent encoun-
tered in the previous week. Common issues that require
problem-solving during appointments with the clinician include
the following: keeping the conversation as simple as necessary
and as complex as possible while stimulating mostly stutter-free
speech from the child; finding varied activities that are fun as
well as suitable for generating the appropriate level of con-
versation for a practice session; and finding time to conduct
the practice sessions and occupying siblings while doing
practice sessions.
This process of demonstration, experimentation, and problem-
solving provides the basis for the clinician's recommendation for
the coming week. It also ensures that the parent feels confident
about being able to practice at home in ways that are fun and
enable their child to speak at an optimum level (i.e., simple as
necessary and as complex as possible) with mostly stutter-free
speech. When parents are able to conduct practice sessions this
way, it provides the best context for the parent to give feedback—
the third essential component of the LP.
Therapy Strategies
The primary strategy used in LP is parent-administered feed-
back that is mainly given not only for stutter-free speech but
also for stuttering. The following general principles apply for
any feedback in the LP:
●Feedback for stutter-free speech is always introduced before
feedback for stuttering.
●Feedback is given in practice sessions first and then in
everyday conversations.
●Feedback for stutter-free speech is more frequent than
feedback for stuttering.
●Feedback is embedded into the conversation and not
intrusive or intensive.
●The child and the parent must be comfortable with all
feedback given.
Although these general principles apply, each is individually
adjusted. For example, although feedback for stutter-free
speech is always introduced first, there are no hard and fast
rules for when feedback for stuttering is introduced. It might be
in the first few weeks or much later. Further, parents initially
only provide feedback during the 15-minute practice sessions;
however, there are no rigid guidelines for when feedback is
introduced in everyday conversations. It might be introduced
when the parents are noticing some stutter-free speech in
everyday conversation and are accurately providing feedback in
practice sessions. In addition, although feedback for stutter-free
speech is always more frequent than feedback for stuttering,
exactly how much of each is provided depends on how the
child and their stuttering responds—it might be a dozen in each
practice session, but it can also be fewer or many more. The
child and the parent must be comfortable with all the feedback
that is given.
As shown in ▶Fig. 10.5, there are three types of feedback for
stutter-free speech: acknowledgment, praise, and request for
self-evaluation. These three types of feedback enable the parent
to tailor their responses to their own and their child' style. For
example, some children and parents prefer very enthusiastic
praise or request for self-evaluation that can be considered
Preschool-Age Children
162

"double praise," for example, the parent asking "was that
smooth?" and the child saying "yes" and the parent following
up with "yes it was, well done!" Other parents' and children's
styles are more suited to very low-key acknowledgment, such
as the parent simply saying "smooth" to provide feedback. In
any case, the feedback must feel (to the parent) and sound (to
the child) sincere. If the child does not like the way the feedback
sounds, it must be adjusted until a style of feedback that suits
the child is found. Also, just as the wording and type of feed-
back is determined individually, so is the frequency of feedback.
Although it should be given consistently throughout the prac-
tice session, it should be neither intrusive nor intensive. That is,
feedback is "sprinkled" through the 15-minute practice session
conversation and does not detract from the content of the
conversation.
Feedback for stuttering is introduced once the parent is accu-
rately providing feedback for stutter free-speech and both
parent and child are comfortable with the feedback during the
15-minute practice sessions at home. Providing the child feed-
back after moments of stuttering can often occur as quickly as in
the first few weeks, but it may also take several months. At first,
as is the case with feedback for stutter-free speech, feedback for
stuttering is only introduced during the 15-minute practice
sessions. As shown in ▶Fig. 10.5, there are two types of feedback
for stuttering, acknowledgment and request for self-correction.
Both are delivered in a neutral tone and are in no way punitive.
In fact quite the opposite; a request for self-correction is deliv-
ered in a way that is helpful and gives the child the maximum
chance of responding with a stutter-free utterance. The parent is
taught to be specific and only ask the child to repeat the stut-
tered word or words, not the whole utterance. For example, if
the child says "I I I like the ones with the chocolate sprinkles",
the parent might respond, "So yummy!! Can you say 'I like'
again?" If the correction is successful in that the child produces
the stuttered word or words fluently, it is followed with praise,
for example, "you made it smooth, well done! I like the chocolate
sprinkles too!" and the conversation continues seamlessly. If
it is not successful and the child responds with a stuttered
word, the response is acknowledged but a second request for
self-correction is not provided, and once again, the conversa-
tion continues seamlessly. It is very important to ensure that
the child is comfortable with this kind of feedback, as it has the
potential to be perceived negatively. If the child is even slightly
uncomfortable when asked to self-correct, this type of feedback
is deferred, or left out altogether. It is not essential that it is
used in the LP.
Once the parent and child are comfortable with giving and
receiving feedback in the practice sessions and the parent is
noticing some entirely stutter-free utterances in everyday
conversations, the clinician teaches the parents how to give
feedback in everyday conversations. As with feedback during
the practice sessions, this feedback is individualized with
respect to its wording, enthusiasm, and frequency across the day.
Collaboration between the clinician and parent is essential to
individualized application of the LP. Although the clinician has
expert knowledge in stuttering and it is their role to demon-
strate and explain the components of the approach to the
parent. It is not until this knowledge is synthesized with the
parent's knowledge of their child, their family, and their child's
stuttering that treatment can be successful. Collaboration in
decision-making about how to conduct the treatment ensures
that it is done not only correctly but also in a way that is possi-
ble within their family's individual circumstances and charac-
teristics. Open discussion and experimentation with procedures
occur during every appointment, for example, deciding the best
times for practice sessions, selection of materials (e.g., books,
toys), and checking with parents to ensure their comfort with
the wording of reinforcement, for example, "I've just praised by
saying 'fantastic smooth words,' do you think that would feel ok
for you and Sam?" or "We're seeing SRs of mainly 4 s and that's
with about 5 praises in everyday conversation; I think it might
be good to do a few more. What would be another situation
you would hear some stutter-free speech in that you could
praise?" and so forth. Such problem-solving conversations sup-
port the parents' confidence and foster empowerment in their
ability to manage not only successes but also the diﬃculties
with treatment at home. Clinicians aim to develop a shared
sense of responsibility for the treatment with the parent, so

10.2 Therapy Approaches for Preschool Children Who Stutter
163

that the parent does not feel their role in the treatment weigh-
ing heavily on them. Creating this atmosphere of collaboration
and sharing of responsibility is one of the foundations of the LP.
Follow-up and Monitoring
Once the child's stuttering has shown a pattern of mainly 0 s
and some 1 s on the SR scale for 3 consecutive weeks, stage 2
of the LP commences. This stage of treatment consists of
follow-up and monitoring, designed to prevent relapse and
typically lasts around 12 months. If the child's SRs continue
to be mainly 0 s and some 1 s, and the parent is aware of how
to address any increases, the feedback in practice sessions
and everyday conversations are gradually and systematically
reduced. If relapse occurs, the feedback is increased or rein-
stated until the zero or near zero levels of stuttering are
reached once more.
In practical terms, this means that appointments with the
clinician are scheduled increasingly further apart: two times 2,
4, then 8, and finally 16 weeks apart. Parent collection of the
SRs continues throughout stage 2; however, it is also reduced in
frequency. Once appointments with the clinician are 8 weeks
apart or more, parents are asked to monitor regularly and to
comment on any increase in the child's stuttering, but only col-
lect SRs for 2 weeks prior to an appointment. Practice sessions
have usually ceased toward the end of stage 1, as the child's
speech is mainly stutter free in everyday conversations. If they
are still occurring, they are faded out in the early part of stage
2. Finally, assuming stuttering remains at a very low level, the
feedback that the parents give in everyday conversations is
reduced gradually from the amount that was being conducted
daily in stage 1, to almost no feedback except occasional praise
toward the end of stage 2.
10.2.3 Restart-Demands and
Capacities Model Based Treatment
Evidence Base for Restart-DCM
Beginning in the 1970s, clinicians and researchers in stuttering
began to develop treatment approaches for preschool stuttering
based on the idea that "fluency breaks down when environmental
and/or self-imposed demands exceed the organism's motoric,
linguistic, emotional or cognitive capacities for responding."49 This
notion was formalized in the Demands and Capacities Model
(DCM) of intervention developed for preschoolers and their
parents.6,7,50 This model assumes that stuttering arises when a
child attempts speech performance beyond his or her actual
capacities (skills and abilities) for fluent speech. It is viewed as
a consequence of a mismatch between task demands, and the
capacities that the child brings to the task at that moment in time.
Demands for fluency will naturally increase as a child gets older;
for example, listeners expect a quicker and more complete answer
to a question from a 5-year-old than from a 3-year-old. In most
cases, these increasing demands will be successfully met because
the child's capacities for fluent speech mature as a function
of time. In fact, it has been speculated that the synchronous
development of both language and speech motor skills and
performance with age may partly explain the high proportion
of unassisted or natural recovery from stuttering in young
children (see ▶Chapter 1 for a more detailed discussion of
unassisted or natural recovery).
Although research has shown that some children who stutter
exhibit relative weaknesses or dissociations in their capacities
for fluency,9,13,18,19,51,52,53,54,55,56 the DCM model assumes no
deficits. That is, a child's capacities for fluency across all four
domains—speech motor, linguistic, emotional, and cognitive—
may be within normal or even above normal limits.49 The latter
may be especially true for linguistic capacities,19,56 in that pre-
cocious language will place a high (internal) demand on a
child's (typically or poorly) developing speech motor system.
The central premise of DCM treatment is that decreasing com-
municative demands, both internal and external to the child,
can promote the child's speech fluency.57,58,59,60 For example,
parents' explicit acknowledgment of the child's diﬃculties with
talking during moments when the child is clearly experiencing
diﬃculty ("That was hard, wasn't it?" or "Learning to talk can
sometimes be hard") will decrease the emotional demands on
both. ▶Fig. 10.6 illustrates DCM's assumption that stuttering
results when the speech motor, linguistic, emotional, and cogni-
tive demands (internal and external) placed on the child for
fluent speech exceed the child's capacities in one, more, or all
of these domains at that moment in time.
Results of early DCM therapy have been reported by its
developers.7,61 Later, the eﬀectiveness of (Restart-)DCM was
investigated in two studies in the Netherlands, both compar-
ing (Restart-)DCM-based treatment—the standard treatment
approach in the Netherlands—with the LP (▶Table 10.1).
Analyzing the long-term outcome data of the RESTART study
is currently in progress.
Essential Pieces
Initial Assessment
A multifactorial assessment to identify the child's capacities
for fluent speech production, and the communication demands
placed on them, is an indispensable part of the Restart-DCM
approach. In addition to the assessment domains specified in
▶Table 7.3 in ▶Chapter 7 of this book, Restart-DCM assess-
ment also includes an assessment of the child's speech motor
skills: the accuracy, smooth flow, and rate of speech motor
movements.62 In addition, a parent-child interaction (PCI) is
analyzed3 Appendix 10.2 A teacher's questionnaire covering
the questions in ▶Table 7.2 is optional.
The PCI analysis, which is specific to Restart-DCM, serves as
the initial assessment activity. In this activity, the parents and
the child are invited to engage about 7 minutes in free play, and
preferably also about 7 minutes in a developmentally appropri-
ate structured activity (e.g., working on a puzzle together) "just
as they would do at home." This PCI sample is video recorded
and analyzed using the PCI Form (Appendix 10.1).3 This analysis
includes observing and scoring specific parent and child con-
versation behaviors such as interspeaker pause time; number,
type, and tone of parental questions; and parent's reactions to
the child's stuttering (verbal and nonverbal).
All assessment data collected are analyzed and used to
formulate hypotheses in preparation for a parent conference.
Which demands appear to cause communicative pressure for
the child? What capacities appear limited or poorly matched to
demands at this moment in time? Which factors appear to be
Preschool-Age Children
164

impacting the favorable balance between demands and capaci-
ties in an undesirable way? An example of how assessment data
is used to develop treatment aims is provided (Appendix 10.2).
During the parent conference, the child's parents are asked to
describe their idea or "theory" about what caused the child's
stuttering. Often parents express feelings of guilt and worry
about their child's stuttering, and the clinician should listen
deeply so that they feel comfortable expressing their beliefs.63
Reviewing the child's assessment data and explaining to
parents how the identified capacities and demands fit within
the Restart-DCM approach, the clinician can draw a plain
scale and note a few "weights": salient examples of demands
and capacities, and how well or poorly they are matched at
this moment in time. For example, the child's asynchronous
language development would be an example of capacity and
the parent's speech rate would be an example of a demand,
and so forth. Special Times and a logbook are introduced,
which are considered to be the bridge to starting treatment.
The parents are instructed to use the logbook to record the
length and content of each Special Time, including when and
what demands and capacities tools were practiced and
the results, specific observations of the child's and parent's
behavior,
and
questions
for
the
clinician.
Observations
recorded in the logbook are guided by a series of questions
that include the following: What did you do? For how long?
How did it go? What was the result? How did you experience
the "special time"? What did you notice about your child?
Therapy Structure
Treatment is delivered through once-weekly clinic sessions,
which last approximately 1 hour, with one parent attending.
After every fourth clinician-parent-child session, conferences
with both parents (without the child) are scheduled. It is pref-
erable to address parent concerns or diﬃculties without the
child being present.
▶Fig. 10.7 shows the key elements of Restart-DCM as the
steps of a staircase to emphasize that each step in the process
builds on the previous step.
As depicted in ▶Fig. 10.7, Restart-DCM includes three
discriminant treatment phases:
●Phase I: In the initial phase, therapy focuses on lowering
demands by teaching the parents tools to facilitate a better
match with the child's current capacities for fluency. Parents
learn to change their interaction style, first during treatment
sessions in the clinic, then at home during Special Times.
Gradually, parents start to change their interaction behavior
also in everyday situations. First, the relevant motoric
demands, as identified in the assessment, are addressed,
followed by linguistic, emotional, and, finally, cognitive
demands. Besides changes in interaction style, parents also
make changes in daily life to reduce demands placed on the
child. For example, parents may plan activities to improve the
predictability of events for the child and to adapt it to the
child's temperament. Many children only need this the first

demands for fluent speech outweighing the
child's capacities for fluent speech. Demands
and capacities include motor (light blue),
linguistic (orange), emotional (yellow), and
cognitive (dark blue). On the demands side of
the scale, lighter shades of one color express
internal demands, whereas darker shades
express external demands.

phase of Restart-DCM treatment (lowering relevant demands
for fluency) to achieve normally fluent speech. If so, all
behavioral adjustments gradually become normalized and
treatment will be tapered oﬀ(▶Fig. 10.7). Only if the child's
level of fluency has not reached acceptable levels (i.e., more
than occasional repetitions with one iteration) once relevant
demands have been addressed, phase II of the program—
increasing capacities—is added.
●Phase II: During this second phase, the clinician (in the clinic)
and the parents (in the clinic and at home) maintain the
achieved level of reduced communicative demands on the
child, and treatment proceeds with training of relevant
capacities for fluency. When the capacities of the child
mature and improve enough to withstand communicative
demands in everyday speaking situations, treatment will be
tapered oﬀ.
●Phase III: In the final phase of the program, enhancing
fluency more directly is initiated, but only if the child is still
exhibiting unacceptable disfluency after lowering demands
and increasing capacities.
In summary, a typical treatment session may include the
following: the clinician observes the PCI and the child's fluency,
reads the parents' notes in the logbook from the past week,
debriefs about how parent-child Special Times/practice sessions
went, reviews how treatment was implemented during the
past week, and demonstrates, discusses, and models changes in
procedures for the coming week. During the session, the parent
takes notes and practices new strategies. Finally, a plan for the
coming week and time allotted for discussion and problem-
solving is provided.
Therapy Strategies
Phase I of the program, lowering demands, begins with the
motor domain and targets decreasing the demands observed
during the assessment. The most common demand on the
child's speech motor system is a parental speech or articulation
rate, which is much faster than the child's rate in conversation.
Parents are trained to use an articulation rate that is comparable
to the child's rate when they are speaking fluently, typically
about three syllables per second for a 3- to 4-year-old. This
reduction in parent speaking rate typically feels "abnormal" to
them; indeed, while slower than the natural adult speech rate of
about five syllables per second, it is a temporary adjustment
intended to restore a favorable demands/capacities balance for
the child. Another way to reduce the demands within the motor
domain is by teaching parents to extend the breaks they take
between the child's own conversations and their own conversa-
tions, and arranging turn taking.
Decreasing demands on the child in the linguistic domain
includes training parents to ask fewer questions of their child
in conversation and using more declarative and redundant
language instead. Within the emotional domain, parents may be
taught to respond helpfully when the child stutters, but only
when the child shows signs of increased emotional reactivity
or distress (e.g., "Saying that word was hard, wasn't it?). In
addition, providing the child with words to express emotions in
daily situations can help the child to regulate strong emotional
reactions in the moment (e.g., "You feel angry because you
think it is unfair that you have to go to bed now"). This type of
response can help reduce the child's level of emotionality, but
only if the parent's tone of voice is empathetic and sincere.
Once the parent has used wording to convey that they have

phase III (enhancing fluency more directly), tapering off treatment.

166

heard and seen the child, they can proceed with a direction or
explanation (e.g., "Four-year-old boys need good sleep so that
they will be ready for the next day. Oﬀwe go"). This two-step
model of responding to the child's emotion followed by provid-
ing language models and explanations was specifically devel-
oped for Restart-DCM treatment (Appendix 10.2),3 and can be
very helpful; however, only if the parent-child relationship is
positive; otherwise, parents may sound hostile or punitive to
the child. In addition, in the cases where the child is especially
sensitive to his stuttering, parents can model easy, typical dis-
fluencies for the child. Occasional modeling of normal disfluen-
cies for the child, such as "Clean, clean up your toys" or "Clean
up your, eh, toys," may decrease demands by lowering the
child's internal (and high) "fluency standard." Finally, in the
cognitive domain, parents can be taught to show the child how
to respond in a specific situation rather than demanding
speech; for example, modeling the sentence "Thank you for the
slice of sausage, sir" as opposed to "What do you say?"
It is essential to remember that any changes in communica-
tion that are proposed to parents are always first modeled by
the clinician, and then practiced with the parent during a treat-
ment session before they start using them at home. Only after
the parent feels comfortable using these strategies, and the
clinician thinks they have suﬃciently mastered the relevant
behaviors (e.g., dealing with the child's frustration after losing a
game), are they ready to practice at home. As an example, a
mother who sought treatment for her 3-year-old son shared
that she sometimes had cried in bed at night, feeling very
guilty, because she could not manage to slow her speaking rate
on her own, recommended to do so by a former clinician. For
most parents, changing habitual communicative patterns is
hard, so in Restart-DCM, we consider modeling and practicing
essential to the success of the approach. In general, building a
respectful, honest, and supportive working alliance with the
parent is considered crucial: at home, the parent delivers the
treatment and the clinician guides the parent to do this eﬀec-
tively and safely.
Phase II of the program, increasing capacities, also firstly
targets the speech motor domain. If shown to be relevant from
results of the assessment, the child's speech motor skills will be
targeted.62,64,65 The therapist will model sequences of nonsense
words such as /zipe/ and /mitapo/ (14 levels of diﬃculty), and
children are invited to repeat these syllable sets accurately,
smoothly, and coarticulated. Speech motor training starts at a
very slow rate (1 syllable/s), then slow (2 syllables/s), and then
a normal rate (3 syllables/s), and with varying stress patterns
and intonation. Nonsense syllable sets are followed by sequenc-
ing real words,66 and are paired with other activities such as
coloring and dancing, gradually generalizing these movements
to spontaneous speech to stimulate automaticity. If the parents
are able to successfully engage in these so-called "speech gym"
activities with their child at home, two times a day for about
5 minutes and speech fluency does not normalize, training
capacities in the relevant language domain, including phonol-
ogy, will be added. For example, if the assessment results
indicate that strengthening receptive or expressive language
capacities would benefit the child's speech fluency, or in case
of a language dissociation (e.g., a lower word knowledge as
compared to other language capacities), then language inter-
vention would be appropriate to reduce this imbalance. If the
child's speech fluency is still not normalized after relevant
speech motor and language capacity training, and assessment
results
and
observation
indicate
that
emotional
factors
appear to contribute to more (severe) stuttering, increasing
the
child's
capacities
in
the
emotional
domain
can
be
targeted. Specific and more direct exercises to desensitize the
child to stuttering (i.e., decreasing the child's reactivity to
stuttering) may be relevant. Those children who stutter more
in situations where they become easily and quickly upset or
excited, or who withdraw quickly and regulate slowly, may
benefit from direct activities to improve awareness of their
emotions, and their emotional reactivity and improve self-
regulation skills. For example, the therapist may first model
for the child that losing a game can be hard and can make you
angry (reactivity), but that you can still continue the game
(regulate), which is more important. Then, the therapist will
try to engage the child in the exercise. It goes without saying
that directly teaching self-regulation strategies is always
adapted to the child's maturity level. Finally, in the cognitive
domain, the child can engage, for example, in activities to
learn how to take turns during verbal interactions, if this is
still a situation that seems to elicit more stuttering.
Phase III of the Restart-DCM program, enhancing fluency more
directly, is initiated if the child's level of disfluency is still too
high after lowering relevant demands and training relevant
capacities. Phase III involves teaching the child how to modify
instances of stuttering. For example, while playing games
appropriate for the child's developmental level, examples of
how to change stuttered speech in a playful way will be shown
to the child. For example, contrasting an easy repetition with a
tense prolongation, or comparing and contrasting large articula-
tion movements (e.g., mouth more open, lips more rounded)
with small articulation movements (e.g., mouth a little bit open,
lips hardly rounding). All clinician modeling and practicing
occurs in a playful manner, modeling an attitude of tolerance
for stuttering and while the child is invited to participate. At
home, parents replicate these strategies and games to ensure
that the child experiences normal (dis)fluency and spontane-
ously starts to employ other, easier ways of speaking as a result
of these experiences. The balance between demands and
capacities continues to fulfill the pivotal role in treatment.
Follow-up and Monitoring
Over the course of treatment, the clinician periodically measures
the child's stuttering severity (using the Stuttering Severity
Instrument, Fourth Edition [SSI-4]),67 and both the parent and
clinician periodically rate the child's fluency on a qualitative
8-point scale,8 where 0 = normal fluency, no stuttering, 1 =
borderline fluency, 2 = mild stuttering, and 8 = very severe
stuttering.9 Parents also repeatedly (e.g., every 3 months)
rate the impact of stuttering on the child (see ▶Chapter 7).
When the child exhibits normal speech fluency for several
weeks, home treatment sessions will be gradually termi-
nated, parental use of lowering demands in daily conversa-
tion with their child will become gradually normalized, and
treatment sessions will be gradually tapered oﬀ. At the termi-
nation of therapy, parents should feel skilled in lowering
communicative demand, so they will be able to respond to a
relapse of stuttering immediately by lowering demands.
10.2 Therapy Approaches for Preschool Children Who Stutter
167

10.3 Discussion
With each of the approaches described in this chapter, there
will be children who continue to stutter. One of the roles of the
therapist is to ensure that intervention does not reinforce
negative views of stuttering in either the child or their
parents. In the case that early intervention does not achieve
fluent speech, both parent and child may experience a sense
of failure and a negative view of therapy. If these results are
not discussed with sensitivity and care, there is a danger that
the pursuit of fluency can give the child (and parents) an
unintended message that stuttering is undesirable, some-
thing to be fixed, avoided, or hidden. If we reinforce the belief
that the stuttering must be stopped no matter what, we run
the risk of encouraging avoidance, shame, and guilt about
stuttering, and strengthening a belief that a happy life is
impossible when you stutter. Therapy for stuttering in the early
years is the beginning of a process of tolerance and acceptance
of diﬀerence, more in keeping with current attitudes and views
regarding diversity in other walks of life. Supporting eﬀective
and confident communication, participation in daily activities,
and the child's ability to reach their potential are the ultimate
aim, whether or not they continue to stutter.
In some countries, a monitoring phase precedes the begin-
ning of early intervention.5 The length of this monitoring period
depends on the presence of risk factors described in the intro-
duction, and the impact stuttering has on the parents and child.
Often, there will be good reasons to recommend immediate
therapy, even in the cases where time since onset is only
3 months.
Given the options available, the clinician will need to decide
which of the available treatments will be oﬀered to an individu-
al child and family. The similarities and diﬀerences between
Palin PCI, LP, and Restart-DCM are shown in ▶Fig. 10.8, and
careful comparison of each when considered in the context of
the child's and family's needs will facilitate decision-making.
Importantly, recent research suggests that while all three
treatments are eﬀective, there is not one approach that yields
a better outcome than another.38
As discussed throughout this chapter, parent preferences are
considered, and should be a fundamental to shared decision-
making. Parent preferences may be influenced by their own
experiences of therapy, cultural norms, values, priorities, learn-
ing styles, or the child's temperament. In reality, however, the
choice of treatment used may be heavily influenced by factors
such as the needs and opportunities for postgraduate training
of clinicians in the region, and the skills, background, and theo-
retical perspectives of graduate instructors and experienced
colleagues. The approach of choice will be further influenced by
the treatment setting (school, private practice, university clinic)
and travel distances. Finally, there may be higher political or
institutional directives within a service delivery model or insur-
ance policy that restrict the family's and therapist's choice.
Ultimately, what is important is for the therapist to seek the
necessary training to reliably and validly deliver one or more of
these approaches, and seek continuing education as caseloads
demand.
In some circumstances, it is possible for individual clinicians
to oﬀer a choice of intervention, but this tends to be limited to
more specialist therapy contexts (i.e., centers dedicated to
stuttering and stuttering therapy), or in certain countries
such as the Netherlands and the United States. If a clinician is
unable to oﬀer a choice, parents should be educated about
the diﬀerent approaches and provided support in accessing
those elsewhere if they choose. In sum, it is most important
for the therapist to be trained in the approach they use, the
therapy is individualized to meet the family's needs, and
that the impact of the intervention is monitored and jointly
reviewed at regular periods.

10.4 Conclusions and Future
Directions
At the Oxford Fluency Conference in 2014, it was recognized
that fluency is not the only outcome for therapy and not neces-
sarily the most important one. Satisfaction with communication
in everyday situations was proposed as the primary outcome
for stuttering therapy.68 Unfortunately, research following up
on this is still very limited.69
Further research into the mechanisms of change and critical
components of therapy is required. In this respect, research into
the LP is more advanced, with the researchers investigating the
contribution of treatment components.70,71 Research should
also investigate the eﬀectiveness of treatment components such
as "lowering speech motor demands" or "increasing speech
motor capacities." More information about what features of the
LP, Restart-DCM, and Palin PCI are the mechanisms of action
would help refine and enhance the methods and potentially
increase treatment adherence and fidelity.72 Although therapies
have several commonalities (which might explain why they
have comparable outcomes), and most treatments appear to
work for most families and children, there is unlikely to be a
"one-size-fits-all" intervention.23 Understanding more about
the variability in responses to intervention, the factors that
influence that, will help improve the recommendations for
which therapy might be more or less suitable for which child.
Further, the eﬃciency of treatments needs to be compared.
For example, Palin PCI and Restart-DCM are both indirect
approaches, but Palin PCI takes only six sessions and one
follow-up session, whereas Restart-DCM treatment has a mean
of 20 sessions over the first 18 months from treatment onset.39
Last but not least, as we learn more about the genetic under-
pinnings and the neurophysiological mechanisms of stuttering,
we hope that more targeted and eﬀective therapies will be
developed. Therefore, although we have support for our current
methods, research into novel interventions should continue.

Abstract
This chapter describes strategies for helping school-age children
who stutter (i.e., children between the ages of 6 and 12 years)
learn how to navigate the impact of stuttering on their commu-
nication and their lives as a whole. The treatment process is
presented as a comprehensive approach that must be consid-
ered within the context of overall communication functioning;
the overarching goal of therapy is to ensure that the child is
able to speak freely and eﬀectively, regardless of whether or not
moments of stuttering are produced in the flow of speech.
Because numerous approaches to stuttering therapy for school-
age children have been described in the literature, we will pro-
vide readers with an overview of the general therapy process
and its various components. In doing so, readers will learn how
to identify relevant aspects of therapy for diﬀerent children
who stutter and how to select from and adapt available treat-
ment options to meet the needs of each individual child. A set
of targeted case examples, rather than a single, detailed case
study, is used to demonstrate the steps in the clinical decision-
making process so that readers can apply the general concepts
underlying stuttering therapy to individual children.
Keywords: stuttering, treatment, therapy, intervention, school-
age, speech fluency
11.1 Introduction
Working with school-age children who stutter oﬀers speech-
language pathologists (SLPs) countless challenges and opportu-
nities. The challenges arise because the school-age years bring
new uncertainties for children as they learn to navigate greater
independence and responsibility in their speech and in their
lives as a whole. The opportunities arise because there is much
that SLPs can do, while working collaboratively with children,
caregivers, and others, to reduce the impact of stuttering and to
minimize the likelihood that the child will experience negative
consequences associated with stuttering. The overarching prin-
ciple guiding our approach to treatment for school-age children
who stutter is that "stuttering is more than just stuttering."1
This means that the experience of stuttering for the child
involves more than just the production of stuttered speech
disfluencies. Accordingly, therapy for stuttering must address
more than the child's observable stuttering behaviors. In this
chapter, we talk about how to address the entirety of the stut-
tering experience, including issues related to speech fluency as
well as the ways the child, family/caregivers, and others react to
stuttering, the ways in which stuttering might aﬀect the child's
ability to communicate eﬀectively, and the impact that stutter-
ing might have on the child's overall quality of life.
This chapter is organized as follows. We begin by highlighting
the importance of diagnostic data to ensure that clinical decision-
making is based on an appropriate foundation of evidence. We
then discuss some of the reasons that working with school-age
children who stutter is unique, emphasizing the challenges and
opportunities mentioned earlier. We then move on to the details
of treatment, starting with the primary goals of therapy for
school-age children who stutter. To ensure that treatment is
comprehensive in nature,2 we base our goal-selection process on
the World Health Organization's International Classification of
Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF),3 a standard framework
that is used around the world for categorizing all aspects of
human health experience. Within the context of the ICF, we then
describe various treatment options that can be used for each
unique child who stutters and their caregivers. Following this, we
illustrate how the process can unfold by sharing a set of case
examples, highlighting how our treatment decisions are aﬀected
by particular characteristics of the child and caregivers. We then
discuss two specific aspects of the therapy process that can
greatly aﬀect outcomes: the development of the therapeutic
alliance and the clinician's demonstration of empathy. Finally, we
end with some brief thoughts about the future of stuttering
therapy for this age group, as we aﬃrm that clinicians can make a
positive diﬀerence in the lives of school-age children who stutter
and their families. Our orientation to treating children who
stutter is optimistic, and we hope that, by the time you finish
with this chapter, you will agree.
11.2 The Importance of
Assessment
This is a chapter on treatment, but before we can begin to discuss
how to plan therapy, we must first ensure that we have appropri-
ate assessment data. The components of a comprehensive stutter-
ing assessment for school-age are described in ▶Chapter 8, and
we emphasize that one should never predetermine what a child
needs in therapy based solely on the knowledge that "the child
stutters." Put simply, diﬀerent children who stutter need diﬀerent
therapy, and the only way to know what that therapy should be
is to first have adequate information about the unique needs of
each child and family. The best way to obtain this knowledge
is through a comprehensive assessment process that involves
more than just measuring stuttering frequency or severity.4
Importantly, research has shown that the speakers' experience of
stuttering is not solely determined by the amount, nature, or
severity of stuttering that the speakers may produce.5 For exam-
ple, some children may stutter frequently yet experience minimal
adverse impact resulting from their stuttering. On the other hand,
some may stutter infrequently (at least as determined by
listeners) yet experience significant negative impact.6 Therefore,
we must assess more than just observable stuttering behavior.
As described in ▶Chapter 8 (see also ▶Table 11.1), a
comprehensive evaluation of a school-age child who stutters
should include information about how the child and the peo-
ple in the child's environment (friends, peers, teachers, family
members, and other caregivers) react to and cope with stut-
tering. This includes details about how stuttering is aﬀecting
the child (often referred to as "adverse impact" or "impact on
quality of life") and the child's interactions with others, as
well as reports from the child and other relevant individuals
174

in the child's life. Some of this information can be gathered
through standardized assessments, though clinicians will also
find it valuable to conduct detailed interviews with the child,
the caregivers, and other relevant individuals who know and
interact with the child. Going forward in this chapter, we
assume that a comprehensive evaluation has already been
conducted and that the clinician and family have decided that
therapy is both warranted and recommended.
11.3 General Considerations for
Working with School-Age Children
"Growing up is hard, and I'm trying not to do it."
-10-year-old child
Children who continue to stutter beyond the preschool years
face several challenges that SLPs must be prepared to address.
Put simply, school-age children who stutter are diﬀerent from
preschool children who stutter: they are more likely to continue
stuttering,7,8,9 and they are more at risk of experiencing nega-
tive reactions,10,11,12 both from themselves and from others.
Moreover, school-age children have unique psychosocial,
aﬀective, and behavioral developmental patterns that are
distinct from those of younger children—and also from those
of adolescents.
11.3.1 School-Age Children Who
Stutter Are Still Growing
Although school-age children are often referred to as "big kids,"
they sometimes want to do "little kid" things, as well. As they
move away from younger childhood and toward adolescence,
school-age children may want to show increasing independ-
ence from their caregivers. Simultaneously, they also show
increasing dependence on their peers for social, emotional, and
academic development and validation.13 School-age children
are not only growing physically but also developing more com-
plicated notions about their sense of self and their personal
identity. Simultaneously, they are expanding their awareness of
their future roles in society and relationship with others. More-
over, a growing body of research has shown that school-age
children's temperament is likely to aﬀect their experiences with
stuttering over time.14,15
Developmentally, school-age children are at an age of insta-
bility, exploration, and self-focus; they are in a stage of being
"in between," sandwiched between two more clearly identifi-
able age groups. For these reasons, school-age children often
experience confused and confusing feelings about stuttering.
It is critically important that we demonstrate unconditional
positive regard for the child, their thoughts, and their emo-
tions. We will return to the notion of providing support to
our clients when we discuss empathy and the "therapeutic
alliance" toward the end of this chapter. For now, we want to
highlight the value of supporting school-age children through
the unique position they find themselves in: not yet fully inde-
pendent, but still expected to take on more responsibility and
initiative every day—even in areas in which they may still
feel the need for greater support. Dealing with the challenges
presented by stuttering may be one of those areas. Children
benefit when they know that we are there to help them even
as they work to find their own way.
As you can see, it is necessary for SLPs to adapt their treat-
ment to the unique developmental stage of school-age children.
This means that we need to be aware of the rapid changes in
development, learning, and preferred activities that children
experience during this period (▶Table 11.2). For example, like
preschool-age children, children aged 6 to 7 years enjoy many
diﬀerent activities, including gross motor activities, such as
riding bicycles and jumping rope; they generally like to be
occupied and kept busy during treatment sessions. At the same
time, they may also be able to engage in repeated practice
activities in order to improve their skills and abilities. By the
age of 8 or 9 years, children are becoming more proficient in
their abilities; they can care for themselves more eﬀectively,
and they can employ finer motor skills, such as using tools,
sewing, and drawing. Still, they like to play, and an important
aspect of play at this age is learning to interact and socialize
with others. During the school-age years, children tend to move
from playing alone to having multiple friends and social groups.
Friendships become more important across these years, but
school-age children are generally still connected to their
caregivers and like being part of a family unit. Generally, by the
age of 10 to 12 years, children's interests move toward
competition-based games; they may enjoy participating in
clubs and groups, thereby highlighting the even greater role of
social interaction. By this age, children are lively contributors to
conversations, and they usually enjoy engaging with and talk-

ing to others. Talking plays an increasingly important role in
the child's life, and this has particular relevance for understand-
ing the impact of stuttering—and the role of the SLP in helping
children who stutter. ▶Table 11.3 summarizes some of the
ways in which stuttering might aﬀect school-age children dif-
ferently from the way it aﬀects preschool-age children.
11.3.2 Stuttering Aﬀects School-Age
Children Diﬀerently from Preschool
Children
One of the key ways in which stuttering can aﬀect school-age
children is in their social interactions with others. Social com-
petence, or skilled communication in social behavior, plays a
substantial role in children's social development. The fact that
stuttering can interfere with communication may have conse-
quences for the child's participation in social discourse.12 For
example, social banter is one tool that young people may use to
both test out and forge friendships. Knowing good jokes and
being able to tell them, as well as using popular slang words
and terminology, matters at this age; school-age children want
to be able to interact with potential friends in an easy and ef-
fortless way, but stuttering can hamper their ability to do this.
School-age children who stutter may also experience bullying
and other negative reactions from their peers.16,17 The result
can be diminished opportunity for social interaction, increased
isolation, and greater adverse impact on the child's quality of
life as a result of stuttering. All of these consequences reflect
the unique challenges faced by school-age children who stutter,
and so they must be carefully considered in a comprehensive
plan of treatment.18
Another way in which stuttering aﬀects school-age child dif-
ferently than younger children is the basic fact that they have
been stuttering for a longer period of time—and, the older they
get, the more time they have spent stuttering.13 They may not
remember a time when they did not stutter, and this has conse-
quences for their still-developing self-concept and self-identity.
For example, children may see themselves only or primarily as
a person who stutters, and ignore the other important roles
they have, and other characteristics they possess. Moreover, the
growing demands placed on school-age children for increas-
ingly adultlike social, communicative, and academic compe-
tence may exacerbate concerns about speaking, stuttering, and
communicating.19
11.3.3 School-Age Children Are Not
Adolescents or Adults
Just as school-age children are diﬀerent from preschool children,
they are also diﬀerent from adolescents and adults.20 They are
still developing their self-awareness skills and their ability to
manage their behavior. Crucially, they may not be able to demon-
strate the same level of commitment to change or independence
as adolescents and adults. This has important consequences for
therapy, aﬀecting everything from goal selection to how sessions
are structured and the nature of practice assignments. At the
same time, the school-age years present numerous opportunities
for children to develop healthy attitudes and learn ways of
responding to stuttering that reduce the likelihood of later
concerns with self-esteem and self-confidence. This, in turn, can
minimize the adverse impact of stuttering on quality of life,
something that is commonly experienced by adolescents and
adults who stutter. If children can learn at an early age that what
they say is valued—even if it is produced disfluently21—then this
can go a long way toward diminishing the adverse impact of stut-
tering that they might otherwise experience later in life.

the responses of caregivers. As parents and others begin to
recognize that their child did not "grow out" of stuttering at
an earlier age, they may worry more about how stuttering
might aﬀect their child's life.22,23 For example, they may raise
concerns about the potential eﬀects of bullying, and they may
wonder about whether or how stuttering will aﬀect the child's
later school performance, employment opportunities, and
overall success in life. This concern can lead to an even greater
sense of urgency for their child to make progress both in and
out of treatment. In response to this increased worry about
the impact of stuttering on the child's future, caregivers often
become concerned that their child is not practicing enough or
focusing enough on their speech. This can result in parents
placing
greater
pressure
on
the
child's
communication,
whether intentionally or unintentionally.24 Teachers, too, may
experience increasing concern about how to respond to a
child's stuttering at school, and this can compound the diﬃcul-
ties that children experience, in and out of the classroom.25,26
The child's continued stuttering can also have an impact on
the caregivers themselves,27 as they continue to worry about the
role that they may have played in their child's development—and
lack of recovery from stuttering. They may have understandable
fears about how to help their children cope with stuttering as
they grow, and this can increase the impact of stuttering on the
entire family. Thus, the experiences and hopes of caregivers must
also be considered in treatment for children who stutter.23 The
discussions that SLPs have with caregivers of school-age children
are going to be diﬀerent from those they have with the care-
givers of children in the preschool years. Accounting for the
needs of caregivers is another reason that eﬀective therapy
for school-age children who stutter should be broad based,
addressing not only the child's speech fluency but also their
overall experience of stuttering, as well as the experiences and
the reactions of those in the child's environment.
11.4 Comprehensive Treatment
for School-Age Children Who
Stutter
Readers will likely identify a consistent theme that runs through-
out many of the chapters in this book: stuttering treatment
should not focus only on observable stuttering behaviors.
Although there may be diﬀerences of opinion about the specific
nature and cause(s) of stuttering or about the specific form that
assessment and treatment should take,2,28 we believe that it is
fair to say that there is general consensus across theorists and
clinicians alike about the fact that stuttering is a complex condi-
tion that involves many diﬀerent aspects of a person's life.
11.4.1 A Framework for Understanding
Stuttering
Accounting for the various aspects of the experience of stutter-
ing can be confusing, even for clinicians and researchers who
specialize in stuttering and its treatment. To make the complex-
ities of stuttering assessment and therapy easier to understand,
we find it helpful to use a widely accepted framework for
describing human health experience in general. In this chapter
(as in ▶Chapter 8), we use the ICF. This framework is used in
the field of speech-language pathology in general, in part
because it forms the core of our scope of practice,29 and in part
because it highlights the ways in which diﬀerent aspects of the
experience of communication issue can relate to one another.
The general structure of the ICF is described in ▶Chapter 8,
so we will not go into specifics here. Put simply, the ICF describes
the overall experience of behavioral and health disorders in
terms of two primary interacting components: (1) body function
and structure and (2) activities and participation. Interacting
with both of these components is (3) personal and environ-
mental context. First, the body function and structure compo-
nent includes all of the major structures and functions of the
human body, along with the ways in which people can experi-
ence impairments in those body structures and functions.
Second, activities and participation include the various activ-
ities that people might wish to engage in as they participate in
their lives, as well as the limitations or restrictions on either
that may be associated with the impairment. Finally, the ways
a person's experience of a condition or disorder such as stut-
tering can be aﬀected by their own personal reactions to the
situations they face, as well as the reactions of those in their
environment. These key components of the ICF and their appli-
cation to stuttering in school-age children are summarized in
▶Table 11.4.

11.4 Comprehensive Treatment for School-Age Children Who Stutter
177

Applying the ICF framework to stuttering assumes that the
impairment in body function for people who stutter reflects
underlying diﬀerences in the various linguistic, motoric, temper-
amental processes31 that arise from genetic32 and neurological33
diﬀerences commonly seen in people who stutter. This funda-
mental impairment ultimately results in what might be termed
the primary symptom of stuttering as experienced by people
who stutter,30 that is, the sensation of being "stuck" when trying
to speak. Adults who stutter describe this sensation as a "loss of
control,"34 or a moment in which they know what they want to
say but are unable to say it. This sensation can lead the speaker to
exhibit and experience various reactions that can be described
as aﬀective
(feelings),
behavioral
(actions),
or cognitive
(thoughts). Common aﬀective reactions include feelings of
embarrassment, shame, frustration, and anxiety.35 Common
behavioral reactions include disruptions in speech fluency
(i.e., speech disfluencies), physical tension or struggle,36 and
avoidance or escape behaviors.37 Common cognitive reactions
include lower self-esteem or self-confidence,38 a reduced sense
of self-eﬃcacy,39 or self-stigma.40 People in the speaker's
environment can also react, for example, by cutting the speaker
oﬀ, finishing sentences, or bullying the speaker, and this, in turn,
can increase the individual's own negative reactions to their
stuttering.41,42 The sensation of being stuck, combined with the
internal and external negative reactions, can lead to limitations
in daily activities such as introducing oneself, joining in conver-
sations, telling a joke, and reading aloud or asking questions in
class. If a child experiences diﬃculties in these daily activities,
then this might contribute to broader restrictions in the child's
ability or willingness participate in the educational setting or in
learning to socialize with others.
The ICF model is helpful when working with school-age
children who stutter because it allows clinicians to view stut-
tering in the larger context of the child's everyday experiences.
In this way, it reduces the likelihood that clinicians will focus
primarily or only on surface-level characteristics (i.e., speech
fluency) and intentionally or inadvertently ignore the child's
thoughts and feelings—and the role they play in both the expe-
rience of stuttering. In the next portion of this chapter, we will
demonstrate how the ICF can support the development of a
comprehensive set of treatment goals that address the entire
experience of stuttering for the school-age child.
11.4.2 Selecting Appropriate Treatment
Goals
As we have noted, treatment for school-age children who stut-
ter should be tailored to the needs of each individual child and
family. Even so, there are commonalities43 in treatment goals
and procedures that are relevant across children and their fami-
lies, even as the specific procedures used for achieving these
goals need to be individualized. We present these general
goals below following the structure of the ICF, then we provide
more specific details about how to implement them later in the
chapter. (A summary of sample goal areas as reflected by the
ICF framework is shown in ▶Table 11.5.)
Impairment
According to people who stutter,30 the fundamental core or
underlying experience of the moment of stuttering involves a
sensation of being stuck or of losing control of the speech
mechanism. It is this sensation of being unable to move forward
that is believed to lead to the disruptions in speech that are
characterized as "stuttered" or "stutterlike" disfluencies. Thus, a
common goal for stuttering therapy is to help speakers learn to
identify and navigate through the sensation of feeling or being
stuck.1 The diﬀerent therapeutic strategies for doing this can
result in an overall reduction in the frequency of stuttering as
well as qualitative changes in the form that stuttering takes
(e.g., a reduction in the perceived severity of stuttering). Examples
of goals that address this aspect of stuttering center on so-called
speech modification or speech restructuring strategies44,45 that
seek to enhance fluency, as well as so-called stuttering modifica-
tion strategies46,47 that seek to help people stutter with less
physical tension or struggle, so that stuttering moments are less
disruptive to ongoing communication. (Note that these aspects
of therapy can also be seen as relating to the child's reactions,
covered in the next section. Although we often think about the
components of the ICF model in fairly independent terms, it is
necessary to recognize that they are in fact interacting and
overlapping.3) A brief comparison of speech modification and
stuttering modification strategies is shown in ▶Table 11.6.
Child's Reactions
As one might imagine, the experience or sensation of being
stuck or of losing control is not pleasant. In reaction, children
who stutter may tense their muscles when speaking or avoid
talking altogether as they attempt to cope with the underlying
disruption in speech planning36 or diﬃculty in producing
speech smoothly (behavioral reactions). At the same time, they
may feel embarrassed, anxious, or upset about the resulting dis-
ruption in fluency (aﬀective reactions) and, over time, they
might come to believe that they cannot communicate eﬀec-
tively (cognitive reactions).

178

A substantial literature from the field of psychology has
described methods for helping people understand and ulti-
mately change these types of aﬀective, behavioral, and cogni-
tive reactions48,49 to a wide range of issues. These so-called
cognitive therapy approaches have direct relevance to the
treatment of school-age children who stutter, and in recent years
several authors have described ways to use cognitive methods in
stuttering therapy. These include cognitive behavioral therapy,50
acceptance and commitment therapy,51,52,53 and mindfulness54
approaches, and there is a growing literature on the use of these
types of cognitive therapy approaches in helping children who
stutter (and their families) come to terms with stuttering so that
it causes less adverse impact in their lives. For example, Murphy
and colleagues have described how to use cognitive restructur-
ing (a common cognitive therapy strategy) to "de-awfulize"
stuttering so that children can learn to respond less negatively to
moments of stuttering.55,56 This helps children learn to tolerate
the discomfort of stuttering rather than trying to run from or
avoid it. As children become desensitized to moments of stutter-
ing, and as they learn to cope with the sensation of loss of
control, they can communicate more easily and more eﬀectively.
Environment/Reactions
Children experience a wide variety of communication environ-
ments, and there can be notable diﬀerences in how other people
in their family and community react to stuttering. As a result,
children need to learn how to navigate their communication
experiences at home, at school, in social settings, at community-
based events, and in many other potential situations (e.g., sports,
band, dance, on the school bus, etc.). Unfortunately, children who
stutter often find themselves in an environment that does not
understand stuttering.1 Parents and other caregivers, teachers,
peers, and even SLPs may harbor misperceptions and misunder-
standings about stuttering and stuttering therapy. Given these
challenges, children need therapeutic support as they learn to
advocate for themselves, to educate the people around them
about stuttering, and to respond appropriately and eﬀectively to
challenging situations such as bullying.56,57
Activity Limitations and Participation
Restrictions
The challenges associated with stuttering can result in a situation
where children are less willing or able to (1) perform daily activ-
ities associated with speaking and (2) participate fully in com-
munication situations. Goals related to reducing these activity
limitations and participation restrictions are the culmination
of all of the general goals described earlier: helping children
respond diﬀerently to the sensation of being stuck (thereby
changing their speech fluency or stuttering), helping children
reduce their negative reactions to stuttering so they are less
concerned about speaking diﬀerently from other people, and
creating an environment that is supportive of their communica-
tion diﬀerences. Put simply, it is easier for children who stutter
to perform daily activities related to speaking and to participate
more fully in social interaction when they can speak and
communicate more easily, think and feel less negatively about
themselves and their stuttering, and have an environment that
understands and accepts them. SLPs can further support reduc-
tions in adverse impact due to stuttering by specifically helping
children learn to fully engage in daily activities involving speaking
and to participate in social interaction, for example, by intention-
ally entering feared situations that they might otherwise have
avoided and by being open about stuttering so that they are not
held back by a fear of being "found out" as a person who stutters.
11.4.3 Focusing on Communication
Rather than Speech Fluency as a Primary
Outcome
As should by now be apparent, the goals of therapy for
school-age children will likely involve a mix of improving
communication attitudes, increasing the child's and care-
givers' understanding about stuttering, fostering the child's
sense of empowerment and self-acceptance, and making
changes in speech production that enhance overt fluency and
minimize the severity of stuttering behaviors. Still, it is
important to recognize that children (and their families)
often come to therapy with one goal in mind: to increase the
child's fluency. As we work to create meaningful goals for
each individual child, we need to understand why the family
(and perhaps the child) sought therapy in the first place.
More than likely, fluency is only part of a bigger picture.
When we dig deeper into motivations for therapy, we often
find a broader desire for the child to be able to communicate
more easily and more eﬀectively. The true goal is not just for
the child to be fluent when speaking but also for the child to
be able to say what they want to say without being held back.20
Likewise, the wider motivation for therapy is often the desire for
the child to succeed in school, in their career, and in their life as a
whole, regardless of whether or not they stutter. Put diﬀerently,
the caregivers' sincere wish for therapy is that it will help their
child to be "okay"—even if they continue to stutter.1
"I just want him to be okay."

11.4 Comprehensive Treatment for School-Age Children Who Stutter
179

The caregivers' and child's genuine thoughts about therapy and
what they hope it will accomplish can often be more thor-
oughly unpacked in the early stages of the therapy process. For
example, children may share that they wish that they could
raise their hand in class or order for themselves at a restaurant,
or they may reveal that they want to be able to tell a joke or a
story to their friends.58 These are concrete, real-world changes
that would make a positive impact on the child's life. Impor-
tantly, these are changes that can be accomplished regardless
of whether the child speaks fluently. Likewise, caregivers may
report that they want their child to feel good about themselves
and to succeed at school. At first, they may think that the only
way to accomplish this goal is for the child to "be fluent." As
they learn more about stuttering and communication as a
whole, they often come to realize that this goal can be achieved
even if the child continues to stutter in some fashion. SLPs should
not be lulled into focusing only on fluency simply because this is
what children and families think they want; a deeper conversa-
tion and exploration of the child's and family's true motivations
for pursuing therapy may reveal why they seek fluency. By taking
a broader perspective, clinicians may be able to help their young
clients and their caregivers come to understand that their
ultimate goals can be accomplished regardless of whether or
how much the child continues to stutter.
In fact, one of the easiest ways for clinicians, children, and
caregivers alike to ensure holistic treatment is to look past the
observable stuttering behaviors altogether. This might seem
counterintuitive, given that the child and family may believe
that they are seeking treatment in order to help their child
achieve fluency. Still, as we have stated, focusing only on
fluency is not enough—and, in fact, it might be detrimental to
achieving the most impactful goals of therapy. Research has
shown that having a primary goal of "speaking fluently" can
actually be associated with an increased adverse impact of stut-
tering on a person's life.37 Moreover, although overt disfluencies
are often the most noticeable and seemingly relevant aspect of
stuttering for listeners, this may not be the case for speakers
who stutter themselves. It is critically important for SLPs to
understand—and ultimately treat—stuttering as it is experi-
enced by the speaker who stutters.37 As we discussed earlier,
this means addressing the ways a child feels and thinks about
stuttering while ensuring that they can communicate eﬀectively
so that stuttering does not interfere with their ability to live a
full and fulfilling life.
Here is another way of looking at the goals of stuttering
therapy: We want children to feel better about themselves
and their communication than they did before they met us.
From a listener's perspective, this might mean that overt stutter-
ing behaviors have changed. From the children's perspective,
however, this means that they can better tolerate the moment of
stuttering and the sensation of the loss of control, that they can
communicate more easily and more eﬀectively, that they can
speak with a greater sense of spontaneity59 and comfort, that
they can engage in social interaction with increased confidence
and satisfaction, and that stuttering no longer has a negative
impact on their life. Any and all of these potential therapy
outcomes constitute success, both in the grand scheme and in
daily interaction. To achieve these goals, clinicians need to
become facilitators who enable children to expand their choices,
to reduce their emotional reactivity, and to improve their overall
resilience,60,61 thereby leading to a better long-term quality of
life. The clinical practices that SLPs employ in the service of these
goals must be flexible enough to allow for diﬀerences in child-
ren's skills, interests, and characteristics— and therein lie the
challenges and the joys of working with school-age children
who stutter and their families.
11.4.4 The Importance of
Practice-Based Evidence
As any student in any field knows all too well, there is a dif-
ference between how something is presented in a textbook
and how it is realized in real life. This is certainly the case
when it comes to stuttering therapy. What we present in this
chapter reflects the combined experience of advanced clinicians
and researchers who have dedicated their lives to the study of
stuttering assessment and treatment. We recognize that our
experience allows us to adapt treatment to the individual needs
of our clients seemingly eﬀortlessly, but we do not come by this
ability by magic or without thought. Instead, we continuously
adapt and develop our clinical decision-making based on the
best-available evidence from the ever-expanding research litera-
ture and our growing clinical experience. On a day-to-day basis,
however, what allows us to make our decisions about how to
proceed in therapy with our clients who stutter is the data
that we collect in an ongoing fashion. This is particularly
important as we seek to uphold and adhere to the principles
of evidence-based practice (EBP), as is the expectation and
obligation of all SLPs.62,63,64 Certainly, one key aspect of EBP is
the published literature.65 Another key aspect, however, is the
practice-based evidence (PBE) that each clinician collects with
each client and family with whom they work as we move
through the therapy process.66 That is, SLPs must evaluate the
relationship between what is addressed within therapy and
the child's performance and experiences in the real world. This
is particularly important when it comes to treating school-age
children who stutter, for the existing evidence base in the
published literature is sorely lacking.28,62 Put simply, we need
more research on the treatment of school-age children who
stutter; this is a point on which even those who approach stut-
tering from diﬀerent philosophical perspectives agree.2,28
To compensate for the lack of empirical evidence, it becomes
particularly important for clinicians to collect their own data in
order to evaluate the appropriateness and eﬀectiveness of the
treatment that they provide to school-age children who stutter
and their families. Of course, ongoing data collection is always
important for supporting clinical decision-making; in the case
of school-age stuttering, however, it is even more crucial.
Therefore, as we discuss treatment options in the next section,
we also discuss methods for documenting the changes that
clients might experience, so that we can keep our focus on
ensuring that treatment is moving in the right direction—that
is, helping school-age children communicate more easily and
more eﬀectively and minimizing the burden that stuttering
might cause in their lives.

11.5 Sample Treatment Goals,
Procedures, and Activities for
School-Age Children Who Stutter
Given the material covered thus far as background and founda-
tion, we now turn to specific treatment procedures and activities
for individual school-age children who stutter and their families.
Again, we emphasize that these procedures and activities will not
all be necessary for all children and families. Diﬀerent children
will likely have diﬀerent needs and priorities for what treatment
should emphasize, both for the child and for the family as a whole.
For example, some children will come to treatment with much
higher levels of resilience than others61; these children may need
less work on self-advocacy before moving to other areas of treat-
ment. Other children may come to therapy with higher levels of
embarrassment or shame; these children may need considerably
more work on self-acceptance before moving on to other areas of
treatment. It is incumbent upon the SLP to select appropriate
therapy components based on the individual needs of their clients
and to apply them in the order that is appropriate for each person;
here, we seek to present a broad menu of options that may be
considered and selected as necessary, based on a careful review of
the literature, the child's and caregivers' needs, and the clinician's
perceptions and experience. As before, we organize these options
in terms of the ICF model to ensure that we address the entirety
of the stuttering experience. (Note: Because the specific format
and language required for treatment goals diﬀer depending upon
the institution or location, we have not presented these goals in a
format that might meet the requirements of an Individualized
Educational Plan [IEP] for a particular school district in the United
States. Instead, the goals that we present below are worded
generally, so that they can easily be adapted to diﬀerent formats
and requirements.)
11.5.1 Sample Goals, Procedures, and
Activities: Stuttering Impairment
Helping children change the way they cope with the underlying
sensation of being stuck involves helping them understand
what they are doing during the moment of stuttering itself.67,68
This begins with helping the child to build a strong foundational
understanding of their speech mechanism (e.g., the "speech
machine"1) and the ways they use it when speaking—and when
stuttering.20 A specific goal for this aspect of therapy might be,
"The child will demonstrate knowledge of the parts of the body
involved in producing speech." Sample procedures include teach-
ing the child how we use the respiratory, phonatory, and articula-
tory systems alone and together to produce speech. For example,
the clinician and child might talk about the speech mechanism,
draw pictures of the parts of the body involved in producing
speech, identify moments of "fake" stuttering in the speech of the
clinician, and, ultimately, in the child's own speech. Relevant data
might include evaluations of the child's ability to describe the
speech mechanism to others and to relate the occurrence of phys-
ical tension to specific physiological systems.
Increasing awareness of stuttering in this way is an excellent
first step that can help children to "stay present" during a
moment of loss of control so that later in therapy, they can
learn how to make changes in their stuttering behavior in real
time. Thus, another specific goal for this aspect of therapy
might be, "The child will demonstrate the ability to identify a
moment of stuttering in their own speech." Sample procedures
might involve tallying activities, in which a child counts their
moments of stuttering. This is a powerful way to build behavio-
ral or physical awareness of stuttering, whether this awareness
occurs before, during, or after the moment of speech disruption.
Tallying activities can be as simple as asking a child to make a
mark on a piece of paper when they feel stuck while talking;
doing so in and of itself supports ongoing data collection and
reflection. Importantly, such activities must not be done in a
punitive fashion. The purpose of identifying moments of stut-
tering is not so that the child must "fix" their speech or recog-
nize that they have made a "mistake"; we do not wish to send
the message that "more stuttering is bad" or "less stuttering is
good." Instead, the goal of these types of activities is to help
children better understand and "tune in" to what they are doing
when they talk. We want them to be able to experience stutter-
ing during these exercises, so that they can learn more about
stuttering. This helps build their self-monitoring skills; these
exercises also help them to learn to tolerate the moment of
stuttering and to experience stuttering without negative judg-
ment from themselves or us. Rather than viewing stuttering as
something to suppress or hide or feel bad about, children are
being praised for their ability to "catch" or be aware of moments
of stuttering. Once the child has an increased awareness of when
they are stuttering, we can guide them toward staying present
during a moment of stuttering. These lessons will be crucial for
later work in which they learn to modify moments of stuttering
if and when they choose to do so.
Another common goal for helping children learn to cope with
the sensation of being stuck is to help them learn to hold on to,
or stay in, a moment of stuttering while they are producing it.
Thus, a goal might be, "The child will demonstrate the ability to
'freeze' while producing a moment of stuttering and remain in
it." At first, this may seem counterintuitive, in that it is reasonable
to assume that our goal is to help children move through
moments of stuttering more easily. This is certainly true—we do
teach the child how to move through stuttering moments
eﬃciently. Before they can do that, however, they need to develop
the self-monitoring skills to "catch" a moment of stuttering in real
time. The ability to catch a moment of stuttering "on the fly"
helps the child to develop the presence of mind to be able to
make changes in stuttering. Staying with a moment of stuttering
in real time also helps the child to tolerate stuttering enough that
they do not feel compelled to rush through or run from the
sensation of being stuck. We can accomplish this goal through
"speech detective" or "catch me" games,1 in which we "play
around" with stuttering to help children learn more about
what they do with their speech mechanisms during stuttering.
Relevant data include tallies of the number of moments of
stuttering that the child is able to catch and the speed with
which they catch them (i.e., before, after, or during production).
▶Table 11.7 lists sample goals and activities for addressing
this aspect of treatment. Importantly, these activities also sup-
port the child's ability and willingness to stutter more freely
and openly, and this, too, helps them learn to respond more
easily to the sensation of being stuck. Rather than trying to
hide, avoid, or mask stuttering, they can allow themselves to
"let stuttering out" more easily. The resulting speech behavior—
that is, speech that may be disrupted but does not contain
11.5 Sample Treatment Goals, Procedures, and Activities for School-Age Children Who Stutter
181

tension or struggle behaviors—might be called "easier stuttering."
As the child is able to tolerate the sensation of being stuck, they
becp,e able to stutter more openly, with less avoidance behaviors.
Ultimately, this can lead to more forward-flowing speech.
Spotlight: Targeting Stuttering Impairment
Most, if not all, school-age children who stutter can benefit from work related to increasing their understanding of the moment of
stuttering and the ways in which they respond to the underlying sensation of being stuck or of losing control. Thus, this is a component
of therapy that we use for nearly all school-age children with whom we work. In particular, we often find that school-age children who
stutter have not received suﬃcient support in learning about stuttering, even if they have previously been in therapy. When we talk
with clinicians who are facing challenges in stuttering therapy, we often find that one of the key reasons is that they have not spent
suﬃcient time building a foundation for the child's understanding of speaking and stuttering.
Consider the common situation of a school-age child who stutters whose prior testing and assessment have revealed low awareness
of stuttering—although the child certainly knows that they stutter, they do not necessarily understand what they are doing during the
moment of stuttering, and they cannot always identify stuttering in their speech. Therefore, an appropriate (and necessary) focus of
therapy is to help them understand the parts of the body involved in producing speech (brain, lungs, larynx, and articulators)—
presented at whatever level of complexity is appropriate for the child's age and cognitive development. This is followed by a detailed
exploration of what they do with their speech mechanism when they are speaking fluently and what they do with their speech mecha-
nism when they are stuttering. The more they learn about the moment of stuttering and how their speech mechanism is involved, the
better prepared they will be for later work on changing the moment of stuttering (so-called stuttering modification techniques46,47).
Children at this age and stage of therapy also benefit from "catch-me" and "speech detective" activities,1 in which they explore the
physical and cognitive/emotional sensations of being stuck and the surface speech disruptions that may result as they attempt to cope
with their diﬃculty in producing speech in that moment.
11.5.2 Sample Goals, Procedures, and
Activities: Child's Reactions to Stuttering
"Be yourself; everyone else is already taken."
-Oscar Wilde
The reactions that children may have toward their stuttered
speech and the impact that it has on their quality of life has
been investigated in several studies.10,11,12 A principal finding
from this work is that school-aged children who stutter experi-
ence negative reactions to their stuttering. This is not surpris-
ing, of course, but it is still important to recognize that such
negative reactions to stuttering are often reflected in magnified
aﬀective, behavioral, and cognitive reactions to their speaking
ability and diﬃculty, as well as significantly compromised com-
munication in daily situations. More specifically, research has
shown that the experience of stuttering for school-age children
may involve elevated anxiety, interpersonal stress, and even
social phobia.6,15,35,69,70 These responses are compounded by
the variable nature of stuttering,71,72 which leads children to
stutter more in some situations or at some times than in other
situations or at other times. The uncertainty about stuttering
can be extremely frustrating for children who stutter,73 and can
lead them to struggle even more. Importantly, even children
who do not stutter show some degree of negative reaction to
their speaking ability.12 Thus, the goals of therapy addressing
negative reactions to stuttering do not need to seek an outcome
of "zero negative reactions" in order to be successful. Helping a
child achieve more neutral reactions to stuttering and speaking
is a reasonable outcome, provided those reactions do not inter-
fere with communication.
Thus, a common and important aspect of therapy for school-
age children who stutter involves reducing negative emotions;
this is often accomplished through desensitization and other
cognitive therapy approaches that are designed to help the child
become more comfortable with stuttering2,55 (▶Table 11.8).
Desensitization, or the process of reducing negative thoughts
and feelings through gradual exposure, is a key part of the treat-
ment process, as it helps the child to be able to stutter more
freely, to reduce avoidance of stuttering, and to minimize the fear
of stuttering. A relevant goal might be, "The child will demon-
strate reduced negative reactions to moments of stuttering."
Common procedures for achieving this goal include exposure
therapy, in which children learn—gradually—to allow stuttering
in their speech while they systematically reduce their negative

reactions. Children can learn to feel more comfortable stuttering
by allowing naturally occurring stuttering to occur in a suppor-
tive environment (e.g., in the therapy room with us, while we
encourage them to know that it is okay to stutter) or by using
"voluntary" stuttering or "pseudostuttering" in order to di-
rectly experience the behaviors and reactions associated with
stuttering—without the sensation of being stuck.74,75,76 Relevant
data may include children's self-reports about their feelings
about stuttering, the number of times they were able to stutter
openly or voluntarily along with the situations in which they
were able to accomplish this, as well as results from standard
tests and assessments of their reactions to their stuttering.58,77
As children learn to stutter with less fear and other negative
responses, this leads to greater acceptance.55 Acceptance in and
of itself can help to reduce the adverse impact of stuttering
overall. It can also help to reduce the physical struggle often as-
sociated with stuttering as the child learns not to wrestle with
the sensation of being stuck. To achieve this, clinicians can build
on the previously described foundational activities that help
the child to increase their understanding and awareness of
when and how they stutter. We like to explore pseudostutter-
ing with more physical tension and then with less physical
tension to help our students learn that they can make changes
to how they stutter. These changes will require a significant
amount of practice, but they provide a necessary foundation for
later use of stuttering modification46,47 strategies, if indicated
for a particular child. Speech modification strategies,44 designed
to reduce tension and struggle, can also be taught to reduce the
behavioral reactions to the sensation of being stuck when speak-
ing. Practicing these specific physical changes to the moment of
stuttering (e.g., reducing muscular tension and moving forward
in the utterance) can help the child to stutter more easily and
with less physical tension.46 Here, a relevant goal might be,
"The child will demonstrate reduced physical tension during
moments of stuttering," with ongoing data reflecting self-ratings
or clinician ratings of the degree of tension.
As noted earlier, cognitive behavioral therapy strategies,
including
acceptance
and
commitment
approaches
and
mindfulness-related procedures,78 are also useful for helping
children learn how to respond diﬀerently to diﬃculties in
planning and producing speech.
Regardless of how much speech modification or stuttering
modification is targeted in therapy, or experienced by the child,
the most important goal is to help children learn that it is okay
to stutter and to be a person who stutters. The more that chil-
dren can learn and internalize that message, the easier it will
be for them to cope with the fact that at times their speech will
be diﬀerent from the speech of their peers. And, when children
believe that it is okay to stutter, they will come to recognize that
they are okay—that they are not doing anything wrong when
they stutter and that they should not judge themselves nega-
tively because they sometimes do not produce speech fluently.
Spotlight: Targeting Child's Reactions to Stuttering
A common case scenario is the child whose stuttering is elevated (more frequent or physical tense moments of stuttering) in the class-
room or when reading aloud in front of peers. Unfortunately, this increased diﬃculty is experienced in exactly those situations in which
the child really wants to be able to talk easily (e.g., in front of peers). Therefore, an important component of therapy in such situations
is to help students learn that "it is okay to stutter"—even in those situations where they wish that they could be fluent! SLPs typically
experience this when school-age children express concern that they cannot participate in class the way other children can (e.g., they
feel that they cannot ask or answer a question or read aloud like their peers can), or they cannot tell a joke like their friends can,58 or
they are afraid to speak lest they—or others—react negatively to their stuttering. Our job in such instances is not only to help them learn
ways of coping with the sensation of being stuck, as described earlier, but also to help them learn to reduce their negative reactions to
stuttering. The therapy builds upon prior work focused on educating children about speaking and stuttering, as described earlier, so
that we can help children learn to tolerate—and ultimately accept—the moment of stuttering as something that sometimes happens
when they are talking. Through exposure and desensitization therapy (teaching the child to use purposeful stuttering to become less
fearful of it and helping them stutter in a way that may feel more comfortable for them), we help students learn to accept stuttering
(aﬀective reactions), to become less likely to avoid situations in which they might stutter (behavioral reactions), and to become less
likely to judge themselves negatively or harshly because they stutter (cognitive reactions). As children learn that they are okay even
though—and even when—they stutter, they become better able to cope with the diﬃcult situations they face, and this ultimately helps
them to improve their overall communication and to reduce the adverse impact of stuttering on their lives.

11.5.3 Sample Goals, Procedures, and
Activities: Environment's Reactions to
Stuttering
Educating the people in the child's environment about stuttering
is a fundamental step in creating a supportive atmosphere
(▶Table 11.9). Importantly, the work that we do with caregivers,
other family members, teachers, and peers has a bidirectional
impact: the more we help the people in the child's environment
to cope eﬀectively with the child's stuttering and their own
worries, the more it helps the child to do the same. This, in turn,
helps the family and other important people in the child's life to
feel less worried about stuttering and their child. One of our
most fundamental goals when working with people in the child's
environment is ensuring that they understand the nature of stut-
tering. For a child in the school-age years, this means helping
parents and others to understand that, in all likelihood, the child
will continue to stutter, in some fashion, throughout their life. It
also means educating the child's support system that the adverse
impact of stuttering may be greater in later childhood than in
the preschool years. That means that the child is likely to need
emotional support, not only from the SLP but also from the
parents, other family members, teachers, and peers, and that the
need for this support is likely to increase over time.
Depending upon the setting in which they work, clinicians
may face challenges in working with parents, caregivers, or
other family members. In the school environment in the United
States, for example, clinicians might have relatively little contact
with families—and even if they do, they may not have the time
needed to guide caregivers through their own journey of stut-
tering acceptance. Therefore, much of the work in developing a
supportive environment for the child may need to be done
through the child rather than directly with the family. For
example, helping children to increase their openness about
stuttering will teach them how to discuss stuttering with their
families and others in their environment. A goal might be, "The
child will discuss basic facts about stuttering with family mem-
bers, teachers, and peers." As children develop their expertise
about stuttering in general and about their own stuttering in
specific, they also develop the confidence they need for teaching
others about their communication diﬀerences. This experience
can be tremendously empowering for children in and of itself.
Similarly, engaging in self-disclosure activities,79,80,81 in which
children learn to openly acknowledge their stuttering, can help
further reduce shame while simultaneously educating others
about stuttering. For example, "The child will acknowledge their
stuttering openly when talking to a friend" is an example of a
therapy goal that targets self-disclosure. Of course, doing this can
be quite challenging, especially if a child has previously worked
hard to hide or avoid stuttering. Accordingly, we always begin
such activities in a safe space (e.g., with us in the therapy room)
before practicing with others. We then guide children through a
hierarchy from easier to harder situations in which they can self-
disclose (e.g., talking with a parent first and then, when ready,
talking to a teacher), in order to provide support and foster
generalization of skills to increasingly real-world situations.82
Such activities help children learn to be proactive in dealing with
stuttering
while
simultaneously giving
them
control
over
whether and when they tell others about their stuttering. The
child's disclosure can also foster discussions about the nature of
stuttering, thereby removing much of the "mystery" surrounding
stuttering. This can ultimately lead to increased community
awareness about stuttering and about people who stutter.
"Self-disclosure is easy! I'm just telling people the truth about me."
-Child who stutters
Indeed, we routinely work on how children can talk openly
about stuttering, so that their peers, teachers, and caregivers
will learn from them that stuttering is just a characteristic of
how they talk and not something to be embarrassed about or
ashamed of. We model diﬀerent ways of talking about stuttering,
we role-play responses to the comments of other children,81 and
we practice how to describe stuttering to others (e.g., "sometimes
when I talk, I repeat sounds or words" or, even more simply, "I
stutter"). Certainly, attaining the ability to talk about stuttering in
an accepting fashion builds on a foundation of understanding
(impairment) and acceptance (reactions) of stuttering, and comes
with diligent practice.
In order to foster ongoing education about both the nature and
treatment of stuttering for people in the child's environment,

we encourage regular discussions between the child and care-
givers about stuttering in general, and about the specific goals
that a child is addressing at the time, both in and out of therapy.
Children may give very brief presentations containing factual
information related to stuttering (e.g., the prevalence of stutter-
ing, the fact that more boys than girls stutter, etc.). This may be
done first with family members, as the child may not yet be ready
to talk about stuttering outside the comfort of home. Later, the
child may be ready to give presentations about stuttering to their
class or other social groups.56 Children can vary the complexity of
their presentations, for example, by describing basic facts about
stuttering early in the therapy process and exploring theories of
stuttering onset or therapy strategies later in therapy, as their
knowledge and understanding develops. In addition, children
may feel that it is helpful to discuss the impact of stuttering on
their everyday life and communication, rather than just basic
facts about stuttering. Child-delivered presentations56 about
stuttering are an eﬀective way to educate other people about
stuttering while also having the benefit of reducing the stigma
associated with stuttering.
One common and troubling aspect of the environmental
reactions to stuttering that we wish to highlight in particular is
bullying.83 Bullying is particularly problematic for children who
stutter, not only because it increases the diﬃculty they experi-
ence with communication but also because it can increase
social isolation. Social isolation in and of itself is a significant
risk factor for greater adverse impact from stuttering.56 Helping
children cope eﬀectively with bullying includes educating them
about stuttering and bullying, reducing their negative reactions
to their own stuttering, and helping them learn to respond
eﬀectively and appropriately to the negative comments and
behaviors of others.57 Teaching such self-advocacy skills supports
the child's development of self-esteem and self-acceptance. Goals
for this aspect of therapy might include, "The child will demon-
strate appropriate responses to negative comments made by
others." The identification of appropriate responses can be a key
focus of therapy,56 and the data collected in and out of sessions
could include the child's and the clinician's observations of how
the child handled such diﬃcult situations.
Importantly, not all environmental responses to a child's stut-
tering should be viewed as negative. For example, a growing
body of research shows that participation in support groups
can help reduce a child's negative reaction to stuttering by
providing a supportive network of people who understand and
accept stuttering.84,85 It is important to note that support
groups are not the same as treatment groups. Although both
types of groups have their place in the treatment process, treat-
ment groups are often used as a means to target specific goals
that the child may be working toward in therapy, but they are
practicing within a group setting. Support groups, on the other
hand, are not as likely to have specific speech-related goals
attached to them. Instead, they oﬀer opportunities for the child
to speak freely about stuttering with others who may be at
similar or diﬀerent places in the treatment process (or not in
treatment at all). Although SLPs can help facilitate the process
of self-acceptance for the child who stutters, belonging to a
community of children who stutter, in which they can safely
share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences, is a powerful
way to reduce isolation while normalizing the experience of
stuttering. (Note that such activities can appropriately be
viewed as involving both environmental reactions and personal
reactions, as they cross domains in the ICF model.)
As with much of the literature in the field, the majority of
research on the impact of support/self-help groups has focused
on adults who stutter.37,86,87,88,89,90 Still, a growing literature
demonstrates the value of stuttering support and self-help
activities and experiences for children, including participation
in stuttering support groups and camps.84,85,91,92,93 Support
groups can also oﬀer parents the opportunity to meet and talk
with other parents who have faced similar issues in raising a
child who stutters. This can be empowering for both groups,
and it can help reduce the feeling of isolation. Another benefit
of support groups is that they may be utilized even after formal
treatment ends as a way for the child to continue working on
generalization and maintenance of skills learned in therapy.
Thus, we routinely introduce children and their families to the
various support/self-help organizations for people who stutter.
We are fortunate to have several organizations dedicated to
the needs of children who stutter and their families. In the
United States, this includes the National Stuttering Association
(www.WeStutter.org), Friends: The National Association of
Young People Who Stutter (www.FriendsWhoStutter.org), SAY:
The Stuttering Association for the Young (www.SAY.org), and the
Stuttering Foundation (www.StutteringHelp.org). Worldwide,
there are many other organizations focused on helping those
who are aﬀected by stuttering; a comprehensive list is oﬀered by
the International Stuttering Association (www.isastutter.org). As
children participate in stuttering support and self-help activities,
they gain the opportunity to meet other children who stutter.
Spending time with children who share their experiences helps
them see that they are not alone in facing their stuttering, and
this in and of itself can be a powerful lesson.88 Support groups
that include parents, caregivers, and families also help the
important people in the child's life to see people who are living
their lives successfully despite—or even because of—the fact that
they stutter. This helps foster a sense of hope and optimism
about their child's future. Support/self-help organizations give
people who stutter the opportunity to speak freely in a safe
space, and they provide them a place to be themselves, regardless
of whether or how much they stutter. Although people who
participate in support or self-help groups benefit in varying ways,
one common outcome is the overall reduction in the adverse
impact on the quality of life attributed to stuttering.84,86,85,87,94 It
is no exaggeration to say that we have seen children and care-
givers experience life-changing growth during a single weekend
at a conference hosted by a support organization; ongoing par-
ticipation can bring even greater gains. Put simply, we strive to
connect every child and family with whom we work with a stut-
tering support organizations in one fashion or another,89 and we
are always gratified by the results.

Spotlight: Targeting Environment Reactions to the Child's Stuttering
A common situation we face with respect to the environment's reactions to stuttering is the situation in which a parent is actually more
concerned about stuttering than the child is. There are many reasons for this; one key factor is the parents' ability to look toward the
future and envision the problems that the child might experience as a result of stuttering. Not all of the feared outcomes are likely to
come to pass, though it is understandable for parents to worry about the potential consequences of stuttering and to try to take steps to
reduce the likelihood that their worst fears will come true. Therefore, we often find it important to educate parents about the experiences
that people who stutter do actually have in their lives. This process has typically already started by the time a child reaches the school-age
years; education of parents is an important component in many approaches to early childhood stuttering therapy. Still, the role of the
parents—and the information that they need to know—changes as the child enters the school-age years. It is crucial for parents to receive
updated information about stuttering so that they will be prepared to support their children through the many changes that they face. It
is also crucial for parents to come to terms with the fact that their child stutters so that they are less likely to put inappropriate pressure
on their child to speak fluently all the time when that can be quite diﬃcult for children to do. Thus, parents will need to understand that
the goals of therapy involve more than just increasing speech fluency, so it is important for clinicians to provide necessary background
information to parents, in person during therapy sessions or via handouts and other materials. Another excellent way to accomplish this
goal is to connect parents with adults who stutter, so that the parents can see that it is possible for their child to continue stuttering yet
still live a good and fulfilling life. Seeing adults who stutter who are successfully pursuing and achieving their life goals can help reduce
parents' fears about the future. Yet another way to educate parents is to encourage children to share their own thoughts about stuttering
with their parents so that the parents can come to understand what stuttering is really like—not just what they fear it might be like. Of
course, this does lead to parents hearing about the negative experiences that their children might have, but fostering open lines of com-
munication in this way gives parents the opportunity to provide support and encouragement to their children, and this connection can
have remarkable benefits for the child and parents alike. Working together, parents and children can come to understand that stuttering
does not have to have a negative impact on the child's life and that there is much that they can do together.
11.5.4 Sample Goals, Procedures, and
Activities: Activity Limitations and
Participation Restrictions
The sensation of being stuck when speaking, the emotional and
cognitive discomfort that accompanies that feeling, the physical
reactions and avoidance that result from that feeling, and the
environmental reactions to speech disruptions all combine to
cause the child who stutters to experience adverse impact in
the form of activity limitations and participation restrictions
involving communication. Moreover, the negative emotions
and cognitive reactions to stuttering experienced by young
people have been shown to directly impact their participation
in social events, their development of friendships, their school
success, and ultimately their future career choices.10,11,35,95
Therefore, an appropriately broad conceptualization of the im-
pact of stuttering (and an appropriately broad approach to stut-
tering therapy) should address surface behaviors along with the
intertwined consequences for the child's overall quality of life.
One of the most important ways to achieve this goal is to
ensure that treatment activities are designed to promote gener-
alization to real-world settings as early as possible.82 This
means that clinicians must not create goals that are geared only
toward improving fluency or attitudes or communication in the
clinical setting. Instead, goals must be comprehensive and
target all aspects of the experience of stuttering in all of the
various communication contexts where the child interacts.
Examples are shown in ▶Table 11.10. Note that generalization
should not only be targeted at the end of the therapy process; it
must also be integrated throughout intervention. Only by
addressing generalization right from the beginning of therapy
will clinicians be able to help their clients expand their success
beyond the therapy setting. Further, it is only by expanding
success beyond the therapy setting that children who stutter
can overcome the potential activity limitations and participa-
tion restrictions that are so commonly a part of the experience
of stuttering. Goals should be written to target objectives
outside of the therapy room as quickly as possible. Examples of
ways generalization can be targeted include teaching peers
about stuttering at school, ordering food at a restaurant while
stuttering on purpose, and making a phone call while using
speech or stuttering modification.
A particularly important aspect of overcoming activity limita-
tions and participation restrictions associated with stuttering is
the reduction of sound, word, or situational avoidance. The rea-
sons that children engage in avoidance are particularly important
for clinicians to understand. Generally, children avoid stuttering
because they are embarrassed by it or afraid of it. They may be
afraid not only of the discomfort associated with the moment of
being stuck but also of the reactions of parents, teachers, and

peers who may respond negatively to stuttering. Reducing avoid-
ance, in all its forms, can help children to increase their ability to
perform daily activities and participate fully in life. A sample goal
for reducing avoidance might be, "The child will engage in activ-
ities and situations that are presently avoided," and data collection
can involve lists of the situations themselves and tallies of the
child's success in facing those situations. It is important to note
that the child's fluency in these situations is irrelevant; the goals
are to enter and participate in an activity or situation, regardless of
whether or how much the child stutters when doing so. The more
that we can help children understand the negative consequences
of avoidance, the more they will come to understand the value of
speaking when they want to speak, rather than selecting whether,
when, or how much to speak based on their fear of stuttering or
its sequelae.
Another important way for SLPs to reduce the overall adverse
impact of stuttering on children's lives is to maintain contact
with them over the long term in order to monitor progress and
make adjustments as the child faces new situations over time.
One of the biggest mistakes we can make in stuttering treatment
is to assume a definitive endpoint to the clinical interaction. This
expectation on the part of the SLP or the child and family is
problematic in a number of ways. First, discharging the child
from therapy without developing a comprehensive monitoring
plan can lead children who stutter and their caregivers to as-
sume that treatment is over forever and will no longer be needed
at any time in the child's life. If (and when) this turns out not to
be the case, the situation might be viewed as "relapse."96,97 The
term "relapse" itself is associated with negative stigma, and it
may lead children and their families to feel that the child (or the
clinician) has failed in some fashion, even though this is not the
case. The clinician should create the expectation for children and
their caregivers that stuttering and its consequences may require
some type of intervention at various points across the lifespan.
For example, SLPs may work with children who do very well in
therapy in the school-age years and no longer require formal
treatment services. When these same children approach high
school, however, they move on to more challenging communica-
tion situations that are very diﬀerent from those they success-
fully navigated in middle school. They may also need to discuss
specific situations such as job interviews, class presentations in
front of peers, and talking with people they find attractive. Addi-
tional therapy or support may be necessary to help them deal
with these situations; this is perfectly normal. For reasons such
as these, children who stutter and their families should maintain
some connection with a clinician, a trusted friend, or a support/
self-help organization to gain the encouragement they might
need in coping with their stuttering—and ensuring minimal
adverse impact—throughout their lives. One way of achieving
this is through regular "check-ins" with the clinician, perhaps
consisting of brief phone calls, online video check-ins, or e-mails.
The main goal of maintaining these relationships is for children
to understand that support and help are available if they ever
need further treatment or advice—and, if they do they have not
failed or done anything wrong; it is simply the nature of dealing
with a chronic condition such as stuttering.
Spotlight: Targeting Activity Limitations and Participation Restrictions
When children come to us exhibiting behavior patterns that involve avoidance, we immediately recognize that we will need to engage in
treatment goals and activities focused on helping them overcome their fears so that they speak freely and openly in any situation. Some
particularly common situations in which children are likely to avoid speaking involve asking or answering questions in class or reading aloud.
The result of these behavior patterns is reduced participation in the academic setting. Children who are reluctant to participate in class may
be worried about how their peers will react to stuttering; they may also be worried about how much eﬀort may be required on their part to
say what they want to say. To address these concerns, we talk directly with our clients about their underlying reactions toward stuttering.
We seek to and determine the level at which they feel comfortable participating in class, and then we seek to increase that level through
gentle and carefully paced guidance toward greater participation. Note that in some cases, children may not be ready to participate in class
at all. They may first need significant work in addressing underlying reactions toward stuttering. When we all agree that they are ready to
move toward participating more fully in class, we discuss goals for how often and in what context they will volunteer to participate in class.
Structuring therapy in this way can help reduce the children's fears that they will be called upon before they are ready to participate. Thus,
children can go into class knowing what their goals are, knowing how they will work to accomplish their goals, and knowing that they will
not be put in overly distressing situations while they are still working toward easier and fuller participation in their educational settings. Note
that we must also involve and engage classroom teachers in the therapy process when we establish these types of goals. This will allow
them to react appropriately and to provide feedback to the clinician, caregivers, and even the child about how the plan is proceeding.
Another common situation in which school-age children who stutter may experience limitations in their daily activities and reduced
participation is in everyday social situations. Indeed, as children move through the school-age years and toward adolescence, a large
part of their social time may be spent with friends at malls, restaurants, or other establishments. In such settings, "placing an order" is
an obligatory part of their conversational speech. People who stutter often report that not being able to order their own food is a
frustrating experience,58 and people may even resort to ordering something other than what they actually want. This can feel self-
defeating, as the child may come to belief that stuttering must necessarily prevent them from getting what they want, not just at a
restaurant but also in life as a whole. Thus, one of the more empowering activities we can have for children who stutter is to help them
order their own food or ask questions when they are out in public. This can initially be addressed in therapy sessions as SLPs guide their
students through the process of practicing ordering food from menus, asking questions related to a menu, and role-playing various
scenarios that might occur in the real world. As children begin to feel more comfortable with the tasks—and, in particular, as they
become more comfortable stuttering during these tasks—then the activities can be transferred out to the real world, where the clinician
and clients can practice ordering food together, either in person or over the phone. In doing this, we want to be sure not to overwhelm
the child by moving to real-world situations too quickly; therefore, we typically practice such activities gradually, moving up a hierarchy
from easier to harder situations that take us from the therapy room to the real world. An example of a hierarchy for ordering food is
shown in ▶Table 11.11. (Note that following a hierarchy is also a great way to practice self-disclosure and pseudostuttering, as well as
speech modification and stuttering modification strategies, as appropriate for each individual child.)

11.6 Discussion
In this chapter, we sought to provide a general overview of
important
considerations
in
planning
and
implementing
comprehensive therapy for school-age children who stutter.
Throughout, we emphasized the importance of individualizing
therapy to the needs of each specific child and family. Of
course, we cannot cover all possible situations or outcomes in
a single chapter, especially given our emphasis on the fact that
"one size does not fit all" in stuttering therapy.98 Still, as we
bring this chapter to a close, we wish to address two additional
considerations—the value of an empathetic clinician and the
value of the therapeutic alliance—that significantly aﬀect clinical
decision-making and application with this population.
Building an eﬀective working relationship with children who
stutter is at the core of successful therapy. Eﬀective clinicians
are those who are professional and confident, and who display
an understanding of the nature and treatment of stuttering.99
Eﬀective clinicians are also passionate and committed; they
have a belief in the therapeutic process, and they express faith
in the child's (and family's) ability to change. In addition to
being empathetic,100 eﬀective clinicians are honest and able to
relate to their clients on both personal and professional levels.99
One way that clinicians can express empathy is by showing
respect for children as autonomous individuals—that is, as
people who have meaningful agency in their own life decisions,
commensurate with their age, development, and experience.
This means collaborating with them in developing and indi-
vidualizing therapy goals. Successful collaboration results from
deep listening, asking meaningful questions, and providing
validation. We must also be prepared to provide a safety net for
school-age children who may be hurting as they come to terms
with their diﬀerences. Although school-age children may be
more adept at managing their wants and needs compared to
younger children, they are still just developing. The respect that
we show them, the belief that we express in their abilities, and
the validation that we oﬀer them are all invaluable for support-
ing their ability to cope eﬀectively with stuttering.
The therapeutic alliance is the foundation of successful
therapy.101,102,103 It is a cooperative working relationship be-
tween the client and the clinician—a partnership that reflects
the trust that the clinician and child will reach an agreement
about the goals of therapy and share an understanding of the
processes to achieve these goals. Collaboration begins early in
therapy as clinicians adjust their therapy methods to suit the
needs and capacities of each individual client. The perspectives
on these early needs in therapy do not have to match, and it is
important not to be judgmental or defensive but to be open and
direct the client and clinician work together to negotiate the
therapeutic goals. Routinely checking on the child's and care-
givers' perspectives is an important way to establish a strong
alliance and increase positive outcomes.101
11.7 Future Directions
"Cupcakes are muﬃns that believed in miracles."
-Zen Buddhist quotation
As new data about stuttering emerge, we will need to continue
examining our treatment practices. In particular, we must
increase our understanding of the ways in which individual dif-
ferences, as well as individual experiences in and out of therapy,
may relate to stuttering treatment outcomes. As a field, we have
achieved a strong consensus that stuttering treatment should
be comprehensive;2 we are still learning about the ways in
which therapy can be better individualized. We must also work
to ensure that all SLPs have adequate training and continuing
education opportunities to understand how to address stutter-
ing in a comprehensive manner. And we must continue to
develop means of evaluating the changes that children make in
therapy across a range of objectives (e.g., measuring success not
just in terms of changes in observable stuttering behavior but
also in terms of the other aspects of therapy, such as reductions
in negative reactions, increases in functional communication,
and improvements in quality of life).58 Although our field has
made and continues to make great strides in improving our
understanding, assessment, and treatment of stuttering, we still
have work to do.
11.8 Conclusion
Stuttering treatment for school-age children should focus on
the entire experience of stuttering, addressing the unique
needs of individual children and their families. Common com-
ponents of therapy can be described in terms of the WHO's ICF
model, meaning that therapy should address several related but
distinct components. Aspects of therapy related to the impair-
ment include strategies to help the child manage the experience
of being stuck or of losing control when talking, so that they
can move forward in speaking. Aspects of therapy related to the
child's aﬀective, behavioral, and cognitive reactions relate to
helping children understand—and, ultimately change—the way
they react to the sensation of being stuck, so that they can feel
less embarrassed or ashamed of stuttering, are less likely to
avoid moments of stuttering, can judge themselves less nega-
tively, and, generally, can come to accept their stuttering.
Aspects of therapy relating to the environment's reactions to
stuttering involve educating parents and other caregivers,
teachers, and peers about stuttering so they are less likely to
react negatively. Doing so creates a supportive environment of

individuals who understand and accept the child's stuttering.
Finally, aspects of therapy designed to reduce activity limita-
tions and participation restrictions are focused on ensuring
that children say what they want to say without holding back,
enter situations that they might otherwise find challenging,
and engage fully in their lives.
When a child can recognize that stuttering is merely a char-
acteristic of how they talk (and not the defining characteristic
of their whole being), they can live their lives to the fullest
without being held back or burdened by it. As clinicians, we can
facilitate a child's journey toward improved communication
and self-acceptance. We find this to be an extremely rewarding
path for our young clients, their caregivers, and ourselves. We
hope that you will also come to find this sense of satisfaction
and accomplishment as you learn to help school-age children
who stutter and their families.

12 Adolescents and Adults

Abstract
The purpose of this chapter is to provide clinicians with a
framework for working with their teen and adult clients in
designing and implementing stuttering therapy. Our guiding
principles for working with people who stutter have been
inspired by the work of researchers and practitioners in com-
munication sciences and disorders, counseling psychology, and
health psychology. We propose that stuttering therapy and its
outcomes require us to consider (1) how important speech and
stuttering modifications, thoughts and feelings about stutter-
ing, and avoidance strategies are to the client and (2) how ready
clients are to change any or all of these components of the
stuttering experience. With this in mind, we oﬀer strategies for
helping your clients make decisions about what they want and
can do about stuttering, ways you can assist them in achieving
these goals, and case examples of the therapy process.
Keywords: stuttering, fluency disorder, therapy, adults,
adolescents
12.1 Introduction
As you learned in ▶Chapter 1, developmental stuttering first
emerges between 2 and 4 years of age. For approximately 75%
of young children who begin stuttering, the core speech behav-
iors of stuttering—sound/syllable repetitions and prolonged
sounds—decrease measurably over the next 36 months, with
most children recovering within 12 to 24 months post onset.
This means that teenagers and adults who present with devel-
opmental stuttering (i.e., stuttering that first began in early
childhood) represent 25%, or the minority, of all cases. What do
these numbers mean for the treatment of stuttering in adoles-
cents and adults, the subject of this chapter? First, they indicate
that teens and adults who stutter are, in some ways, not repre-
sentative of the group of people with developmental stuttering,
in that the majority experience unassisted (i.e., little or no treat-
ment) recovery. That is, there is a unique set of risk factors that
lead to the persistence of stuttering in these 25%. We under-
stand developmental stuttering to be the result of a complex
interaction of multiple risk factors (see ▶Chapter 1), and that
none of the candidate risk factors (i.e., genetics, speech motor
skills, etc.) are necessary or suﬃcient for stuttering to emerge.
These two facts—that teens and adults who stutter are a rela-
tively small subgroup of the stuttering population and that the
stuttering "recipe" is diﬀerent and possibly unique for any given
individual—lead to the conclusion that (1) the principles under-
lying intervention for persistent stuttering are largely diﬀerent
from those for young children and (2) treatment should be tail-
ored to the person's individual situation and needs. This second
point relates to the ways in which the "age" of the stuttering
problem (along with, but likely more important than, the age of
the person who stutters) shapes the experience of stuttering for
teens and adults who stutter, often profoundly. That is, the
more time that has passed since stuttering onset, the more
opportunities the person has had to experience and internalize
both social and personal reactions to stuttering. For many teen-
agers and adults who stutter, these reactions tend to be nega-
tive, leading to an array of chronic and unhelpful behaviors,
thoughts, and feelings.1 It is this constellation of negative reac-
tions (e.g., visible and physical tension and struggle while
speaking and stuttering; avoidance of specific words, sounds, or
situations, and verbal interactions in general; and negative
thoughts and feelings about communication and self) that are
necessarily the focus of stuttering therapy. That is, the way the
person stutters or interferes with talking2 and the habitual way
they react to stuttering and its social and emotional consequen-
ces are the larger obstacles to well-being than the speech dis-
fluencies themselves.
This chapter is organized into three distinct, yet interre-
lated, topics. First, we will describe two lines of research that
have converged to reveal key cognitive processes underlying
intentional behavior change. As mentioned earlier, we use
this work and associated theoretical bases as a framework for
making decisions about therapy goals and clinical approaches
for teenagers and adults who stutter. Next, we present a ser-
ies of related measures and dialogue methods that are rooted
in one of these theories—Stages of Change—and discuss their
use in determining how ready a client is to make a positive
change to stuttering, what they are willing and able to
address in both the present and future, and how confident
they are that they can continue working on those new behav-
iors in the face of challenges or setbacks. We propose that this
multidimensional framework should be used in the first step
of therapy, as it forms the basis for intervention goals and
approaches that are matched to the client's readiness to use
them. Previous and emerging research supports the view that
tailoring intervention in this way increases the likelihood of a
positive, durable outcome. Finally, we discuss approaches for
teaching clients how to engage in behaviors that lead to suc-
cess in living with stuttering: learning to modify speech and
stuttering, addressing negative thoughts and feelings, and
increasing approach behaviors by talking without avoiding
words or situations.
12.2 What Needs To Be Changed
about Stuttering and Who
Decides?
The field of speech-language pathology emerged from a collabo-
ration of researchers and clinicians in multiple disciplines,
including but not limited to education, physics, neurology, and
psychology. This cross-disciplinary origin remains a key strength
of our field. At the same time, it can pose challenges for students
who must take coursework in a wide array of subject areas!
Because we are therapists, we have been particularly influenced
by research and practice in both counseling and health psychol-
ogy to help us understand how best to facilitate behavioral and
cognitive change in our clients. In the past 20 years or so,
192

speech-language pathologists have learned more and more from
psychology about the essential ingredients of successful therapy,
and how to help clients choose personally meaningful goals.
These two pieces of the therapy experience are the touchstones
of the work we do.
12.3 What Contributes to
Treatment Outcomes?
12.3.1 The Common Factors
For several years, researchers in counseling psychology have
compared the eﬃcacy of treatment approaches for mood disor-
ders. The purpose of these meta-analyses has been to deter-
mine which treatment approach or set of techniques leads to
the best outcomes and, therefore, represents the best approach.
To the surprise of many investigators and replicated across sev-
eral meta-analyses, results showed that (1) therapy for diﬀerent
mood disorders is better than no therapy and (2) one approach
does not lead to a significantly better outcome than another.
These findings have been consistent regardless of disorder (e.g.,
anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, etc.).3,4 How
can one interpret these results and how might they apply to
stuttering? A likely explanation is that while specific therapy
techniques diﬀer among treatment approaches, there is a set of
commonalities across them that contribute more than techni-
que to a good outcome in therapy. Researchers in psychology
have labeled these the common factors in therapy and argue
that each must be addressed if therapy is to be successful.
Although stuttering is not a mood disorder, these findings are
relevant to stuttering, a disorder that impacts a speaker's cogni-
tive, emotional, and social well-being. We will more clearly
connect the common factors and stuttering therapy shortly.
What are the common factors that contribute to successful ther-
apy outcomes? Both researchers and therapists have identified
four such factors: (1) the specific treatment approach and
related techniques that are used, (2) what the client and their
environment contributes to therapy, (3) the collaboration or
alliance between the client and the clinician, and (4) both the
client's and clinician's optimism in the client's ability to change
and the clinician's ability to facilitate that change. The first one
(treatment approach) is specific in that it is unique to diﬀerent
clinicians working with their individual clients; the rest,
however, are factors that cut across all therapy contexts (thus,
referred to as common factors), regardless of the specific
approach and strategies used to target behavior change. In
fact, some researchers have argued that these three factors,
common across all therapy approaches both together and
even separately, contribute the more to treatment outcomes
than the specific techniques used.5 This helps us to explain a
common observation in clinical practice: although therapy
approaches yield good outcomes overall for a population of
clients, there is a large degree of variability in outcomes
across individuals. ▶Table 12.1 provides a description of the
common factors.
What is the relevance of common factors to stuttering
therapy? We continue to develop a solid evidence base that
therapy "works" while also investigating the eﬃcacy of diﬀer-
ent approaches for various disorders. In more recent years,
however, researchers in speech-language pathology have been
able to replicate findings from the psychotherapy literature. To
a limited extent, meta-analyses have shown that therapy is
better than no therapy across diﬀerent speech and language
disorders (e.g., child language disorders, aphasia, stuttering,
etc.),7,8 but that no single approach or therapy technique
results in a significantly better outcome. Some researchers in
stuttering have delved deeper to show that people who stutter
believe that common factors, such as the therapeutic alliance,
are essential to successful treatment outcomes.9,10
In summary, previous and emerging research in both psycho-
therapy and speech-language pathology points convincingly to

the need for clinicians to understand the importance of factors
beyond the technique itself to treatment outcomes. We believe
that this is also true for stuttering intervention.
12.3.2 Spotlight on the Client's
Contribution to Therapy Outcomes:
Stages of Change
Recall that the attributes of the client and what they bring to
the therapeutic context are one of the common factors in
treatment outcome. There are numerous characteristics of
individual clients and their environments that either facilitate or
hinder progress in treatment. One factor that has received
considerable attention by behavioral health and counseling
psychologists is the client's readiness to make a change toward a
healthier physical or emotional state. In many studies across a
wide variety of clinical populations, researchers have shown that
a key factor in the outcomes of behavioral intervention is the
goodness of fit between the therapy techniques used and the
individual's readiness to use them.11 The central idea is that one's
readiness to engage in therapy is aligned with a specific stage of
change (SOC) within a series of five temporally linked stages.12
These five stages, and the shifts in thinking that facilitate
movement across them, are at the heart of the Transtheoretical
Model (TTM), or SOC model of intentional behavior change.13
▶Fig. 12.1 shows the stages of change and a description of each.
Each of the five stages of change depicted in ▶Fig. 12.1 repre-
sents an individual's cognitive state at a particular point in time.
The current stage a person is in depends on two cognitive proc-
esses: (1) how important they personally find the pros and cons
of making a change and (2) their level of confidence in their
ability to stay on the path toward change when it is diﬃcult.
These processes are referred to as decisional balance and situa-
tional self-eﬃcacy, respectively, and have been shown to predict
where an individual is in the process of change.
Decisional balance is a dynamic process of internal conflict
resolution that occurs when a person weighs the gains (pros)
and losses (cons) of making a behavioral change. Shifts in deci-
sional balance predict which SOC the person is in, as well as
their movement across stages of readiness.14,15 As one moves
from Precontemplation toward Action, the number and impor-
tance of the benefits (i.e., the "good things") of making a change
increase, while the number and importance of the losses (i.e.,
the "not-so-good things") of making that change decrease.
As the balance tips in favor of the pros (i.e., the client places
more importance on the pros than the cons), the client finds
themselves closer and closer to being ready to engage in new
behaviors. For example, a person who is in Action likely
perceives that there are several pros related to making a
change to stuttering (e.g., feeling calmer or more confident
when speaking) and that these pros are more important to
them than the fewer number of associated cons (e.g., time and
financial commitment). In contrast, a person who is in Precon-
templation may perceive that there are more cons to making a
change to stuttering than pros and that these cons are impor-
tant enough to dissuade them from making a change.
Situational self-eﬃcacy is also a dynamic cognitive process.
The confidence a person has in their ability to use a new behavior
in challenging situations and remain engaged in behavior change
after "failure" is susceptible to change. Similar to decisional
balance, situational self-eﬃcacy predicts where a person is in their
readiness to change; people in earlier stages tend to have lower
levels of situational self-eﬃcacy, while people in later stages tend
to have higher levels.16,17 Whereas someone who is in Action may
feel moderately confident that they can maintain their new
behavior when faced with challenges, someone who is in Precon-
templation would likely not feel as confident.
In summary, we propose that a client's readiness to make a
positive change to stuttering (i.e., their SOC) is a key "common
factor" in determining the goals of stuttering therapy. The
client's thoughts and beliefs about what needs to change and

how personally important it is for them to make those changes
are powerful contributors to treatment outcomes. Your role as a
clinician is to collaborate with the person who stutters to make
sure that the approach and techniques used in therapy are
matched with their readiness to use them.
12.4 Getting Started: A
Stage-Based Framework for
Therapy Planning
In the sections that follow, we describe a stage-based hybrid
approach. Inspired by the Stages of Change model we just
discussed, we oﬀer a framework that guides adults and teens who
stutter to make decisions about what they want to change about
stuttering, and how to go about it. This approach, sequential in
nature, begins with completing readiness scales that focus the
client's attention on what they want to change about stuttering
and how personally important it is to them. Their point of view,
which is uncovered by completing these scales, is explored more
deeply through motivational interviewing, a dialogic method that
clarifies and strengthens the client's personal motivation for doing
something helpful about stuttering. Finally, the information
gained from both the scales and motivational interview guides
the selection of therapy goals, and techniques are chosen that
match the client's readiness to learn and use them.
12.4.1 Creating the Therapy Plan:
Deciding What is Helpful
Both the Common Factors and Stages of Change models support
the importance of starting therapy by helping the client decide
what they want to be diﬀerent about stuttering. Obviously the
most straightforward way to do this is to ask and doing so will
hopefully lead to fruitful discussions. Our clinical experience
suggests that more often than not, the client's default answer is
that they want to talk more fluently or stop stuttering; obvi-
ously, this makes sense and is valid. Just as often, however, the
clinician can dig a little deeper to uncover less obvious and
more nuanced ideas that the client has about what they want
to be diﬀerent about stuttering. These may include an overall
wish to feel better about stuttering and talking, or to not worry
so much about stuttering. The person may also want to be able
to talk to friends or family members about stuttering or to talk
freely without avoiding. These thoughts and desires are often
below the surface and, in some cases, the client may even be
unaware of them or how important they are to their overall
quality of life. Because stuttering is multidimensional in its
onset and development, choosing to focus solely on one dimen-
sion (e.g., speech modification) without exploring the meaning
the client attaches to it may lead to therapy goals that are not
well matched to the client's readiness to address them.
The process of deciding what needs to change about stuttering
requires the client and clinician to collaboratively unpack the
client's thoughts and beliefs about what is personally important
and how change can occur. Our own work with adolescents and
adults who stutter, and the previously described SOC research
with other clinical populations, serves as the foundation for
choosing the focus of therapy.
What are You Ready to Do?
In our own recent work,18,19 we have shown that the Stages of
Change model is a good fit for the population of adolescents
and young adults who stutter. As a part of that process, we
asked teens who stutter and speech-language pathologists who
identified as stuttering specialists: "If someone was making a
positive change to their stuttering, what would they be doing?"
We carefully analyzed the content of these interviews and
discovered there were common themes that ran through them.
Using qualitative analysis methods,20 we determined three
global themes, or collection of behaviors, that reflect successful
management of stuttering:
●Learn and use speech strategies or techniques for speaking
more fluently and/or stuttering with less tension and struggle.
●Change negative thoughts and feelings about stuttering.
●Approach talking with less avoidance of words, sounds, or
situations.
We used this three-part definition of stuttering management to
create an SOC readiness scale for teenagers and young adults
who stutter, using their responses to distinguish among the five
diﬀerent stages of change.11,21 As seen in ▶Fig. 12.2, our SOC
scale first instructs the person who stutters to read the definition
as a whole (i.e., think about all three "ingredients" necessary to
successfully manage stuttering) and choose from one of five
stages of readiness to address the holistic, three-pronged
approach to managing stuttering. The five choices consisted of
the following: (1) I am not thinking about doing any of these
things in the next 6 months (reflecting the Precontemplation
stage), (2) I am thinking about doing one or more of these things
in the next 6 months (Contemplation), (3) I am planning to do
one or more of these things in the next month (Preparation),
(4) I have been doing one or more of these things for at least
6 months (Action), or (5) I have been doing one or more of these
things for more than 6 months (Maintenance).
Next, the person is asked to consider their readiness to
address each of the three behaviors alone and choose one of the
five stages described earlier for modifying speech, changing
thoughts and feelings, and reducing avoidance. In this way, we
can see whether they are in a similar, or diﬀerent, SOC across
the three ingredients for making a positive change to stuttering.
And in fact, we did find that individuals can be in diﬀerent
stages of change for various aspects of stuttering management
when we received almost 200 completed scales from adoles-
cents and young adults who stutter. For example, although a
client may be in Action for modifying speech (indicating that
they are currently working on it), they may be in Precontempla-
tion for changing attitudes and reducing avoidance.19
How Important is Doing It?
As previously described, the pros and cons of making any sort
of change, and the importance one assigns to each, are a central
determinant of readiness to change. Put simply, people are
more ready to embark on the change process when they believe
that there are more good than not-so-good things about making
change, and the good things are relatively important to them.
That said, as part of our investigation of change readiness in
people who stutter, we wanted to identify the pros and cons of
making a positive change to stuttering according to teens who
12.4 Getting Started: A Stage-Based Framework for Therapy Planning
195

stutter and stuttering specialists. Our analysis revealed eight
pros and eight cons that were reliable predictors of a young
person's readiness to change stuttering. ▶Fig. 12.3 shows the
resulting Decisional Balance scale containing these essential
pros and cons. The pros (i.e., the good things about making a
positive change to stuttering) include such things as "you would
feel better about yourself" and "you would feel calmer." The cons,
or not-so-good things, include "you would be disappointed in
yourself if you change the way you speak just to make other peo-
ple happy" and "you might not be able to change the way you
speak." Respondents were asked to judge how important each of
the pros and cons were to them when considering making a
change to their stuttering. When we dug further into what they
reported, we saw that in fact, there was a relationship between
the number and importance of the pros and cons and SOC: teens
who stutter who placed higher value on the pros of making a
change were more likely to be in the action and maintenance
stages. Why is this important? Until we can unpack these rela-
tionships in more detail, at the very least our observations sup-
port the idea that regardless of one's readiness to make a positive
change to stuttering, an individual's beliefs regarding what is good
and not so good about making this change provide therapists and
clients with important insight for choosing therapy goals. Identify-
ing therapy goals the client is ready to address maximizes the like-
lihood they will experience success.
How Confident Are You That You Can Do It?
In addition to uncovering a person's beliefs about the good and
not-so-good aspects of changing the overt or covert aspects of
stuttering, it is important to have a sense of how confident the
person is in their ability to stay on the path of change when it is
diﬃcult to do so. We asked young people who stutter and a group
of stuttering specialists to tell us the situations that make it hard
to continue to make the three-pronged changes in stuttering. Us-
ing the same methods that we employed to create the two previ-
ously discussed measures of change readiness, we uncovered a
core set of nonoverlapping situations that comprised our Self-
Eﬃcacy scale. As shown in ▶Fig. 12.4, the scale contained 11 situ-
ations that make it challenging to "stay the course" or continue
implementing positive changes to stuttering, including "you are
telling a story" and "you are afraid you are going to stutter." Our
large national sample of teens who stutter rated how confident
they felt managing stuttering in each of these situations.

In summary, the information that a client shares through
these
three
interdependent
measures
of
readiness
(SOC,
Decisional Balance, and Self-Eﬃcacy) can lay the foundation for
treatment. By gaining insight into what the client is the closest
to being ready to do about stuttering, how important it is to
them to do it, and how confident they are that they can stick
with the process, the clinician can help the client select therapy
goals and tools that are a good match for their ability to learn
and use them. Further, the process of working with the client to
uncover their beliefs about what can help and what they feel
ready to do is at the core of a strong therapeutic alliance.10
Filling in the Missing Pieces: The Motivational
Interview
The client's responses on the three readiness scales set the
stage for the focus of stuttering therapy and the approaches
and techniques that will be used. Specifically, the client's

self-judgment of their readiness to engage in changing any or
all the behaviors, thoughts/feelings, and responses to stutter-
ing, along with their ratings of how personally important that
change is, and how confident they are in doing so can help
broadly determine what the client is ready and able to take
on in therapy. The scales do not, and cannot, be a substitute
for deeper conversations that reveal the unique thoughts and
beliefs that either inhibit or facilitate change for an individual. A
powerful method for revealing a client's specific thoughts and
feelings about change is the motivational interview, described by
William Miller and Stephen Rollnick22 and written about exten-
sively since the concept first emerged. Motivational interviewing
involves a dialogue between the clinician and client to elicit
"change talk" from a client, or information about what the client
wants to change and how they can do it.23 A comprehensive
discussion of the theory and practices of motivational inter-
viewing is beyond the scope of this chapter. The format helps
strengthen the person's understanding of the gap between
what they are doing and what they want to do. The therapist
then helps the client to recognize what they already know
and do that can help them to make those changes they desire.
The basic ingredients in a motivational interview can be
described by the acronym DARN, which stands for desire, ability,
reason, and need. As such, the clinician engages the client in
conversation that helps uncover the specifics about what the
person wants to do, what they think they can do, why it is
important to them, and why they think they need to do it. What
is important to understand about a motivational interview is
that these discussions are prompted by both direct and indirect
questions and prompts from the clinician. It is also important to
listen to and value what the client says, rather than inform or
persuade.24 For example, to reveal the client's desires (what they
want to change), the clinician can ask directly, by asking "What
do you want to do about stuttering?" or indirectly, by asking
"What would you like to be diﬀerent about stuttering?" or
"Sometimes people have a theory or an idea about what can
help them make a positive change to stuttering. What do you
think you could do that would be helpful here?"

As an example of how a motivational interview can clarify a
client's readiness to change, imagine that the clinician adminis-
ters
the
SOC,
Decisional
Balance,
and
Self-Eﬃcacy
scales
(▶Fig. 12.2, ▶Fig. 12.3, ▶Fig. 12.4) to a teenager who stutters.
The client's responses indicate that they are in the Action stage
for learning and using strategies for changing speech and/or
stuttering, in Contemplation for changing thoughts and feelings,
and in Precontemplation for talking without avoiding. Using
the client responses on the three scales as starting point, the
clinician can dig deeper into the client's desire (D), perceived
ability and confidence in making changes (A), the reasons these
changes are more or less personally important and why (R), and
the urgency, now and in the future, for making changes (N).
Sample questions for each component of the motivational inter-
view (i.e., DARN) are shown in ▶Table 12.2.
Administering and discussing the SOC, Decisional Balance, and
Self-Eﬃcacy scales, and conducting the motivational interview are
key to developing a shared understanding of the client's thoughts
and feelings regarding change. As such, these practices form
the foundation of a collaborative plan for therapy. We structure
the articulation of this plan with Behrman's example of a "change
plan" format.23 Specifically, with clinician support, the client
decides the following:
●The changes I want to make are....
●The steps I plan to take in changing are....
●The ways other people (clinician, family members, coworkers,
friends) can help me are....
●I will know that my plan is working if...Some things that
could interfere with my plan are....
●What I will do if the plan is not working....
In summary, helping the client explore and consider the useful-
ness of their thoughts and beliefs about doing something about
stuttering is time well spent. In addition to sharing the respon-
sibility
for
the
direction
of
therapy,
these
conversations
strengthen the therapeutic alliance in that they convey to the
client that their viewpoints are honored and that their journey
through treatment is a collaborative partnership with you.
12.4.2 Implementing the Therapy Plan:
Learning the Things that Help
Therapy goals and approaches are chosen when the client and
clinician come to a consensus about which of the three ingre-
dients for successful stuttering management the client is either
ready (i.e., Action) or close to ready (i.e., Preparation; ▶Fig. 12.2)
to learn. For example, some clients may be contemplating doing
something to change the way they talk soon (i.e., learn and use
speech strategies or techniques for speaking more fluently and/
or stuttering with less tension and struggle), but are not ready to
approach feared words and speaking situations without avoid-
ance (Precontemplation). In fact, as we have discovered from our
own work that it is not unusual for teens and adults who stutter

to be at diﬀerent stages of change for the three components of
successful stuttering management (see ▶Fig. 12.2).
The following sections are organized by the three compo-
nents of successful stuttering management that people who
stutter and stuttering specialists endorse: (1) learn and use
speech and stuttering modification strategies to make talking
easier, (2) change how they think and feel about stuttering, and
(3) increase approach behaviors by not avoiding words, sounds,
or situations. For each component, we will describe general
therapeutic approaches and specific techniques that are appro-
priate for individuals who are either preparing or ready to make
a change as revealed through the SOC scale. In addition, we will
discuss ways in which the clinician can integrate the client's
beliefs about the pros and cons of making a change and their
confidence in "staying the course" to guide the focus of therapy.
▶Table 12.3, ▶Table 12.4, ▶Table 12.5 provide summaries of
diﬀerent approaches for the three components of successful
stuttering management.
12.5 Selecting Therapy
Approaches: Learn to Speak More
Fluently or Stutter More Easily
If the client is ready to focus on speech production in therapy,
or is close to doing so, there are three established approaches
that have been developed to teach people who stutter how to
either speak more fluently or stutter with less physical tension
and struggle. These approaches can help in diﬀerent ways and
have diﬀerent levels of support for their eﬃcacy. The first
approach has been referred to as the Normal Talking Process,
the second is referred to as Speak More Fluently (commonly
known as fluency shaping), and the third as Stutter More Easily
(commonly known as stuttering modification). ▶Table 12.3
provides additional information about each of these approaches.
12.5.1 Normal Talking Process
This approach was developed by Dean Williams, a researcher/
clinician and a person who stuttered himself. Williams was
heavily influenced by his own experiences with stuttering, and
by Wendell Johnson, his mentor at the University of Iowa. Like
Johnson, Williams took a "strength-based" approach to the suc-
cessful management of stuttering. Simply put, he argued that
instead of working toward eliminating stuttering or replacing it
with a diﬀerent way of talking, a person who stutters should
focus on what they already know how to do. In other words,
they should pay attention to their spontaneously fluent speech
and "do more of it." On its face, this perspective seems both
obvious and overly simplistic, but in that lies much of its appeal.
The clinician guides the client toward an understanding of how
speech is produced and, more importantly, what it feels like to
use the speech mechanism in diﬀerent ways, including fluent
and disfluent speech. This exploration leads the client to devel-
op a physical awareness of what they do to speak fluently and
what they are doing with the same system to interfere with
fluency, or "forward-moving speech."2,25,26 At the same time,
the clinician helps the client identify their emotional reactions

and responses to moments of speech disruption. The goal is to
recognize the emotional response to a moment of stuttering as
a feeling that can be separate from the physical behaviors
required to speak. In this way, the person learns that they can
use and attend to the "normal" speaking process, even when
strong emotions are present.
What does this approach look like in practice? To begin, the
clinician provides the client with a clear and easily understood
description of the speech mechanism and how we use it. This
naturally involves both visual and written information about
the anatomy of the subsystems involved (i.e., respiration,
phonation, articulation), their various structures, and how we
temporally coordinate the behaviors associated with each to
produce spontaneous fluency (as opposed to controlled fluency,
discussed further below). Although the client learns broadly
about anatomy, they spend more time unpacking the physiol-
ogy of speech production by experimenting with the manipula-
tion of a set of five behaviors or "parameters"2 that comprise
speech production: airflow, movement, timing, tension, and
voicing. First, the person is guided toward a physical awareness
of how they are using these processes when they speak easily
or in a forward-moving fashion. That is, what are they doing
with airflow (continuous), movement (continually moving artic-
ulators from point to point), timing (of airflow and voicing with
articulator movement), tension (of speech muscles), and voicing
(on or oﬀ)? At the same time, the client is encouraged to
manipulate these same processes to disrupt the forward flow of
speech. For example, the clinician can instruct the client to stop
their airflow while counting to 10 or place their tongue behind
their upper teeth while saying /t/ in the word "two" and leave it
there for too long (i.e., timing) or press it hard against their
teeth by using too much muscle tension (i.e., tension). In this
way, the person who stutters is learning the relationship
between what they physically do and how these behaviors under-
lie both fluent and disfluent speech. In Williams' own words2:
"With an increased awareness of behavior during the normal
talking process, (the person who stutters) can begin to compare
what they do to interfere with talking with what they can do to
facilitate it. This provides the framework for constructive
behavior change. They practice interfering on each speech
parameter and then changing what they are doing to normal
functioning on the parameter. Following this, they can practice
on interfering on combinations of speech parameters (e.g. voicing
and movement) and then change to normal talking behavior. As
they practice in diﬀerent speaking situations, they learn that they
can be in charge of what they are doing. This reduces or
eliminates most of the fears of stuttering."
In summary, the Normal Talking process emphasizes the impor-
tance of understanding and feeling the way one talks in general—
both fluently and disfluently—as the primary mechanism for
speech change. There are two main caveats oﬀered here. One is
that this approach is relatively unknown by practitioners in the
field. The second is the lack of research support for its eﬃcacy or
eﬀectiveness. These two important points are undoubtedly linked
to the fact that Williams and his students published relatively little
about how to implement the approach, and the desired outcomes
of the approach are not clearly defined (i.e., increased sponta-
neous fluency, acceptance of stuttering, decreased emotional
reactivity, or all of these?). That said, there is widespread
acknowledgment that an emphasis on behavioral awareness of
how we talk, both fluently and disfluently, is foundational to
learning how to change the way one speaks, suggesting a role
for this approach in the beginning stages of therapy for speech
modification.

12.5.2 Speak More Fluently
This approach is commonly known as fluency shaping, but it
also includes techniques called smooth speech, prolonged
speech, or speech restructuring.27,28,29,30 Some clinicians have
even developed their own idiosyncratic titles for this approach
such as "superfluency"31 or "easy, relaxed approach, smooth
movement."32 Despite the variety of names of this approach,
they all share the same primary goal: teach the client strat-
egies that lead to controlled fluency, or speech that is stutter
free. Intervention programs rooted in the major tenets of the
speak more fluently approach are widely used around the
world and are backed by relatively strong empirical support
for reducing the frequency of stuttering, in some cases report-
ing minimal to no stuttering posttreatment. That is, when indi-
viduals who stutter use the techniques associated with this
approach, they can produce greater amounts of fluent speech
(controlled or spontaneous) at least in the short-term (up to
1 year posttherapy).
In practice, the techniques that yield stutter-free speech
target time, tension, or both.33 With regard to speech timing, the
main goal is to teach the client how to reduce the overall rate of
speech in conversation. To be sure, it is not the case that people
who stutter speak at an atypically fast rate, but rather that
slowing down facilitates smoother within- and between-word
transitions, and thus, fluent speech. As shown in ▶Table 12.3,
speech techniques that lead to a reduced speaking rate include
phrasing and pausing, prolonged syllables, and slow and
smooth initiation of speech (particularly at the initiation of
utterances). Techniques that target muscle tension and facilitate
a more physically relaxed speaking mode include light articula-
tory contact, slow and smooth speech initiation, and physically
relaxed or "easy" onset of phonation.
When a person who stutters uses these strategies correctly,
the result is controlled fluency. As previously mentioned, this is
not to be confused with spontaneous fluency, which is the fluent
speech that an individual automatically produces without
attending to how they are speaking and, thus, without intentional
use of strategies or techniques. This distinction is important for
clinicians who are using this approach with their clients in that it
is essential to reinforce what is being taught, which in this case is
controlled fluency. The contextual variability of stuttering (see
▶Chapter 1) almost guarantees that over the course of therapy,
people who stutter will produce increased amounts of sponta-
neous fluency within the session. Although this is important to
note—if the goal is fluency—it is not what is being taught. The
clinician should focus both teaching (through modeling and ver-
bal instruction) and feedback on controlled fluency, perhaps
noticing and commenting on the client's increased spontane-
ous fluency but not necessarily praising it (e.g., "I just noticed a
lot of eﬀortless fluency" instead of "I just noticed a lot of great
fluency. Nice work!").
An additional point to note about controlled fluency relates
to the client's perceptions of naturalness and spontaneity,
and the extent to which this new way of talking impacts both.
Studies have shown that while the use of strategies to reduce
speech rate and decrease muscular tension yields fluent speech,
individuals using them report that their speech sounds, and
more importantly feels, unnatural. Further, controlled fluency
requires a relatively high degree of attentional focus until it
becomes automatic, resulting in diminished spontaneity of
communication. These experiences undoubtedly interfere with
the long-term use of any technique that results in the person
changing the entirety of their speech pattern such that they
don't "feel like themselves."34 It is essential, therefore, that the
clinician teach the client to self-rate how natural their controlled
fluency feels to them, how comfortable they are in intentionally
using it in any situation, and how to adjust the use of techniques
to increase both automaticity and spontaneity.
12.5.3 Stutter More Easily
This approach, also referred to as Stutter More Fluently or
Stuttering Modification, employs a set of techniques that
teach the client how to intentionally change the moment of
stuttering in real time. By reducing muscle tension and sustaining
airflow, voicing, and articulator movement while producing a
moment of stuttering, the person can essentially change a
long, physically tense moment of stuttering into a shorter,
smoother, and therefore more "acceptable" form of stuttered
disruption.35,36,37 Simply put, the person "catches" a moment
of stuttering, sustains it (or "holds on") until they are able to
reduce muscle tension and/or initiate airflow, voicing, and
movement (or "loosen up"), and smoothly transitions into
the following sound, syllable, or word.
The most significant diﬀerence between the Speak More
Fluently and Stutter More Easily approaches is that the first
requires the client to change the entirety of their speech pattern
to replace stuttering with controlled fluency, while the goal of the
second is to modify only moments of stuttering. In addition to a
focus on identifying and changing moments of stuttering, a goal
of the Stutter More Easily approach is to desensitize the person to
stuttering and, in doing so, reduce feelings of distress and help
them to more readily approach speaking. Specifically, these tech-
niques provide multiple opportunities for the client to confront
stuttering both physically and cognitively, gradually reducing the
negative reactivity and fear that can exacerbate the behaviors of
stuttering.
The strategies that characterize Stutter More Easily and can lead
to both changes in stuttering and reduced fear are presented in
▶Table 12.3. They are typically taught in sequence as they build
upon each other. For example, accurate and rapid Identification of
individual moments of stuttering by the client as they are
produced precedes modification of these instances. Changing any
behavior, including stuttering, requires the individual to know
when and how they produce it. Once the client is behaviorally, or
physically, aware of when they stutter and how they are using
their speech mechanism in those moments, they are ready to
begin the process of modification. First, by Holding and Tolerating
an instance of stuttering, the individual learns to "stay in" the
moment rather than pushing through or recoiling. At these
times, the individual who stutters is typically filled with emo-
tional awareness and in a vacuum of behavioral (or physical)
awareness.38 Holding on to the moment of stuttering, just
staying with it, allows the client to experience the associated
fear, panic, and out-of-control feeling in a safe and accepting
space, which is the essence of exposure therapy. With time,
repeated opportunities to hold and tolerate stuttered disruptions
allow these negative reactions to subside and in doing so, the
client can attend to the physical feeling of stuttering—what they
12.5 Selecting Therapy Approaches: Learn to Speak More Fluently or Stutter More Easily
203

are doing with airflow, voicing, and articulators in that moment.
In short, holding and tolerating facilitates a decrease in emotional
awareness and an increase in physical awareness, which is a
necessary skill for making behavioral change. Once the client can
identify and sustain (hold) instances of stuttering, they can learn
to Pullout by intentionally decreasing muscle tension, initiating
airflow and voicing, and smoothly transitioning into the next
sound, syllable, or word. In the cases where the client is not ready
or able to identify and sustain actual moments of stuttering, they
can produce imitated or simulated stuttered disruptions, also
known as voluntary stuttering or pseudostuttering. Holding on to
and pulling out of moments of pseudostuttering may not be as
confrontational as during moments of authentic stuttering;
nevertheless, doing so provides the client a close approxima-
tion of what they do when they stutter. In addition, through
pseudostuttering or mimicking stuttering "on purpose," the
client can practice holding and tolerating and pulling or easing
out of instances of stuttering. It is important to note that pseu-
dostuttering still requires skill at identification and training in
behavioral awareness; that is, for the client to simulate moments
of stuttering, they will need to know, on a physical level, how
to use their speech mechanism to disrupt the forward flow
of speech.
12.5.4 Summary
When the clinician and the client work together to determine
what the client wants to change about stuttering and why, it is
frequently the case that the individual decides that they are
ready to learn ways to change speech or stuttering to make
talking easier. In these cases, there are three primary ap-
proaches that can help. The first is the Normal Talking Process,
which helps the client to attend to what they do physically to
speak both fluently and disfluently. The focus is on increasing
spontaneous, or automatic, fluency by comparing the physical
feeling of fluent and disfluent speech. Through a process of
experimentation with the various parameters required for
speaking—airflow, voicing, movement, tension, and timing—the
client learns how we vary muscle tension and coordinate respi-
ratory, phonatory, and articulatory movements to speak. By
paying attention to the physical feeling associated with sponta-
neous fluency (something that people who stutter produce
most of the time when they speak), they can make adjustments
when they begin to interfere with this process and return to
"home base," or easy, forward-moving speech. The second
approach to changing talking discussed in this section is Speak
More Fluently, a method for teaching the client to change the
entirety of their speech pattern. The goal is to use a set of tech-
niques that lead to controlled fluency, or stutter-free speech.
These strategies focus primarily on changing speech timing
(e.g., rate reduction) and tension (e.g., easy onset of phonation,
light articulatory contacts). Whereas the Normal Talking Process
leverages awareness of spontaneous fluency to increase nor-
mally fluent speech, Speak More Fluency approaches focus on
teaching ways to make overall changes in speech production
that, when used properly, result in the elimination of overt stut-
tering through controlled fluency. The third approach, Stutter
More Easily, diﬀers significantly from the first two in that the
focus is on the moment of stuttering, not fluency. In practice,
the client is taught to identify, sustain, and ease out of moments
of stuttering. Here the goal is so-called acceptable stuttering, or
moments of stuttering that are shorter, more physically relaxed,
and less struggled—possibly accompanied by fewer associated
or secondary behaviors (i.e., eye blinks, head movements).
Each of these approaches can be helpful and should be pre-
sented to the client as options. Although the client is the one
who decides what they would like to change about the way
they talk, there are some general rules of thumb, based on our
experience, that the clinician should consider. First, we have
found that regardless of what the client wants to do—learn to
use controlled fluency, change moments of stuttering, or both—
a good foundation for speech change is to begin therapy with
instruction in the Normal Talking Process. Following the princi-
ples of this approach, the clinician helps the client to increase
their physical awareness of talking easily and interfering with
this process. In focusing directly on talking as something the
client is doing, rather than something that is happening to
them, the long process of desensitization and the decrease of
emotional reactivity to stuttering begins. Second, for clients for
whom fluency is highly important overall, or those for whom it
is important to be dependably fluent in specific situations,
Speak More Fluently approaches can be the most appropriate. In
addition, we have found that for clients presenting with a high
frequency of stuttering accompanied by physical struggle and
associated behaviors, beginning therapy by teaching techniques
to elicit controlled fluency can relatively quickly allow them to
communicate more eﬃciently (i.e., produce more words per mi-
nute) and provide a boost of confidence that change is possible.
Of course, for these individuals, it is also often the case that
Stutter More Easily strategies are also desirable as they help
desensitize
to and
promote behavioral
awareness
during
moments of stuttering. Finally, for those clients who produce
relatively mild stuttering (i.e., low-frequency disfluencies, short
duration, few to no associated behaviors), the Normal Talking
Process can be most helpful in that it highlights skills that the
client already possesses (relatively large amounts of spontaneous
fluency) by strengthening their behavioral awareness of what
they do when they talk easily. This can lay a strong foundation for
the client to figure out ways to ease out of moments of stuttering
"on the fly," which is a skill subsumed under the Stutter More
Easily approach.
In closing, it must also be said that many people who stutter,
and their clinicians, begin therapy by experimenting with an inte-
grated approach, that is, trying out strategies from all approaches
so that (1) they can become physically aware of what they do
when they talk, (2) they can be intentionally fluent at times of
their choosing, and (3) they know how to and feel confident that
they can change moments of stuttering, in real time, when they
choose. After the client experiments with the strategies that
either yield controlled fluency or easier stuttering, they can make
decisions about which they prefer to focus on in therapy.
12.6 Selecting Therapy
Approaches: Changing Thoughts
and Feelings
As described in several places in this chapter, and throughout this
book, people living with stuttering often experience negative
thoughts, attitudes, and feelings about stuttering, communication,
Adolescents and Adults
204

and themselves. There is a rich literature base showing that these
thoughts and emotions develop over time as people who stutter
experience the personal, academic, vocational, and social conse-
quences of stuttering, as well as the stigma and self-stigma associ-
ated with being a person who stutters.39,40 Clinicians working
with teenagers and adults who stutter must be prepared to help
clients express the thoughts and emotions they experience that
cause distress and, in many cases, drive much of their behavior.
Undoubtedly, when a person who stutters gains a measure of
autonomy over the way they speak—by using controlled fluency
or modifying instances of stuttering—their positive thoughts and
feelings often increase as well. However, this is not always the
case. A comprehensive approach to the treatment of stuttering
must include the cognitive and aﬀective pieces of the problem
that, for many, represent the most significant challenges.
Here we can revisit the discussion at the beginning of this
chapter, namely, the importance of learning from related disci-
plines. Nowhere is this more critical than when deciding how to
help a person who stutters change their thoughts and feelings
about stuttering. This is an essential consideration in stuttering
therapy, and is within the scope of practice for speech-language
pathologists. In recent years, several researchers and clinicians
in the field of stuttering have described ways in which estab-
lished approaches in counseling psychology can be used in ther-
apy. When the person who stutters is ready to confront and
change the way they cope with stuttering, the clinician must
have a working knowledge of how to get started on the journey.
In the subsections that follow, we will provide brief summaries
of the more widely used and promising approaches from coun-
seling psychology and psychotherapy, along with additional re-
sources for further study. A summary of the major principles
underlying each approach, along with additional resources for
more in-depth study, is provided in ▶Table 12.4.
12.6.1 Listening and Valuing
In his seminal text on counseling in communication disorders,
Luterman24 asserts that the key to helping people to understand
and act on what they need to feel better is for the clinician to
listen and value what the individual reveals in conversation.
What this means in practice is that the clinician engages the
client in a dialogue, using a variety of diﬀerent counseling
responses to help them express and reflect upon their thoughts
and feelings without providing a diagnosis of "what is wrong"
or suggestions for how it can be "fixed." The role of the clinician
is to select the response that will guide the client toward open-
ing up and revealing their point of view. These responses are
also strategic in that they invite varying levels of intimacy
between the client and the clinician, and thus can strengthen
(or keep neutral) the relationship between the two. For
example, if a client says, "I'm embarrassed that I haven't been
successful in therapy in the past," the clinician can respond with
information about the types of stuttering therapies that are
available and might also persuade the client to explore a specific
program. Luterman refers to this as a content response, which
essentially requires little or no follow-up from the client while
keeping the relationship superficial. On the other hand, the
clinician may say something as simple as "Tell me what makes
you say that," an open-ended question that in some ways
encourages the client to reveal what they have seen, heard, or
experienced that makes them believe they have failed and feel
embarrassed. Of critical importance here is that the clinician
does not oﬀer an opinion on what the client thinks or how they
feel. By bringing thoughts and emotions out into the open, by
saying them out loud, and exploring them with another person,
the client and clinician can unpack them together. Ultimately, it
is up to the client to understand themselves in a way that helps
them change the way they cope with stuttering and its conse-
quences, both in their thoughts and in their emotions.
12.6.2 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
This long-standing and widely used approach has been the
bread and butter of counseling psychologists and psychothera-
pists for many years. In her excellent book, Judith Beck41
describes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a process of
understanding the perception of events and experiences that
have led to the client's behaviors and feelings. The approach is
rooted in the cognitive model that asserts that specific situa-
tions do not cause us to feel a certain way; rather, it is the way
we interpret events or experiences that influences our emo-
tions. And it is our emotions, not our thoughts, that determine
our behavior, or what we do.
The core strategy in CBT is to first help the client link situa-
tions they experience (or have experienced) to the thoughts that
arise automatically during the event. Here, it is important to
understand that these automatic thoughts are very diﬀerent
from those that we develop through contemplation or active,
critical examination. Rather, automatic thoughts "just happen"—
popping up just under the surface, below our conscious aware-
ness. It is the emotion or feeling tied to an automatic thought
that we notice, and that makes us feel distressed. As an example,
suppose an adolescent boy who stutters tells the clinician that
walking into the cafeteria at school is stressful. The therapist
then prompts him to describe the situation, and as he does, the
therapist notices the boy becoming flushed and losing eye con-
tact—clearly experiencing an emotional reaction. The clinician
stops the boy and asks:
Clinician: "What is going through your mind right now?"
Teen: "I'm going to stutter when I talk at lunch."
Clinician: "What else?"
Teen: "I think that people think I'm weird when I stutter."
Clinician: "And how does that make you feel?"
This sequence of clinician questions is an example of the essen-
tial structure of CBT, one in which the therapist helps the client
identify their automatic thoughts and their consequent emo-
tions and behaviors. For example, suppose the teen answers
this last question by revealing that he feels ashamed. The clini-
cian can then probe to uncover what the boy does when he feels
this way—perhaps avoiding eating lunch in the cafeteria. The
focus of therapy then becomes one in which the therapist and
the client problem-solve ways to break these "thinking traps"
by searching for evidence to support or refute the automatic
thought ("People don't like me"). In summary, the methods of
CBT can be used in stuttering therapy to help a client examine
connections between situations and their cognitive and emo-
tional reactions to them—and to search for interpretations that
lead to positive coping strategies.

205

12.7 Mindfulness
The practice of mindfulness has seen a significant increase over
the past 20 years or so, proving to be a powerful method for
improving psychological well-being.42 More recently, practi-
tioners and researchers have described the eﬃcacy of incorpo-
rating mindfulness practice into stuttering treatment, finding
that it improves the ability to attend to what one is doing at the
moment (physically, cognitively, and emotionally), an essential
skill in all forms of therapy.43 Further, the act of staying in the
present moment, without the continual shifting between the
past and the future so common to the human experience, leads
to lower levels of anxiety and time urgency (the feeling of being
rushed to perform) and increased mental acuity and emotional
self-regulation. For these benefits alone, mindfulness practice
can be helpful for individuals who stutter and provide a stable
foundation for the challenging work of therapy.
12.7.1 Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy
Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an expanded
version of CBT that combines (1) the process of contrasting
automatic thoughts with objective observations and (2) mind-
fulness and personal values to develop a roadmap for setting
treatment goals.44 In addition to using CBT strategies, the ACT
process begins with a values clarification exercise that facili-
tates the expression of what is important to the client. One such
exercise requires them to think of a moment from the past or
more recently when they felt joyful, fulfilled, or calm. They are
then prompted to describe the setting: Who was there? What was
happening? What were the surroundings? This activity helps the
client understand the essential ingredients of situations or events
that bring them feelings of contentment or ease—particular rela-
tionships, settings, activities, or topics of conversation. These are
identified as the client's values and doing things to move closer
to achieving them becomes the goal of therapy. For example, if
relationships in general, or with specific people, are something
the client values, what changes can they make to get closer to
attaining more or better relationships? If some of these changes
relate to stuttering, the client and clinician can discuss how
doing something about stuttering may help the client initiate
more social relationships. The important point is that the client
may come to see that doing something about stuttering helps
them to achieve something personally meaningful, not because
stuttering itself needs to be changed. Just as importantly, the
clinician may come to understand that their clients who stutter
are able to meet their aspirational values despite, and sometimes
because of, stuttering.
In addition to identifying important values and the role that
stuttering plays in living them out, the ACT approach also
emphasizes acceptance of stuttering as something that is an
integral part of the client's past, present, and probably future life.
Stuttering and the thoughts and feelings the client experiences
are noticed but not evaluated, and attempts are not made to
eliminate them. Instead, the client is taught how to attend to the
present without judgment (acceptance) and make a commitment
to flexibly respond (rather than react) to their thoughts, emo-
tions, and behaviors in ways that honor their values. By doing so
routinely, the client's perspective shifts from what they can do to
eliminate stuttering toward what they can do about stuttering (if
anything) to live a values-driven life.
12.7.2 Solution-Focused Brief Therapy
The focus of this approach is on what the client wants to
achieve and how to do it as opposed to closely examining the
problem and its causes. The word "brief" in the title conveys
the result of spending less time discussing the problem and
more time talking about
possible solutions; the goal of
solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) is to quickly implement a
course of action and see positive results in a relatively short
period of time (or relatively few therapy sessions).45
SFBT involves a targeted conversation in which the clinician
asks questions to uncover times in the client's life when stutter-
ing has not been a problem or an exception to the rule. For
example, if a client who stutters is anxious about talking and
potentially stuttering at parties but is not distressed about stut-
tering when talking in other, smaller social situations (e.g., in
the break room at work), the therapist would highlight the
client's interactions at work as an exception to the client's usual
experience with stuttering. The clinician and client then discuss
ways in which the irregularity diﬀers from the client's typical
experience with stuttering, with the therapist focusing the
conversation on the strengths and abilities that the client
already possesses and uses in those atypical situations. In this
way, the therapist borrows principles from positive psychology
described earlier in this chapter, bringing the client's skills to
the forefront instead of trying to build new ones. In fact, it is
this strategy—illuminating what is already known as opposed
to what needs to be learned—that is the main reason that SFBT
can be implemented over a relatively short time frame.
12.7.3 Narrative Therapy
This approach to understanding the way we think and feel about
ourselves assumes that our identity is shaped by the stories that
people in our lives tell about us and the ways in which we rewrite
them.46 For some people who stutter, the main theme in their
story, and in turn their identity, is their stuttering and the fact that
they are a person who stutters. As such, their story is described as
"thin," meaning that in their minds, stuttering makes up the bulk
of who they are. Narrative therapy provides a structure for
expanding one's story to include multiple pieces, a "thickening" of
one's identity so to speak. One of the first steps in narrative ther-
apy for stuttering is to help the client to externalize stuttering by
giving it a name and describing it as an entity separate from the
person.47 The client then writes about stuttering as though it were
a person, describing its characteristics and their relationship with
it. This is followed by another writing assignment in which the cli-
ent is instructed to "Write about a time when stuttering wasn't
able to boss you around" or "did not control you." Through the
lens of their own stories, the client comes to see that they have
experienced typical and unique outcomes related to stuttering,
both resulting from a complex interaction of external and internal
forces. Here, as in SFBT, the emphasis is on the unique outcome
(i.e., those times when stuttering did not control you) and the in-
ternal strengths and skills the client brought to the situation that
they already possess. Simply put, the goal is for the client to write
a "new story" (or identity) in which stuttering occupies less space.

12.7.4 Bibliotherapy
Bibliotherapy refers to the process of reading, reflecting upon,
and discussing first-person narratives. By reading and discus-
sing the stories that people who stutter have shared about their
lives, both clients and clinicians can better understand the lived
experience of stuttering and increase their awareness of diﬀer-
ent ways to cope with it. For example, in a recent qualitative
study, adults who stutter reported that reading and discussing
the narrative Out With It (a memoir about stuttering written by
a person who stutters) in their therapy sessions was beneficial.48
Specifically, they reported that reading the memoir helped nor-
malize stuttering, inspired more positive thoughts and feelings,
and instilled hope for living well with stuttering in the future.
Regarding
change
readiness,
studies
in
behavioral
health
psychology have shown that bibliotherapy can move clients in
Precontemplation toward Action. In our clinical experience, we
have found that some clients are not ready to discuss their stutter-
ing but are willing and open to talking about stuttering in general,
at a safe distance and removed from themselves. Reading about
the experiences of others who stutter is a way to help more
guarded clients "dip their toes" in the water of openly talking
about stuttering-related thoughts and feelings. Finally, it is worth
mentioning that clinicians should be creative in exploring a
variety of platforms for bibliotherapy. For example, clients who do
not enjoy reading, or who are poor readers, can watch and discuss
films such as "The Way We Talk" or "When I Stutter," TED
(technology, entertainment, and design) talks or videos made by
people who stutter, or listen to podcasts and audiobooks.
12.7.5 Self-Help and Support
Organizations
Connecting with other people who stutter in a safe, supportive
environment where stuttering is the norm, not the exception, is
in and of itself therapeutic. Although not typically facilitated by
speech-language pathologists, stuttering self-help or support
groups can play an integral role in developing healthy coping
mechanisms and social support among people who stutter of
all ages. Spending time and talking with other people who stut-
ter can help the client realize that they have options about the
ways in which they think and feel about stuttering and how to
live with it. A growing body of evidence indicates that partici-
pating in stuttering self-help groups increases self-acceptance
and reduces feelings of shame and isolation.49,50,51 There are
many organizations that oﬀer self-help or support events, and
these events can take a variety of formats ranging from 1-hour
virtual "hangouts" to multiday in-person conventions. Specific
support organizations include the National Stuttering Associa-
tion (NSA), FRIENDS: The National Stuttering Association for
Young People who Stutter, and Stutter Social.
12.8 Selecting Therapy
Approaches: Approaching Talking
without Avoiding
Many people who stutter become highly adept at anticipating
upcoming moments of stuttering. This can exist at the sound or
word level, where speakers scan ahead when they are talking
and identify a specific upcoming sound/word that they know
they will stutter on. In these instances, people who stutter often
employ a variety of avoidance behaviors such as changing that
target sound/word with a similar word that is easier to say,
using filler words to buy themselves time, or talking around the
target word (i.e., circumlocuting). People who stutter also
anticipate stuttering at the situation level, where they have a
sense that they will stutter during a specific interaction in the
future such as when introducing themselves at an upcoming
party or during a forthcoming work presentation. This antici-
pation of impending diﬃculty, and the subsequent avoidance
behaviors that speakers plan and carry out, contributes a
great deal to their overall distress and feeling of "walking on
eggshells."
One approach to helping clients approach feared sounds/
words is Stutter More Easily, which we described previously.
With this approach, clients are guided to enter moments of
stuttering, and then hold and tolerate them before easing out.
When practiced in a safe and supportive space, this act of stay-
ing in a moment of stuttering can be hugely desensitizing for
people who stutter and can help them feel more comfortable
approaching trigger sounds/words in the future. In addition to
this approach, there are other ways that clients can practice
approaching talking and stuttering, which we will describe in
the following subsections and are outlined in ▶Table 12.5.
12.8.1 Avoidance Reduction Therapy for
Stuttering
Avoidance Reduction Therapy for Stuttering (ARTS) is a therapy
approach grounded in Joseph Sheehan's pioneering theoretical
and clinical work in stuttering that has been refined and mod-
ernized by Vivian Sisskin.52,53 The ARTS perspective holds that
attempting to control or suppress stuttering results in greater
communication diﬃculty than the act of stuttering itself. Spe-
cifically, teens and adults who stutter have experienced many
years of communication diﬃculty and as such, have developed
idiosyncratic strategies or "tricks" to avoid and escape these
disruptions. The heart of ARTS is helping clients learn to do less
when they stutter—less control, avoidance, escape, emotional
reactivity, and unhelpful thoughts that all lead to struggle
behaviors. By approaching feared sounds, words, and situations,
clients can communicate with greater eﬃciency, spontaneity,
comfort, confidence, and joy.
12.8.2 Pseudostuttering
The act of stuttering, and the anticipation that leads up to it,
commonly spurs a great deal of negative thoughts and feelings
for teens and adults who stutter. They may be afraid of feeling
"out of control," anxious of how their listener will perceive
them, guilty about taking up extra time during the interaction,
or shame about how they talk. These negative emotions can
take hold of the speaker and deter them from approaching
talking. A long-held approach for desensitizing clients to the
negative emotions they have associated with the moment of
stuttering is to guide them in simulating stuttering, an exercise
that is commonly referred to as pseudostuttering, voluntary
12.8 Selecting Therapy Approaches: Approaching Talking without Avoiding
207

stuttering, or purposeful stuttering and is, in essence, a form of
exposure therapy.
The primary goals of pseudostuttering are to (1) desensitize
the client to the autonomic nervous system arousal (i.e., "fight
or flight") and negative emotion that accompany moments of
stuttering and (2) practice stuttering modification techniques
such as holding, tolerating, and easing out of stuttered disrup-
tions. Pseudostuttering in a manner that most closely simulates
the client's actual stuttering has a more positive eﬀect on aﬀec-
tive, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes than pseudostuttering
in a way that is diﬀerent from how the client typically stutters.54
As such, the client must first become physically aware of what
they do when they stutter. Once the client's behavioral aware-
ness of their stuttering pattern is adequate, they can purposefully
stutter in a way that physiologically mirrors what they do during
actual moments of stuttering.
It is common for a client to be confused or resistant when
pseudostuttering is first introduced in therapy. Why am I being
asked to stutter more when I have come here to learn how to
stutter less? This is a valid concern, and as such, the clinician
must present the client with a sound and clear rationale for the
ways in which pseudostuttering can help them approach talking
with less avoidance. As the client practices pseudostuttering in
the safe space of the therapy room and gradually outside of it, the
clinician must provide examples that mirror the client's unique
style of stuttering. When the clinician "puts stuttering in her own
mouth," he or she is not only modeling to the client what the
target behavior is but also desensitizing the client to hearing and
seeing stuttering, which serves to normalize their experience. In
time, the emotional arousal associated with the moment of stut-
tering slowly dissipates and the client finds it easier to approach
previously feared sounds, words, and situations.
12.8.3 Self-Disclosure
Another way to help clients learn to approach, rather than avoid,
stuttering and speaking situations is to explore, role-play, and
practice self-disclosure. Self-disclosure refers to instances in which
people who stutter share information about their identity as a
person who stutters with others, often through verbal disclosure
statements. There are infinite ways to tell others about stuttering,
but an example of a disclosure statement is "You might notice that
I stutter; feel free to check in with me if you have any questions
about it." Research has shown that disclosing stuttering is most
beneficial at the beginning of a communicative interaction when
presented as a neutral (rather than apologetic) statement.55,56
Self-disclosure is also associated with social benefits for both
speakers and listeners.57,58 Specifically, individuals who stutter
report that disclosing stuttering reduces fear and worry and
increases feelings of authenticity, self-respect, and dignity. Further,
people who stutter report that disclosing stuttering makes it
easier for them to be present with their communication partners
because they can "let go" of the urge to monitor whether the
listener knows about their stuttering. Finally, listeners perceive
speakers who disclose stuttering as more outgoing, confident, and
friendly compared to those who do not disclose.59
Although there are several positive benefits associated with
stuttering disclosure, it is important to remember that deciding
whether to self-disclose (and when to do it) is a personal choice
that should be made by the client. Outcomes of disclosing a
stigmatized condition are not always positive, and are influ-
enced by how and why clients choose to disclose, along with a
host of other factors.60
12.8.4 Summary
For many teens and adults who stutter, the amount of space
that negative thoughts and feelings about stuttering occupy in
their minds is the primary contributor to a reduced quality of
life, even more so than the behavior of stuttering itself. Even so,
it is often the case that both clients and clinicians default to
speech goals as the focus of therapy. The reasons for this are un-
clear, but likely relate to the familiarity and comfort with deal-
ing with the observable characteristics (overt speech and stut-
tering patterns) rather than the unobservable (thoughts and
feelings). Further, people who stutter are sometimes not con-
sciously aware that they avoid, or that they frequently engage
in negative thinking, as these ways of reacting have become ha-
bitual coping patterns. These Precontemplators are not seeking
ways to change because they do not clearly see the problem,
and they feel hopeless that anyone or anything can help. Work-
ing with people who stutter requires the clinician to be pre-
pared to help the client learn ways to intentionally respond to
stuttering, first by oﬀering a safe place to express thoughts and
feelings and second by helping them to explore strategies for
changing unhelpful thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
12.9 Putting it All Together: Two
Cases
The following two cases—one a teen who stutters (Appendix 12.1)
and one an adult who stutters (Appendix 12.2)—provide an
opportunity for you to integrate and apply what you have
learned in this chapter. After reading these case descriptions,
discuss each and map out a basic therapy approach. Include
major areas of focus, with a rationale based on the information
provided in each case and try your hand at writing therapy goals.
Consider the following questions:
1. What does the client seem most ready to do about
stuttering? Why?
2. What additional information do you need to develop a
therapy plan? How will you obtain it? For instance, are there
additional assessments you would like to administer? Are
there other people you would like to talk to? What questions
do you want to ask the client and/or others?
3. What therapy approach(es) appear warranted and
recommended for this client? Why?
4. Based on questions 1, 2, and 3, what might you and the
client do in the first therapy session? Can you write two or
three long- and short-term goals?

Appendix 12.1 Case Study: Teen
Darrius, a 13-year-old English-speaking adolescent boy, was
referred to the clinic by his father, Mr. Carter. Mr. Carter reported
that Darrius was experiencing increased diﬃculties with com-
munication after being discharged from therapy for stuttering
approximately 1 year ago. According to Mr. Carter, recently Dar-
rius has repeatedly expressed a desire for help with stuttering.
Darrius lives at home with his mother, father, and younger
sister. He enjoys reading, playing video games, science experi-
ments, and "anything Star Wars."
During the evaluation, Darrius stated that he would like "a
place to talk about my stuttering" and to "learn how to change
it." Analysis of a 300-word speech sample revealed an average of
20 disfluent words per 100 words, primarily characterized by
sound/syllable repetitions and sound prolongations (without
airflow or voicing, i.e., blocks). These disfluencies were accom-
panied by several associated behaviors, including reduced eye
contact and hitting his leg with his fist. Darrius appeared to be
highly aware of moments of stuttering and associated behaviors,
specifically describing the pounding behavior as "annoying." He
added that he would "like to change it if he knew how."
The Stuttering Severity Instrument—Fourth Edition (SSI-41)
was also administered, yielding a severity rating of "severe,"
and placing Darrius in the 78th to 88th percentile rank com-
pared to other children who stutter in his age range. Darrius
also completed the Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience
with Stuttering (OASES2), which assesses the adverse impact of
stuttering. His overall OASES score yielded a "moderate-severe"
rating, with the highest score on the "Communication in Daily
Situations" subtest.
Darrius also completed the Stage of Change scale to assess
how ready he was to do something about stuttering. His
responses indicated that he is in the Preparation stage for
overall stuttering management. For the subscale responses, he
indicated that he is also in the Preparation stage for both (1)
learning and using speech strategies or techniques for speaking
more fluently and/or stuttering with less tension and struggle
and (2) changing negative thoughts and feelings about stutter-
ing, but in Precontemplation for (3) approaching talking with
less avoidance.
Darrius reported that his previous therapy focused on "can-
cellations and slowing down," and shared that these techniques
"worked for a while, but not anymore." He described his family
as "helpful" and "understanding" of stuttering. When asked if
he wished anything could be diﬀerent about stuttering at home,
Darrius shared the opinion that being told to "slow down" is
not helpful but that having "more time to talk helps a lot." He
described classroom presentations and small talk with same-
age peers as particularly challenging speaking situations. Fur-
ther, he reported that he "sometimes" gets mocked and bullied
for stuttering in science class, adding that he "doesn't know
what to do when that happens," so he "stays quiet." When
asked if he would be interested in meeting other teens who
stutter, Darrius said it "could be embarrassing" but might also
help him "feel less alone" about stuttering.
Appendix 12.2 Case Study: Adult
Sasha is a 36-year-old woman who referred herself for a stut-
tering evaluation. She is married, has two young children, and
works as a nurse. She remembers starting to stutter around the
age of 8 years after her parents separated. She had minimal
speech therapy when she was growing up, and the therapy she
did have was not helpful; she recalls the speech-language path-
ologist (SLP) pulling her out of class to practice using "easy
starts" while reading aloud, despite the fact that she tended to
be spontaneously fluent while reading aloud. She did not
receive any therapy for stuttering during high school or college.
According to Sasha, she was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder
in college and has been on a daily regimen of antianxiety medi-
cation since her mid-20 s.
During the evaluation, Sasha stated that she is "exhausted"
from hiding stuttering all the time. She feels like she is "walking
on eggshells" during every conversation and is at a "breaking
point." Analysis of a 300-word conversational speech sample
revealed an average of 7 speech disfluencies per 100 words, pri-
marily characterized by interjections including "you know" and
"uh" (e.g., "It's been you know really hard to you know talk on
the phone and uh-uh-uh-introduce myself to you know new
people"). She occasionally produced fleeting sound/syllable
repetitions during both conversational speech and oral reading.
Further, Sasha consistently avoided eye contact while speaking,
especially while producing sound/syllable repetitions. When
probed about her pattern of stuttering and avoidance, Sasha
reported that she anticipates stuttering "almost always."
The Stuttering Severity Instrument—Fourth Edition (SSI-4;
Riley, 2009) was also administered, yielding a severity rating of
"very mild," placing Sasha in the 5th to 11th percentile of other
adults who stutter. She also completed the Overall Assessment
of the Speaker's Experience with Stuttering (OASES; Yaruss),
which assesses the adverse impact of stuttering. Sasha's overall
OASES score yielded a "severe" rating with the highest scores
on both the "Your Reactions to Stuttering" and "Quality of Life"
subtests.
Sasha also completed the Stage of Change scale to assess how
ready she is to do something about stuttering. Her responses
indicated that she is in the Contemplation stage for stuttering
management. For the subscale responses, she indicated she is in
the Precontemplation stage for learning and using strategies for
speaking more fluently or stuttering with less struggle, Prepa-
ration for changing negative thoughts and feelings about stut-
tering, and Contemplation for approaching talking with less
avoidance.
During the evaluation, Sasha appeared to react negatively
to the clinician's use of the word "stuttering" to describe her
communication diﬃculty. She stated that "It's not that [stutter-
ing]... it's some sort of panicky feeling." She does not use the
Adolescents and Adults
210

words stutter or stuttering to describe herself or her pattern of
speech. Sasha reported that she has never talked about her diﬃ-
culty in speaking with her husband or other family members.
She went on to say that "no one at work knows about my condi-
tion" and that she would like to "keep it that way."

Abstract
This chapter aims to describe fundamental considerations for
assessment and treatment of stuttering within the context of
language and phonology, along with best practices for treating
concomitant
stuttering
and
language/phonological
impair-
ments in children. The chapter expands on what is known
about treating stuttering and concomitant phonology and/or
language impairment, despite a lack of research on best practi-
ces. Thus, the approach espoused in this chapter is one in which
language is recognized as the structure within which speech is
embedded and therefore is central to how we plan and execute
therapy. Accordingly, we review principles of evidence-based
practice as well as practice-based evidence while discussing
potential approaches to treating the child who stutters who
presents with concomitant impairments in other areas of com-
munication. Case studies are included to illustrate possible
approaches to the management of children who stutter with
comorbid diagnoses.
Keywords: stuttering, fluency disorder, language delay/disorder,
phonological disorder, articulation, concomitant impairment
13.1 Introduction
We know that stuttering onset typically occurs around the
time that the child's language and phonological developments
are undergoing substantial growth (see ▶Chapter 1 and
Bloodstein et al1 for an overview of stuttering onset). Thus,
while we do not yet know the possible role that rapid advances
in language and/or phonological development plays in precipi-
tating the onset of stuttering, it is essential that we acknowledge
the interaction between what is happening in the development
of linguistic processes and those involved with motor speech
production. Nevertheless, we know a few things about the com-
plexities involved in interactions among language production,
phonological encoding, and both stuttering and fluency that can
guide work with children who face multiple challenges in
producing grammatically correct, well-articulated, and fluent
utterances. See ▶Chapter 4 for details on the connection
between stuttering and speech and language.
"Language impairment is observed more frequently in children
who stutter than in the general population."
The complexity involved in speech and language formulation
and production requires that we be diligent in collecting as
much information as we can about a youngster's linguistic and
pragmatic skills as well as their fluency abilities. Some children
who stutter will have co-occurring phonology and/or language
deficits. Stuttering and co-occurring, clinically relevant language
impairment has been documented, with language impairment
observed more frequently in children who stutter than in the
general population.2,3,4,5,6 Little is known about the nature of
these language concerns in children who stutter, although some
have suggested these children might represent a "subgroup" of
the larger population of children who stutter.7,8 Regardless,
children who stutter who also exhibit language impairment
require careful therapeutic care. A balance between addressing
their linguistic deficits and facilitating their fluency must be
achieved such that one is not being sacrificed for the other. In
terms of co-occurring stuttering and phonological impairment,
little research evidence exists to suggest that there is an estab-
lished association between the two (see Sasisekaran9 for review).
That said, the clinician treating a young child who stutters would
be wise to bear in mind phonological skills and phonological
context in structuring treatment goals, objectives, and activities
(see discussion on phonology and stuttering later).
"The clinician should consider phonological skills and
phonological context when structuring treatment goals,
objectives, and activities."
We also know that even children who stutter with presumably
typical language skills will have diﬃculty maintaining fluency
while attempting to construct utterances that contain newly
acquired or complex language structures (see ▶Chapter 4 and
Hall et al10 for review). Because a common hallmark of child
language disorders is diﬃculty with encoding new materials
(often measured in tangible terms by examining children's
ability to store and repeat nonsense words, i.e., nonword repe-
tition [NWR]), many children who stutter with concomitant
diagnoses of language impairment may struggle to remember
new linguistic information, further stressing their abilities to be
fluent. Diﬃculties with short-term (working) memory, as well
as other executive function deficits, seem to be characteristic of
most children with language impairment,11 as well as some
children who stutter (see ▶Chapter 4).7,8 Recent work suggests,
in fact, that children who stutter with better NWR skills have
more favorable prognoses for spontaneous recovery.12 Thus,
the child you are treating for stuttering may have weaknesses
in memory for new information which merit both evaluation
and therapy planning consideration.
Most recently, eﬀorts to understand disorders of communi-
cation, such as stuttering and impairments of language and
phonology, have highlighted the integrated nature of the
systems underlying speech and language production. That is,
while many of us studied from textbooks that classified stut-
tering as a "speech disorder," it is now clear that subsystems
within the language production process interact and influence
one another. Although classical approaches to communication
disorders demarcate some as language, and others as speech,
we now know that the conventional view of discrete contrasts
(e.g., speech/language or linguistic/motor) is too simplistic and
overlooks dynamic relationships between these constructs.
For instance, in children, utterances that are relatively longer
or more complex than the child's typical productions result in
destabilization of the coordinated motor actions that underlie
articulatory gestures.13,14,15,16 This may reflect weakened con-
nectivity between brain regions in children who stutter. For
example, in their study of children who stutter, Usler et al13
215

showed not only reduced coordination among motor gestures
for speech but also diﬃculty in remembering and repeating
complex linguistic stimuli, evidence of cascading eﬀects of
demands on aspects of the speech/language encoding process
that interact with one another. This model of interactive proc-
esses necessitates an approach to treatment that recognizes
the delicate balance between reducing linguistic demands to
facilitate fluency while at the same time providing appropriate
language and phonology targets to allow for continued growth.
"Simply demarcating a communication disorder as either
speech or language overlooks the dynamic relationship
between the two."
Finally, it is worth restating that best practices for the treat-
ment of stuttering should always occur within an ecologically
valid linguistic context. Thus, the clinician must plan and
execute therapy in ways that allow the child to learn "real-
world" strategies for managing fluency while also supporting
language and phonology at or close to the zone of proximal
development—creating
appropriate
opportunities
for
the
child to continue to grow linguistically while both fluency
and communication are facilitated. To generalize successfully,
however, all work will need to be practiced under conditions
that duplicate the cognitive, linguistic, and conversational
time-constraint challenges of communicating in "real-world"
situations.
"All work should be practiced under conditions that duplicate the
cognitive, linguistic, and conversational time-constraints of
communicating in 'real-world' situations."
13.2 Intervention Principles
Taken together, research studies suggest the following impor-
tant considerations in working with children who stutter
who have additional diﬃculties with articulation/phonology,
language, or both:
●We know from studies of both typically developing children
and children who stutter that various levels of language
demand can adversely impact children's ability to maintain
fluency (see ▶Chapter 4 for more information). Thus, when
designing activities meant to work on stuttering directly, the
level of language challenge that these activities may require
of the child needs to be carefully considered, if the objective
is to facilitate fluent speech.
●Facilitating fluency, in the context of carefully designed
linguistic tasks, can be advanced by providing ample
opportunity to practice the speech motor behaviors
consistent with fluent speech.
●Why language demand adversely impacts the child's ability to
be fluent is not well understood. However, the relationship
between language or phonological demand and fluency may
be modulated by the impacts that increased linguistic
challenge placed on the child's speech-motor system. An
increased body of experimental research supports this view,
for speech-motor stability has been shown to be adversely
impacted by increasing language task demand in both
children and adults.13,14,15,16
13.3 Diagnostic Considerations
13.3.1 A Thorough Evaluation
Given the recognized potential for comorbidity of stuttering
and additional communication impairments, it is wise for clini-
cians to conduct thorough evaluations of all children referred
for fluency disorder. Our clinical impression agrees with that of
Johnson et al,17 who found that disorders impacting the "form"
of children's communication (e.g., articulation, fluency) are
more likely to be identified as areas of concern by adults in a
child's environment than are more subtle impairments in lan-
guage understanding or use. Tomblin et al agree that language
disorder may be under-referred.18 Thus, thorough assessment
of children referred for concerns about stuttering is imperative
for the following reasons: (1) there is a high likelihood of
comorbidity among communication impairments in young
children and we do not want to miss a potential disorder that
merits intervention; (2) the child's language skills are relevant
in planning appropriate fluency therapy activities and goals;
and (3) it is possible that the child's fluency profile is actually
not stuttering, but evidence of a language formulation disorder.
We will discuss the challenge of diﬀerential diagnosis of stutter-
ing and other disfluency profiles later in this chapter.
"Given the potential for concomitant clinical needs, clinicians
should conduct thorough evaluations of all children referred for
fluency disorder."
A final benefit of thorough language and phonological assess-
ment of the young child who stutters is that recent research
suggests diﬀerential profiles of recovery and persistence in
children based on test performance at initial assessment as
well as growth in language skills over time.19,20,21,22,23 Although
poorer performance on language or phonological measures
cannot predict that a given child will or will not recover without
intervention, presence of a frank concomitant disorder or less
than average performance in areas of communication develop-
ment other than fluency may be used to counsel parents on the
advisability of intervention, rather than continuing to wait for
the child to outgrow either the stuttering or additional lags in
speech and language.
13.3.2 Diﬀerential Diagnosis
It is our clinical experience that many clinicians encounter
children who they feel are excessively disfluent and may
stutter; however, they are unsure. The research literature
increasingly documents why making decisions in these cases
may be challenging. We now know that children with histor-
ies of language delay or diagnoses of language impairment
may in fact display elevated rates of disfluency, including
general categories of disfluency often grouped under the
rubric of "stutterlike disfluency" (SLD).24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31 The
primary behavior seen in many reports is an elevated rate of
whole- or part-word disfluency.
Similarly, bilingual children may demonstrate elevated levels
of SLDs. Although some of these children undoubtedly stutter
(see recent review by Choo and Smith32), not all children do—
many simply show elevated rates of behaviors that overlap
Language and Phonological Considerations
216

between stuttering and typical disfluency.33,34,35,36 This pattern
is far from universal.37 In fact, typically fluent children who
speak a language other than English may have rates of disflu-
ency, including SLDs, that exceed conventional thresholds typi-
cally reported by studies that have tracked English-speaking
children. The reader is referred to ▶Chapter 14 for more on
stuttering and bilingual considerations.
How is the clinician to distinguish between elevated rates of
disfluency and "stuttering"? In our experience, when children
with language delay/disorder or bilingual children, particularly
those who are older, arouse concern due to the number of
disfluent episodes seen in their speech samples, two classical
components of stuttering are often not observed. As noted in
other places in this text, stuttering is somewhat unique among
childhood communication disorders because of its tripartite
constellation of aﬀect, behavior, and cognition, the so-called
ABCs of stuttering (see ▶Chapter 1). Bilingual children show, in
our experience, only one of these: behavior. The other two are
rarely in evidence. The first of these is that moments of stutter-
ing lack the tension, struggle, or awareness that characterize
the speech of children who stutter, features that cross with the
quality of behavior, but also intersect with the aﬀective qual-
ities seen in stuttering. The second is that these children do not
seem to have a self-concept of speaking diﬃculty that we typi-
cally assign to the cognitive features of stuttering.
We do not believe that it is trivial to presume that a child
stutters when in fact they merely experience fluency break-
down more often than a peer judged to be typically fluent.
Disfluency in this population is likely to arise from the child's
diﬃculty in encoding language targets. In some cases, disflu-
ency in bilingual children can even be an indication of attrition
in language proficiency (of the heritage language when in a
diﬀerent majority language setting).38 Therapies for stuttering
have diﬀerent underlying premises and goals than what is
required if disfluency is the natural by-product of a less proficient
expressive language system.
13.3.3 Profiles of "Atypical" Disfluency
Some children and adults present with disfluencies that aﬀect
the medial and final parts of words (e.g., "like -ike -ike"), and
these are referred to as "atypical disfluencies."39 These disfluen-
cies have primarily been described in case reports. In most cases,
the individuals presenting with atypical disfluencies have neuro-
developmental or acquired disorders including autism spectrum
disorders,39,40 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,41 brain
trauma,42,43 reading disability,41,43 and language and articulation
disorders.43 Interestingly, though, of the two school-age children
with atypical disfluencies described by McAllister and Kingston,44
one had no neurodevelopmental or acquired conditions and the
other had only a history of stuttering that had resolved.
As with the elevated disfluency levels that can be associated
with typical bilingual language development, consideration of
the cognitive and aﬀective features associated with atypical
disfluencies seems to indicate that these disfluencies are not a
type of stuttering. Children and adults presenting with these
atypical disfluencies may not be aware of them,39,43,44 which
clearly contrasts with the typical presentation of stuttering,
especially in older individuals. Further, these disfluencies
also are not reported to be associated with increased muscle
tension.40,43,44,45 Although atypical disfluency lacks at least two
hallmark features of stuttering, such behaviors have responded
to traditional stuttering modification therapy that begins with
work in identifying the moments in which atypical disfluencies
are produced.39
13.4 Treatment Options
13.4.1 Principles of Evidence-Based
Practice and Practice-Based Evidence
Because so few studies have been done to evaluate how best to
treat the child who stutters who has a concomitant articula-
tory/phonological or language disorder, and because each child
will inevitably present with his or her own unique mix of
strengths and needs, we would like to preface this section with
a few reminders about the importance, not only of principles of
evidence-based practice (EBP) but also of those of practice-
based evidence (PBE).
To remind, EBP combines the best available published evi-
dence with clinical expertise and patient/client preferences or
specifics.46 PBE, in contrast, gathers data on treatments and
outcomes in routine service settings.47 Readers should be mind-
ful that the highest ranked "evidence" in EBP is the randomized
clinical trial, which typically strives to examine uncomplicated
clinical cases and tends to eliminate participants with concomi-
tant problems48—the topic of this chapter. Thus, in this context,
PBE can be very valuable.
We acknowledge at the outset that little empirical evidence
exists to guide the clinician in working with a child who stut-
ters who has concomitant clinical needs in phonology, lan-
guage, or in any other aspect of communication (e.g., a child
who stutters with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, or intellectual deficiency). One cannot
go to Google Scholar to determine what the best approach is
for a 4-year-old who stutters, has numerous phonological
processes, and has poor development of phrase structure in
spoken language. To the extent that a clinician finds that their
caseload in a public school setting, for example, tends to have
multiple
parallel
individualized
educational
plan
needs
across diﬀerent areas of communication (e.g., fluency, pho-
nology, language), results of intervention with this particular
caseload may be more informative than numerous reports of
therapy eﬀectiveness that were conducted using less complex
child client profiles. Let us take another example. One of the
most widely published interventions for young children who
stutter is the Lidcombe Program.49 To date, it has been modi-
fied in many ways, including telehealth versions.50,51 How-
ever, the program requires substantive parental training,
understanding, and commitment. How might this therapy (or
any other therapy) fare when the parent is not available for
training, unwilling, or otherwise not able to provide the daily
sessions? This is when the clinician's local success in modify-
ing the program to suit population- or setting-specific needs
is very important in monitoring progress (or lack thereof)
and adjusting therapy goals and methods to suit individual
children. This is the heart of PBE, which is sensitive to demo-
graphics, limitations, or advantages of specific groups of
children or specific settings.

217

13.4.2 Monitoring Outcomes
In the absence of empirical outcome or eﬃcacy data, we can
apply knowledge gleaned from basic research studies to construct
and test our selection of therapy targets, their ordering, and other
aspects of our approach to treatment. However, it sometimes
appears that the final stage of both EBP and PBE is under-applied
(see the "hub" in ▶Fig. 13.1 and Step 5 in ▶Fig. 13.2). This step
requires us to evaluate the outcome of the treatment plan on the
patient's behaviors. Even in published therapy outcome reports,
close inspection of individual data can sometimes cause concern:
in one report of a popular preschool treatment for stuttering, at
least two children's treatment was not shifted to an alternative
option after more than 90 weeks with no discernable progress.52
That means that a single, manualized approach to treatment was
employed for almost 2 years without clear evidence of a child's
response to the desired criterion. The take-home message we
want to convey is that even well-documented, evidence-based
treatment approaches that work well for many children may not
work well for an individual child. The clinician should not pre-
sume treatment eﬀectiveness; clinicians should document prog-
ress flowing from their treatment decisions. If progress is not
seen, treatment decisions need to be reconsidered. This may in-
volve changing general approaches (e.g., whether one decides to
use

apy), treatment goals, goal ordering, or activities. The evidence
seen in the monitoring of client progress (or lack of progress) is
more valuable than that reported for groups of children in a pub-
lished article. How long might one wait before deciding that an

Language and Phonological Considerations
218

approach might not be appropriate for a particular child? As one
possible strategy, we note that many reports of therapeutic
change when using a program such as Lidcombe, for example,
show rapid response to treatment from baseline status, often
within a few weeks of therapy initiation. We suggest that a rule of
thumb might be a few months (perhaps as long as 6 months), and
then reevaluating why the child is not responding as anticipated.
"Even well-documented, evidence-based treatment approaches
that work well for many children may not work well for an
individual child."
Particularly when managing complex cases, the clinician may
wish to view some therapy plans in the same way as we employ
diagnostic teaching to appraise the client's response before
committing to a long-term hierarchy of therapy activities. A
suggested sequence of planning is as follows:
●Use the available literature to decide how much "interference"
there might be between two areas of therapy need in a single
client. Concretely, if working with a child who has an
articulation disorder and also stutters, one might begin with
a premise that can be drawn from the literature to date: that
initial attempts at new phonological targets is unlikely to
aggravate the child's fluency over and above its typical
profile. Little evidence suggests a direct relationship between
moments of fluency breakdown and children's
misarticulations or phonological targets, although there may
be an additional weight of phonetic complexity on speech
production in children who stutter who also have a language
disorder. In contrast, as noted in this chapter and others in
this text, there is fairly strong evidence of the impacts of
language targets on children's fluency and stuttering.
●Consider possible "contradictory messages" in how therapy
goals or targets are framed. Thus, we might also think
carefully about principles of articulation therapy or how we
often see it applied in practice. For instance, as noted by Wolk
and others,56,57 and discussed further in the next section of
this chapter, while one might overarticulate a therapy target
to help the child focus on the task (e.g., full loud release of a
word-final consonant, or prolongation of a sibilant in a
complex cluster), such a "cue" might contrast with a potential
fluency-shaping goal to use light articulatory contacts.58,59,60
●Be clear (for ourselves, and for the child's benefit) about what
constitutes a successful response. We should clarify for
ourselves and for the child what will be reinforced and
rewarded in activities. Although it may seem straightforward,
clinicians should be clear about what sorts of behaviors meet
specific therapy goals. For instance, if one is working on
inclusion of a grammatical marker or rectifying a sound
substitution, the fluency of the response should be irrelevant.
Conversely, if one is practicing speaking rate or soft contacts,
we reinforce how well the child achieves those targets, rather
than whether the child's utterance is grammatical, properly
articulated, or even fluent. In our experience, this basic
premise is sometimes diﬃcult for families to understand, if
homework will be assigned or recommended. In this sense,
not every error is an opportunity to learn, much as it might
seem so. For a child with multiple communication needs, it is
not reasonable to expect progress across multiple aspects of
communication simultaneously.
●See what the child's responses suggest about the ways in which
the child's two areas of need may interact. In other words, be
prepared to change initial assumptions. Even highly eﬀective
evidence-based interventions in our field, or in medicine or
education, do not work equally well for everyone. Probably
every reader of this book has experienced a so-called
paradoxical reaction to something—a response that is not
predicted to impact most people, but which can aﬀect an
individual. Let us go back to the premise that articulation goals
will not necessarily impact fluency in an individual child. What
if this turns out not to be the case? We could try a diﬀerent
articulation target to see if working on this goal diminishes the
disfluency. Sasisekaran9 suggests other approaches to easing the
communicative load for a child whose fluency appears stressed
by phonological processing load. If we continue to see that
complex phonological targets disrupt fluency for a child, this is
a sign that managing both sets of demands is challenging. We
should then be sure that for fluency "exercises," care might be
taken to load activities with targets that the child is more easily
able to articulate well. Language seems to have a wider
literature suggesting possible interactions between domains.
We might presume at the onset that fluency targets, activities,
or goals be practiced first in elicited contexts that fall
comfortably within the child's expressive language skills. Only
as the child masters such skills in carefully scaﬀolded and
supported environments might we practice generalization to
more diﬃcult language targets, or unstructured spontaneous
conversation.
None of this adjustment to a child's therapy planning will work
well without active monitoring of possible ways in which goals
interact. EBP requires adjustment around the client's responses
to well-conceptualized therapy choices.
13.4.3 Therapeutic Approaches
The following section describes processes of treatment for the
child who stutters with language and/or phonology concerns.
Broadly speaking, structural models designed to assist in
targeting priority therapy goals for fluency and language and
phonology have included sequential, concurrent, and cyclic
approaches (see ▶Fig. 13.3 for illustration of considerations in
deciding on a treatment approach).59,60 We define sequential
treatment of children with concomitant disorders as a therapy
plan that targets remediation of one of the disorders ahead
of the other(s). In other words, a clinician might decide to
directly work on a child's articulation until better intelligibility
has been achieved before direct work on fluency. In the interim,
the clinician might counsel parents on indirect strategies to use
when dealing with the child's fluency in the home environment.
Obviously, an advantage of such an approach is that goals that
might conflict or interact with one another do not; on the other
hand, it might delay work on one of the child's areas of needs
indefinitely. In the case of a child with language impairment,
since areas of need are typically wide and almost limitless, this
could defer work on fluency for quite some time.
"The session structure for targeting fluency and language and
phonology goals includes sequential, concurrent, and cyclic
approaches."
13.4 Treatment Options
219

We define concurrent treatment as working with the child's
multiple areas of need more or less in parallel. This might mean
dividing therapy sessions into portions that each deal with an
aspect of the child's fluency, language, or articulation needs. It
might even involve a single activity that combines aspects of
therapy goals for two areas of the child's needs, as one of the
case studies below illustrates.
The third option that we describe in some detail, cyclic treat-
ment, combines aspects of concurrent treatment, but defines a
set period of time for work on goals before progressing to next
goals on the child's long-term plan. After a predetermined
period of time, the original goals are reassessed, and work
continues if the child has not progressed to mastery. In the
interim, the clinician relies on the impetus of initial work on
the goal to aid the child to generalize outside the therapy
room. We illustrate a cycles approach in detail in ▶Fig. 13.4.
Sequential Approach
Treatment programs using a sequential approach start by iden-
tifying the more significant need area and treating it directly
until mastery occurs before moving on to the other areas.
Criticism of such an approach, particularly when used with
children who stutter, includes the potential for untargeted areas
to worsen or end up never being addressed.59 This is especially
true for children diagnosed with a primary language impair-
ment, as research suggests that these children may never fully
catch up to unaﬀected peers,17 and one can potentially work
on numerous language goals for long periods of time without
reaching a point where the language "problem" appears suﬃ-
ciently addressed to the point that it no longer merits thera-
peutic attention. Box 13.1 presents a case study involving a
sequential approach to treatment.

Language and Phonological Considerations
220

Box 13.1 Case Study: Fluency, Language, and Phonology Treatment (Sequential Approach)
You are a speech-language pathologist (SLP) working at an outpatient pediatric speech department at a hospital. You have received a
case history form for an upcoming evaluation, along with the child's most recent speech-language assessment (from 18 months ago),
and a speech-language progress report (from 6 months ago). The client is a 12.11-year-old boy named Quinn who recently moved to
your area with his family; his progress report was written to provide an update on his progress before his move. He was receiving
speech therapy until he moved 6 months ago, and goals on his discharge summary indicate that he was working on (1) accurate
production of /r/, (2) narrative organization, and (3) reduction in stuttering with a stuttering modification approach. Quinn's previous
SLP recommended continued treatment with work in these goal areas. The case history form was completed by Quinn's mother and
the goal areas indicated on his progress report matched his mother's major concerns.
Quinn's most recent speech-language evaluation is outdated, and he presents with a complex profile, so you plan to conduct a
comprehensive assessment. You know that you will have to collect information about the impact of the communicative weaknesses on
Quinn's life from Quinn himself, a parent, and with parent permission: (1) at least one of his current teachers at his current parochial
school, who have known him for 6 months and (2) his previous SLP.
Given the complexity of Quinn's profile, you know that this assessment will be lengthy and may require more than the typically
allotted 2 hours. You plan the following test battery:
●Stuttering:
- Stuttering Severity Instrument, Fourth Edition (SSI-4).61
- Overall Assessment of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering-School Age (OASES-S).62
●Language:
- Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-5 (CELF-5), Core Language Battery.69
- CELF-5 Structured Writing.63
- CELF-5 Reading Comprehension.63
- Test of Narrative Language-2 (TNL-2).64
- Expository discourse sample, using the Favorite Game or Sport Task and analyzed with the expository scoring scheme.65
●Articulation/phonology:
- Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation-3 (GFTA-3).66
- Speech sample with relational analysis, using TNL-2 narrative samples.
●Related:
- Informal structural functional examination.
- Hearing screening if Quinn has not passed a recent one.
After you have completed testing and interviewed Quinn, his mother, and his English/language arts teacher, a summary of your im-
pressions is as follows. Quinn presents with overtly mild stuttering characterized primarily by fleeting part-word repetitions and prolon-
gations, sometimes accompanied by eye blinking. Based on your structured life impact measure (the OASES-S) and client, parent, and
teacher interviews, Quinn's stuttering has a moderate adverse life impact, characterized by fear of moments of stuttering, use of word
substitutions to avoid stuttering, avoidance of oral class participation, and deferral to his parents to speak around new people (e.g.,
when ordering in a restaurant). He has made two good friends since moving and is reportedly comfortable speaking around these
friends and his family members.
Results of articulation and language testing were consistent with the areas of need in his most recent speech-language evaluation.
He presented with errors on /r/ in all word positions, at both the single-word level and in connected discourse, and also indicated that
he wanted to learn to say /r/ so that he would sound more like his peers. All spoken and written language skills were average to above
average except for narrative organization. Mild to moderate diﬃculty with narrative organization was apparent in the fictional expres-
sive narratives that are part of the TNL-2 and in the expository narrative sample. These weaknesses were not identified in Quinn's writ-
ing, possibly due to the slower pace of writing compared to speaking and more opportunities for preplanning. Still, given his expressive
language weaknesses, you will discuss narrative organization with his English/language arts teacher so that he or she can communicate
with his team, and encourage him or her to contact you if concerns about written organization arise.
Because Quinn attends parochial school and his parents are not interested in pursuing speech-language services through his public
school district, you recommend twice weekly private speech-language therapy to target (1) decreasing avoidance behaviors and cogni-
tive reactions related to stuttering, (2) increasing his ability to use a stuttering modification approach when he desires, (3) increasing
organization of expository and fictional narratives, and (4) increasing accuracy of /r/ production.
You adopt a sequential approach, meaning that you will address targets sequentially during your sessions. You believe that balancing
stuttering therapy and narrative organization with this approach will be manageable, and your greater concern is addressing Quinn's
residual articulation disorder while avoiding hard articulatory contacts and overarticulation. He had made some progress on /r/ produc-
tion and was able to produce /r/ in the word-initial position at the word level, per his progress note, but seems to have lost all progress
made on /r/ during his 6 months out of therapy. You therefore decide to (1) ask Quinn's previous SLP for tips on which strategies
were eﬀective in eliciting /r/ and (2) pay close attention to the /r/ models that Quinn will be hearing—you will be careful to use
light articulatory contacts and avoid overarticulating with your models and coach Quinn and his mother, who will provide models and
feedback during home practice, to do the same.
13.4 Treatment Options
221

Concurrent Approach
A concurrent approach aims to address multiple areas of need
within a therapy plan, although the structure of the approach
may include combinations of direct and indirect treatment, or
segments of individual sessions being devoted to diﬀerent areas
(see Box 13.3 later in the chapter for an example). When planning
this type of approach, the clinician must examine the eﬀects of
directly treating one area (e.g., phonology) on the other area(s) of
need (e.g., fluency). In some cases, targeting a particular phono-
logical item, process, or linguistic structure may lead to increased
tension and exacerbate stuttering behavior. Conversely, direct at-
tention to specific fluency strategies without maintaining support
for language may inadvertently reinforce the use of reduced lan-
guage by the child and set the stage for limited linguistic growth.
Cyclic Approach
Finally, a cyclic approach (patterned after the successful cycles
approach to phonological intervention by Hodson and Paden67)
can be applied to the treatment of concomitant disorders in stut-
tering (see Box 13.4 later in the chapter for an example). In this
approach, a schedule is set up whereby each area of need receives
direct intervention in its own cycle, which is alternated with other
cycles targeting the other areas of need individually. What makes
the cycles approach unique is that the clinician works on a skill or
a series of skills for a predetermined period of time, rather than to
a predetermined level of accuracy. For example, the clinician may
decide that a set of goals will be worked on during a cycle consist-
ing of eight sessions, after which some goals will be dropped and
others added, regardless of the child's progress toward mastery of
selected targets. A primary principle of this approach is that
recently learned concepts will generalize outside of direct instruc-
tion and practice sessions, even during cycles addressing diﬀerent
targets. A graphic illustration of a potential cycles approach with a
child having fluency, articulation, and language goals is shown in
▶Fig. 13.4. As shown, the program includes returning to prior
targets to assess possible generalization toward desired treatment
outcomes, or to reestablish behaviors and bolster learning, should
that be necessary. If the child has consolidated some learning
toward mastery of a particular therapy goal in the interim, then
the clinician can select new goals from the child's areas of need.
13.4.4 Linguistic Context
Addressing stuttering in young children requires careful analy-
sis of the linguistic context in which fluency and communica-
tion strategies are embedded. In addition to consideration of
the phonologic, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic characteris-
tics of therapeutic activities and techniques, the clinician must
continually examine and reexamine language production skills,
the potential for tradeoﬀs between various developmental
domains that may be competing for resources, and whether or
not targeted strategies are serving to advance fluency develop-
ment. It is recommended that the clinician use a philosophy of
"communicative eﬀectiveness" while determining priority goals
for a child who stutters with language and/or phonology
deficits. Importantly, intelligibility in speech and language pro-
duction includes managing speech rate, phonological accuracy,
lexical retrieval, language formulation, and pragmatic demands,
as well as incorporating strategies to reduce tension. Following
the determination of an overall approach (i.e., addressing indi-
vidual components sequentially or concurrently), the clinician
must structure the linguistic context. Standard practice is to
implement hierarchies for teaching new skills and reinforcing
mastery of old skills. Hence, the introduction of fluency-
facilitating strategies is done within the context of established
linguistic constructions. Once new fluency behaviors, such as
reduced speaking rate and easy starts, have been introduced,
they can be practiced in many diﬀerent linguistic contexts,
which can be modified to help a youngster learn language con-
cepts without having to formulate or draw on linguistic skills
not yet acquired. For example, the use of carrier phrases with
words from diﬀerent categories can help with practicing fluent
speech while learning basic concepts (Box 13.2). As the child
gains success with the fluency strategies, additional language
targets can be introduced and practiced.
"Addressing stuttering in young children requires careful analysis
of the linguistic context in which fluency and communication
strategies are embedded."

13.4.5 Treating Concomitant Stuttering
and Phonology
Evidence-based protocols for treating concomitant stuttering
and phonology are yet to be developed. At present, debate con-
tinues as to whether children who stutter are at greater risk of
phonological impairment,9 and yet, it is clear that such children
do show up on clinician's caseloads.2,3,4,5,6 Consequently, best
practice principles are based primarily on the recommendations
of experienced professionals. The most comprehensive model for
addressing phonology in children who stutter is based on the
work of Wolk and colleagues.56,57 According to this model, pho-
nology is best addressed indirectly in children who stutter to
minimize the potential for exacerbating stuttering because of
heightened pressure and tension in speech production, which
occurs as children attempt to achieve correct sound production.
The resulting approach involves directly targeting fluency using
techniques such as speech rate reduction, prolonged speech tech-
niques, and light articulatory contacts; teaching children about
and modeling contrasts (e.g., diﬀerences between stops and frica-
tives, or between tense and loose); incorporating parent involve-
ment; and using group therapy settings. Box 13.3 presents a case
example of the treatment of concomitant stuttering and phono-
logical impairment in the context of a concurrent approach.
"Children who stutter with phonological impairment do show up
on clinician's caseloads."
Language and Phonological Considerations
222

Box 13.3 Case Study: Stuttering and Phonological Impairment (Concurrent Approach)
You are the SLP at a special education preschool and have been contacted about a 3.6-year-old boy named Kaden. His parents bring
him in for an assessment because they are concerned that he is stuttering. When you approach the family to walk them to the
assessment room, you hear Kaden talking to his dad, and notice that you understand very little of his speech.
When you enter the assessment room, you ask Kaden to play with his mom while you speak with his dad to collect case history
information. You intermittently stop and listen to Kaden's speech. You hear part-word repetitions with one to two extra iterations and
brief prolongations. You estimate that his speech is about 25% intelligible. Given this presentation, you plan to complete a comprehen-
sive battery in the 2 hours you have for the assessment. Because you know that your time with the family is limited, you make sure to
record a speech and language sample. You know that spending about 20 minutes collecting a speech and language sample for later
analysis is eﬃcient, as you can use the sample to obtain information about three key areas: articulation, language, and fluency.

In the parent interview, you collect information about Kaden's speech-language and developmental history, risk factors related to
persistent stuttering, and his parents' concerns about his communication and view of his communicative strengths. You also find out
that Kaden recently passed a hearing screening at his pediatrician's oﬃce.
Highlights from your assessment:
●Structural functional examination results were within normal limits.
●Articulation skills were at the 1st percentile for his age, per the GFTA-3. He demonstrated fronting, stopping, cluster reduction,
prevocalic voicing, liquid gliding, and final consonant deletion.
●KiddyCAT results indicated generally positive communicative attitudes, but some perception of talking being diﬃcult.
●SSI-4 results indicated that Kaden stuttered on 4% of syllables, with mean duration of his longest three moments measured at about
0.5 seconds, with no concomitant behaviors. This corresponds to the mild stuttering range.
●CELF-P2 receptive language and expressive language indices were both within the average range.
●Computation of MLU, Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn), Developmental Sentence Scoring (DSS), and other language sampling
measures was not possible because Kaden only produced 43 fully intelligible utterances in the 20-minute sample (out of 155 total
utterances). Further, you were concerned that MLU computed based on fully intelligible utterances would be deflated and inaccurately
represent his abilities, as it was Kaden's longer utterances that were more likely to be unintelligible. Using the entire 155-utterance
sample, you heard production of present progressive -ing, on, in, irregular past tense (e.g., went), uncontractible copula, articles a and
the, third person irregular (e.g., has), and the uncontractible auxiliary. You did not hear possessive -s, regular past tense -ed, third person
singular -s, contractible copula, or contractible auxiliary—all morphemes that may be impacted by his articulation skills.
●Parent interview: You found that Kaden lives with his mother, father, older brother (5.5 years old), and younger sister (1.1 years old).
His stuttering began when he was 3.4 years old, which means that he has been stuttering for 2 months. He and his brother compete
for talking time. Review of his case revealed both risk factors for persistent stuttering (male sex, speech sound disorder) and positive
prognostic indicators (negative family history of persistent stuttering, onset before turning 4, <6 months since onset, and average
language skills).
A summary of your impressions is that Kaden presents with a severe phonological disorder, mild stuttering, and age-appropriate
language skills, though his expressive skills were diﬃcult to assess given the severity of his phonological disorder. Although stuttering
was the concern that brought him to you, his poor phonological skills are having a far greater impact on his communicative success
than his mild stuttering, which is accompanied by generally positive communicative attitudes. Given this presentation, you recommend
direct therapy focusing on suppression of phonological processes, accompanied by parent counseling to address stuttering.
Based on this assessment, you recommend a concurrent approach. Phonological skills will be addressed with direct therapy, with
initial goals targeting final consonant deletion and prevocalic voicing, as these syllable-level processes were judged to have the most
substantial impact on intelligibility. Additionally, final consonant deletion made it diﬃcult for Kaden to produce age-appropriate
morphemes. For instance, one initial phonological goal may be the following:
Kaden will produce final singleton consonants in one- and two-syllable words, at the single-word level, in 80% of opportunities across
three consecutive sessions.
You will be careful to use light articulatory contacts in your models and avoid over-articulation and full release of stop consonants;
you will coach Kaden's parents to do the same.

13.4 Treatment Options
223

Indirect parent therapy will begin with counseling and education and may address the advice below. Your goals will be adjusted as
you get to know the family and their routines and specific needs better over time.
●Allow turn-taking, and permit Kaden (and all siblings) to have suﬃcient "floor" time to express what they would like to.
●Establish 10 minutes of one-on-one protected talking time every day, for Kaden and one of his parents (this can be done with his
siblings as well).
●Continue to support the development of positive attitudes toward communication.
●Adult models of slower, easier speech.
●Ensure that the parents understand that it is okay to acknowledge Kaden's stuttering.
●Monitor Kaden's stuttering and attitudes toward speaking over time.
Kaden's phonological repertoire is currently so limited that the relationship between stuttering and phonology is diﬃcult to assess. As
his phonological skills improve, this relationship should be monitored.
13.4.6 Treating Concomitant Stuttering
and Language
As indicated in our discussion of assessment considerations,
determining a profile of linguistic skills and how stuttering
behavior is related to those skills will help in identifying ther-
apeutic priorities for children with concomitant stuttering and
language. A hierarchy of language targets should be developed
in concert with fluency targets. According to Hall, fluency
treatment may be introduced in the context of reduced
linguistic demand to establish new speaking behaviors, such
as reduced speaking rate and easy starts.73 That said, once
established, it is best to introduce new language behaviors
while supporting fluency through the use of routine speaking
tasks and practiced structures (e.g., carrier phrases). To
expand a youngster's morphosyntactic repertoire while
simultaneously managing fluency, the clinician will need to
take advantage of times when speech is reasonably fluent.
Likely, with certain fluency-facilitating behaviors having
been established, there will be periods in which the child is
relatively fluent, and linguistic targets can be addressed
directly. See Box 13.4 for a case example of stuttering and
language impairment in the context of a hybrid approach
involving cycles principles in conjunction with occasional
concurrent targets.
"A hierarchy of language targets should be developed in concert
with fluency targets."
Box 13.4 Case Study: Stuttering and Language Impairment (Concurrent and Cycles Approach)
You are a private practice SLP and have been working twice a week with Ethan, a 3.11-year-old boy with a receptive-expressive
language disorder. You have been treating him since he was 3.4 years old, at which time his language skills were approximately at the
2.5-year-old level. Receptive language goals have included increasing comprehension of wh-questions and directions containing
multiple steps, as well as sentences with increasingly advanced concepts and syntax. Expressive goals have targeted production of
sentences containing basic concepts such as spatial terms, use of the copula and auxiliary, production of the irregular past tense, and
production of more complex wh-question types such as why, how, and when.
Over a period of several weeks, it has become apparent to you and Ethan's mother, who brings her son to his sessions, that he has
begun to stutter. He primarily produces repetitions but also produces sound prolongations and blocks. You already have information
about his language profile and will update this information with formal testing when he is 4.4 years old, after 1 year of therapy. To
gather information about Ethan's stuttering, you complete the SSI-4,61 which indicates moderate stuttering. You judge his language
skills to be insuﬃcient for completion of a formal attitudes measure, so you informally interview Ethan instead and continue to discuss
his reactions to stuttering with his mother. He stomps his feet during moments of stuttering. His mom reports additional signs of
frustration occurring at home, including crying, shouting, and "shutting down" during periods of increased stuttering. He has several
risk factors for persistent stuttering, including male sex, and below-average language skills.
You know that addressing Ethan's language skills is still important because (1) he is still about 6 months behind age expectations
and (2) greater language growth is related to greater likelihood of recovery from stuttering.19 However, you also feel that immediately
addressing Ethan's stuttering is important because of his frustration and that it should take precedence over his language skills for the
first few weeks. You adopt a hybrid concurrent and cycles approach. You begin with modeling easy speech in person and include a
substantial parent counseling component focused on environmental modifications. Your first aim is to decrease Ethan's frustration with
his speech, as you feel that expressive language therapy will be less eﬀective until this is achieved. Thus, you plan to spend several
weeks on fluency exclusively. After you have decreased Ethan's frustration level, you will return to language therapy and adopt a
concurrent approach. During all phases of treatment, you use language targets that are already in Ethan's repertoire when modeling
fluency behaviors. You will use periods when Ethan is more fluent and less frustrated to implement direct language therapy. You will
also increase your parent counseling component for language and teach Ethan's mother to increase modeling and recasting with
language targets.
Language and Phonological Considerations

13.5 Conclusions
Treatment outcome studies, whether in stuttering or other
conditions, tend to focus on the responses of groups to specific
treatment approaches. Not infrequently, children with concom-
itant disorders are not included in either basic research studies
or treatment outcome reports. When included, it is often diﬃ-
cult to ascertain what impact other communication diﬃculties
might have had on the child's therapeutic progress.
In the real world, particularly if children who stutter are thor-
oughly evaluated, we can expect a proportion of children who
stutter on any caseload to require additional goals that involve
language, articulation/phonology, or both. Although specific
published guidance in working with these children is still scant,
we believe that clinicians who have an understanding of com-
monly observed interactions between fluency and certain task
demands, who carefully monitor the child's response to therapy
planning decisions, and who are willing to adjust therapy goals
or approaches in response can assist these children in making
progress toward multiple communicative goals.

14 Bilingual and Multicultural Considerations
Courtney Byrd, Kia Noelle Johnson, and Julie Fortier-Blanc
Abstract
In this chapter, we explore the relationship between typically
fluent speech and stuttering in both mono- and multilingual
individuals. General information and characteristics regarding
bilingualism will be presented along with the inherent diﬃcul-
ties encountered when using English monolingual guidelines for
assessing stuttering in bilingual speakers. Suggestions are made
to help clinicians accurately diagnose those who do stutter.
Treatment issues with bilingual populations will be discussed
including ways to better adapt our intervention with these
speakers. We take into account multicultural considerations and
how best to incorporate them when assessing and treating
culturally diverse children and adults. Together, these learning
outcomes will ensure that you are equipped to provide quality
care to persons who stutter from culturally and linguistically
diverse (CLD) backgrounds.
Keywords: stuttering, bilingualism, bilingual, multilingualism,
multilingual, multicultural, assessment, treatment
14.1 Introduction
Stuttering is a multifactorial speech disorder that is present in
speakers of all languages and cultures. Although we may per-
ceive that a person stutters when they speak Spanish, French,
or another language, there are some unique challenges that the
speech-language pathologist faces when working with bilingual
individuals. In particular, speech disfluencies are more frequent
when facing linguistic uncertainty, for example, when trying to
retrieve the right word or sentence structure to express a thought
or idea, and bilinguals are more likely to face this uncertainty giv-
en that they are navigating between languages. This may result in
an increase in the production of both typical speech disfluencies
and those considered to be stuttering-like, thus compromising
the accurate diagnosis of stuttering in bilingual speakers.1
The purpose of this chapter is to explore the dimensions of
stuttering that are unique to the ever-growing population of
bilingual and multicultural speakers. In the follow sections, we
examine the diﬃculties encountered when distinguishing stut-
tering from the disfluent speech often produced by speakers of
more than one language. Before launching into the focus of the
chapter, we will first describe basic concepts and key terms to
provide a framework, and give some general knowledge regard-
ing bilingualism.
14.1.1 Basic Concepts
For the purpose of this chapter, we will consider bilingualism as
the regular use of two or more languages in daily life.2 We need
to keep in mind that bilingualism is on a continuum and that
bilingual speakers are not simply two monolingual speakers in
one person. Why? Because to diﬀering degrees, their knowl-
edge, exposure, and use of a language are actually spread across
their two languages.
When bilingual speakers are described as being dominant in
one language, it means that they have more advanced skills in
that language than they do in the other. As such, they can read,
write, and speak more proficiently in their dominant as
opposed to their nondominant language. Bilinguals can also be
described as balanced bilinguals, meaning they have relatively
equal skills in each of the languages they speak.
Another term that is inherent to bilingualism is linguistic
uncertainty. A speaker whose linguistic knowledge is comprised
of more than one language will have higher linguistic uncer-
tainty. On the one hand, they may have less knowledge in the
language they are using to express themselves while also hav-
ing more options for what they want to say and how they could
say it, given that their overall language abilities are broader and
more complex.
Over the last 40 years, the rate of bilingualism has doubled,

languages; a rate that is projected to double in the next four
decades. Thus, in the years ahead, the United States (U.S.) bilin-
gual population will be more comparable to that of traditionally
bilingual populations, where at least 40% of the population
speaks a second language. Immigration is one factor that has
contributed to this rise, in addition to the relearning of other
languages, and the increase in dual language immersion pro-
grams. That said, the United States' consideration of mandating
English as the national language in addition to some states
adopting English as the oﬃcial language may have kept the
country's bilingual population lower than that of other countries.
In fact, until the last two decades, families that immigrated to
the United States focused on learning English and adapting to
American culture resulting in the loss of their native languages
and culture.
Countries such as Canada have two oﬃcial languages and
some, such as Belgium and Switzerland, have three. Canada, as
with other countries, has legislation that governs the use of
languages in schools, commerce, and places of work. Thus, the
importance of bilingualism is likely to be very diﬀerent and
more complex in other countries than it is in the United States.
The laws of a country are sometimes written to protect a
language and a culture. For example, in the Canadian province
of Quebec there is legislation stating that French is the oﬃcial
language. This has helped preserve the French language and
culture from slowly disappearing among the largely English-
speaking population of North America. There is also federal
legislation being written to preserve the rights of French-
speaking residents outside of Quebec. These laws will guarantee
access to judicial services in French, and encourage bilingualism
in both French and English throughout the country. The
Canadian census survey that is taken every 4 years includes a
large number of questions relating to the status of languages
and bilingualism in the country. This information helps the
government assess how the issues surrounding languages and
bilingualism are evolving over time, and plays a role in adjusting
linguistic policies. The issues surrounding bi- and multilingual-
ism are complex and often associated with highly emotional
points of view that are at times diﬃcult to resolve.
227

It is interesting to note that a bilingual speaker is able to use
only one (codes) language when talking with a monolingual
speaker, but will easily alternate between two languages during
a conversation with another bilingual person who speaks the
same two languages. This is referred to as code-switching,
wherein speakers will use the word or sentence structure or
expression in the language that comes to mind first, as it is less
cognitively demanding and thus easier and faster to communi-
cate. Therefore, when you listen to bilingual speakers talking
together, you might often hear them saying part of a sentence
or word in one language and the rest of the sentence in another
language, alternating between languages as they speak.
Culture includes race, religion, and ethnicity, amongst other
factors and is reflected in one's values and the way one thinks,
communicates, and interacts. Whereas bilingualism is defined
as a speaker of two languages, multiculturalism is defined as a
person belonging to more than one culture coexisting together.
Although monolingual speakers can be influenced by more than
one culture, it is likely that multiple cultures influence the daily
communication of bilingual speakers. The distinctions in these
influences should be taken into account when completing our
assessment and when developing individual treatment plans. It
is important to understand that for children to connect with
their families, they need to be able to speak the languages of
their household. This means that any recommendation to speak
one language exclusively—for example, English—may be detri-
mental to the child's connection with their community. For
every individual we assess, we must consider the parts that
contribute to the person as a whole.
Finally, in many countries worldwide, including the United
States, there are speakers who speak more than two languages
and, thus, are considered to be multilingual. However, the infor-
mation in this chapter will largely focus on bilinguals, as the
vast majority of the limited research completed to date has
focused on this area. Nevertheless, readers should assume that
the factors discussed in the present chapter will likely apply to
multilinguals as well.
14.2 Speech, Language, and
Fluency in Bilingual Speakers
Although it is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss speech
and language development in bi- and multilingual populations,
there are interesting findings that highlight the uniqueness of
these speakers. Clinicians commonly report diﬃculties determin-
ing whether children who speak more than one language
present with a communication disorder or a diﬀerence.3,4 Bilin-
gual children sometimes speak less and are not as grammatically
accurate as monolingual speakers. This is a direct result of the
complexity of navigating more than one language, and this
diﬀerence in the acquisition and use of a language is often
misinterpreted as a disorder.5 In fact, researchers have since
learned that this "silent period" is not representative of a
deficit, but instead reflects children internalizing the languages
they are learning to speak. The following quote draws attention
to this probability6: "There are great individual diﬀerences
within and between the two languages of bilingual children
and current assessment instruments are not designed to diﬀer-
entiate diﬀerences from true disabilities in these children."
In terms of speech fluency, while additional research is
needed, it seems that bilingual speakers are naturally more dis-
fluent. This is most likely related to the linguistic uncertainty
they experience when deciding which words to say and in what
language they will say it. This increase in the frequency of dis-
fluency may make these children more vulnerable to be identi-
fied as stuttering.
Presently, researchers report that the positive benefits of
being bilingual far outweigh any misperceived disadvantages.
For example, learning a second language can increase multi-
tasking skills and improve memory and the ability to focus.
Bilingualism has also been shown to contribute to a cognitive
advantage in aging, with studies showing that bilingual speakers
may be less likely to develop neurological diseases such as
dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, being bilingual allows
one a view of other cultures in ways that can expand our hori-
zons and provide a new and diﬀerent window into the world.
14.3 Challenges in Identifying
Stuttering in Bilingual Speakers
Recent research suggests that typically developing bilingual
children are not only more likely to be misidentified as exhibit-
ing a language deficit but also more likely to be mislabeled as
being a child who stutters. This increased likelihood of false-
positive identification, or rather inaccurately identifying the
presence of a disorder in a typically developing child, may be
explained by the following factors: (1) use of monolingual
guidelines for stuttering assessment; (2) a misperception of bi-
lingualism as a risk factor for onset and persistence of stutter-
ing; (3) inconsistency in the description of bilingualism; and (4)
an assumption that stuttering and typical speech disfluency are
related to language dominance. We consider each of these in
the following sections.
14.3.1 Use of Monolingual Guidelines
for Stuttering Assessment
Multiple studies confirm that speech-language pathologists can
use monolingual English guidelines to accurately assess stutter-
ing in non-English monolingual speakers of other languages
such as Dutch, French, and German.7,8,9 Yet, some have indi-
cated that they may not be applicable to all languages, for
example, Spanish.10 Nevertheless, we cannot assume that these
monolingual English guidelines, eﬀectively used with monolin-
gual Dutch speakers, for example, will also apply to bilingual
Dutch-English speakers. This is because the use of these guide-
lines with bilingual speakers does not consider the possibility
that bilinguals may have either limited or exceptional profi-
ciency in both languages. In essence, they have many more
choices to make when speaking, and the result of selecting
among those choices is elevated levels of disfluency.11,12
While reading this chapter, you may be thinking: hasn't it been
proven that clinicians can listen to speakers whose language they
do not speak and still be able to accurately identify stuttering? The
short answer is yes, but the long answer is no.
For example, it has been shown that speech-language pathol-
ogists can identify stuttering in adults whose language they do
Bilingual and Multicultural Considerations
228

not understand.13,14 It has also been shown that they can identify
stuttering severity in bilingual speakers with high levels of accu-
racy, even when they are unfamiliar with the language.15,16,17,18
That said, discriminating whether disfluencies are typical or
atypical in bilingual speakers may prove to be more challenging.
When clinicians are asked to listen to samples of bilingual
children who do and do not stutter, they accurately identify
those children who actually stutter. However, they also inaccur-
ately identify the typically fluent bilingual child to be stutter-
ing. In essence, there is likelihood that clinicians will not be
able to diﬀerentiate stuttering children from typically fluent
children who are producing disfluencies that are the natural
by-product of speaking two languages. Why is this so? To find
out, researchers asked the clinicians to share what influenced
their decisions about whether a bilingual child was stuttering
or normally disfluent.19 As shown in ▶Table 14.1, practitioners
stated that although they heard no tension in the disfluencies,
they did hear monosyllable word, sound, and syllable repeti-
tions or what is commonly categorized as stuttering-like dis-
fluencies. In addition to reporting these types of disfluency,
they judged that they were produced at a frequency that would
be indicative of stuttering in monolinguals.
Unfortunately, by using these monolingual English guidelines
with bilingual children, clinicians falsely identified typically
fluent Spanish-English speaking children as stuttering. Thus, it
seems that the conventionally used metric for monolingual
English-speaking children of 3 stuttering-like disfluencies per
100 syllables as indicative of stuttering may be too stringent a
criterion for the bilingual population.20
14.3.2 Speech Disfluencies Produced by
Bilingual Children Who Do Not Stutter
In order to better understand the factors that increase the
likelihood of misperceiving a typically fluent bilingual child as
stuttering, researchers have explored the speech of nonstuttering
bilingual children. Their aim was to clarify or help determine
what is typical versus atypical in bilingual speakers when com-
pared to monolingual English speakers. An analysis of the speech
disfluencies produced by 18 typically fluent bilingual Spanish-
English children between 5 and 6 years of age demonstrated that
they produced stuttering-like disfluencies that exceeded 3 per
100 syllables. In fact, if the monolingual English-speaking guide-
lines had been applied, most would have been classified as chil-
dren who stutter despite the fact that no child, parent, teacher,
or clinician expressed concern regarding their fluency.11
Similar results were found for 59 typically developing
Yiddish-Dutch speaking children ranging from 6 to 10 years of
age. The number of stuttering-like disfluencies produced by
these children was higher in both languages than the standard
guidelines would allow.21 This shows that the use of our current
monolingual English guidelines for assessment of stuttering in
bilingual speakers should be adapted so as to avoid false-
positive identification of stuttering in these children.
In summary, clinicians are able to identify stuttering in indi-
viduals even when they do not speak their language. However,
given the high rates of disfluencies produced by speakers of
more than one language, typically fluent bilinguals, particularly
children, may be more likely to be inaccurately identified as
stuttering. Thus, our guidelines for determining stuttering in
bilinguals need to be stricter, especially when it comes to
frequency of disfluencies and the presence of sound, syllable,
and word repetitions in their speech. This broader view will
help us better diﬀerentiate stuttered speech from typical
speech disfluency in these speakers and advance our under-
standing of how stuttering manifests in bilinguals.
14.3.3 Misperception of Bilingualism as
a Risk Factor for Stuttering
When clinicians are asked to identify factors that might contribute
to the onset and development of stuttering, it is surprising to see

how many are concerned that speaking more than one language
puts a child at risk of developing stuttering. This phenomenon
was observed using a web-based survey completed by 207
speech-language pathologists who were members of the
American
Speech-Language-Hearing
Association
(ASHA).22
Preliminary results indicate that more than a quarter of the
speech-language pathologists polled view bilingualism as a
risk factor. However, there are no data to support this risk.
One of the most commonly cited historical studies suggesting
that bilingualism may increase the risk was completed in 1937
by Travis et al.23 This study, along with a more recent one in
2009 by Howell et al,24 has methodological concerns that
resulted in their findings being disproven and in the case of
Howell et al. even recanted.1,11,25
Think about this: If speaking more than one language
increased the likelihood that you would develop stuttering,
then there would be higher rates of stuttering in countries
where there are higher rates of bilinguals, but there are not.
Additionally, if you reflect back to the beginning of this chapter,
there are numerous advantages to being bilingual and, for many
children, speaking more than one language is the only means of
communicating with members of their family and connecting
to their culture.
14.3.4 Inconsistency in the Description
of Bilingualism
The vast majority of investigations in stuttering and bilingual-
ism have considered bilingualism as a categorical label with
the idea that a person is or is not bilingual.26,27 This is mislead-
ing because bilingualism is on a continuum, and performance
on speech and language tasks will fluctuate depending on
language dominance and proficiency.2,28,29 In addition, the
frequency of disfluency will most likely be aﬀected by these
factors.
Thus, in both clinical practice and research, it is not enough
to simply describe an individual who stutters as bilingual
because we need to consider the language history, function, and
proficiency across the languages they speak. This will paint a truer
picture of bilingualism and enable us to compare bilinguals who
stutter with greater accuracy.
As shown in ▶Table 14.2, language history is defined as the
age and conditions in which the speaker was exposed to their
second/non-native language (L2). The first/native language is
labeled L1. Language function is defined as the amount or
frequency that each language is currently used across specific
settings such as at home, school, or work, in various contexts
(e.g., monologue or narrative, dialogue or conversation) or
with diﬀerent conversational partners. Language proficiency is
defined as the speaker's overall ability to speak and understand
each language in verbal and written form.
Two systematic reviews of the stuttering literature revealed
that the vast majority of studies simply referred to the partici-
pant as bilingual, without providing more insight into the
language history, function, and proficiency.26,27 This means that
despite the increase in the quantity of research examining the
nature of stuttering in bilinguals, the quality of the descriptors
used to characterize their bilingualism remains insuﬃcient
and inconsistent. Thus, one should interpret the findings of any
research in stuttering among bilingual speakers with caution
given the manner in which bilingualism has been defined in the
literature.26,27
14.3.5 Assumption That Stuttering is
Related to Language Dominance
To date, there have been conflicting results from studies
examining the relationship between stuttering and the language
dominance of bilingual speakers. Certain studies have found
similar amounts of stuttering in both languages, while others have
reported that some bilingual speakers produce more stuttering in
one language when compared to the other.
Why is this so? Some have argued that the diﬀerences are
related to the grammatical structure of the language being
spoken. Others have argued the diﬀerence may be related to
linguistic uncertainty. It seems intuitive that linguistic uncer-
tainty only occurs when one's knowledge and use of the
language spoken is reduced when compared to one's second
language. However, research has not proven this to be true. In
fact, there is uncertainty when there are more options, and
also when there are fewer options. This means that bilinguals
may be more disfluent because they are selecting among
many choices, or they may be more disfluent because they are
struggling with too few choices.
Importantly, many clinicians have noticed from experience
that the relationship between language dominance and stutter-
ing can be diﬀerent from one speaker to the other and is diﬃ-
cult to predict. This is also true for typically fluent bilinguals.
For this reason, regardless of whether the diﬀerences in speech
disfluencies and/or stuttering are related to the grammatical
structure of the language or linguistic uncertainty, it is critical
to collect samples in each of the languages a child or adult
speaks when conducting a stuttering evaluation.
14.4 Culturally and Linguistically
Sensitive Assessment of Stuttering
Whether a child or adult speaks one, two, or more languages,
clinicians must seek to identify and understand the similarities
and diﬀerences between their own cultural influences and the

client's, because these factors contribute to clinical decisions
and the client's response to those decisions. For example, a
clinician might identify with a culture in which verbal interac-
tions occur regardless of the perceived status or gender of a
conversational partner. The client, however, may be from a
culture that restricts verbal interactions with conversational
partners that are of a perceived higher status or a diﬀerent
gender. This discrepancy between conversational styles could
create a perception that either the clinician or the client is being
rude or inappropriate during the clinical exchange.
It is important that clinicians continue to educate themselves
on the culture(s) with which their clients identify, particularly
as it relates to stuttering. At the same time, one should never
assume that individuals who identify with the same culture(s)
will present with the same cultural expression. As our personal
experience grows, so should our knowledge regarding the
distinctions across diﬀerent cultures as well as the individual
diﬀerences among people within the same culture. This will
enable clinicians to conduct a culturally responsive assessment
as well as consider the influence of culture on intervention. The
following section provides strategies for the assessment and
treatment of stuttering when working with culturally and
linguistically diverse (CLD) individuals.
14.4.1 Formal Assessment of Stuttering
There are a number of commonly used assessment tools to
determine the presence and/or severity of stuttering in both
children and adults. When we use these instruments in our
clinical practice, we need to consider their appropriateness
from both a linguistic and cultural viewpoint.
For example, was the assessment tool normed on a sample
that represents the cultural background of the client? Was the
tool designed for use with individuals who speak more than
one language? The fact that many stuttering assessment instru-
ments do not consider cultural or language diversity does not
generally devalue their eﬀectiveness, nor diminish their reli-
ability or validity. Nevertheless, clinicians should consider the
impact of culture and be cautious when interpreting the assess-
ment results.
For example, one of the most commonly used stuttering
assessments is the Stuttering Severity Instrument, Fourth
Edition (SSI-4).28 The SSI-4 was normed on children and adults
recruited from California public schools, private practice, and
university and community clinics. Although the manual does
not provide guidance for speakers of languages other than
English, this measure can be used if considering only those
speech disfluencies produced with atypical timing and tension
that are clearly indicative of stuttering. Since typically fluent
bilinguals produce more stuttering-like disfluencies than their
monolingual peers, it is critical that only those produced in a
tense, arrhythmic manner be computed in the SSI-4. Otherwise,
typically disfluent bilinguals may be erroneously identified as
presenting moderate to severe stuttering.
The
Communication
Attitude
Test
for
Preschool
and
Kindergarten Children who Stutter (KiddyCAT)29 is another
commonly used assessment tool that examines the percep-
tions and attitudes of kindergarteners and preschool-age
children about stuttering in general and their own stuttering
in particular. There is no specific guidance provided for the use of
this tool with a CLD child. For example, in some cultures, children
are not encouraged to openly share their feelings and attitudes
with others and instead may have a tendency to agree with an
elder so as to not show disrespect. When this tendency carries
over into the test setting, the child may be looking for opportuni-
ties to guess which answer the examiner expects rather than
providing a valid response. So what do you do about this? You can
complete this assessment in each language the child speaks. And
as you learn more about the child's cultures, you will become
more apt at determining how their responses may be influenced
by culture, independently of stuttering.
The Test of Childhood Stuttering (TOCS)30 is a standardized
assessment tool that measures stuttering in children through a
variety of speaking contexts. The authors of the TOCS have
intentionally included information regarding the ethnicity of the
sample used to norm the test, which includes children of the
following race and ethnic groups: White, African-American,
Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut, and
Hispanic. The authors also clearly state that this tool is not
appropriate for use with children who have limited English
proficiency.30
Since its development, the validity and reliability of the TOCS
have been examined for use in other languages, specifically
Persian and Arabic,31,32 but the cross-linguistic reliability and
validity require further investigation. As with the SSI-4, clini-
cians should attend only to disfluencies associated with tension
or atypical timing.
The Overall Assessment of the Speakers Experience of Stut-
tering (OASES) is used to determine the adverse impact of
stuttering on an individual's life.33,34 Originally published in
English, the OASES in its initial form did not lend itself to
being used with CLD individuals. However, since that time,
the authors have made considerable strides in broadening the
application of their test. The OASES has been translated and
validated for use with Spanish, German, Dutch, Hebrew, and
Portuguese speakers.35,36,37 Because the impact of stuttering
on quality of life can vary depending on language and culture,
it is again important to evaluate this in each of the languages
that the person speaks.
14.4.2 Informal Assessment of
Stuttering
With any CLD person suspected of stuttering, combining the
results of both formal and informal assessment of stuttering is
necessary to minimize cultural biases. Instead of relying heavily
on the frequency of speech disfluencies to render a diagnosis of
stuttering, a good starting point is simply to reflect on the ques-
tion, "Does the speaker sound like a person who stutters?" The
clinician's perception and judgment are important components
to a stuttering evaluation and are very helpful when assessing
these individuals.
A high frequency of disfluencies is a common characteristic
of stuttering; however, there are reasons other than stuttering
that can explain a high frequency of speech disfluencies. One is
that there is a greater cognitive demand placed on bilingual
speakers as they navigate more than one language. Another, from
a strictly cultural perspective, may be the purposeful use of a
significantly high number of interjections or word repetitions
solely for purposes of expression. This is commonly seen in
14.4 Culturally and Linguistically Sensitive Assessment of Stuttering
231

African-American speakers and sometimes in French speakers. It
is clear that a diagnosis of stuttering in either case would be
inappropriate.1,38
Although it is not always easy to diﬀerentiate these behaviors
from stuttering, obtaining narrative and conversational samples
in each of the languages the person speaks during the assess-
ment process is an important step. Subsequently, by focusing less
on the overall frequency and more on the types of disfluencies
and especially the manner in which they are produced, the clini-
cian can make a more accurate diagnosis. An in-depth discussion
about centering the stuttering assessment on how a person stut-
ters and their response to stuttering, as opposed to how much
they stutter, is presented in ▶Chapter 9 of this text. By attending
to those disfluencies that sound like stuttering and are associated
with tension, it will be simpler to distinguish stuttering from
repetitions the speaker is using to emphasize a point, or those
related to the speaker's eﬀort to determine the word and the lan-
guage they will use to communicate.
In addition to the speech disfluencies produced across
speaking samples, the assessment of nonverbal behaviors is
common practice in evaluations of all persons who stutter.
With CLD individuals, there may be large diﬀerences in the
way that nonverbal behaviors are used and interpreted, espe-
cially in terms of what is considered acceptable or unaccept-
able within that culture. The nonverbal behavior most critical
to consider during a stuttering assessment is eye contact.
For example, persons from western cultures (i.e., North
America and Europe) generally establish some eye contact with
a conversational partner regardless of age or gender. However,
in Middle Eastern, Asian, African, Latin American, and American
Indian cultures, any direct eye contact is considered inappropri-
ate, rude, or threatening depending on the gender or age of
their conversational partner.39,40 This behavior can greatly
influence an assessment of stuttering because that lack of eye
contact could be misinterpreted as a secondary behavior, per-
haps signaling habitual avoidance. So it is essential that the
clinician familiarizes themselves with what is considered
appropriate in that person's culture in order to determine
whether the individual's eye contact is related to stuttering or
to cultural influences.
14.5 Additional Cultural
Considerations
14.5.1 Age and Gender
Age and gender are two additional factors that can indirectly
influence the presentation of speech disfluencies. For example,
in middle-class, mainstream cultures, it is assumed that chil-
dren are appropriate conversation partners for adults, especially
when these adults are their parents. Thus, it is common during
the assessment to observe the conversation between a child
and his or her parent(s) in order to obtain a sample of typical
language use.
However, in some cultures such as in traditional Asian families,
it can be considered inappropriate to expect conversational
interactions between parents and their children.41 These children
have often learned that they are expected to speak when spoken
to and rarely initiate a new conversation topic with persons they
perceive to be of higher status. Thus, if they are placed in a
conversational setting with their parents or a clinician during a
fluency evaluation, their verbal output may be limited. One likely
explanation is that the child is limiting their speech to shorter,
less complex utterances to mask the occurrence of stuttering.
However, it is also possible that the clinician uses their own
culturally based expectations to assume the child to be reserved
about speaking due to their stuttering rather than their culture. A
clinician who is culturally aware of these possibilities would
prepare the evaluation in a way that minimizes these potential
biases. Ideally, one way is to include a clinician who is of the same
cultural background and possibly the same gender as the client
to assist with the assessment.
14.5.2 Conversational Style
Conversational style is another aspect of communication that has
the potential to impact service delivery to CLD individuals.
Specifically, in some cultures (e.g., African-Americans, Hispanics,
French and French-Canadians), speakers interrupt each other
frequently during conversation. These interruptions are not
intended to be negative to the flow of conversation, but
instead indicate active participation and emotional involvement
on the part of the speaker during communication. Sometimes
they are also used as a strategy to gain the conversational floor.
These interruptions may also be associated with disfluencies
such as word or sound repetitions at the beginning of utterances.
Again, they do not indicate the presence of stuttering. These
disfluencies may be interpreted as a way of showing spontaneity
or interest in the conversation and be considered by certain
cultures as a fashionable way of talking. Although some speakers
are naturally more disfluent than others, it is also possible that
certain cultures have a higher tolerance for disfluencies.
Speakers of some cultures talk with what could be called a
culturally appropriate rate of speech. Their speech is rapid
when compared to the typical rate expected for mainstream
speakers. Both a rapid rate of speech and a high proportion of
interruptions in a person who stutters are common findings, but
this way of speaking is also appropriate and perceived positively
in some cultures. Unfortunately, it may also exacerbate stuttering
in those who actually do stutter, particularly children. When
speaking rapidly, there is less time available to make changes, so
modifying stuttering becomes more diﬃcult and challenging.
In this situation, the clinician should educate the client and
their conversational partners, such as the family, on the nega-
tive impact these features may have on stuttering. In the case of
a child, it may be necessary to reassure the parent that making
small changes to lower the number of interruptions or decrease
speech rate used in conversation will not take away from their
child's cultural identity, but is necessary in order to progress in
stuttering treatment.
14.5.3 Views on the Cause of Stuttering
Finally, there is considerable variability in how cultures view the
etiology and treatment of stuttering. For example, a historical
etiological belief within African-American culture is that stutter-
ing is the result of an evil spirit or the will of a higher power.38
Others may think that the problem is psychological in nature
and firmly believe it is rooted in diﬃcult family relationships or
Bilingual and Multicultural Considerations
232

personality traits such as shyness. When clinicians are faced with
such strong and resilient beliefs, they should be respectful of them
while also providing clinical education to the family or client. It is
best for clinicians to send the message that the information given
is another viewpoint on stuttering that is more research based.
This attitude is more helpful than giving the impression that there
is a correct versus incorrect way of viewing stuttering.
Now that we have reviewed the data regarding the nature of
disfluent speech production in speakers of more than one lan-
guage, and the relevant formal and informal assessment consid-
erations, it is time for you to review the case study (Box 14.1
and Box 14.2) and apply what you have learned by answering
the reflection questions.
Box 14.1 Case Study
Matthew is a 5-year-old English-Spanish bilingual child. His
parents are seeking a professional opinion after Matthew's
kindergarten teacher raised concern about his speech fluency.
Matthew began learning English first, which is the language
spoken at home. But, at the age of 4 years, he began attending
a dual-language preschool where he was first introduced to
Spanish. According to Matthew's parents, he only speaks
Spanish in school.
He reportedly began exhibiting speech disfluencies at 3.5
years of age, but his parents report them to have been less
frequent and less noticeable at that time. However, over the
6 months, his mother and the teacher have noticed an increase
in frequency of speech disfluencies, which has coincided with
an increase in his exposure and use of Spanish. His parents
report noticing it most often when he is excited or when
others "speak over him." His parent noted further that his
teacher hears the "stuttering" in English when Matthew
responds to questions in class or is explaining something, but
considers it less noticeable when Matthew is speaking Spanish.
Conversational and narrative samples collected in Spanish and
English demonstrated that across both sample types and
languages, Matthew produced an average of 30 speech
disfluencies per 100 spoken words. Of these disfluencies, more
than 3% were stuttering-like in nature and specifically included
repetitions of sounds, syllables, and words. The remaining
disfluencies produced were non-stuttering-like in nature and
consisted of interjections, revisions, and phrase repetitions. None
of the speech disfluencies were produced with atypical tension.

14.6 Considerations for
Intervention
Similar to assessment tools, most therapeutic strategies and
programs for stuttering have been developed for, and often by,
monolingual speakers of English. Many speech-language path-
ologists working with bilingual children and adults who stutter
have modified therapy on a trial-and-error basis in order to
eﬀect change in their client's stuttering. The first question
that arises is whether or not we should treat stuttering in all
languages spoken by the individual. The answer is yes, as much
as possible.
As we have seen earlier, stuttering is not distributed equally
across the languages a person speaks. An individual may stutter
more in one language and much less in the other. However,
treating stuttering in all of the languages the person speaks is
not always easy. Sometimes the clinician is unable to speak the
language of the client, or the client does not speak the clini-
cian's language very well and an interpreter will be needed.
Although having an interpreter, preferably within the family, is
ideal, it may not be possible. In such cases, keeping explana-
tions to a minimum and modeling behavioral therapy strategies
(e.g., reduced rate) are most helpful. Since clinicians are able to
correctly perceive disfluencies in diﬀerent languages, especially
when a diagnosis of stuttering is established, it is also possible
for them to give feedback to clients when they are practicing in
a language diﬀerent from the clinician's.
When teaching specific behaviors in therapy, some clients
and/or their parents may express resistance due to diﬀerent
culturally-based interpretations. For example, slowing the rate
of speech, especially in adolescents and adults, may meet resist-
ance. This is true even for monolingual speakers of English, but
cultural interpretations regarding the perception of the slower
speaker may diﬀer. For example, some seem to value speaking
rapidly and often perceive these speakers favorably as quick
thinkers, active, and interesting people. Conversely, they may
view a person who speaks more slowly as less intelligent and
uninteresting. To encourage use of any sort of rate reduction
strategy, the clinician must establish rapport with the client
and, if applicable, their parents. The therapeutic alliance is crit-
ical regardless of culture, and perhaps more essential when the
treatment requires behaviors that do not culturally align.
Speech-language pathologists should take the time to discuss
the rationale for using any therapy technique with the client,
and work together to determine ways to help the client feel
more comfortable.
The nature of parental participation may be another issue
that has to be confronted when treating young children who
stutter from a diﬀerent cultural background and their parents.
Current intervention practices tend to rely heavily on parents
both in and out of therapy, to help carry out both therapy
procedures and practice sessions. For example, the Lidcombe
Program42 teaches parents to distinguish between stuttered
speech and typical speech disfluency. They are then coached to
provide feedback to a set proportion of fluent and stuttered
utterances during daily parent-child interactions and, ultimately,
to request the child reproduce their stuttered utterances more
"smoothly."
14.6 Considerations for Intervention
233

In contrast, the Dutch RESTART-DCM program (see https://
restartdcm.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/RESTART-DCM.
Method.-English-met-app.pdf) and Palin Parent-Child Interaction
Therapy43 indirectly target the reduction of specific fluency dis-
rupters in the child's environment. The parent and child engage
in daily interactions, but without the child directly asked to
modify their speech. A randomized clinical trial of Lidcombe
compared to RESTART-DCM therapies showed negligible out-
come diﬀerences for speakers of more than one language.45 More
detailed discussion of both Lidcombe and RESTART-DCM can be
found in ▶Chapter 10 of this text.
Recently, research has shown similar results from these two
distinct programs. This is likely because there are common
factors driving the outcomes. It has been speculated that the
component common to both approaches, which contributes
most to outcomes, is the daily interaction between parent and
child, where the parent takes the time to listen to the child
prior to responding. Nevertheless, regardless of the approach
used, parental involvement is essential in the treatment of
childhood stuttering. Although this is the case, some parents
across some cultures may have a more formal relationship with
their children, some do not feel comfortable engaging in play
with their child in a professional setting, and still others may
think that it is inappropriate for them to carry out therapy
activities with their child. Fortunately, it is often possible
through sensitive guidance to facilitate the parents openness to
their involvement and to help them acquire the necessary skills
to work eﬀectively with their child.
In some cases, because cultural resistance is so strong,
speech-language pathologists may need to modify intervention,
so it relies more on the clinician than on the parent. When this
happens, the clinician should inform the parents that due to
these cultural restraints the course of treatment may be longer,
and the outcomes may diﬀer from what has been documented
in the cases where parents played a more significant role.
Ideally, therapy should be completed in all of the languages
that the child speaks. However, there is evidence that general-
ization of results across languages can occur in fluency ther-
apy.46 It should be noted, however, that these generalizations
are restricted to the behavioral aspects of stuttering and do not
extend to the cognitive (i.e., thoughts) and aﬀective (feelings)
aspects. In other words, learning to produce an easy onset at
the beginning of a word is a behavioral strategy that has been
shown to transfer to another language without practice in that
other language. This makes sense intuitively, as learning to
open your mouth slightly and making lighter articulatory
touches and a breathier start to their utterances are strategies
that can be used across many spoken languages. That said, these
behavioral gains are often not maintained in the long term for
either language, especially in adults.
More recently, there are data focusing on overall communica-
tion such as eye contact, using gestures, and smiling slightly
while speaking to express a positive aﬀect, rather than focusing
on fluency and/or reduction of stuttering, with results repli-
cated in CLD populations. This work showed a significant
decrease in the negative impact of stuttering on the person
who stutter's overall quality of life. In addition, there was a
significant increase in communication competencies, social
skills, self-advocacy, and positive communication attitudes for
children aged 4 years through adults older than 90 years. As is
demonstrated in this video clip, of the final treatment session of a
Spanish-speaking adult who stutters (along with his interpreter),
improvements in functional outcomes such as reducing speech
avoidance, talking openly about stuttering, and using more
competent communication skills are significant.
In summary, although there are inherent challenges in serving
the multicultural and multilingual population, communication is
critical across all cultures, and all languages. Thus, the focus
should be on helping them to communicate freely and compe-
tently. Treatment may take longer, be more demanding for the
clinician who must adapt and be creative, and often may not be
as perfect as was hoped. However, for the speech-language path-
ologist, the CLD client will provide many satisfying moments as
well as opportunities to learn and grow as a clinician, and as a
person.
14.7 Conclusion
This chapter has provided an overview of the progression of
research centered on the role of bilingualism and multilingual-
ism as they relate to the assessment of stuttering, the impact
on
treatment,
and
cultural
considerations
to
be
made
throughout service delivery. The findings to date have high-
lighted a major challenge for clinicians to accurately identify
behaviors that diﬀerentiate typical disfluency, language learn-
ing, language impairment, and stuttering in monolingual and
bilingual speakers. The data have also shown that typically
fluent bilinguals and those who stutter are often much more
disfluent than their monolingual counterparts because they
are navigating between languages. This raises the question of
how best to adapt our monolingual English guidelines to this
population in order to enhance our diﬀerential diagnosis of
these speakers.
From a theoretical perspective, additional research exploring
the overlapping and distinguishing behaviors could serve to
demonstrate the relative contribution of linguistic planning
and speech motor control to the diﬀerent manifestations of
disfluent speech. As cultural and linguistic awareness and
bilingual and multilingual populations increase, it is expected
that this area of knowledge and research will expand. Thus,
clinicians should be prepared to continue educating themselves
in this area as findings emerge and evolve. Nevertheless, the
information given in this chapter has provided readers with an
evidence-based starting point with regard to the key diﬀerentiat-
ing characteristics, areas of overlap, and other critical assessment
and treatment considerations.

15 Pharmacological Considerations for the
Treatment of Stuttering
Lisa LaSalle, Angharad Ames, and Gerald Maguire
Abstract
Pharmacological considerations for adults who stutter are
important for an interprofessional team to address. This chapter
provides information that speech-language pathologists need
to know about pharmacotherapy for adults who stutter. We
begin with a dopamine hypothesis about stuttering—how per-
sistent developmental stuttering is likely a hyperdopaminergic
condition similar to Tourette's syndrome. Background is pro-
vided as to how neurotransmitter reuptake, the placebo eﬀect,
and safety play a role in medication development. A historical
perspective is then added, spanning the earlier use of haloperi-
dol to the present use of newer, second-generation dopamine
antagonists. New investigatory medications such as ecopipam
are included. Second-generation dopamine antagonists cur-
rently used to treat stuttering with the lowest adverse drug
reaction profiles include six medications (e.g., asenapine), pre-
sented in a table format. Adverse drug reactions are also consid-
ered, as they occur with all medications, but can be minimized
with careful dosage decisions. Stuttering, for the purpose of this
chapter, will include (1) persistent developmental stuttering,
whether comorbid/co-occurring or not; (2) exacerbated stutter-
ing (i.e., paradoxical eﬀects); and (3) acquired stuttering (i.e.,
iatrogenic eﬀects) versus serendipitous stuttering amelioration
that may occur when individuals who stutter are medicated for
a co-occurring condition. We then discuss the eﬀect of medica-
tions prescribed for other conditions on both persistent devel-
opmental stuttering and acquired stuttering. Future directions
include new medications, and combining support/self-help
group, behavioral treatment, and/or pharmacotherapy is rec-
ommended. Treatment options arise from the informed client's
wishes in both an evidence-based practice and a cost-benefit
type framework. Finally, we believe that pharmacological con-
siderations for adults who stutter are where our ethics, coun-
seling, scope of practice, and interprofessional practice intersect
to provide the best possible treatment options.

15.1 Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to provide pharmacological con-
siderations for individuals who stutter. We define pharmaco-
therapy as treatment of a client/patient with medications, thus
requiring medical professionals (e.g., physicians or psychia-
trists). We have focused especially on adults who stutter, but
we included several pediatric case reports. We have excluded
pharmacological considerations for individuals younger than
18 years, as pharmacotherapy for stuttering in children and
adolescents may not be eﬀective or advisable.1 Compared to
children and teens, adults who stutter (AWS) are the most likely
age of individuals seeking pharmacotherapy. In general, AWS
are likely to seek pharmacotherapy if their stuttering severity is
moderate to severe, and/or if they have experienced relatively
negative impacts of stuttering on their quality of life, despite
behavioral treatments.
Based on criteria such as stuttering severity and being a
nonresponder to speech therapy, medication is an option for
AWS. Providing access to self-help/support groups and to
behavioral speech fluency/stuttering modification treatment for
individuals who stutter are other important options. Providing
all evidence-based options when requested is an obligation that
falls upon the speech-language pathologist (SLP). Ideally, indi-
viduals who stutter would consult with an interprofessional
practice team to determine treatment options.
The third author of this chapter, Dr. Gerald Maguire, is a
person who stutters, a researcher of stuttering, and a psychiatrist.
He served as chair of the National Stuttering Association, and he
believes that acceptance of stuttering by the person who stutters
is the first step in the treatment of stuttering in AWS. Based on
his experience over the years, Dr. Maguire views medication as
an important adjunct to available fluency shaping, stuttering
modification, and support/self-help group services for AWS.
When considering treatment for stuttering, he believes that SLPs
are the primary helpers and that treatment options including
medication should be at the client's discretion and involve
appropriate education for the AWS.2 The authors of this chapter
believe that combining evidence-based treatments in a compre-
hensive, synergistic way is best for individuals who are seeking
help for their stuttering.
Thus, by way of introduction, a brief coverage or reminder
of evidence-based practice (EBP) is in order. For the present
chapter, EBP involves applying the body of peer-reviewed litera-
ture to the pharmacological (as well as other) options for those
who stutter. However, EBP also considers the clinician(s)' exper-
tise and the informed wishes of the client/patient who stutters.
The first author recalls attending a panel discussion of stuttering
specialists who stutter. One speaker recounted his experience in
taking an antianxiety medication in attempts to speak more
fluently in his presentation, only to have the medication wear oﬀ
before getting his turn at the microphone! This anecdote high-
lights the informed wishes of this individual to take a medication
that would assist him in stuttering symptom alleviation, at least
for the presentation. It also addresses the phenomena of both
pharmacodynamics (i.e., what a medication does to the body, in
this case presumptively decrease anxiety) and pharmacokinetics
(i.e., what the body does to the medication, including metabo-
lism and the wearing-oﬀof its eﬀects). Dr. Ehud Yairi, another
person who stutters, an SLP and a researcher of stuttering, has
expressed that "the search of the person who stutters for a
relief, if not a complete cure, is understandable."3 This chapter
is written in that spirit.
236

We also believe that a type of cost-benefit model, specifically
the necessity-concerns framework, is one helpful way to under-
stand how people perceive medications.4 People tend to focus
on either or both the necessity (i.e., benefits) of maintaining
one's health or quality of life with medications and the concerns
(i.e., costs) toward the adverse eﬀects or "side eﬀects" of those
medications. The necessity-concerns framework helps explain
how people exhibit individual diﬀerences in their cognitive and
aﬀective perception of medication or pharmacotherapy. The
model assumes that people perceive that when costs outweigh
benefits, negative beliefs toward medication occur. Conversely,
people may decide that benefits of a medication outweigh
its costs, thus viewing medications relatively positively. Such
individual diﬀerences regarding people's attitudes about medi-
cations could cluster together into at least four subgroups. For
example, one subgroup could be accepting (high necessity, low
concerns), another ambivalent (high necessity, high concerns),
indiﬀerent (low necessity, low concerns), and still another
skeptical (low necessity, high concerns). This necessity-concern
framework could be applied to a vast range of medications
administered to treat a range of human conditions.4,5 Persistent
developmental stuttering is one of those human conditions.
Findings from 18- to 65-year-old individuals who stutter
(n = 226), using an international Beliefs about Medication
Questionnaire indicated that pharmacotherapy was as equally
sought out as was speech therapy. In these survey results, 16%
responded as being accepting in their beliefs about medication,
whereas 27% were indiﬀerent, 24% ambivalent, and 33% skeptical.
Those who were accepting in their medication beliefs, as
might be expected, were most likely to seek pharmacotherapy
for their stuttering. Furthermore, the ambivalent and indiﬀerent
participants who stutter were significantly more likely to seek
pharmacotherapy than were the skeptical participants who
stutter.6 It would seem helpful for the clinician to know that
almost one out of five (16%) AWS might be accepting, that is,
they have low concerns about the cost aspect of pharmaceuticals
and feel a high necessity for alleviating/ameliorating to stutter
symptoms. In this way, clinicians can be better prepared to
frame discussion with their clients regarding pharmacological
considerations. We can further appreciate that the one out of
three AWS who are skeptical about medications might be so for
various reasons (e.g., acceptance of one's stuttering; knowing
that medications cross the blood-brain barrier; encountering
problems with access to quality health care and thus access to
medication, out-of-pocket costs of medication, etc.).
15.2 Stuttering and the Dopamine
Hypothesis
In order to explain why medication might alleviate stuttering
symptoms, we will present basic information about a neurolog-
ical timing/programming deficit, likely to be present in AWS.
This presumed deficit is what the medication is designed to act
upon. After all, medicine at its simplest level is the use of a com-
pound reasoned to alleviate symptoms. It is important to
understand what is referred to as a mechanism of action (MOA),
that is, biochemically, how the medication produces its phar-
macological eﬀect. A medication's MOA describes how the
chemical structure of the medication/compound binds to mo-
lecular targets, such as the enzyme or receptor. It is not the pur-
pose of this chapter to provide comprehensive coverage of such
processes. Indeed, basic overviews of pharmacodynamics and
pharmacokinetics specific to stuttering have been previously
presented, for example, by Ludlow7 and Saxon and Ludlow.8
Recent available evidence suggests that the basal ganglia
and white matter tract development is abnormal in those who
stutter.9,10,11,12,13 The over-activation of the basal ganglia circuits
(i.e., the red nucleus, pedunculopontine nucleus, subthalamic
nucleus, and substantia nigra) in AWS during speech tasks
supports the likelihood that stuttering is associated with a
hyperactive dopaminergic system.14 Dopamine is one of six
major types of neurotransmitters. Each neurotransmitter is
presented with its type and function in ▶Table 15.1.
Skilled motor movements, such as speaking, are highly inter-
connected with the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and other sub-
cortical and cortical regions, so much so that the neurological/
neuropharmacological "juries are still out." That is, we do not
yet know where in the basal ganglia/white matter tract
specific deficits of developmental stuttering would be found,

of monoamines, amino acids, and others, such as acetylcholine (Ach). Peptides are considered as neurotransmitters, but excluded here

15.2 Stuttering and the Dopamine Hypothesis
237

"...especially against the backdrop of a developing linguistic
and nervous system in children."15
Brain imaging studies of AWS have been enlightening, but
findings from these studies are likely to show compensatory
eﬀects of stuttering, not pure etiology of stuttering. And yet, for
33- to 34-month-old children who are at the typical age to have
just begun to stutter,16 it does not yet seem feasible to use brain
imaging techniques on them, given their diﬃculties cooperating
with procedures that restrict their activities/movements. With
that background, we present three findings that pertain to
(1) dopamine metabolism, (2) excessive release of dopamine,
and (3) dopaminergic genes.
First, dopamine metabolism is implicated in persistent devel-
opmental stuttering.10,17 Dopamine is a monoamine catechol-
amine neurotransmitter. To unpack that definition, like other
neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, norepinephrine), dopamine
is a compound with a single amine group in its molecule (i.e., a
monoamine). Dopamine is also a hormone produced in the
adrenal gland, sent to our bloodstream when we are physically
or emotionally stressed (i.e., a catecholamine). Dopamine func-
tions in our learning, attention, movements, emotions and
reward/motivation systems, and possibly even fear.18

dopamine.
Agonists are chemicals that bind to a receptor, which produces
a biological response. Antagonists, however, block the action of
the agonist. Thus, dopamine receptor blockers are synonymous
with dopamine antagonists. There are five types of dopamine
receptors, D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5. When a neurotransmitter
binds to a receptor, an extracellular signal converts to an intra-
cellular signal, which then changes target neurons. ▶Table 15.2
shows the specific genes and chromosomes that encode each of
these dopamine receptors, their distinct functions, the rank
ordering of how abundant each dopamine receptor type is, and
where each receptor tends to be found.
Second, AWS, when compared to adults who do not stutter
(AWNS), exhibit excessive release of dopamine into the striatum
(i.e., the caudate nucleus and putamen). As a group, AWS exhibit
a disproportionately increased amount of activity in the substan-
tia nigra, and excessive release of dopamine in the striatum.14,17,19
In an early (1997) example of these types of findings, positron
emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brains of AWS showed
an increase in fluorodopamine (FDOPA, specifically 6-FDOPA)
activity in the caudate tail. The caudate, as well as the putamen
(which are both components of the basal ganglia), contains cells
on which D1 and D2 receptors are located. The location of these
two dopamine receptors on components of the basal ganglia
suggests that dopamine plays a role in the pathophysiology of
stuttering.20
Third, empirical findings indicate that dopaminergic genes
(i.e., possibly SLC6A3 and DRD2 and GNPTAB) are associated
with stuttering, further supporting the dopamine hypothesis of
stuttering.21,22,23 Genetic findings and interpretations are pre-
sented in a cautionary manner, as further research is needed to
support or refute these claims. It also helps one's understanding
of the pharmacodynamics of stuttering to know about common
conditions with over-suﬃcient dopamine levels (e.g., schizo-
phrenia) as well as insuﬃcient dopamine levels (e.g., Parkinson's
disease [PD]). For instance, stuttering could be a comorbid or
concomitant disorder for those with schizophrenia and PD, or
stuttering could result from a dopamine agonist medication
(i.e., iatrogenic), either when stuttering is acquired for the first
time or when a worsening of developmental stuttering occurs.
The MOA of the medication prescribed for schizophrenia
targets the over-suﬃciency of dopamine (i.e., the medication
decreases dopamine availability as a mechanism for alleviating
schizophrenic symptoms, such as disorganized speech, or flat
aﬀect). An example of pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia
would be to prescribe D2 antagonists, those that block the D2
receptor, or aﬀect other receptors, such as the serotonin and
histamine receptors. For example, the medication aripiprazole,
often prescribed for schizophrenia, is both a serotonin and a D2
partial agonist. Partial agonists bind to or activate a receptor in
an incomplete manner, in an analogous way to a door open

halfway as opposed to a full entrance to a receptor, which
would be the case with a full agonist.
In contrast to schizophrenia, for PD, the substantia nigra
produces an under-suﬃciency of dopamine. This results in the
person with PD exhibiting such symptoms as bradykinesia,
festination, micrographia, resting tremor, shuﬄing gait, and
postural instability.
Dopamine agonist medications for PD increase dopamine
availability as a mechanism for alleviating PD symptoms. To
treat PD pharmacologically, physicians prescribe medications
such as carbidopa and levodopa together (i.e., carbidopa-
levodopa). In this case, levodopa is converted into dopamine,
while carbidopa's MOA decreases to some extent the peripheral
side eﬀects of dopamine.24,25 Carbidopa-levodopa has been
reported to both exacerbate developmental stuttering and cause
acquired stuttering,26,27 thus providing further support for the
dopamine hypothesis of persistent developmental stuttering.
Another condition that can be misdiagnosed as stuttering, and
occasionally co-occurs with stuttering, is Tourette's syndrome
(TS). Like persistent developmental stuttering and schizophrenia,
TS likely has a hyperdopaminergic etiology. Like stuttering, TS
has a vocal fluency disruption component (i.e., vocal tics), a likely
genetic predisposition (i.e., in the case of TS, the ASH1 L gene),
childhood onset, and a prevalence of less than or about 1%. There
is one other commonality between persistent developmental
stuttering and TS that, to our knowledge, has not yet been
pointed out in the literature. This is the commonality that indi-
viduals who stutter and those with TS both tend to show poor
time estimation, which is likely a hyperdopaminergic function.
Such poor time estimation involves the perception that time is
moving faster than real time, which has been observed in both
those who stutter28,29,30 and in those with TS.31 We will return to
medications designed for TS and stuttering-related findings.
However, the next section follows from the hyperdopami-
nergic condition aspect of stuttering and TS, and it addresses a
"two-loop" hypothesis about how speech output fluency might
be facilitated via neurotransmitters such as dopamine and GABA.
15.3 Stuttering and the
"Two-loop" Hypothesis of
Speech Output
There is a large body of evidence that the basal ganglia are
implicated in stuttering. Yet, the basal ganglia are basically
motor nuclei, and they comprise almost all of the gray matter of
the cerebrum, with the exception of the thalamus, which is
primarily sensory (i.e., only motoric in a secondary feedback
manner). The function of the basal ganglia is to plan and
execute movements, and the basal ganglia serve as the main
relay station for the extrapyramidal motor system. ▶Table 15.3
shows, first, the breakdown of the three largest motor nuclei in
the basal ganglia (i.e., caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus
pallidus) and their related structures (i.e., subthalamic nucleus,
substantia nigra, and centromedian [thalamic] nucleus). Many
indirect (i.e., inhibitory) and direct (i.e., excitatory) pathways
exist among the thalamus, basal ganglia/related structures,
parietal lobe, premotor, primary, and supplementary cortices,
to one another. When dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
nigra no longer function, the indirect pathway is suppressed,
halting the direct pathway as well. The result of this dysfunc-
tion is inhibition of the thalamocortical neurons, causing hypo-
kinetic movement disorders such as PD. Regarding stuttering,
Chang and colleagues provide support for Alm's early specula-
tions that the excessive dopaminergic dysfunction is either
(1) in the indirect pathway, thus increasing motor activation
due to decreased inhibition, or (2) in the direct pathway, thus
decreasing motor activation due to decreased excitation.9
The "two-loop timing theory of speech output" suggests an
outer linguistic loop and an inner motoric loop. Borrowing from
this inner and outer loop theory allows us to understand how
dopamine blockers might facilitate speech fluency in AWS. The
second part of ▶Table 15.4 breaks down the function and
implicated brain regions for this hypothesis.
We have adapted this original "two-loop speech theory"
considered by Foundas and colleagues to fit with a hyperdopa-
minergic view of stuttering.32 The inner motoric loop is specu-
lated to be abnormal in adults with persistent developmental
stuttering. To overcome this deficit, individuals who stutter
need to access an outer loop through fluency-enhancing activ-
ities like choral speech during reading, where the linguistic load
is low (see ▶Chapter 1). Because dopamine decreases the activ-
ity of the putamen and caudate nucleus (i.e., the striatum), a
dopamine receptor blocker type of medication would increase
the activation of the striatum, thereby increasing speech fluency.
Another treatment possibility is to administer a medication that
aﬀects the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA), in attempts at facilitating speech fluency. Enhancing

GABA and reducing dopamine would facilitate fluency even
during spontaneous speech through the inner loop, even though
the linguistic and resulting motoric load is high, and especially so
under time pressure.17
▶Fig. 15.1 is a graphic overview of the neurotransmitter
pathway possibilities between Broca's and Wernicke's areas in
the frontal and temporal lobes of the left hemisphere.
Additional data will help us to better understand whether
(1) (in)direct pathways are related to these inner and outer
loops, (2) synchrony of the loops matter for fluency facilitation,
and (3) perception and production operate autonomously in
spontaneous speech, and how that informs these neurotrans-
mitter pathway possibilities.
15.4 Background Pertaining to
Pharmacotherapy for Stuttering
Three background areas need explanation before the history of
pharmacology and stuttering: (1) a neuropharmacological
impact on neurotransmitters known as reuptake, (2) limiting or
controlling the placebo eﬀect, and (3) four phases of clinical
trials (e.g., pagoclone).
15.4.1 Neuropharmacological Impact
on Neurotransmitters: Reuptake
Neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine, GABA) travel from the cell
body down the axon and reenter the axon by endocytosis (i.e.,
transporting molecules into the cell by taking them inside the
cell membrane). Alternatively, the neurotransmitter can reenter
the presynaptic neuron by being taken back up by the same
neurons that released them at the synaptic junction, a process
known as "reuptake." ▶Fig. 15.2 shows this reuptake process
and reuptake ports, as might occur with serotonin, dopamine,
or other neurotransmitters. If the needed transport molecules
are not available, then neurotransmitter reuptake does not
occur, causing the neurotransmitter to accumulate in the
Fig. 15.1 Dopamine pathways. The authors speculate that fluency-
enhancing behaviors like singing, choral speaking, and reading allow
for accessing a compensatory "outer loop" when the "inner loop" is
deficient in people who stutter. As can be seen here, when prescribing
(+) a dopamine blocker or a GABA partial agonist, dopamine and GABA
are reduced (-) as input to the striatum, and fluency facilitation can
occur even during spontaneous speech/"inner loop" production.
Fig. 15.2 Neurotransmitter reuptake process.
Some neurotransmitters will bind to the recep-
tors on the postsynaptic neuron, but others will
be recycled through reuptake ports. (This image

synaptic junction. This would then increase the excitability of
the neuron. Pharmacological agents that are reuptake inhibi-
tors would then bring about this presumed eﬀect.
15.4.2 Limiting or Controlling the
Placebo Eﬀect
To understand the historical context of pharmacological options
for those who stutter, we next introduce the placebo eﬀect.
Researchers want to minimize the placebo eﬀect, as it is one
type of threat to internal validity. When a study has good
internal validity, the independent variable (e.g., a medication)
appears to be the only variable aﬀecting the dependent variable
or outcome (e.g., stuttering frequency). An individual who
stutters perceiving that "this medication will be beneficial for
me" could be a nuisance variable aﬀecting the outcome.33
The placebo eﬀect in pharmacology means that patients
could perceive and self-report symptom improvement without
ever being administered the actual medication. Research design
for controlling the placebo eﬀect includes randomly adminis-
tering either a fake/sham pill or the real one (e.g., "2.5 mg/d of
olanzapine or identical placebo for the first 4 weeks"34).
Appropriate statistical methods help us to ascertain if it is the
medication and not the placebo that causes the change in
outcome. Placebo administration in medication designs are
important. The importance of placebos in COVID-19 vaccine
development became one of many familiar news stories in
2020. Here are two examples of placebo use pertaining to stut-
tering. First, barbiturates have shown no beneficial eﬀects over
placebo in stuttering frequency outcomes.35 Olanzapine, how-
ever, showed a statistical diﬀerence from placebo in improving
patients' self-ratings of stuttering (22% change from baseline
with olanzapine versus 1% change from baseline with placebo).
15.4.3 Four Phases of Clinical Trials and
the Example of Pagoclone
An overview of the four phases (i.e., I-IV) of clinical trials allows
for the appreciation of the role of "safety" in the development
of any medication.
Phase I studies evaluate the safety of medications, typically take
several months to complete, and most experimental medications/
drugs pass this phase of testing.
Phase II studies, following phase I, attempt to determine
whether or not the drug has the desired eﬀect. Phase II studies
often last up to 2 years, require statistical power, and thus often
include more than 100 participants. Most phase II studies
involve randomized, placebo trials, and are double-blinded.
Double-blind or blinded means that neither the patients nor
the researchers know who has received the experimental drug.
At the end of the double-blind phase, participants are invited to
enroll in open-label extension studies. This type of study
involves giving all participants the "experimental drug." As part
of the open-label extension study, both participants and investi-
gators are made aware that the experimental drug is being used.
Phase III involves a large-scale test lasting several years. It
elucidates the medication's benefits and all side eﬀects or
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) as well as for the pharmaceutical corpo-
ration producing the drug. Placebos may or may not be used in
phase III trials, and the actual medication might be oﬀered to a
patient receiving placebo after a certain time span. Successful
phase III completion allows a pharmaceutical corporation to
request FDA approval for marketing a medication.
Finally, phase IV or "post marketing surveillance trials" are
run in order to compare the medication with alternative medi-
cations, to estimate long-term eﬀectiveness, impact on quality
of life, and to determine cost-eﬀectiveness. The authors of this
chapter have been considering medications that are without
specific FDA indications for treating stuttering. The absence of
FDA approval is not equal to the absence of medication/drug
safety and eﬃcacy. FDA approval is a branding of sorts.
One example of a medication tested on individuals who stutter
that illustrates the application of the four phases of a clinical trial
is that of pagoclone. Pagoclone is an anxiolytic (antianxiety)
agent belonging to the class of nonbenzodiazepines that binds
with high aﬃnity to the GABA-A receptor, acting as a partial
agonist. Pagoclone was under development by two pharmaceuti-
cal companies as an investigational therapy for panic disorder in
1996 to 2000. Indevus later acquired the rights to test the medi-
cation for the pharmacological treatment of stuttering.
Pagoclone showed early eﬃcacy for stuttering amelioration
in the largest pharmacological trial of stuttering conducted to
date. Researchers in 2010 assessed the safety, tolerability, and
eﬀectiveness of pagoclone during 8 weeks of double-blind
treatment followed by a 1-year open-label extension in patients
who stutter. It was an 8-week, 16-center, randomized clinical
trial, double-blind study, followed by a 1-year open-label exten-
sion. Participants had persistent developmental stuttering.
Pagoclone was administered twice daily to 88 patients, with
matching placebo given to 44 patients. Participants reduced
percent syllables stuttered (%SS) by 19% from baseline in
contrast to only a 5% SS reduction with placebo. Then 40% SS
reduction from
baseline was observed during open-label
treatment, after 1 year of treatment with pagoclone. Headache
(12.5% pagoclone patients, 6.8% placebo patients) was the most
reported ADR.36,37
Next, a phase II trial of pagoclone for treating stuttering
enrolled over 330 participants who stutter in just 2 weeks with
no formalized advertising for the trial. Although this provided
convincing evidence for the interest and need in this population
for advanced treatment options, the phase II results yielded a
high placebo response, which, as a result, did not pass the strin-
gent criteria stated earlier for Indevus to proceed with investing
financially and further developing pagoclone for stuttering. The
primary endpoint in the study was the percentage of syllables
stuttered, which revealed great variability from visit to visit and
a high placebo response with all subjects overall, showing
improvement compared to baseline on this metric. However,
the social anxiety levels of individuals on active therapy showed
a marked improvement over placebo. The experience with
pagoclone serves as a prime example of the need for more valid
instruments for measuring stuttering response over time. With
pagaclone, there was a strong interest from the community,
and stuttering amelioration benefits were at least initially
observed.36,37

241

15.5 Medications for Stuttering:
A Historical Perspective
Presently, there are no medications approved by the FDA for
the treatment of stuttering. Investigation is ongoing into the
utility of already-developed medications in the treatment of
stuttering. Several classes of medications have been studied in
this way, and multiple medications have demonstrated positive
results in the treatment of stuttering. Medications, however, are
not always prescribed for symptoms that they were labeled
or designed to treat. Specifically, physicians have and will
prescribe a medication to treat a symptom, complaint, or condi-
tion in a manner not specified in the FDA's insert (i.e., approved
packaging label required for each prescription drug marketed in
the United States, i.e., "oﬀ-label"). Indeed, this is a prescription
procedure that also occurs for stuttering.
Historically, pharmacotherapy for the treatment of stuttering
as a symptom or as a condition has been conducted without
specific FDA indications. Many helpful overviews exist on this
topic of medications for stuttering.3,5,35,38,39,40,41 For example,
Brady reviewed 102 papers (1940s to 1990) and concluded that
the pharmacological agents administered to AWS span a wide
spectrum, including, for example, carbon dioxide, beta blockers
(e.g., propranolol), calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil),
stimulants (e.g., methylphenidate), sedatives (e.g., benzodiaze-
pines), tranquilizers (e.g., meprobamate), and neuroleptics/
antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol).35 For example, in one case
study, propranolol was reported to decrease stuttering by 50%
from baseline.42 In another case study, propranolol nearly com-
pletely eliminated stuttering in a male adolescent patient who
reported a late onset of stuttering at age 10 years.43 In his 1991
narrative review of pharmacological treatments for stuttering
in adults, Brady predicted that calcium channel blocking agents
and cholinergic medications (i.e., those inhibiting, facilitating,
enhancing or mirroring the action of acetylcholine) would
show promise,34 but no recent investigations have yet sup-
ported or refuted this possibility. Calcium channel blockers,
such as verapamil, have been shown in at least a couple studies
to demonstrate only limited eﬃcacy in treating stuttering.44,45
The remainder of the chapter will refer to many diﬀerent
medications and drug classes. To help readers locate, in one
place, the various brand names of these medications as well as
the intended and unintended eﬀects of each, we have included
▶Table 15.5, which provides an alphabetized list and an
explanation of each medication included in this chapter.
Beyond the challenge of the heterogeneity of stuttering,
there are specific challenges involved in analyzing and
synthesizing the stuttering pharmacotherapy literature to
date. The first challenge is that when case studies naming a
medication or recreational drug (e.g., "severe stuttering and
motor tics responsive to cocaine")46 are reported to show
serendipitous
fluency-exacerbating
or
fluency-enhancing
eﬀects,47 researchers would not ethically/legally try them out
with AWS. As another example, the antidepressant fluoxetine
(Prozac) was reported to enhance fluency in at least one case of
an AWS.48 Such findings may encourage physicians to prescribe
fluoxetine to a patient with stuttering to see if the drug has a
similar eﬀect on their stuttering, but presumably would do so if
the patient also presented with depression.
We might learn that a certain medication improves, worsens,
or even brings on an incident of stuttering based on its inci-
dental eﬀects. For example, anticholinergic medications (i.e.,
medications that block the actions of the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine), such as tricyclic antidepressants, have been
found to cause some people to begin stuttering.35 Observing
these findings, a clinician might reason that the opposite, chol-
inergic medications (i.e., those that enhance the actions of
acetylcholine) would alleviate stuttering, but such reasoning
could be fallacious. Another specific challenge is that there is
no standard outcome measure for stuttering frequency across
medication studies. Some employ outcomes such as %SS (i.e.,
stuttering frequency), whereas other studies report only such
measures as time speaking fluently, which aims at the same
construct as stutter frequency, but also includes stutter dura-
tion in the same measure. The present authors suggest that
the best way to tackle these challenges is to engage in safe,
scientific, scope of practice viewpoints. Historical perspectives
provide us with a variety of "lessons learned" regarding phar-
macological considerations for AWS.
Since about the mid-1990s, as alluded to earlier, there is
increasing evidence for an association between basal ganglia
activity and stuttering. Speculations on the association between
basal ganglia and stuttering are based on findings from studies
of brain lesions, neurodevelopment, and fluency-enhancing
conditions (e.g., Delayed Auditory Feedback, appropriate for
those with severe stuttering during reading tasks49).10,50,51,52 By
the onset of the 21st century, some were surmising a hyperdo-
paminergic condition in individuals who stutter. At present, the
only eﬀective way to reduce dopamine activity is through
blocking the dopamine receptors via the MOA of a given medi-
cation. Such blocking of dopamine receptors is accomplished by
employing a medication with low to no side eﬀects or adverse
reactions. The hypothesis taking shape by around the year
2004 was that D2 antagonist medications enhance or facilitate
fluency because they compensate for excessive dopamine in
individuals who stutter.17,19,20,34,40
Prior to 1990, before researchers investigated the dopamine
hypothesis, most research studies reported on first-generation
medications, such as dopamine antagonists (i.e., neuroleptics;
typical
antipsychotics,
e.g.,
haloperidol)
as
the
primary
fluency-enhancing medications. Unfortunately, these first-
generation, dopamine antagonistic medications that block
dopamine are potentially associated with a variety of adverse
eﬀects, such as sexual dysfunction, dysphoria, extrapyramidal
symptoms, and tardive dyskinesia. These adverse side eﬀects
obviously act to decrease patient/client tolerability and long-
term adherence.53,54,55,56
In 1995, Gordon et al published results about the use of
clomipramine, a medication that works, in part, by blocking the
reuptake of serotonin in the neuronal synapse. They found that
clomipramine had a fluency-enhancing eﬀect in adults who
stuttered.57 Gordon et al's findings suggest that, in addition to
dopamine antagonists, there might have been a therapeutic role
for serotonin-related or serotonergic medications.57,58 During
this same time period, sertraline (Zoloft), which is classified as
a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), was found to
both alleviate59 and induce60 stuttering symptoms.
A decade later in 2005, Stager and her colleagues examined
two medications: (1) pimozide, a first-generation dopamine

blocker, similar to haloperidol (originally studied in 1997), and
(2) paroxetine, an SSRI commonly used to treat depression and
anxiety. Both pimozide and paroxetine had been shown to
improve mood and anxiety, which Stager et al reasoned could
be fluency enhancing.61,62 These researchers investigated the
eﬀects of medications on the speech-related anxiety of 11 AWS
as well as the associations between anxiety and fluency
changes.
Several
important
findings
and
interpretations
emerged from this study. First, pimozide was associated with
significantly more time speaking fluently on the telephone and
significantly shorter average stutter duration compared to base-
line. However, generalized and speech-related anxiety did not
diﬀer from baseline. Half (3/6) of the participants experienced
depression and one-third (2/6) experienced "mood alteration."
As many as 16 other types of side eﬀects were reported by
the participants taking pimozide (e.g., prolactin elevation or
"prolactinemia" and cardiac conduction abnormalities). For the
five AWS who were administered paroxetine throughout the
study, there was no significant fluency improvement observed,
and withdrawal from paroxetine was associated with severe
side eﬀects (e.g., increased anxiety, nausea, blurred vision).62
Given the fact that paroxetine is like clomipramine in that
both inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, it was remarkable that
fluency eﬀects diﬀered: clomipramine was fluency-enhancing
in previous studies,57,58 but paroxetine was not, in the Stager
et al study. Stager and colleagues reasoned that this diﬀerence
was because clomipramine is less selective of a serotonin reuptake
inhibitor than is paroxetine, and clomipramine aﬀects dopamine
metabolism more so than it blocks serotonin reuptake. Based on
their findings, Stager et al concluded that dopaminergic mech-
anisms are more important than serotonergic mechanisms to
explain changes in dysfluency in adults with persistent devel-
opmental stuttering.62
ADRs, known to most laypersons as "side eﬀects," are a key
concern when initiating pharmacotherapy in AWS, or for any
human condition, for that matter, and for good reason. For
example, in 1997, Bloch et al found that four out of seven (57%)
men who stuttered and who adhered to prescribed pimozide
began to develop what the authors termed "marked depressive
symptoms." Although these researchers reported no association
between these ADRs and the specific dose of pimozide, ADRs
resolved when pimozide was discontinued.61
Prior to the 1990s, so-called first-generation medications were
mainly used to treat hallucinations and delusions in schizophrenia
(i.e., antipsychotics, e.g., haloperidol). In the 1990s to early 2000s,
newer medications emerged, labeled as second-generation medi-
cations. These second-generation medications showed promise
by having fewer extrapyramidal ADRs (e.g., tremor, parkinsonism)
in the individuals for whom they are prescribed. In addition to
blocking dopamine receptors, these second-generation antipsy-
chotics also blocked serotonin receptors. Risperidone and olanza-
pine were the two main second-generation medications, both of
which appeared to be fluency-enhancing in AWS20,40,63,64 as well
as in children who stutter.65 In order to understand this set of
studies of second-generation medications, we underscore the
importance of dosage amounts, in what exact milligram (mg)
dosage. Participants who stutter in some studies exhibited what
could be considered paradoxical eﬀects (i.e., risperidone-induced
stuttering when risperidone is intended to treat stuttering), and
dosages exceeding 4 mg could be responsible.66,67
Maguire and associates in 1999 to 2000 were the first to
publish data about risperidone's eﬀect on stuttering. They
conducted
a
randomized,
double-blind,
placebo-controlled
study on the eﬃcacy of risperidone in 16 AWS. Eight partici-
pants received placebo, and eight received risperidone (0.5 mg
once daily at night, gradually increased to 2 mg/d). Findings
indicated significant reductions in stuttering frequency from
baseline (i.e., 50% decrease) for the risperidone group (n = 8)
compared to the placebo group (n = 8). Given what we know
about the importance of the dosage administered, it is notewor-
thy that five participants responded best to only 0.5 mg of
risperidone per day. Notably, stuttering recurred when doses
were increased to 2 mg for these five participants. The remain-
ing three participants spoke most fluently at 2-mg doses.63,64
Although the focus in this chapter is on adults, a child case
study illustrates the beneficial eﬀects of proper dosage of
risperidone. The case was a 4-year-old boy with a familial
history of bipolar disorder. He presented with severe aggressive
behaviors (i.e., temper tantrums, biting, kicking) that did not
resolve with behavioral treatment. The boy also stuttered
severely, so his doctor administered 0.25 mg of risperidone.
One week later, the boy reportedly returned with improved
behavior and complete remission of the stuttering. His physician
further reported that discontinuing by tapering oﬀthe risperidone
led to a return of the boy's stuttering, although not to the severity
documented prior to treatment.68 Although it is possible that
changing nonspeech behaviors (e.g., aggressive behaviors, in this
case study) led to improvement in the child's speech fluency, find-
ing that it was a rapid change suggests that the dopamine blocker
medication was responsible. In summary, several studies have
shown the fluency facilitation eﬀects of risperidone in individuals
who stutter.68,69,70
Olanzapine, also a second-generation dopamine blocker, has
been eﬀective in reducing symptoms of stuttering. Support for
olanzapine's eﬃcacy are based on findings from both individual/
case and group studies. We provide one example of each here. In
an older case study of a 37-year-old veteran with psychosis and
stuttering associated with postconcussive syndrome, this man's
stuttering showed noticeable improvement after initiation of
olanzapine.71 An example of a group study took place in 2004
when Maguire and associates studied 23 AWS who completed a
12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
conducted at two separate sites. Participants received either
placebo or olanzapine (2.5 mg titrated to 5 mg) and they were
closely monitored for ADRs. Stuttering severity and associated
socio-emotional and cognitive symptoms were significantly
improved as compared to placebo on doses between 2.5 and
5 mg, but an average of 5 kg in weight gain was observed. It
should be noted that olanzapine has both a diﬀerent tolerability
profile and a diﬀerent ADR profile than risperidone. More
recently in 2013, a team of researchers in Tehran, Shayganne-
jad and associates, published a randomized control trial
(single-blind) comparing the eﬀects of olanzapine to haloper-
idol in 93 individuals who stutter, between 10 and 50 years
of age. They found that olanzapine, when compared to haloperi-
dol (i.e., a first-generation medication), was associated with a
significantly greater reduction in stuttering score from baseline.
These researchers expressed caution that olanzapine could
worsen stuttering in patients who are on antidepressants or
who have preexisting brain pathology. Regarding ADRs, they also
Pharmacological Considerations for the Treatment of Stuttering
246

noted that olanzapine is associated with weight gain, but that
sedation eﬀects are lower than with haloperidol.72
Ziprasidone, asenapine, aripiprazole, and lurasidone are
examples of alternative second-generation dopamine antagonist
medications with seemingly more tolerable ADR profiles than
olanzapine.73,74,75,76 A recent case report demonstrated that
ziprasidone may be an eﬀective, well-tolerated medication for
treating stuttering.73 Asenapine, a newer dopamine antagonist
medication, has been reported to be less associated with signifi-
cant weight gain and metabolic side eﬀects. Furthermore, in a
limited open-label trial study, three participants who were
administered asenapine demonstrated improved fluency when
on a well-tolerated dose.74 Aripiprazole is another unique medi-
cation that acts as a partial D2 agonist, acts on certain serotonin
receptors, and is FDA approved for TS in children and adults.
There are published case reports of aripiprazole demonstrating
its safety and eﬃcacy in treating stuttering75,77,78 including,
again, in eﬃcacious dosages.79 However, the potential side eﬀect
of akathisia (i.e., a state of restlessness and agitation) limits its
tolerability.78 Lurasidone is another newer dopamine antagonist
that, in a small open-label study in individuals with stuttering,
showed improvement in reported stuttering symptoms.76,80
In general, the tolerability of second-generation dopamine
blockers varies among individuals. A reasonable approach
would be for a physician to prescribe lurasidone or aripiprazole
as first-line medications in order to minimize the risks of
weight gain and metabolic abnormalities. Based on findings of
peer-reviewed studies as well as the authors' experience,
▶Table 15.6 presents the top six choices for a psychiatrist or
physician to consider when deciding about second-generation
dopamine antagonist medications for a patient who stutters. In
our determination of such choices, we have given careful con-
sideration to each medication's primary indications and ranked
each ADR from minimal to significant. Other considerations in
▶Table 15.6 involve the relative strength of eﬃcacy, also
ranked from minimal to clinically significant.
Another line of research regarding dopamine-blocking medi-
cations for stuttering involves ecopipam. Ecopipam blocks
dopamine D1 receptors and thus has a lowered risk of extrapyr-
amidal symptoms than do medications that block D2 receptors.
Furthermore, ecopipam is not associated with weight gain,
a common consequence of olanzapine and other second-
generation dopamine antagonists. Maguire and associates in
2019 published preliminary findings of a phase I, open-label
experimental study of ecopipam, suggesting the need for a
future double-blind and randomized control clinical trials (i.e.,
phase II-type studies).82 In this phase I study, five men with
moderate to very severe stuttering participated. They were
administered an initial dose of 50 mg of ecopipam daily at
bedtime. If this dose was well tolerated and there was no
reported improvement in their symptoms of stuttering, it was
increased to 100 mg. If there was reported diﬃculty tolerating

15.5 Medications for Stuttering: A Historical Perspective
247

100 mg of ecopipam, the dosage was reduced to 50 mg per day.
At 4 weeks and at 8 weeks post-baseline, stuttering and ecopipam
tolerability was assessed, and no ADRs were of concern.
Most germane to the present discussion, ecopipam was
associated with a significant reduction in stuttering frequency
in %SS. Participants with moderate stuttering made significant
fluency gains in reading and spontaneous speech; however,
those with very severe stuttering at baseline exhibited smaller
reductions, that is, a more modest 4- to 8-point reductions in
the Stuttering Severity Instrument, Fourth Edition scores.
Findings indicated that ecopipam, compared to baseline, was
associated with the following changes: (1) reduced %SS in both
reading and spontaneous speaking; (2) faster completion of
oral reading; (3) reduced duration of instances of stuttering;
(4) improved attitudes as per the use of the Overall Assessment
of the Speaker's Experience of Stuttering.81 Findings were taken
to support the need for a larger sample, double-blind, random-
ized, controlled clinical trial to examine the eﬃcacy of ecopipam
in treating stuttering.82,83,84
15.6 The Eﬀect of Medications
Prescribed for Other Conditions on
Stuttering
Given that many medical conditions are treated with pharma-
cotherapy, it is no surprise that individuals who stutter may be
prescribed medications for conditions other than stuttering. In
some cases, the condition for which an individual is medicated
is a condition unrelated to stuttering. In other cases, medica-
tions may be prescribed for conditions that more commonly
co-occur with stuttering and are more related to overall commu-
nication and educational progress, such as attention deficit hyper-
activity disorder (ADHD). When we assess clients/patients known
to stutter or suspected to be stuttering, we ask them to report
medication(s) that they take and the dosages per day. This helps
determine whether medications known to be associated with the
onset or exacerbation of stuttering symptoms (i.e., iatrogenic) are
part of the individual's diagnostic profile. Conversely, as we have
reviewed earlier, medications could also be associated with
amelioration of stuttering symptoms. Stuttering symptom amel-
ioration could either be planned by the client's/patient's health
caregiver/provider or could occur in a serendipitous manner.
The conditions discussed in this section that appear to have
some medication relationship to stuttering are as follows:
(1) schizophrenia, bipolar, anxiety, and major depressive disor-
der; (2) TS; (3) ADHD; and (4) infections (e.g., strep). In 2015,
Lustig and Ruiz published guidelines for SLPs on drug-induced
movement disorders (DIMDs) including cautions about medica-
tions prescribed for various conditions.85 Parkinsonism or extrap-
yramidal symptoms are a potential iatrogenic result of certain
neuroleptic or antipsychotic medications, an important topic that
we turn to next.
15.6.1 Parkinsonism versus Parkinson's
Disease and "Stuttering"
Earlier in the chapter, we explained how dopamine antagonists
are often the medications of choice to help treat stuttering.
However, movement abnormalities (e.g., tremor, changes in
tone, rate) are potential ADRs associated with the use of dopa-
mine antagonists. DIMDs are characterized by a variety of
symptoms (e.g., tremors, spasms, extrapyramidal symptoms).
DIMDs are involuntary movements that may occur shortly
after the medication is administered; may be delayed by
weeks, months, or even years; and vary in severity (i.e., mild
to severe). DIMDs are iatrogenic and take many forms, but can
be categorized into two types:
●Extrapyramidal symptoms, which include akathisia (i.e.,
agitation, restlessness), dystonia (i.e., involuntary muscle
contractions), and dyskinesia (i.e., diﬃculties with muscle
movement). Likely, the ADR leading to acquired stuttering or
even exacerbated developmental stuttering is an iatrogenic
concern related to dyskinesia.
●Parkinsonianlike symptoms, which occur when there is no
formal, previous diagnosis of PD but there is observation of
delayed motor initiation, slow completion, gait shuﬄing/
stooped posture, micrographia (i.e., tiny handwriting), muscle
rigidity, and/or tremor. The drug-induced tremor is often less
severe than that which occurs in PD. Also, the intentional
tremor type (e.g., when the patient tries to point to
something or lift a spoonful of food) is more often found in
parkinsonism. In contrast, resting tremor type (e.g., when the
patient's hand shakes when it is lying in their lap) is more
often found in PD.85
Other DIMDs and/or related ADRs associated with parkinson-
ism include excessive fatigue, diﬃculty multitasking, altered
breathing patterns, bradykinesia (i.e., slowed facial move-
ments), and tardive dyskinesia (i.e., involuntary body or facial
movements such as rapid blinking or facial contortions).
DIMDs occur more frequently in women than in men and
have more of a sudden onset in parkinsonism, as opposed to
gradual, progressive onset associated with actual PD. DIMDs
can include any number of distinct types of speech disfluencies
or prosodic disturbances.86,87,88,89 If a patient presenting with
drug-induced parkinsonism were to be put on levodopa for a pre-
sumed PD diagnosis, the parkinsonism/extrapyramidal symptoms
are not likely to resolve. This result helps the medical professional
infer that the parkinsonism is likely drug induced/DIMD.85 Just
as dopamine antagonists often alleviate stuttering symptoms,
administering a dopamine agonist such as carbidopa-levodopa
can worsen stuttering or increase speech disfluencies.26,27
15.6.2 Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder,
Major Depressive Disorder, and
Stuttering
Since 1954, neuroleptics (e.g., chlorpromazine) prescribed for
symptoms of schizophrenia have been reported to induce
extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., tremor) as well as stuttering-like
behaviors (e.g., physically tense sound repetitions).90,91 For
example, one report indicated that phenothiazine was prescribed
for two schizophrenic patients (35- and 40-year-old men). An
ADR reportedly followed from this administration of phenothia-
zine whereby both patients began to "stutter."92 The brevity of
many of the case studies makes it diﬃcult to determine what the
acquired stuttering symptoms would have sounded like when
Pharmacological Considerations for the Treatment of Stuttering
248

they first began. Findings from these types of case studies are rel-
evant for SLPs because it helps them be aware that parkinsonism
and extrapyramidal symptoms are the primary ADR of dopamine
antagonists.85,93,94
Consistent with previously mentioned ADRs regarding drug-
induced stuttering, there are at least two case study reports on
the worsening of stuttering being associated with lithium.
Lithium is a substance used primarily to treat bipolar depres-
sion. Lithium is also used to treat a variety of other psychiatric
illnesses, without specific FDA indications to do so. At present,
lithium's MOA is not entirely known. It is presumed to function by
displacing sodium and calcium ions. Such displacement aﬀects
neurotransmitters, and thus it may impact the dopaminergic as
well as serotonergic, cholinergic, noradrenergic systems. Common
side eﬀects of lithium are lightheadedness and tremor.
One related case study reports on an adult male patient with
developmental stuttering. This patient had previously been
treated with fluoxetine (Prozac) for suspected depression, and
he was later put on lithium for diagnosed bipolar disorder.
When administered lithium, his stuttering became worse.
When lithium was discontinued, his stuttering returned to his
prior baseline level.95
Another case was reported of a 10-year-old boy with a history
of developmental stuttering, bipolar disorder not otherwise
specified (NOS), ADHD, and conduct disorder with recurrent sui-
cidal ideations and increased physical aggression. He had been
administered lithium 150 mg/d at bedtime for bipolar disorder,
which was later increased to 900 mg twice daily. During the time
of the 150 to 1,800 mg/d dose adjustment, the boy's stuttering
worsened severely, but when the dose was reduced to a divided
dose of 600 mg in the morning and 900 mg in the evening, his
stuttering returned to baseline. The authors surmised that the
worsening of his fluency was an ADR of lithium at higher doses.
This 10-year-old patient was on stable doses of other medica-
tions (i.e., risperidone, clonidine), a peptic ulcer medication
(famotidine) and the supplement melatonin, so it was unlikely
that one of these contributed to his stuttering exacerbation.96,97
Again, it is important with these case studies of co-occurring
stuttering plus multiple medications for psychiatric conditions
for the clinician to know details about the other medications pre-
scribed and adhered to and, of course, to know about the client's
exacerbation of stuttering. Such knowledge helps medical pro-
fessionals attempt to reverse such concerns (e.g., exacerbation of
stuttering). For cases like this 10-year-old boy, SLPs are an inte-
gral part of the team to help describe the stuttering onset, its
progression, and severity.
15.6.3 Anxiety Disorders and Stuttering
Individuals who stutter could be treated for a co-occurring
social anxiety disorder, or a generalized anxiety disorder.
Joseph LeDoux, a well-respected researcher on the topic of
emotion, claims that fear is a state of awareness of being in
harm's way, whereas anxiety is an emotion or worry involving
the possibility that threat(s) will cause harm. LeDoux contrib-
uted to the decision made by the Diagnostic Statistical Manual,
Fifth edition (DSM-5) committee to retract and reorganize
certain categories related to anxiety disorders. Now there is a
"fear and anxiety disorder" category in the DSM-5 including
Generalized Anxiety Disorders (i.e., maladaptive feelings about
future threats), Panic Disorders (i.e., including panic attacks;
somatic), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). LeDoux
considers fear and anxiety disorders to be the most prevalent
psychiatric disorder in the United States, aﬀecting as many as
one-fifth of Americans, and with a diagnosis 20 times more
frequently occurring than schizophrenia. Complicating this
picture of fear and anxiety disorders is that it can co-occur (i.e.,
be comorbid) with other disorders in the DSM-5 such as major
depressive disorder.98
Social anxiety has been investigated as it relates to persistent
developmental stuttering. For example, Blumgart et al intro-
duced a study by explaining that social anxiety may be consid-
ered primary (i.e., existing without particular social impetus) or
secondary (i.e., developing because of stuttering experiences).
AWS, when compared to AWNS, have been reported to exhibit
significantly higher prevalence of social phobia (i.e., 50/200 or
25% of AWS in their study identified with social phobia).
Although one cannot rule out the possibility that stuttering
contributes to social phobia, these researchers cautioned that
health care professionals need to treat social phobia in AWS,
whether it is primary or secondary.99
Prevailing pharmacotherapy for anxiety and depression
include the use of SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine) and serotonin-
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, e.g., venlafaxine).
These SSRI and SNRI drugs work by blocking the proteins that are
responsible for gathering leftover serotonin and norepinephrine,
respectively.
Medications, of course, are just one element of the treatment
for anxiety. Counseling or talk therapy is another critical ele-
ment in the treatment of anxiety.98 Meditation is another.100
For about one out of five individuals who stutter who seek out
medications,6 medications can be eﬀective in reducing anxiety/
social phobia symptoms coinciding with or coming from
chronic stuttering. Of course, following scope of practice guide-
lines, only a physician can prescribe and change dosage of med-
ications. The professionals whose scope of practice it is to treat
primary social anxiety, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, and
clinical social workers, would perhaps recommend talk therapy
and medication. We concur with authors who assert that
we achieve the best outcomes of speech treatment when a
co-occurring primary disorder of social anxiety is also treated.99
Iverach and colleagues investigated the relationship between
mental disorders and stuttering treatment outcomes. These
researchers reported that the only subgroup of adult participants
who maintained stuttering treatment benefits for 6 months was
comprised of the participants without a mental disorder. Most
importantly, Iverach et al reported that the presence of anxiety
disorders was associated with situational avoidance following
treatment.101
These findings suggest that the high rate of relapse often
found for AWS may be, in part, due to the presence of anxiety or
other disorders. Specifically, such disorders may be associated
with avoidance of speech practice and social encounters that may,
in turn, contribute to reduced maintenance of the gains made
initially in speech treatment.101 Iverach et al's findings exemplify
how stuttering and co-occurring disorders interact across time.
These interactions require the development of a treatment plan
and the services of an interprofessional practice team that fits this
trajectory. Such a team and an associated dynamic treatment plan
might involve stuttering modification/fluency-shaping approach
15.6 The Eﬀect of Medications Prescribed for Other Conditions on Stuttering
249

counseling and/or medication management to achieve the best
outcome for the client/patient.
What might help treat social anxiety disorder may not lead
to a decrease in stuttering. Antianxiety GABA receptor agents or
anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, have
been investigated with the idea that by reducing co-occurring
anxiety, they might alleviate stuttering. Although these anxiolytics
have been shown to reduce anxiety in the short term, they have
not demonstrated an ability to improve speech fluency, nor do
GABA receptor medications show any benefits over and above that
of placebo.35,102,103 Furthermore, there is evidence that anxiolytic
agents may be associated, at least with certain dosages, with
acquired, drug-induced stuttering. Researchers of veterans from
the Iraq and Afghanistan wars performed careful work separating
out the eﬀects of PTSD and traumatic brain injury (TBI) from the
eﬀects of medications that they were prescribed. These research-
ers reported that anxiolytics were the most likely, and dopamine
receptor blockers the least likely, to trigger acquired stuttering.104
15.6.4 Tourette's Syndrome and
Stuttering
For reducing signs and symptoms of TS, clonidine is a medication
that has some demonstrated eﬃcacy. It has been hypothesized
that clonidine may show similar eﬃcacy in treating stuttering.
However, findings from school-aged children who stutter in a
study by Althaus and colleagues did not support this hypothesis.
Specifically, these researchers reported a nonsignificant diﬀerence
between clonidine and placebo in terms of their eﬀects on objec-
tive measures of stuttering as well as subjective symptom ratings
by parents and teachers.105 These findings suggest that although
TS and stuttering are similar conditions, it is not a simple matter
of prescribing the same medication at the same dosage for both
disorders and expecting significantly improved outcomes of, say,
vocal tics and stuttering respectively. Also, further research of
medications like clonidine in AWS rather than in children who
stutter may be warranted.105 Findings such as these suggests that
although TS and stuttering are similar conditions, it is not a simple
matter of prescribing the same medication at the same dosage for
both disorders.
15.6.5 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder and Stuttering
Medications for ADHD fall into two categories, stimulants (e.g.,
mixed amphetamine salts-see dextroamphetamine sulfate or
Adderall in ▶Table 15.5) and nonstimulants (e.g., atomoxetine
or Strattera). Only a scant literature on (non)stimulants and
stuttering is available. One report suggested that stimulant
medication may worsen stuttering symptoms. This was a case
of a 10-year-old boy with stuttering, ADHD, and TS, wherein
the boy demonstrated increased stuttering, tic behaviors, social
anxiety, and communication-related frustration shortly after
starting dextroamphetamine sulfate. This medication was then
discontinued, and he was started on atomoxetine. Subse-
quently, he demonstrated a 63% reduction in disfluency rate
and a 51% reduction in the proportion of speech behaviors typi-
cal of stuttering. Unfortunately, the change in medications was
also associated with an increase in impulsivity and a decrease
in attention and focusing in the academic setting. This case high-
lights the dilemma that often arises in treating co-occurring
disorders.106
Beginning as early as 1996 when methylphenidate (Ritalin)
was a common medication for ADHD, no significant diﬀerences
were reported between an on- and oﬀ-methylphenidate con-
ditions in the speech rate and overall speech fluency for indi-
viduals with ADHD who had no co-occurring developmental
stuttering.107 Finally, there is one anecdotal report of a pre-
schooler who was treated for stuttering and speech sound
disorder with behavioral concerns. The report indicated that
the child "ceased to stutter after the right prescriptive match
was found to treat his ADHD" (p.11)."108 More research is
sorely needed in regard to the comorbidity of ADHD and stut-
tering. Recent findings from Choi et al suggest that language
skills are an important variable to consider with stuttering
and ADHD genetic predisposition, as they found significantly
lower language scores and positive family histories of ADHD
in a normally fluent (control group) of children when a posi-
tive family history of stuttering was reported.109
15.6.6 Autoimmune Conditions and
Stuttering
The onset of stuttering can result as an autoimmune condition
triggered by an infection, as first reported in a 2010 case study.
A 6-year-old boy with no family history of stuttering experi-
enced a sudden onset of stuttering approximately 1 month after
a documented streptococcal infection (i.e., "strep throat"). The
medical team thought that stuttering symptoms could be a
manifestation of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder
associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), which is an
uncommon, but important, sequelae of streptococcal infections
in some children.
PANDAS is characterized by a waxing-waning course, with
proposed involvement of the basal ganglia, and neuropsychiat-
ric symptoms that often involve ticlike motions. At the time of
diagnosis of PANDAS, the boy's parents declined antibiotics.
Reportedly, the acute onset of sound and syllable repetitions
and blocking was followed by facial grimaces and head
twitches/ticlike behaviors 3 months later. According to the
report, the boy continued to have a positive rapid streptococcus
antigen test 5.5 months after initial diagnosis. Next, he was
administered amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (800 mg/d for 10 days),
and stuttering symptoms resolved within 2 weeks. At that time,
streptococcal throat culture was negative, and the course of anti-
biotics was complete. The authors stated the possibility that in
the process of combating the infection, a cross-reaction could
occur between antibodies and antigens. The speculation the
authors oﬀered was that this cross-reaction interferes with the
developing basal ganglia.110,111 The postulation that PANDAS
may be a cause for at least some forms of stuttering has now
essentially been confirmed by recent research (Alm et al112),
bringing forth the model to screen children at onset of stuttering
for such a possible cause.
To conclude, from the above coverage of co-occurrence of con-
ditions with stuttering, it appears that a key part of assessment
of an individual known or suspected to stutter is to gather infor-
mation on medications, dosage, and adherence. This information
Pharmacological Considerations for the Treatment of Stuttering
250

should help the SLP rule in or rule out ADRs including DIMDs
and other medication eﬀects. Equally important is the need to
report to a medical provider stuttering onsets that occur sud-
denly with the onset/diagnosis of another condition and/or
when medication is administered. Thus, knowing when to refer
to (or consult with) a medical provider is an important skill for
an SLP. Thus far, this section has been centered on prescriptions
including antipsychotics (i.e., some causing DIMDs), antidepres-
sants, antianxiety medications, as well as those for TS, ADHD,
and even antibiotics. Nonprescribed, recreational drugs and
self-medicating behaviors are also worthy of mention.
15.7 Recreational Drugs and
Self-medicating Behaviors
and Stuttering
Results of two large sample studies of AWS indicate that neither
AWS from the community nor AWS on a waitlist to receive
speech therapy exhibit greater substance-use disorders (e.g.,
alcohol use and abuse) than matched controls.113,114 However, a
paucity of literature exists on the potential eﬀects of recreational
substances (e.g., marijuana) on stuttering.114 This is because
so-called Schedule I drugs, such as cocaine and marijuana,46,115
are diﬃcult to study scientifically due to state/federal regula-
tions. Thus, most reports of eﬀects of recreational drugs on stut-
tering have so far come from case reports.
One example of such a case study involved a 16-year-old
adolescent boy who presented with persistent developmental
stuttering with a family history of stuttering, cannabis depend-
ence, and a conduct disorder. Speech therapy was sought to
help improve his overall communication skills, so that he could
achieve healthier relationships. Abstinence from marijuana
became the focus of the speech therapy approach. The authors
reported that after the teen decreased his use of marijuana, but
did not stop use completely, his normal and stuttered disfluen-
cies were fewer. The authors noted that the client became more
critical about and responsive to his own treatment, which
appeared to motivate him to try longer periods of abstinence
from marijuana usage.115
15.8 Future Directions in
Pharmacological Options for
Adults Who Stutter
By now, the reader might have correctly inferred the following.
Although we know quite a lot about pharmacological options
for AWS and related studies, there is far more we do not know.
Many studies, including those cited here, have various interpre-
tative as well as methodological flaws that we can improve
upon, going forward.39,116 Systematic reviews and letters to the
editor exchanges often include controversies over the tolerabil-
ity of medications and how much quality-of-life improvement
could be expected from pharmacotherapy.39,116,117,118 Further-
more, correlation between a medication and either increases or
decreases in stuttering should not be assumed to infer a causal
relation between the medication and stuttering. Certainly, the
onset of a medication and the onset of stuttering or relative
fluency can be remarkable. However, an individual patient/
client may be adhering to multiple medications and/or self-
medicating, circumstances that may contribute to or indeed
cause changes in speech fluency. In short, there are always oth-
er factors to be considered besides the more obvious ones. For
example, therapy including antibiotic and anti-inflammatory
treatments could be warranted for some patients who stutter.
Discussions about medications and treatments require rapport
and trust-building between clinicians and their clients or
patients who stutter. Certainly, ASHA's (American Speech-
Language-Hearing Association) guidelines for ethics, counsel-
ing, interprofessional practice, and scope of practice all apply
to this important topic. The more we involve ourselves with
understanding new classes of medications, the more these
considerations (e.g., ethics, counseling) continue to be critically
important.
We see several future directions as promising. The first is a
class of relatively new medications, known as vesicular
monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors, such as valbe-
nazine and deutetrabenazine. These medications work by
decreasing the synthesis of dopamine through the inhibition
of VMAT2. VMAT2 is a transport protein responsible for pack-
aging dopamine into vesicles, from which dopamine is then
released by neurons into the central nervous system. VMAT
inhibitors have shown eﬃcacy in treating TS, tardive dyskine-
sia, and abnormal movements associated with Huntington's
disease.82,83
Research is now underway to determine whether these med-
ications are safe and may assist in the treatment of stuttering.
Of course, study of these medications would require the appli-
cations of all the ethical and legal guidelines stipulated by the
Institutional Review Board for Human subjects as well as phases
I to IV of randomized controlled trials previously mentioned.
Second, perhaps there is value in further study of a protein
known as homovanillic acid (HVA), which is necessary for dopa-
mine metabolism to occur. Results of an early study hold promise
for further understanding of the presence of HVA in preschool
and school-age children who stutter.119
In terms of interprofessional practice, we as SLPs can oﬀer
valuable information to our colleagues and our clients who
stutter about how, for example, TS is and is not similar to
stuttering. We can oﬀer AWS the information included in this
chapter and help them better appreciate and understand the
available information on medications and stuttering. Follow-
ing the guidelines for SLP scope of practice established by the
ASHA, the SLP needs to be careful, cautious, and circumspect
when a client who stutters asks us about dosage or eﬃcacy of
a medication that he or she is already prescribed, or when we
are asked about the appropriateness of particular medica-
tions for stuttering. Instead of directly responding to such
client inquiries, the SLP must refer the client who stutters to
colleagues in psychiatry, neurology, or other appropriate
branches of the medical profession.
The authors of this chapter are an interprofessional team of
an SLP, psychiatrist/person who stutters, and a psychiatry resi-
dent, and we have enjoyed sharing our knowledge bases. We
believe that the ideal future direction for AWS might follow
these steps:
1. Complete the research phases necessary to get a safe,
tolerable, low/no ADR medication designed for AWS.
15.8 Future Directions in Pharmacological Options for Adults Who Stutter
251

2. Complete the randomized control trials needed to improve
the eﬃcacy and eﬃciency of behavioral treatment, for
example, of stuttering modification and fluency-shaping
treatment approaches.
3. Where possible, appropriately blend (1) + (2) with any
additional treatments needed if there are conditions
co-occurring with stuttering (e.g., talk therapy/Cognitive
Behavior Treatment/Acceptance Commitment Therapy for
anxiety). Others concur with us that the best option for AWS
is to combine behavioral treatments with pharmacotherapy,
when warranted, in interprofessional practice.7,38,41,104
15.9 Conclusions
In closing, we would like to underscore the importance of the
informed wishes of the client when considering pharmaco-
logical options: Has the client had self-help or support group
experiences? How severe is the stuttering? What is the apparent
impact of stuttering on the person's quality of life? Medications
are one therapeutic path that we could recommend be accompa-
nied by behavioral treatment and/or talk therapy, as our fields of
study progress. We have presented here guiding principles so that
clinicians can best help individuals who stutter when we consider
pharmacological options and pharmacological eﬀects.
15.10 Definitions
Adherence:
Refers to taking medications correctly; whether a
patient who is prescribed a medication gets the prescription
filled, remembers to take the correct dosage of medication
on time, while understanding and following any specific
directions about the medication (e.g., take with food).
Adverse drug reactions (ADR):
Also called side eﬀects or
adverse drug events (ADE); such eﬀects are unwanted,
unexpected, or dangerous responses to a drug. ADRs can be
of a gradual or sudden onset.
Aﬃnity:
The extent to which, or strength with which, a
ligand (defined below) binds to a receptor at any given
concentration of that ligand.
Agonist:
A substance that binds to a receptor to induce a
chemical physiologic response.
Akathisia:
A state of agitation, distress, and restlessness that
is an occasional side eﬀect of antipsychotic and antidepres-
sant medications.
Antagonist:
A substance that blocks a receptor, thereby prevent-
ing agonists from acting at the receptor; blocker medications.
Anticholinergic:
That which blocks the action of acetylcholine
in the central and peripheral nervous systems.
Antiemetic:
A medication that prevents vomiting.
Anxiolytics:
Substances that produce a reduction in anxiety.
Apomorphine:
A medication that is a dopamine receptor
agonist; can be used to treat advanced Parkinson's disease.
Barbiturates:
Sedative
and
sleep-inducing
medications;
derivative of barbituric acid.
Basal ganglia:
Basal nuclei, consisting of the corpus striatum
(i.e., caudate nucleus and putamen) and global pallidus
(▶Table 15.3).
Benzodiazepines:
Anxiolytic
medications
with
addictive
properties that work by acting as an agonist at the GABA-A
receptor; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicated for
treatment of panic attacks and alcohol withdrawal syndro-
me; nonbenzodiazepines are similar without the addictive
properties, and are prescribed for anxiety and for sleep.
Blood-brain barrier (BBB):
The means by which the central
nervous system (CNS) is isolated from surrounding tissues.
The inner layer of BBB involves a tightly sealed, continuous
capillary endothelial cell layer, the middle layer, a basal lam-
ina surrounding the endothelial cell layer, and on the outer-
most layer, astrocytic processes that envelope the capillary.
Molecules that are too large and/or those smaller molecules
that are not easily transported by the endothelial cells are
blocked from entering the CNS due to the protection of the
BBB. Lipid-soluble (i.e., fat-soluble, not water-soluble, like
aspirin or amoxicillin) molecules are endothelial cell trans-
ported and thus cross the BBB. Most medications discussed
here are lipid soluble and thus cross the BBB.
Bradykinesia:
Slowness of movement; a cardinal manifesta-
tion of Parkinson's disease.
Blinded study:
An experimental study in which subjects do
not know if they are receiving a treatment or placebo (and
are thus "blinded"), to reduce the bias that such knowledge
might have on the subjects' responses.
Catecholamine:
An amine class including several neurotrans-
mitters—dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin—produced
in the adrenal glands and elsewhere in the sympathetic nerv-
ous system.
Cholinergic:
That which precipitates or enhances the action of
acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous systems.
Dopamine:
A neurotransmitter of the catecholamine class
with many functions, for example, learning, attention,
reward, and motivation-related pathways in the brain. See
▶Table 15.1 and ▶Table 15.2 for more explanation of dopa-
mine compared to other neurotransmitters and types of
dopamine, respectively.
Downregulation:
The process by which consistent overstimu-
lation of a receptor on a cell leads the cell to produce fewer
of the receptors, thereby leading to a marked reduction in
the number of receptors that are available.
Drug-induced parkinsonism:
A type of DIMD (see drug-
induced movement disorders, DIMDs), this is motor system
dysfunction caused by medications that deplete dopaminer-
gic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain (such as
D2 receptor blockers). Symptoms associated with DMID
mimic those of Parkinson's disease, but diﬀer in important
ways (e.g., onset).
Dyskinesia:
Abnormality or impairment of voluntary move-
ment, typically due to neurological disease or a side eﬀect of
a medication.
Dyslipidemia:
Abnormal amount, usually elevated, of lipids,
such as cholesterol or triglycerides, in the blood.
Dysphoria:
A general unease or dissatisfaction with one's life.
Dystonia:
abnormal muscle tone resulting in muscular spasm
and/or abnormal posture, typically due to neurological dis-
ease or a side eﬀect of a medication.
Extrapyramidal system:
Composed of fibers or tracts that do
not directly course through the pyramidal tract of the medulla,
but are responsible for motoric control; includes the indirect
pathways from the cortex, feedback loops, and the descending
pathways that are auditory-visual-vestibular.
Pharmacological Considerations for the Treatment of Stuttering
252

Extrapyramidal
symptoms:
Symptoms such as
tremors,
involuntary movements, and muscle contractions belonging
to
Parkinson's
disease
and
parkinsonism
(see
drug-
induced parkinsonism), these can be associated with dop-
amine blockers.
Festination:
A characteristic of Parkinson's disease; the ten-
dency, when performing repetitive movements, to speed up
the movement and perform it with decreased amplitude.
First-generation antipsychotic medications:
Primarily used
to treat hallucinations and delusions in disorders such as
schizophrenia, these are also called "typical" antipsychotics, as
they are an older class of antipsychotics than second-
generation or "atypical" antipsychotics.
Fluorodopamine (F-DOPA):
A fluorinated form of levodopa
(L-DOPA). When parkinsonism is suspected, F-DOPA is used
as a radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) to
image the dopaminergic nerve terminals in the striatum.
GABA-A receptor:
A receptor at which the primary endoge-
nous inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) is an agonist; it is also the site of agonist
actions of alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines.
Heterogeneity of stuttering:
The high degree of behavioral,
symptomatic, etc., variability within and across people who
stutter. Such variability may be caused or manifested by diﬀer-
ences in the onset, development, and maintenance of stutter-
ing. For example, such variation may be observed when a
person who stutters exhibits diﬀerences in stuttering duration,
frequency, severity, and types of disfluency (i.e., sound prolon-
gations, sound/syllable repetition, etc.) from one speaking or
reading task to the next, or from one day or week to the next,
without any apparent or known reason for doing so.
Homovanillic acid (HVA):
An organic compound (specifically a
catecholamine and a metabolite) included when considering
neurotransmitters such as epinephrine and dopamine. HVA
is the product of the action of first monoamine oxidase and
then catechol-O-methyltransferase on dopamine. HVA is
associated with dopamine levels in the brain.
Iatrogenic:
Greek for the concept of "bringing forth by a
healer." This concept or word refers to eﬀects that result from
health care professionals' use of products or services with the
intent of gaining health benefits, but which negatively aﬀects
some behavior/condition of the patient (e.g., a worsening of
developmental stuttering or acquired stuttering).
Internal validity:
The degree to which the independent varia-
ble is responsible for aﬀecting the dependent variable in
research design; related to limiting nuisance variables like
placebo eﬀect.
Ligand: A substance that binds to a receptor.
Mechanism of Action (MOA):
Also known as mode of action
(MOA); this refers to how a substance acts upon or binds to
specific molecular targets (e.g., receptor, enzyme). An MOA
is a logical or reasoned attempt to explain how a medica-
tion/agent yields a reported or observed pharmacological
eﬀect.
Micrographia:
The condition of having progressively smaller
handwriting or abnormally small, cramped handwriting;
commonly associated with neurodegenerative disorders of
the basal ganglia, such as Parkinson's disease.
Necessity-concerns:
Somewhat similar to the notion of cost-
to-benefits ratio, this notion suggests that adherence to a
treatment is influenced by one's implicit beliefs regarding
personal need for the treatment and implicit concerns
about the potential adverse eﬀects of the treatment.
Neuroleptics:
Antipsychotics; eﬀects can be both intended
(e.g., reduction in confusion and agitation) or unintended
ADRs (e.g., a state of apathy, lack of initiative, and limited
range of emotion).
Nucleus accumbens:
A region in the brain that is a component
of the basal ganglia. it has a significant role in the cognitive
processing of motivation, aversion, reward, and reinforcement.
"Oﬀ-label":
The use of a medication to treat a disorder or
symptom, for which it does not have an FDA indication.
"Open-label" extension study:
An investigation planned to
occur after a double-blind, randomized controlled drug trial
has occurred and before requesting FDA approval. These
types of studies append to, or extend, a randomized con-
trolled clinical trial. No blinding is used in these types of
studies and all parties (i.e., patient and physician) are aware
of the treatment groups (i.e., "open label"). Such open-label
studies are sometimes referred to as "unblinded." Unblinding
means that the participant and/or study team is told which
treatment the participant received during the trial, and the
medicine is under an investigational new drug license.
Paradoxical drug eﬀects:
Alterations in observing an oppo-
site clinical eﬀect (e.g., exacerbating stuttering symptoms)
than the desired clinical eﬀect (e.g., ameliorating stuttering
symptoms).
Parkinson's disease:
A progressive disease of the nervous
system caused by the destruction of cells that are responsible
for producing dopamine in the substantial nigra of the mid-
brain, leading to characteristic motor system dysfunction,
hallmarked by tremor, diﬃculty initiating movement, slow-
ness of movement, and diﬃcult walking.
Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated
with streptococcal infections (PANDAS):
A clinical diagnosis
in children, roughly from about 3-year-olds to puberty, in
which health care providers use diagnostic criteria to deter-
mine the presence of such concerns as obsessive compulsive
disorder (OCD) or a tic disorder (i.e., Tourette's syndrome), or
both. PANDAS can be associated with group A beta-hemolytic
strep infection, such as a positive throat culture for strep or
history of scarlet fever, and with neurological abnormalities,
such as physical hyperactivity or unusual, jerky movements
that are not in the child's control. PANDAS can have a very
abrupt onset or be associated with worsening of symptoms
(i.e., no lab tests can diagnose PANDAS, but blood tests may
be ordered to determine if there was a prior strep infection).
Pedunculopontine nucleus:
Part of the reticular activating
system, this nucleus is located in the brainstem, in the upper
pons. this nucleus has two divisions of subnuclei, the pars
compacta of cholinergic neurons and the pars dissipata of
mostly glutamatergic neurons.
Persistent developmental stuttering:
Developmental stutter-
ing (that typically onsets in childhood) that has not resolved
spontaneously, or which persists despite speech therapy.
Pharmacodynamics:
Described as what a drug does to the
body versus what the body does to the drug (i.e., pharma-
cokinetics), this is the study of the physiologic/molecular
and biochemical eﬀects of substances. Subtopics relating to
pharmacodynamics include receptor sensitivity, receptor
15.10 Definitions
253

binding, post-receptor eﬀects, and chemical interactions. Phar-
macodynamics can be aﬀected by physiologic changes due to
aging, drug interactions, and a given disorder or disease.
Pharmacokinetics:
Described as what the body does to the
drug versus what a drug does to the body (i.e., pharmacody-
namics), this is the study of the process of the uptake of the
substance, when eﬀects of a medication wears oﬀ, what
biotransformations the medications undergo, and how their
metabolites are distributed in tissues and eliminated.
Pharmacotherapy:
Medical treatment with pharmacologic
agents (medications), sometimes referred to as drug therapy.
Placebo:
A
sham or an inert substance or
treatment
intended to have no benefits therapeutically (e.g., sugar
pills, saline injections); such substances are important
with regard to research design considerations. Placebos
are typically provided to volunteer participants in phase
III portion of a randomized controlled trial for a medica-
tion to determine whether the medication is more eﬀec-
tive therapeutically than the substance having no known
benefit; see internal validity/controlling placebo eﬀect.
Prolactinemia:
A state of elevated levels of the hormone
prolactin, which is produced by the pituitary gland and is
responsible for breast development during pregnancy.
Red nucleus:
Part of the extrapyramidal motor system in the
basal ganglia along with the substantia nigra, this nucleus is
in the tegmentum of the midbrain; it is termed "red"
because in cadaver views it is pale pink, due to ferritin and
hemoglobin (i.e., iron); functions in motor coordination and
in the gait of primates.
Schedule-I drugs:
A classification of drugs used by the U.S.
drug enforcement agency (DEA) for drugs that have no cur-
rently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse
(e.g., heroin, cannabis).
Schizophrenia:
A psychotic illness hallmarked by delusional
beliefs, hallucinations, blunted aﬀect, and a variety of other
symptoms.
Second-generation
antipsychotic
medications:
Primarily
used to treat hallucinations and delusions in disorders such
as schizophrenia, these are also called "atypical" antipsy-
chotics. Compared to first-generation "typical" antipsy-
chotics, second-generation antipsychotics are newer in the
origins and usage.
Social anxiety disorder:
Also called social phobia, a psychiatric
diagnosis characterized by fear and anxiety of being evaluated
negatively by other people, marked impairment in everyday
functioning and significant distress.
Substantia nigra:
Latin for "black substance," named as such
because it appears darker than adjacent regions due in part
to elevated dopaminergic neuron levels. it is part of the
extrapyramidal motor system, together with the red nucleus,
produces and sends dopamine to the striatum.
Subthalamic nucleus:
Thought to be part of the extrapyrami-
dal motor system in the subthalamus of the basal ganglia,
this nucleus is a small and lens-shaped nucleus, and its
function is unknown.
Tardive dyskinesia:
A rare but serious side eﬀect of neurolep-
tic medications that is characterized by involuntary and
uncontrollable movements of the face or body (e.g., sticking
one's tongue out); risk of occurrence increases with length of
time of neuroleptic use.
Tricyclic antidepressants:
An early class of antidepressant
medications, which often have broad indications beyond
depression (e.g., pain, insomnia) and which are associated
with many side eﬀects, especially anticholinergic eﬀects.

Abstract
The purpose of this chapter is to provide updated information
on cluttering, a fluency disorder that is often misunderstood
and misdiagnosed. Updated definitions and research findings
will be presented to provide latest information about the best
clinical practices. The chapter begins with a case study of a
teenager who is referred for an evaluation due to decreased
speech intelligibility. The case is woven throughout the chapter
to illustrate all aspects of client management: initial referral,
evaluation and diﬀerential diagnosis, treatment, and education
of the client, family members, and other professionals. The case
reflects the challenges a clinician often encounters with a
client's resistance to treatment. As the chapter illustrates, part
of this resistance may be due to the nature of cluttering
symptoms, and partly due to prior missed diagnoses and failed
treatments. The chapter provides background on how our
knowledge of cluttering has evolved, and the need for it to
continue in the future. Additionally, methods for evaluation, dif-
ferential diagnosis, and treatment of cluttering are presented.
Background on the past and present state of cluttering research
provides the context for what we do and do not know about
cluttering, and for making the best decisions in treatment. The
overall focus is to help the clinician better understand how to
(1) identify cluttered speech and (2) treat the client with clutter-
ing in a holistic manner, based upon symptom presentation.

16.1 Introduction
The Referral: Peter
Peter was a high school junior who was concerned about his
grade on a recent classroom presentation. His history teacher
stated that he spoke too fast and wanted him to correct this
issue for his next presentation. Peter, an honors student, was
frustrated at what he felt was his inability to control his rate. He
also did not agree that he spoke quickly. His parents noted that
he did speak fast at times, which made him diﬃcult to under-
stand. When Peter's parents would tell him to slow down, he
would respond that they should, "Listen faster." He said that no
one else was telling him that they could not understand his
speech.
Peter's mother was frustrated and wanted to help her son. She
did an online search for "fast speech." The term "cluttering" came
up. She read the description and wondered if this could be her
son's problem. She called a speech-language clinician who speci-
alized in cluttering to inquire about a possible evaluation. Before
we delve into the evaluation, the reader will need some back-
ground information on how cluttering came to be defined as it is
today.
16.1.1 Common Characteristics of
Cluttering: Past and Present
History
Experts have discussed the topic of cluttering for much longer
than most people are aware. A description of this history will
demonstrate how in diﬀerent time periods, and in diﬀerent
parts of the world, characteristics associated with cluttering
were similar. We begin by sharing information about the well-
known Demosthenes, the Greek orator, who lived more than
300 years before the common era (384-322 BC). People
working in the field of fluency disorders might know that
Demosthenes stuttered, but fewer people know about his
cluttering, which was characterized at the time by reduced
intelligibility, weak voice, short breaths, and an inability to
focus on the main point of discourse.1 The famous actor and
voice teacher, Satyros, reportedly "cured" Demosthenes of his
cluttering. It is worth questioning what "cured" meant in this
context since even in the present day we have no documenta-
tion of people being "cured" of cluttering.
The first complete book devoted to cluttering was titled "Das
Poltern" (German word for cluttering2). In this book, Richard
Luchsinger explained cluttering as a "mismatch" between a
speaker's intention (i.e., what they want to say) and their ability
to produce it (i.e., control of speech production). Another
pioneering book by Deso Weiss, "Cluttering," was published in
1964.1 Weiss explained cluttering as a central language imbal-
ance. Weiss' holistic perspective on the treatment of cluttering
influenced the work of many researchers and clinicians around
the world.
Current Definition of Cluttering
Original definitions of cluttering described the speaker as some-
one with a "syndrome" who was messy and disorganized, or
constantly interrupting conversation.1 Because this description
was so broad, however, it became diﬃcult to distinguish clut-
tering from other communication disorders.
In a quest to uncover the distinctive features of cluttering,
core symptoms upon which fluency experts could agree were
identified.3,4,5,6 These were the symptoms that stood out when
an expert said, "I know cluttering when I hear it." These symp-
toms were always present (albeit not always in the same speak-
ing situations) in cluttering. Based on the data of 15 participants
who cluttered (ranging in age from 11 to 37 years), the most
commonly occurring symptoms of cluttering were identified,
resulting in the lowest common denominator (LCD) definition of
cluttering (note that the parenthetical numbers in the definition
refer to the notes that appear directly underneath it)6:
Definition
Cluttering is a fluency disorder wherein segments of conversa-
tion (1) in the speaker's native language (2) typically are perceived
259

as too fast overall (3), too irregular (4), or both. The segments of
rapid and/or irregular speech rate must further be accompanied
by one or more of the following: (a) excessive "normal" disfluencies
(5); (b) excessive collapsing (6) or deletion of syllables; and/or (c)
abnormal pauses, syllable stress, or speech rhythm (pp. 241-242).
Notes
1. Cluttering must occur in naturalistic conversation, but it need
not occur even a majority of the time. Clear but isolated
examples that exceed those observed in normal speakers are
suﬃcient for a diagnosis.
2. This may also apply to the speaker's mastered and habitual
non-native language, especially in multilingual living
environments.
3. This may be true even though syllable rates may not exceed
those of normal speakers.
4. Synonyms for irregular rate include "jerky," or "spurty."
5. These disfluencies are often observed in smaller numbers in
normal speakers and are typically not observed in stuttering.
6. Collapsing includes, but is not limited to, excessive shortening,
"telescoping," or "over-coarticulating" various syllables,
especially in multisyllabic words.
Under this definition, speech that is rapid sounding or "perceived
as too fast overall" is a mandatory criterion for a diagnosis of
cluttering. Note that although this criterion is mandatory, the
speaker does not have to present with a rapid or irregular rate in
all or even most speaking situations (see note 1 above).6 People
who clutter may be perceived as having a rate that is more rapid
than average, yet objective measures of speech rate do not
often exceed the average. Thus, there is something else about
cluttering that makes the listener perceive the rate as "fast."7
One widely held hypothesis is that speakers with cluttering are
speaking at a rate that is too fast for their speech production
system to handle.8 Such a challenge results in a communication
breakdown that sounds "too fast" to the listener.8 The resulting
symptoms that come with a "too fast" rate may be what makes
the listener say, "That person speaks quickly!"
It is important to note that cluttering may occur in people
with additional diagnoses. One of the most commonly reported
co-occurring disorders in cluttering is stuttering. Some of the
other co-occurring diagnoses may include but are not limited to
expressive and/or receptive language disorder, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Not all
individuals with cluttering have these diagnoses, and not every-
one with these diagnoses exhibits cluttering. To avoid confusing
symptoms of cluttered speech with symptoms of other disor-
ders, the clinician is advised to focus on the criteria in the LCD
definition above. Symptoms related to other disorders, such as a
receptive and/or expressive language disorder or stuttering,
should be further evaluated as potential concomitant diagnoses.
Prevalence
The exact prevalence of cluttering is uncertain. However,
because there is such a lack of understanding about cluttering
among many professionals, both combined stuttering/cluttering
and pure cluttering (i.e., cluttering without any additional
disorders; see the section "Co-Occurring Symptoms/Disorders"
below) are likely underdiagnosed. Experts estimate that fewer
than 5% of cases referred for stuttering exhibit "pure cluttering,"9
although a more recent study found the prevalence to be
approximately 1.2% among Dutch and German adolescents.10
Research has further revealed that approximately 40% of individ-
uals with Down syndrome exhibit excessive disfluencies and 12
to 19% of these individuals were subsequently diagnosed with
cluttering or mixed cluttering/stuttering.11
16.2 Diagnostic Considerations
The LCD definition allows the practicing clinician to diﬀerenti-
ate cluttered speech from characteristics that might be related
to other disorders. However, careful attention to diﬀerential di-
agnosis is still required when diagnosing cluttering.
Talking with Peter's Parents
Peter's mother was convinced that her son was cluttering, but
Peter's dad was skeptical. Peter had been evaluated by his school
clinician and did not meet the school's criteria for any services.
The parents asked for a conference call with the speech-language
clinician who specialized in cluttering. During that call, the
clinician asked for Peter's speech history. Peter was a "late talker"
who received services as a preschooler for articulation diﬃculties.
Peter's parents could not recall the sounds Peter had worked on.
Peter's dad reported that when Peter was younger, his speech
sounded like someone who had a hearing impairment. His
mother did not have this perception. Peter's parents believed that
when Peter slowed down, his speech was clear. Both agreed that
his speech could sound "mumbled" at times. Peter's parents
reported that Peter argued that their inability to understand him
was due to their inadequate hearing.
Peter's mother wanted to schedule an evaluation as soon as
possible. She felt that even though Peter was not expressing any
perceived problems, his frustration when others asked him to
repeat or commented on his speech was becoming very apparent.
She felt this frustration was carrying over into other activities,
causing Peter to "shut down" and communicate less. His father
was more hesitant. He knew that Peter was resistant to pursuing
help with his speech, and he wanted to make sure that Peter was
going to get an accurate diagnosis without more wasted time.
Peter's dad was concerned that too many attempts in the "wrong
direction" would close his son oﬀto the idea of treatment.
16.2.1 Important Background
Information
When determining whether cluttering is the issue, the clini-
cian should be cautious, as there are many factors that can
contribute to decreased speech intelligibility. Given the state-
ment about potential issues with prosody (i.e., client's possi-
ble history of sounding like he had a hearing impairment) and
previous work on speech sounds, the clinician considered a
possible diagnosis of mild childhood apraxia of speech. Peter's
parents said this diagnosis had never been brought up to
them. There were no current articulation errors. Due to the
mention of prosody, the clinician also wanted to rule out any
resonance issues that might be contributing to decreased
intelligibility. Peter's dad's concern about too many eﬀorts in
the wrong direction was not unfounded; many adults who
clutter report frustration with wasted time and eﬀorts with
inaccurate diagnoses.12,13

260

16.2.2 Continuous or Intermittent
Rapid or Irregular Speech Rate
In making a diagnosis of cluttering, the clinician wanted to
ensure that Peter had the mandatory speech characteristic for
people with cluttering: his speech sounds fast at least some of
the time. If Peter never sounded fast, there would be no support
for a diagnosis of cluttering. It is important to note that just as
in stuttering, cluttering does not have to occur each time the
speaker talks to warrant a diagnosis. In fact, under the LCD defi-
nition, the cluttered moments do not even have to occur most
of the time.6 Just as you will read elsewhere in this book that
stuttering is situational, so too is cluttering. The clinician also
wanted to ensure that Peter had at least one of the following
diﬃculties: excessive "normal" disfluencies, excessive moments
of over-coarticulation, and/or atypical pauses.
16.2.3 Excessive "Normal" Disfluencies
Normal disfluencies (NDs; i.e., nonstuttering disfluencies) are
defined as interjections (e.g., "uh," "um," etc.), multisyllabic
word repetitions without tension, phrase repetitions, and
revisions. These should be contrasted with stuttering-like
disfluencies, which consist of within-word repetitions, pro-
longations, and blocks (see ▶Chapter 1).
NDs can come from many diﬀerent sources, such as helping a
speaker gather their thoughts or retrieve a word. However, if
NDs are used "excessively," speakers are likely to transmit their
messages ineﬃciently. In this case, diﬃculties with retrieval/
language organization, which may require language treatment,
must be ruled out. Language testing can help ascertain this
question objectively. The clinician's informal assessment of the
speaker's performance during reading, conversation, retelling a
story, and monologue samples is also crucial for a comprehen-
sive evaluation of cluttering. Does the speaker use NDs when
less language formulation is required, such as when reading?
Does the speaker use vague terms or need additional time to
formulate the remaining part of the sentence? Is the speaker's
message disorganized and diﬃcult to follow?
People who stutter may use excessive numbers of NDs to
escape or avoid moments of stuttering. This does not, by
default, make them people with cluttering. However, if a
speaker has a propensity to stutter and clutter, then establish-
ing the root cause of the excessive NDs is necessary for the
accurate diagnosis and eﬀective management of cluttering. If
someone has a combination of stuttering and cluttering, and
engages in stuttering avoidance behaviors, the stuttering
avoidance must be addressed first. Objective testing and an
interview will help identify whether the speaker has symp-
toms of cluttering and/or stuttering, including use of NDs as
stuttering avoidance.
16.2.4 Excessive Moments of
Over-Coarticulation
A hallmark cluttering symptom is that the client's speech often
sounds "mumbled." This is the listener's perception of over-
coarticulation, whereby the speaker runs one word into the
next one, blending sounds or syllables so that some sounds
and/or syllables are deleted (this is also referred to as telescoping).
This is likely a consequence of the speaker speaking at a rate that
is too fast for their system to handle.8 However, additional speech
disorders might cause this lack of clarity. To diﬀerentiate a severe
articulation or phonological disorder from cluttering, the clinician
must consider, for example, whether the client is dropping sylla-
bles due to a phonological disorder (e.g., weak syllable deletion
and/or final consonant deletion) or over-coarticulation. The clini-
cian must also consider whether speech errors or distortions are
due to apraxia of speech, dysarthria, or perhaps a severe vocalic
/r/ distortion, as all these disorders can impact intelligibility.
An important distinction the clinician must consider during
an assessment is that if a client's over-coarticulation is due to
cluttering, then decreasing the rate by inserting natural pauses
will eliminate or significantly reduce symptoms. Although
reducing rate should also decrease some of the symptoms of
dysarthria and/or apraxia of speech, the motor patterns exhib-
ited by these disorders will remain. Additionally, even with a
reduced rate, phonological disorders and/or articulation errors
will continue to be present on a fairly consistent basis. Unlike
other speech sound disorders, with cluttering decreased intelli-
gibility will often be correlated with an increased rate rather
than with the ability to correctly produce specific sounds
or words. This is not to say that those who clutter may not have
words that they find diﬃcult to produce (often multisyllabic
words), but rather that this correlation links more to rate than
to the ability to correctly produce specific words or sounds.
The clinician should also rule out any type of resonance
issue, such as cul-de-sac resonance. Resonance issues are not
characteristic of cluttering and should be diﬀerentiated from
cluttering as a cause of decreased intelligibility. Such issues
are related to diﬀerences in the structure and/or function of
the velopharyngeal mechanism. In those instances, evaluation
by a craniofacial team is warranted.
16.2.5 Atypical Pauses
Atypical pauses are those which occur in places not expected
syntactically. It has been suggested that people who clutter do
not pause as much as typical speakers.14 Therefore, if they speak
past the point of natural pauses, when they finally do pause,
the pauses are likely to occur in linguistically atypical places.
The clinician should ensure that such pauses are not caused by
avoidance or anticipation of stuttering or word finding and/or
language formulation problems. ▶Fig. 16.1 summarizes the key
diﬀerential diagnosis procedures that need to be considered
when assessing cluttering.
16.2.6 Co-occurring Symptoms/
Disorders
As previously indicated, cluttering commonly co-occurs with
other diagnoses, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
receptive/expressive language disorder, speech sound disor-
der, autism spectrum disorder, stuttering, and/or learning
disorders.15 Thus, it is important to evaluate and consider these
diagnoses in addition to cluttered speech. Clinicians should
conduct a comprehensive assessment of other speech and
language skills (e.g., language, articulation, pragmatics, etc.)
16.2 Diagnostic Considerations
261

using norm-referenced standardized tests or informal measures
to identify coexisting symptoms/disorders that may also require
treatment.
It is important to understand the potential interaction
between cluttering and other coexisting disorders. For example,
when a person who clutters speaks at a rate that is faster than
their system can handle, cluttering is triggered. If someone who
stutters and clutters speeds up to avoid stuttering, they often
end up speaking at a rate that is faster than their system
can handle, thereby triggering cluttering. Therefore, the root
"trigger" for the increased speed in this case is avoidance of
stuttering. On the other hand, some individuals who both stut-
ter and clutter state that if they begin to clutter, they may feel
increased pressure to speak fluently and clearly, resulting in
increased stuttering.16 When there is overlap of symptoms in
these ways, this should be taken into consideration in inter-
vention. A summary of diﬀerential diagnostic considerations
is outlined in ▶Table 16.1.
Peter's Evaluation and Results
After the clinician explained the procedures for diﬀerentiating
cluttering from other disorders, Peter and his parents were ready
to pursue the evaluation. To guide the process of diﬀerential
diagnosis, it was necessary to obtain a detailed case history and
to collect speech samples in various contexts.
The clinician began the evaluation by asking Peter how he felt
about his speech. Peter said that he was frustrated that others
could not understand him. Even though he had told his parents
the opposite, he told the clinician that others asked him to repeat
frequently, and he really did not understand why. He felt misun-
derstood by his teacher, who told him he needed to slow down.
Peter felt annoyed and discouraged by this feedback and said that
sometimes it was easier to avoid speaking in certain situations.
A conversational sample was taken to analyze for the presence
of stuttering-like disfluencies, NDs, over-coarticulation, and/or
atypical pausing. Peter was asked to speak about baseball, since
he was passionate about this topic and research has shown that
monologues tend to elicit more moments of over-coarticulation in
school-age children who clutter.17 Peter did not exhibit stuttering,
and both he and his parents denied any family history of stutter-
ing. Peter recalled that his articulation treatment in elementary
school focused on the production of /r/. At that time, the clinician
had concluded that Peter had symptoms that made her initially
consider a language disorder, such as multiple revisions, but he
never qualified for services based on the results of standardized
testing.
Peter currently scored within the average range on an articula-
tion test, as well as on tests examining word finding and lan-
guage organization. Peter's parents provided a sample of Peter's
Fig. 16.1 Evaluation procedures. (This image is

Cluttering: Etiology, Symptomatology, Identification, and Treatment
262

conversational speech, prerecorded before the evaluation. The
clinician explained that this sample was important, since in-clinic
samples may not always show the symptoms of cluttering. The
clinician also asked Peter's parents if there was a family history
of rapid rate and/or unclear speech. Peter's mother recalled that
her brother had a speech pattern where others were constantly
asking him to repeat what he said or asking him to stop mum-
bling. She now wondered whether Peter's uncle had cluttering
as well.
Peter was asked to read a passage at a rapid rate, during which
over-coarticulation was evidenced. The clinician then presented
Peter with the same reading passage marked with vertical slashes
at commas and periods to indicate where he should pause. With
the natural pauses inserted, over-coarticulation was no longer a
symptom, and Peter's speech became clear. When asked to discuss
baseball, Peter exhibited multiple phrase and word repetitions
without tension. The clinician concluded that these NDs sounded
"excessive" because it took Peter much longer to get his point
across than if he did not exhibit so many NDs. When shown how
to include natural pauses in a second monologue, Peter exhibited
only a few NDs. Peter exhibited several instances of atypical
pauses during conversation and a monologue, but these also
abated when Peter used natural pausing.
At this point, Peter's speech fit the required criteria of rapid-
sounding rate and all three breakdowns in intelligibility (either of
speech or of message): excessive over-coarticulation, an excessive
number of NDs, and atypical pausing. None of these symptoms
were present all the time in Peter's speech; rather, they presented
themselves at diﬀerent times in various speaking contexts. At
times, a combination of symptoms (i.e., "clusters"), such as an
excessive number of NDs and over-coarticulation, was noted, as
has been documented in speakers who clutter.18
Upon gathering the diagnostic information just described,
the clinician compared Peter's history and his speech samples
to the LCD definition. This is the most basic way to diagnose
cluttering. In addition to the basics presented above, a variety of
additional tools can help with identifying cluttering symptoms.
Once the clinician feels comfortable diagnosing cluttering
according to the LCD symptoms, he or she may want to consider
using these additional tools (see ▶Table 16.2). These tools,
however, should not be used as the sole means of diagnosing
cluttering, especially considering that most, if not all, of the
characteristics identified in these tools may not be present in
all people who clutter. Rather, when combined with a thorough
examination of the core features of cluttering under the LCD
definition, these tools should be used to help the clinician iden-
tify concomitant characteristics. Additionally, having a better
understanding of these other characteristics, if present, may
inform treatment planning, as will be discussed later in this
chapter.
16.2.7 Patterns of LCD Symptoms
To design better treatment, it is important to identify patterns
among those who clutter. The clinician should consider which
cluttering symptoms are most predominant and, therefore,
need to be prioritized in treatment. In addition to rapid-
sounding speech, many people who clutter present with
(1) overarticulation, (2) excessive NDs, or (3) a combination
of both, with one pattern predominant. Understanding the
patterns will drive treatment decisions. For more information
on diﬀerentiating between "motor" and "sensory" cluttering
subtypes, see Ward,9 and for "syntactic" and "phonological"
cluttering subtypes, see van Zaalen et al.19,20 For testimony
by people who clutter about their experiences with syntactic
and phonological subtypes of cluttering, see Exum et al.16
Discussion of Peter's Evaluation Results
After the evaluation, Peter and his parents met with the
clinician to discuss the findings. Although Peter's mother was
relieved to have a definitive diagnosis for her son, Peter's father
was still skeptical about the diagnosis. "How much do we really
understand about this disorder of cluttering anyway? What
research is there to back it up? And what are the options for
treatment?"

16.3 Cluttering Research: Past and
Present
Much of the early cluttering research has suﬀered from various
methodological shortcomings. A special edition of the Journal of
Fluency Disorders, published in 1996, featured articles relating
solely to the cluttering disorder, and included discussions on
its characteristics, diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. Upon
reviewing this edition, Richard Curlee21 called for "more system-
atic, better controlled research." Specific flaws were identified in
many of the studies, including a lack of consensus in defining
cluttering, the inclusion of participants who had both cluttering
and other disorders, and small sample sizes. Although progress
had been made in cluttering research,22 more progress was
clearly needed.
The call for progress was taken seriously. Over the last 25
years, cluttering has, indeed, gained more attention, as more
studies focusing solely on cluttering have been published. Publi-
cations about fluency disorders have more commonly been
including information about cluttering. In 2007, the First World
Conference on Cluttering was held in Bulgaria in honor of Deso
Weiss. This conference brought together, for the first time,
researchers, clinicians, and people who clutter, and resulted in
the creation of the International Cluttering Association. The
association has been instrumental in spreading awareness
about the symptoms, prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of
cluttering around the world, taking significant steps to end the
long-standing era when cluttering was considered an "orphan"1
in the field of speech-language pathology.23 They also continue
to address challenges in the field of cluttering, such as further
refining the cluttering definition.24 See ▶Table 16.3 for web-
based resources focused on cluttering awareness (see also
Further Readings).
With a more streamlined definition of cluttering, research
methodology has improved. And objective data continue to
be collected and analyzed, improving our understanding of
diﬀerential diagnosis (e.g., cluttering vs. stuttering), cluttering
characteristics (e.g., speech rate and rate variability),7,20,25 the
topography of cluttering moments,18 and the neural correlates
of cluttering.26 These studies represent a start to improved
cluttering research, yet more replication is needed to draw firm
conclusions.
There are still challenges in conducting cluttering research.
For example, it is diﬃcult to examine "pure" cluttering because
few participants exhibit cluttering with no other diagnoses.

This leads to a catch-22: we need larger sample sizes to have
enough power to find statistically significant eﬀects (if present),
but the larger the sample, the more likely it is that the partici-
pants will have one or more concomitant diagnoses.27 We must
also be cautious in defining cluttering too broadly so that we do
not overdiagnose, but at the same time, it should be broad
enough so as to not overlook clients who have cluttering. Clut-
tering research and theory must continue to overcome these
challenges.
16.4 Treatment Options for
Cluttering
Just as we used the LCD definition to identify the mandatory
symptoms of cluttering, so too can we use it to develop a
plan to treat cluttering symptoms. As a perceived rapid and/or
irregular speech rate is the primary criterion for a cluttering
diagnosis,6 rate is a primary area to address.8 Treatment of
speech rate means first increasing awareness and then imple-
menting strategies to regulate rate. At the same time, direct
work on over-coarticulation may be needed. For long-term
success, working on self-regulation in increasingly complex
environments is needed. One option to consider in treatment
is the "synergistic approach,"28 which means that working on
one area of cluttering will decrease symptoms in another area.
For example, pausing may help reduce both the symptoms of
over-coarticulation and an excessive number of NDs. In the
same manner, by emphasizing sounds and syllables, a client
may reduce their speech rate, which could, in turn, reduce
other cluttering symptoms. Finally, working on symptoms of
co-occurring disorders that might have an impact on the eﬃ-
ciency of communication should be considered. We will elaborate
on these treatment options in the following sections.
16.4.1 Treatment of LCD Symptoms
Speech Rate Awareness and Regulation
Treatment for cluttering has generally focused on helping
clients regulate their speech rate.28,29,30,31,32 There are many
ways in which this can be accomplished. For example, clients
can insert natural pauses into their speech33 or use pacing
devices and/or analogies (e.g., slowing down when driving on a
curvy road).9,30 In a case study examining the use of pausing
and overemphasis in articulation in a teenager, both strategies
were found to reduce symptoms of over-coarticulation, although
pausing was used more often in carryover than overemphasis.34
Placing pauses in natural places may eliminate the symptom of
atypical pausing. However, some people with cluttering who
have atypical pauses may be unaware of the grammatical rules
for where pauses should naturally occur in sentences. These
individuals may benefit from a review of the grammatical rules
for more natural pause placement during conversational speech.
To work on speech rate and other LCD symptoms, a client must
have awareness of these symptoms. Active self-monitoring is
often diﬃcult for many people who clutter, resulting in a failure
to notice specific symptoms of cluttering as they occur. Although
in some cases, such as Peter's, there is a general lack of aware-
ness, in others there is general awareness but a lack of awareness
of specific moments of cluttering.35 Being aware of one's
speech rate and/or lack of clarity can improve communication
eﬀectiveness, as the speaker can quickly repair breakdowns
when they occur.33
In clinical settings, we can observe improved speech clarity
when clients increase levels of eﬀortful attention to their
speech. Awareness of fast articulatory rate or inadequate speech
clarity can be taught by integrating "contrasting exercises," in
which the client is first asked to contrast an extremely fast and
an extremely slow speech rate, and then identify speech rates
that fall in between extremely fast and extremely slow. As the
person who clutters becomes more aware of how fast or how
unclear their speech feels, they become more aware of these
symptoms during conversations, allowing them to repair clut-
tering moments. It is also important to teach clients to become
knowledgeable about the symptoms that tend to trigger their
cluttering, so that they can proactively monitor their speech
rate and clarity, as discussed below.
The clinician can have people who clutter record themselves
speaking using a mobile phone, iPad, or other electronic devices
to increase awareness both within and beyond the clinical set-
ting. These recordings can document progress and management
over time. Audio recordings can also be used in awareness
training. This method can be aversive for some clients at first,
so it should be introduced gradually when needed. For exam-
ple, with audio-visual feedback training using Praat software,
clients learn how to monitor their speech, visually represented
as a waveform, for rate, fluency, pitch, and prosody, as well as
pause placement and duration. The eﬀectiveness of this training
was evaluated in a recent study.36 Findings indicated that par-
ticipants not only improved their speech, language, and moni-
toring skills but also became more confident and satisfied with
their interactional skills.36
People who clutter may have diﬃculty with the perception of
their speech rate.8,37 Helping people with cluttering gain insight
that they may perceive their speech rate diﬀerently than the
listener may help them see the importance of improving their
monitoring skills during practice. For example, even though the
person who clutters may perceive their rate to be "extremely
slow," this impression may not mirror the listener's perception.
It may be helpful for clients to consider speech rate as falling on
a 10-point scale, with 1 being too slow, 5 "just right," and 10
too fast.15 Clients can practice speaking at a slightly slower than
average rate (e.g., a 3 or 4 on the 10-point scale) in the clinic,
and then work toward regulating rate, with the ultimate goal
being for them to use an average rate in everyday speaking situ-
ations. Keeping the overall concept the same, the range along
the 10-point scale can be adjusted to the clinician's preference,
such as from 1 to 6.38,39
Some experts believe that diﬃculties with speech monitoring
may be related to inconsistent eye contact.15 Although some
adult clients do not like to be interrupted and asked to repeat
words, other clients have said, "I really wish they would just tell
me that my speech is unclear." Thus, the speaker may not
always receive the feedback they need to repair breakdowns in
conversation. In these situations, tuning in to subtle (and often
unconscious) signals from the listener about a communication
breakdown necessitates steady eye contact. Yet even when their
pragmatic skills are within normal limits, we have found that
many people who clutter may not maintain consistent eye
16.4 Treatment Options for Cluttering
265

contact. Diﬃculty maintaining eye contact may be manifested
for a variety of reasons: (1) not feeling confident as a commu-
nicator due to prior negative experiences, (2) being uncom-
fortable with making and/or maintaining eye contact, and
(3) having diﬃculty organizing thoughts while also maintain-
ing eye contact. Learning to proactively initiate eye contact
while speaking will help the speaker "catch" confusion on the
listener's face sooner rather than later, which allows them to
make the appropriate repair before the speaker gets too far
into the conversation.33 On the other hand, some people who
clutter are acutely aware of listener feedback, noticing things
such as the listener moving closer to them and/or looking
intently at their mouth when speaking. Nevertheless, if they
are unaware that the listener is having diﬃculty following
them, increasing eye contact may help them to become more
proactive in repairing communication breakdowns. A summary
of the proactive and reactive approaches to managing speech is
outlined in ▶Table 16.4.
NDs and Over-Coarticulation
Although excessive NDs and over-coarticulation may abate with
rate regulation and/or pausing alone, some clients need more
direct work. If excessive NDs do not decrease with rate regula-
tion alone, the clinician should consider targeting language
organization. Although pausing to regulate speech rate may
reduce or eliminate over-coarticulation for some speakers, others
may continue to have diﬃculty with over-coarticulation if they
rush the words in between the pauses. To increase clarity of
speech when over-coarticulation diﬃculties remain, clients can
be taught to emphasize sounds, syllables, and/or words by focus-
ing on clear and accurate productions of the (1) overall phrase or
sentence, (2) first few words of a sentence, and/or (3) last few
sounds of a word (e.g., emphasizing consonant blends at the
ends of words, such as "st" in "first" or "last" and "nt" in "can't"
or "don't").
16.4.2 Improving Self-Regulation
Once the person who clutters becomes more aware of their fast
speech rate and accompanying symptoms of excessive NDs,
over-coarticulation, and/or atypical pauses, they must work
toward regulating their speech in everyday speaking situations.
Just as stuttering treatment may involve the simulation of
moments of stuttering, cluttering treatment may include simu-
lating moments of cluttering.15 Part of the goal of simulation in
stuttering treatment is to desensitize the individual who
stutters to the moment of stuttering. The goal of simulating
moments of cluttering, on the other hand, is to help the person
who clutters to concentrate on how it feels to increase speaking
rate, over-coarticulate, and/or produce excessive NDs. The
objective in simulating and identifying cluttering, along with
practicing repair strategies, is to help the client learn how to:
(1) identify when these moments occur earlier during real-life
speaking situations and (2) react to these moments by adjusting
their speech (e.g., adding pauses, overemphasizing sounds) in a
way that does not interfere with ongoing communication.
In more recent years, mindfulness-based approaches have
been shown to be helpful in the therapeutic setting, including
stuttering therapy.40,41,42,43,44,45,46 Due to the connection between
mindfulness, self-awareness, and self-regulation, the assessment
of self-awareness in individuals who clutter may be beneficial for
treatment planning and maintenance. Based on the Western
conceptualization of mindfulness and the work of Baer,40 mind-
fulness involves intentionally focusing on one's internal and
external experiences in the present moment. We have chosen to
use the concept broadly, with the intention of cultivating aware-
ness or focusing attention to thoughts, feelings, and sensations as
they arise. Several questionnaires designed to measure mindful-
ness or related variables have been developed and may be down-
loaded at no cost (▶Table 16.3). We have found that introducing
and implementing awareness-based exercises to increase aware-
ness and communication skills can be helpful for people who
clutter.38,39 In a recent study,47 it was found that mindfulness
indirectly targeted the self-regulation skills of a person with
cluttering. Future research of awareness-based approaches with
larger samples of individuals who clutter is needed.
16.4.3 Treatment of Concomitant
Symptoms/Disorders
If language organization diﬃculties are identified by standar-
dized testing and/or by observing symptoms subjectively, then
work on those symptoms is warranted. Further, since cluttering
and stuttering frequently co-occur, it is important for the clini-
cian to understand how to treat both disorders. For example, if
a client with stuttering and cluttering is speeding up to hide
stuttering and this triggers their cluttering, as previously dis-
cussed, it would be important to prioritize work on avoidance
and address negative thoughts and feelings about stuttering.
Considering that stuttering moments often occur after pauses,
and pauses are frequently used to regulate rate in cluttering,
people with both disorders may need to be taught how to man-
age moments of stuttering after pauses using stuttering modifi-
cation strategies (see ▶Chapters 11 and 12).
Although they may not have the same pragmatic deficits as
others with communication disorders, such as in autism

spectrum disorder, people who clutter may not provide all
the relevant information needed for listeners to understand
them during communication exchanges.48 These clients may,
therefore, benefit from working on how to better communi-
cate from a linguistic and/or social point of view. In a dyad,
both partners must be able to notice and interpret nonverbal
signals, body language, and vocal information that signal
when messages are unclear.
16.4.4 Treatment of Aﬀective and
Cognitive Components of Cluttering
Communication with people who clutter brings to the fore their
emotional reactions to the challenges they experience when
interacting with the people around them. The first empirical
studies.49,58 examining aﬀective and cognitive aspects of
cluttering were conducted using qualitative research (a semi-
structured interview). People who clutter reported feelings
of frustration, shame, sadness, fear, and avoidance of certain
social situations in response to their cluttering. They also
described having diﬃculty accepting their disorder and had
to learn how to deal with the consequences.
Many famous neural scientists have demonstrated that the
mind consists of thoughts and emotions, which work together
to influence reasoning and decision-making processes. An
understanding of the link between thinking and feeling is
needed to succeed in stuttering and cluttering intervention.50
Bar-On's51 emotional intelligence model can provide clinicians
with the tools to address any feelings of sadness, frustration,
and incompetence, and self-defeating thoughts that an individ-
ual who clutters may experience. Reichel50 adapted five of Bar-
On's emotional intelligence competencies to benefit individuals
who clutter: (1) emotional self-awareness, (2) impulse control,
(3) reality testing, (4) empathy, and (5) interpersonal relation-
ships. These competencies can help people with cluttering to
enhance their awareness of emotions and communication
behaviors, become self-controlled, assess situations realistically,
resolve conflicts in interpersonal relationships, and consider
the feelings and reactions of listeners to their speech.
16.4.5 Cluttering and the Working
Alliance
The concept of the working alliance has its roots in psychody-
namic theory. Bordin52 described the "working alliance" as the
degree to which the client and clinician are engaged in collabo-
rative, purposeful work. Bordin's model of the working alliance
includes the dimensions of therapy goals, therapy tasks, and
the bond between client and clinician. We believe that clinicians
who are eﬀective in forming alliances with persons who clutter
may have better therapy outcomes. The establishment of a
strong working alliance, in which the client and clinician devel-
op an emotional bond and work together to develop treatment
goals and tasks, can go a long way toward facilitating change.52
This may be particularly important to cluttering treatment.
That is, therapy should focus on providing a clear rationale for
the joint selection of treatment tasks, and these tasks should be
assessed and integrated into what really matters for each
person.53,54 As with any communication disorder, the clinician
needs to be sensitive to each individual client's profile, needs,
values, motivation, and responses.
Keep in mind, however, that the preferences and goals of
individuals who clutter may become clearer with improvements
in self-awareness and self-regulation throughout therapy.54 The
treatment may also be influenced by unique intrapersonal and
contextual factors. Therefore, the clinician should be open to a
continued dialogue about the need for goal revision throughout
treatment.
16.5 Future Directions in
Cluttering
As mentioned earlier, progress has been made in better under-
standing the nature and treatment of cluttering. Today speech-
language pathology students are receiving more information
about cluttering in their fluency courses than they did even
10 years ago. This is remarkable considering that at one time
experts would not even acknowledge the existence of cluttering
as a valid diagnostic category.
Despite this progress, more work needs to be done. This can
begin by educating the public to recognize the signs and symp-
toms of cluttering, and where to go for diagnostic evaluation
and treatment. While getting the consumer to professionals
who can evaluate and diﬀerentially diagnose cluttering from
other communication disorders is one challenge, making clini-
cians more knowledgeable about cluttering is another. Many
myths surround cluttering, and as long as these myths persist,
clinicians will face uncertainty about how to diagnose and treat
cluttering.
Based on survey studies, most schools of higher education
provide weak academic preparation and limited clinical train-
ing in cluttering. Most university faculty report that cluttering
is addressed in less than 2 hours in fluency disorders courses,
which is considerably less than what most other communica-
tion disorders receive.55 Clearly there is a need for more time
spent on cluttering.56
In fact, some university programs in various countries (e.g.,
Germany, Hungary, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia,
United States, etc.) have dedicated courses in cluttering. As
awareness of cluttering and its pernicious consequences on
communication, social interactions, and quality of life has
increased, establishing independent courses in cluttering—or at
least teaching more than what is currently being taught in most
universities—becomes imperative.56,57
Peter's Treatment: Addressing all Aspects of Cluttering
Peter and his parents felt that the clinician answered all their
questions about cluttering, and they were ready to commit to
treatment. Because Peter reported that he did not think there
was anything wrong, the clinician began by talking about
communication breakdowns in general, rather than his own
communication.33 This "normalizing" approach helped Peter
break his defensiveness toward examining his speech. Eventually,
Peter noticed more and more when communication breakdowns
occurred in his own speech. Peter learned that to avoid misunder-
standing, it is necessary to repair communication breakdowns,
and that this is done by speakers every day. Peter learned to use
strategies that involve natural communication, rather than
feeling diﬀerent. In this way, the treatment changed from "fixing"
16.5 Future Directions in Cluttering
267

the problem to building confidence in his ability to communicate
eﬃciently and eﬀectively with others.33
As Peter began treatment, his clinician asked him about pre-
vious strategies he tried and how they worked. Peter indicated
that he had been uncomfortable with the exercises he did with
his previous clinician because he did not understand how they
could help. He said that he had practiced "tongue twisters," but
he could not explain why they did this. Peter and his new clini-
cian proceeded to work on natural strategies such as pausing to
regulate rate, emphasizing all sounds and syllables, and tuning
in to listener feedback. Peter learned to proactively look for com-
munication breakdowns and repair these breakdowns in natural
ways, such as by inserting more typical pauses when he found
himself speaking too quickly. As the clinician developed a rap-
port with Peter, Peter revealed more about his feelings. He said
that in the course of their work together, he had become increas-
ingly aware of his speech diﬃculties. Peter's mother had told
him that she now thought his uncle was a person with cluttering
and encouraged Peter to speak with him. Peter and his uncle had
a talk about their speech. Peter's uncle spoke of times in his life
when others asked him if he was "stupid" or "drunk" and/or told
him to "stop mumbling." Peter's uncle felt he had not been con-
sidered for a promotion at work, despite his qualifications, due
to his poor communication skills. He never had a diagnosis, and
never understood why others judged him so negatively. As a
result of this discussion, Peter's uncle began to seriously consider
seeking an evaluation himself. Peter said that this talk made him
realize the extent to which he had been hiding the frustration
and anxiety he had been feeling about his speech for years.
Talking with Peter's Previous School Clinician
The clinician asked Peter for permission to contact the school
clinician who had worked with Peter in the past. When the
current clinician told the former school clinician about the
cluttering diagnosis, the former clinician said, "Oh that makes
sense. You know I often wondered if Peter cluttered. However, I
really didn't learn much about fluency disorders in graduate
school, let alone cluttering. And, working in a school, I see about
two cases of stuttering a year. So, I don't feel confident about my
work with fluency disorders." The current clinician said she
understood and suggested that the school clinician consider
continuing education in fluency disorders. The school clinician
responded, "I think about this all the time. However, it has often
been diﬃcult for me to justify using my continuing education on
fluency disorders when I have so many clients in language and
articulation. I will consider it, though." The school clinician went
on to say that she had considered cluttering as a potential diag-
nosis for Peter, but discounted it after her colleague had said,
"Well, he doesn't sound fast all of the time, does he?" The school
clinician was unaware that many who clutter do so only situa-
tionally. She also said that she considered a cluttering diagnosis
for a diﬀerent student, but she again discounted it when the stu-
dent's mother came to school one Monday morning saying, "He
didn't do it all weekend." Peter's clinician asked, "Well, if you had
a client with an articulation disorder that only occurred in cer-
tain contexts, and the parent didn't see any of those contexts over
the weekend, would you declassify the child of the articulation
disorder?" "Ooooh," the school clinician responded. "I never
thought of it that way."
Peter's clinician went through the LCD definition of cluttering
with the school clinician, showing her how the mandatory criteri-
on is perceived rapid rate rather than measured rapid rate, and
how cluttering does not have to occur in all situations to be diag-
nosed. The school clinician also admitted that she would have a
hard time working with Peter because he did not acknowledge
that he had a communication disorder, and therefore, even if he
did have a disorder, there was no functional impact on his com-
munication or quality of life. The clinician acknowledged that
Peter often said he was not impacted by his speech. However,
when examining his frustration about others asking him to repeat
and/or to slow down, it seemed that Peter was, in fact, negatively
impacted by his fast and unintelligible speech. The clinician
indicated that formal checklists measuring the impact of clutter-
ing on a speaker are under development. Additionally, Peter's
clinician told the school clinician about a study in which adults
who clutter were interviewed about their experience living with
cluttering.58 One theme that emerged from this study was that
when the adults were teens, they did not want to acknowledge
that cluttering was an issue. It eventually took someone outside
of their family, such as a supervisor at work or school, to tell them
that their communication needed to be improved. This was the
trigger that finally inspired them to look for treatment. Thus,
Peter's behavior is typical for someone who clutters, especially
teens.16,59,61
16.6 Conclusions
Has there been a great deal of progress regarding the field of
cluttering? Yes. Is there much further to go? Yes. Educating the
public and clinicians to identify the disorder and conducting
well-controlled research to examine the characteristics of clut-
tering are still needed. As a future or current clinician or
researcher interested in cluttering, we thank you for learning
more. As this chapter illustrates (see ▶Table 16.5 for a sum-
mary of the key points), people like Peter and his family are
Table 16.5 Summary of key points
●To be classified as a person who clutters, the individual must meet the criteria listed in the lowest common denominator (LCD) definition
●An individual who clutters may not necessarily exhibit symptoms of cluttering in all speaking situations
●Formal assessment measures should not be the only tools used to diagnose cluttering
●Self-regulation of speech rate and intelligibility are successful treatment strategies for individuals who clutter when combined with other strategies
●Treatment strategies fall into two categories: proactive and reactive. Proactive strategies are used when a speaker wants to monitor full-time to avoid
a communication breakdown, while reactive strategies are used to respond to and manage moments of cluttering without constant monitoring
●As in all areas of fluency treatment, a working alliance allows for more productive teamwork to help the client manage cluttering
●Cluttering research continues to advance as awareness of cluttering increases and the definition tightens

16.7 Definitions
Atypical pause:
A pause in speaking that is not within gram-
matical boundaries.
Cluttering:
A fluency disorder characterized by a rapid- and/
or irregular-sounding rate of speech and breakdown in
intelligibility in at least one of the following three areas:
ex-
cessive normal disfluencies, excessive over co-articulation,
and/or excessive atypical pauses.
Emotional intelligence:
There are two contrasting models of
emotional intelligence. First, the ability model focuses on the
emotional and cognitive relationship and is comprised of
four categories:
the ability to perceive emotions, the ability
to use emotions to facilitate thought, the ability to under-
stand emotions, and the ability to manage emotions. Sec-
ond, the mixed model combines mental abilities with other
characteristics of a person, such as motivational and inter-
personal qualities, similar to personality traits.
Mindfulness:
Mindfulness involves intentionally bringing
one's attention to the internal and external experiences
occurring in the present moment.
Over-coarticulation:
When sounds or syllables are blended
in excess so that to the listener, syllables or sounds are per-
ceived as deleted and/or collapsed. Also known as telescoping.
Self-regulation:
The ability to monitor and control one's speech
rate and/or clarity.
Speech awareness:
Knowledge of how one's speech is coming
across in terms of clarity of message and words.
Working alliance:
The working alliance represents a proactive
collaboration of a client and a clinician and includes three
processes:
the emotional bond, the agreement on the goal
of treatment, and the extent to which the client and clini-
cian consider the treatment tasks as relevant.

Identification, and Treatment

Abstract
Although stuttering typically has its onset in early childhood,
stuttering speech disfluencies can also develop later in life, most
often in adulthood. In this case, they are referred to as acquired
stuttering. The most common subtypes of acquired stuttering
are acquired neurogenic and functional (psychogenic) stuttering.
The onset of acquired neurogenic stuttering is associated with a
known or suspected neurological condition. Understanding the
nature of this condition, as well as how it may aﬀect speech
fluency and other aspects of communication is an important
aspect of diagnosis and treatment. In contrast, acquired functional
stuttering is associated with traumatic emotional or psychological
events, usually in the absence of an underlying neurological
disorder. Because of the complex nature of acquired stuttering,
clinical intervention needs to start with a comprehensive
assessment in order to diﬀerentially diagnose the type of stut-
tering, and to diﬀerentiate stuttering from other speech and
language disorders that may aﬀect speech fluency, such as
apraxia of speech and aphasia. A comprehensive assessment
will allow the clinician to plan for the most eﬀective, evidence-
based and individualized intervention approach for their clients.
After reading this chapter, the clinician will be able to identify the
characteristics of acquired stuttering, what important elements to
include in an assessment, and the clinical intervention options
available to speech-language pathologists.
Keywords: stuttering, acquired stuttering, acquired neurogenic
stuttering, acquired functional stuttering, psychogenic stuttering,
feigned stuttering, factitious stuttering, malingered stuttering
17.1 Introduction
17.1.1 Definition
Acquired stuttering is a speech fluency disorder that is charac-
terized by an acquired onset of stuttered disfluencies. This
short and straightforward definition highlights the most
important aspects of this fluency disorder. First, the onset of
stuttering is acquired, as opposed to developmental. It most
often starts in adulthood, typically in people with no previous
history of developmental stuttering. Second, the key speech
characteristic is the presence of stuttered disfluencies. These
disfluencies include repetitions of sounds, syllables, and
monosyllabic words, prolongations, and blocks, and are
discussed in more detail in ▶Chapter 1. Third, it is a speech
fluency disorder. The disfluencies are not thought to be due to
acquired language formulation problems (i.e., aphasia) and are
uncharacteristic of the type of disfluencies that may be associ-
ated with other acquired speech disorders such as apraxia of
speech or dysarthria, although some people with acquired stut-
tering will present with co-occurring speech and language
problems.
17.1.2 Subtypes
Acquired stuttering is used here as an umbrella term, covering
neurogenic, functional (psychogenic), and factitious subtypes of
stuttering. In this chapter, we will primarily use the term
acquired neurogenic stuttering to refer to stuttering onset
following a neurological lesion or disorder. This terminology
avoids potential confusion with developmental stuttering,
which is increasingly also seen as resulting from atypical
brain functioning.1 In line with current trends in neurological
classifications,2 and as discussed in more detail in the section
"Acquired Functional Stuttering," we will use the term
acquired functional stuttering for the subtype traditionally
referred to as psychogenic stuttering. Finally, we will use the
terms factitious stuttering and malingering to refer to cases
where an individual deliberately feigns stuttering symptoms.
The two latter conditions are defined in ▶Table 17.1 and are
only addressed briefly in this chapter due to the feigned
nature of the stuttering disfluencies.3
Most of the literature on acquired stuttering consists of case
reports, although several studies with larger samples have been
published. For this chapter, information on 188 case studies,
362 people from group studies, and 175 people from question-
naire studies was reviewed. Most of the published case studies
had a neurogenic onset of stuttering (n = 156, 83%). Functional
(psychogenic) stuttering was reported less often (n = 21, 11%).
Reports on feigned stuttering were relatively sparse (n = 11, 6%),
possibly due to the uncertainties associated with this diagnosis.4
Therefore, the information presented in this chapter reflects
the proportionally larger knowledge base that is available for
acquired neurogenic stuttering compared to other subtypes of
acquired stuttering.
17.2 Etiology
17.2.1 Acquired Neurogenic Stuttering
Acquired neurogenic stuttering is characterized by the onset of
stuttered disfluencies following a neurological event or disease.
Stroke is the most common cause of acquired neurogenic
stuttering, accounting for half of the reported cases.5,6 This is
followed by traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neurodegenerative
diseases.5,7 Parkinson's disease is the most frequently reported
neurodegenerative disease associated with acquired neurogenic
stuttering,8,9 but other neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's dementia,10 motor neuron disease,11 and multiple
sclerosis12 can also result in acquired stuttering. In addition, an
acquired onset of stuttering can occur following other neuro-
logical conditions such as encephalitis,13 brain tumours,14 and
epileptic seizures.15 The onset of acquired neurogenic stutter-
ing has also been reported following surgery for deep brain
stimulation, although the reported eﬀects are variable. In most
people, the presence or severity of acquired stuttering remains
unchanged during deep brain stimulation on and oﬀperiods.16
271

However, for some patients, especially those with preexisting
stuttering, turning on the stimulation can result in increased stut-
tering, while turning it oﬀcan lead to a decrease in stuttering.17
Still others may show improvements in stuttering when the deep
brain stimulation is activated.18 Finally, acquired neurogenic
stuttering can begin subsequent to the use of recreational and
therapeutic medical drugs.19 Some have argued that "drug-
induced stuttering" should be considered separate from other
forms of acquired neurogenic stuttering, primarily because
stuttering typically ceases when the drug is no longer adminis-
tered or the dosage has been adjusted.20 We continue to
include drug-induced stuttering under the general umbrella of
acquired neurogenic stuttering. This is because therapeutic
drugs, often administered as treatment for other health condi-
tions, may result in changes in brain functioning, which in turn
can lead to the onset of stuttering. As such, this etiology is not
fundamentally diﬀerent from other neurological conditions
that aﬀect brain functions, especially given that even in those
other neurological disorders, stuttering is not necessarily a
chronic condition.21
Acquired neurogenic stuttering often has a sudden onset
following neurological events such as strokes and TBI. Gradual
onsets are more commonly reported in people with neurodege-
nerative diseases,5 and sometimes an onset of acquired stutter-
ing can be the first presenting symptom of an underlying
neurodegenerative disease.11 Although intervals of more than
1 month have been reported between the occurrence of brain
damage and stuttering onset, such longer periods make it
harder to establish a causal relationship between the stuttering
and underlying neurological disorder.22 Most individuals with
acquired neurogenic stuttering have no history of preexisting
developmental stuttering, but in some cases, complete or parti-
al recovery from childhood stuttering was reported prior to the
lesion or disease onset. In those cases, preexisting developmen-
tal stuttering may worsen or return in the presence of acquired
neurological conditions.23 For example, recurrence of childhood
stuttering was the first symptom of Alzheimer's-like dementia
in one reported case.24 While one may argue that such cases
should not be considered acquired neurogenic stuttering, we
do include them because of the direct link between the onset of
the lesion or the disease and the reoccurrence or worsening of
stuttering.
The age of onset of acquired neurogenic stuttering varies and
is typically consistent with the age ranges associated with the
underlying neurological disorder. In a prospective group study
of 17 patients with neurogenic stuttering following stroke, the
median age was 72 years (range: 51-87 years).21 A similar
mean age of 72 years (range: 56-85 years) was reported for
people who developed acquired neurogenic stuttering follow-
ing various neurodegenerative diseases,5 while individuals with
extrapyramidal diseases were somewhat younger—around 61
years—at the time of stuttering onset.8 Consistent with the
typical occurrence of TBI in younger individuals,25 the age of
acquired stuttering onset following TBI is lower, with averages
of 35 and 47 years reported across studies.26,27
Although most people develop acquired neurogenic stutter-
ing as adults, it can also occur in children. We found 12 reports
of acquired neurogenic stuttering in children between 2 and
16 years of age. Their stuttering occurred following stroke,
TBI, tumor resection, encephalitis, or drug ingestion. For some
children, the onset of the stuttering occurred immediately
following the neurological event,28 while for others, the relation-
ship between the onset of stuttering and the underlying event
was less obvious. In these latter cases, the stuttering had a
gradual onset over a number of years,29 occurred months after
the stroke,30 or was linked to the lesion retrospectively.31
Although the nature of acquired neurogenic stuttering in itself
does not preclude it from aﬀecting younger people, the diﬀer-
ential diagnosis from developmental stuttering can be diﬃcult
in children, especially considering that the neurological event
could act as a trigger for the onset of developmental stuttering.6
Lesion Localization
Investigating the localization of the brain lesion(s) underlying
acquired neurogenic stuttering can provide information about
the neural networks that support fluent speech production.26,32

that neurogenic stuttering can be associated with lesions in
almost every part of the brain, with the possible exception of the
occipital lobe.33 However, with recent advancements in brain
imaging techniques, and the availability of more group-level data,
a more localized pattern of lesions has started to emerge. This
pattern is remarkably consistent across the diﬀerent etiological
subgroups of neurogenic stuttering.
One group study investigated lesion data of 10 people who
developed stuttering following TBI,26 and another study focused
on 20 people who started stuttering following stroke.34 Both
report lesions in the inferior frontal white matter (▶Fig. 17.1),
internal capsule, and basal ganglia (e.g., putamen and caudate
nuclei; ▶Fig. 17.2) to be significantly associated with acquired
neurogenic stuttering. However, there was more left-sided
lesion involvement for the stroke group (▶Fig. 17.3), while
more bilateral involvement was present in the TBI group. These
findings overlap with those on the neural changes that occur in
Parkinson's disease, as Parkinson's disease is characterized by
loss of dopamine-synthesizing cells in the substantia nigra,
which results in dysfunction in the motor loop mediated by the
putamen.35 Finally, reports on drug-induced stuttering have
pointed to an onset of acquired stuttering following drugs that
influence the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system.19
In summary, many case reports and group studies point to
an important role of the basal ganglia systems and their
interactions with the frontal cortex in the onset of acquired
neurogenic stuttering.28 However, the neural changes leading
to an acquired onset of stuttering are certainly not restricted
to these areas, and future research will need to clarify how
these changes lead to disruptions in the neural networks that
support speech fluency.
Prevalence
Although acquired stuttering, both neurogenic and functional,
occurs more frequently than previously thought, comprehen-
sive prevalence and incidence data are not yet available. To date,
only one study with stroke patients has directly collected
prospective prevalence data for acquired neurogenic stuttering
in that patient population.21 In this study, 319 patients were

screened for speech disfluencies over a 1-year period following
their stroke. In the acute phase, 17 (5%) of the 319 stroke
patients presented with more than 3% stuttering disfluencies.
For 8 (47%) of these 17 patients, the stuttering persisted more
than 6 months following the stroke.
Preliminary data on the occurrence of acquired neurogenic
stuttering following Parkinson's disease suggest that the preva-
lence ranges from 4 to 57%. In a study of 280 people with
Parkinson's disease, 15 participants (5%) reported stuttering.
Four of these 15 participants had preexisting developmental
stuttering, suggesting that the stuttering was first observed
following the onset of Parkinson's disease in 11 of the 280
participants (4%).36 In another study, 12 of 21 participants
(57%) with Parkinson's disease exhibited more than 3% stutter-
ing disfluencies during a reading task.37 Future studies linking
prevalence of stuttering with the diﬀerent stages of Parkinson's
disease are necessary to further clarify this relationship.
17.2.2 Acquired Functional Stuttering
Although acquired stuttering is typically associated with a
known neurological lesion or disease, this is not always the
case. Individuals, usually adults, may develop stuttering symp-
toms in the absence of an obvious physical medical condition.
Traditionally, this condition has been known as psychogenic
stuttering, reflecting the belief that the onset is found in an
underlying psychological condition such as stress or emotional
trauma. According to some, psychogenic stuttering can best be
understood as a form of conversion reaction, a psychiatric term
originally coined by Freud to indicate a condition by which
unresolved unconscious conflict is converted into overt neuro-
logical symptoms.38 However, there are a number of problems
with the label "psychogenic stuttering." For one, it is based on a
dualistic mind-body approach that may not reflect our current
understanding of human behavior. It also suggests that the
absence of a direct physical medical explanation implies a
psychological origin of the disorder. Finally, it does not capture
the fact that patients with a diagnosed physical disease may
also develop stuttering in response to the stress and emotional
trauma associated with their disease.38 In fact, in a study of 69
people with diagnosed psychogenic stuttering, 20 also showed
evidence of neurological disease.39 As a result, the more
agnostic term "functional disorder" has become more com-
monly used in the neurological literature40 and adopted in
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fifth Edition (DSM-5).41 The use of "functional" rather than
"psychogenic" focuses more on the behavioral manifestation
than the presumed etiology of the disorder. Importantly, this
term has also been shown to be more acceptable to clients,
an important predictor for tolerance of the diagnosis as well
as treatment outcome.42 Therefore, we will use the term
acquired functional stuttering in this chapter.
Primarily based on clinical reports and retrospective studies,
acquired functional stuttering is equally common among males
and females.39,43 Although it may be the sole or main complaint
for some individuals, it is often associated with other motor,
sensory, or cognitive complaints such as headaches, fatigue, or
unilateral weakness. A history of previous psychiatric symp-
toms is reported in approximately one-third of the cases with
functional stuttering, and in only 5% of patients who demon-
strate functional stuttering with co-occurring neurological
disease.39 The age at onset of acquired functional stuttering is
variable, but averaged around 45 years, both for people with
and without co-occurring neurologial conditions.39
Precise epidemiological data for acquired functional stutter-
ing are not yet available. Some indirect information can be
gleaned from the fact that functional motor symptoms are
relatively common among movement disorder patients, with
prevalence ranging from 15 to 62%.44 In one study, 16.5% of
individuals who were seen for functional neurological disor-
ders at a general movement disorders clinic also demonstrated
functional speech and voice disorders, with half (8.25%) of
them experiencing stuttering.45 This suggests that functional
speech disorders, particularly stuttering, may be more com-
mon than previously thought.
17.3 Symptomatology
17.3.1 Acquired Neurogenic Stuttering
Historically, when describing the symptomatology of acquired
neurogenic stuttering, the focus has been on identifying charac-
teristics that diﬀer from those seen in developmental stuttering.23
However,
recent
evidence has
shown considerable
overlap

between characteristics of neurogenic stuttering and those
typically seen in people with developmental stuttering. As a
result, even experienced speech-language pathologists cannot
always reliably diﬀerentiate the etiologies based on observable
speech characteristics alone.46 Nevertheless, the typical onset
in adulthood and the presence of an associated neurological
condition are often clear indicators to support a diagnosis of
acquired neurogenic stuttering.
Speech Characteristics
The key speech characteristics of acquired neurogenic stut-
tering are the following: repetitions of sounds, syllables, and
monosyllabic words; prolongations; and blocks. Repetitions
were the most common disfluency type in the literature on
stroke-induced stuttering. Most cases had more than one
disfluency type, with one-third reporting a combination of
repetitions, prolongations, and blocks.6 In people with stut-
tering following TBI, stuttering disfluencies frequently occur in a
cluster with more typical disfluencies such as interjections.47
Although it has previously been suggested that stuttering
disfluencies in acquired neurogenic stuttering are not restricted
to word-initial syllables,23,48 a recent review has shown that
they almost always occur at the beginning of words.6 In addi-
tion, a direct comparison of reading samples of 5 people with
stroke-induced stuttering and 35 people with developmental
stuttering found no diﬀerence in the location of within-
utterance disfluencies.49
The frequency of stuttering disfluencies varies widely across
cases and speech tasks. As one extreme, a person stuttered on
95% of words following a history of seizures.50 However, for
most people with acquired neurogenic stuttering, the frequency
of stuttering disfluencies is considerably lower, ranging from 2 to
52% stuttered syllables (SS) during conversation in two studies
focusing on stroke.27,34 Interestingly, frequencies of stuttering
disfluencies during conversation and monologue have been
shown to be highly correlated, while such a relationship was not
present with reading.21 Sentence repetition also consistently
led to a lower frequency of stuttering disfluencies compared to
conversation and reading tasks.28 Following TBI, similar varia-
bility in the occurrence of stuttering disfluencies has been
shown, both between patients and between speech tasks, with
disfluencies ranging from 18 to 29% during monologue and 11
to 58% during conversation.27 People with co-occurring aphasia
and apraxia of speech following stroke have also been shown
to present with higher frequencies of stuttering compared
to those who do not present with these disorders. No such
relationship has been found with co-occurring dysarthria or
cognitive problems.21
Changes in stuttering disfluencies during fluency-inducing
conditions also highlight the heterogeneity in this population.
Reading adaptation occurs in approximately half of the people
with neurogenic stuttering following stroke and TBI,6,27 and
in at least two-thirds of people with stuttering following
Parkinson's disease.37 Choral reading can lead to significant
reductions in stuttering disfluencies in people with Parkinson's
disease,51 but mixed results are reported for other etiologies.52
Most reports indicate a marked reduction in stuttering during
singing.52
Nonspeech Characteristics
It has previously been suggested that nonspeech, or concomi-
tant, behaviors are not typically associated with moments of
disfluency in acquired neurogenic stuttering.23 Recent studies,
however, have shown that the presence of such behaviors in
acquired neurogenic stuttering is not unusual. Information on
nonspeech behaviors was reported in only 86 of the 156 cases
with acquired neurogenic stuttering that were reviewed for this
chapter. Approximately half of those cases (n = 41, 48%)
reported the presence of nonspeech behaviors such as facial gri-
macing, neck tension, and aversion of eye gaze. While it could
be assumed that the occurrence of nonspeech behaviors is asso-
ciated with the frequency of disfluencies, a one-on-one rela-
tionship between disfluencies and nonspeech behaviors is not
always present. In some individuals, the concomitant behaviors
can increase over time while the stuttering disfluencies remain
unchanged,10 whereas for others, nonspeech behaviors may
persist even after speech fluency has been regained.53
Absence of negative speech-related emotions has also long
been regarded as a characteristic of acquired neurogenic
stuttering.23 Unfortunately, this characteristic is not always
addressed explicitly in published reports. Of the 156 cases
we reviewed, only 50 commented on the presence or absence
of speech-associated emotions and of these close to 70%
showed evidence of such reactions varying from slight
annoyance8 to being anxious about their speech,54 and feeling
miserable and afraid of speaking.50 This is consistent with
speech-language pathologist reports of emotional responses
such as frustration, irritation, fear, crying, and anger in reac-
tion to the stuttering in 62% of stroke patients, 82% of TBI
patients, but only in 33% of people with a neurodegenerative
onset of stuttering.5 Especially following stroke or TBI, speech
attitudes can be similar to those typically seen in adults with
developmental stuttering, and can be significantly more
negative than those reported for people with typical fluency.27
17.3.2 Acquired Functional Stuttering
Acquired functional stuttering may be characterized by features
that resemble those of developmental or acquired neurogenic
stuttering,55 although characteristics can also be atypical.56

can be found in Chung et al (case 3)55 and in Baizabal-Carvallo
and Jankovic.45
Speech Characteristics
The largest retrospective study of acquired functional stuttering
to date was conducted by Baumgartner and Duﬀy.39 Their obser-
vations were based on 49 individuals diagnosed with acquired
functional stuttering without accompanying neurological disease
and 20 who received an additional diagnosis of neurological
disease. Speech disfluencies were primarily characterized by
sound or syllable repetitions (80% of all cases). Prolongations
(27% of cases) and blocks (18% of cases) were also observed
but much less frequently. Of the nine patients for whom reading
adaptation was assessed, eight showed an absence of this eﬀect.
The most relevant feature supporting a functional diagnosis
was a rapid improvement of stuttering symptoms in 70% of
these cases following one to two sessions of speech therapy.
17.3 Symptomatology
275

Most reported cases were diagnosed with functional stutter-
ing because of a lack of a known neurological etiology.55,57,58
One person developed frequent sound-syllable repetitions in
addition to posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, and cogni-
tive impairments, after being injured in an active war zone.57
Another adult male developed stuttering characterized by fre-
quent repetitions and blocks, with no periods of fluent speech.
Known fluency-enhancing conditions, such as choral or whis-
pered speech and reduced auditory feedback, did not result in
increased fluency. Neuropsychological and medical tests did
not point to any abnormal findings or potential organic cause.58
One of the authors of this chapter (CT) worked with a woman
who had a sudden onset of stuttering while in hospital for acute
stroke. Her speech was characterized by bizarre stress patterns,
final-word repetitions, and multisyllabic repetitions. It was
concluded that her stuttering most likely was a psychological
reaction to distressing information that she received about her
home situation while she was admitted to hospital. Her disfluen-
cies subsided immediately when the home situation was
addressed. Another individual seen by the second author (LDN)
demonstrated very severe stuttering, primarily characterized by
sound-syllable repetitions and blocks, on almost every word
during speaking and reading, accompanied by significant strug-
gle behavior. His stuttering had started following a minor car
accident. Although medical examination immediately following
the accident did not show any evidence of whiplash or any other
neurological lesions, there were obvious psychological stressors
in his personal life coinciding with the development of stutter-
ing, and the stuttering was considered to be functional in nature.
Together, these cases show that many speech characteristics
are similar to those reported for acquired neurogenic stuttering
earlier, or developmental stuttering in previous chapters.
However, atypical features such as final-word multisyllabic
repetitions and absence of islands of fluency can also occur.
Nonspeech Characteristics
Concomitant behaviors, such as facial grimacing and obvious
muscle tension in the orofacial area and extremities, were
observed in a majority of individuals reported in the study by
Baumgartner and Duﬀy.39 These behaviors can occur infre-
quently in some clients57 but can also present as severe struggle
behavior58—as was the case for the man who started stuttering
following a minor accident described earlier. The woman with
an onset of functional acquired stuttering following stroke
described earlier did not seem bothered by or aware of her
stuttering, which is consistent with the suggestion that some
people with acquired functional stuttering may present with
"la belle indiﬀerence."56 Overall, the presence of atypical strug-
gle behaviors and emotional reactions, in addition to atypical
speech behaviors, can be considered an important observation
leading to the identification of acquired functional stuttering.39
17.4 Diagnostic Considerations
17.4.1 General Considerations
When assessing an individual with possible acquired stutter-
ing, the speech-language pathologist will need to consider a
number of diﬀerent aspects as part of their evaluation (see
▶Table 17.2). In addition, two general issues need to be con-
sidered. First, it is important to determine whether the
observed stuttering disfluencies are newly developed or the
continuation or reemergence of previously present develop-
mental stuttering. Knowledge of any preexisting fluency
disorder needs to be explored as it may result in a better
understanding of the nature of the disorder and could influence
the nature and direction of any recommended intervention.
Second, it needs to be assessed whether the observed acquired
stuttering is neurogenic, functional, or feigned in nature. This
may be a somewhat more diﬃcult question to answer as the
relationship between the presence or absence of a neurological
lesion or illness and subsequent acquired stuttering is not
always straightforward. Diﬀerential diagnosis becomes increas-
ingly more diﬃcult the longer the interval between the diagnosis
of the neurological lesion or disease and the onset of stuttering.
Furthermore, individuals with a medically diagnosed neurologi-
cal lesion or disease may still develop acquired functional
stuttering as a result of their psychological reactions to the
disease, or to other distressing life events occurring around the
same time as the disease. Cases of acquired stuttering also have
been reported where the absence of any clear neurological
symptoms initially led to a diagnosis of functional stuttering,
which later had to be revisited when it became apparent that
there was an underlying neurological condition for which the
onset of stuttering was one of the first observable symptoms.11

The diﬀerential diagnosis of acquired neurogenic versus func-
tional stuttering can be complex and is an ongoing dynamic
process that needs to be continuously reassessed as more
information becomes available to the clinician.
17.4.2 Assessment Protocol
Case History
A full assessment of acquired stuttering needs to start with a
comprehensive case history. A good place to start would be the
medical file, if available, which normally includes information
on the medical diagnosis and disease history. Special attention
should be given to the time of disease onset and any fluctua-
tions in the symptomatology, such as changes in severity, since
onset. Typically, the medical file will also include details on past
and current medication, so their potential impact on speech
and language can be investigated. Details on brain imaging,
other medical tests, and personal history could provide a
deeper insight into potential causal factors for the acquired
stuttering. For instance, the absence of neurological deficits
may be indicative of acquired functional stuttering, especially
if associated with stressful emotional variables in the client's
personal life.
In addition to the medical information, the speech-language
pathologist should probe the history of speech and language
development, with special emphasis on the presence of devel-
opmental stuttering and whether recovery occurred. Particular
attention should be given to previous stuttering treatment the
client may have received, including the use of self-management
strategies (e.g., avoidance, speech rate changes). If the client has
a history of developmental stuttering, the speech pathologist
would need to clarify whether the onset of a neurological lesion
or disease resulted in a reemergence, an increase, or a decrease
of previous stuttering disfluencies. Another component of the
case history to explore is the impact of the speech disfluencies
on the client's quality of life and their self-perceptions of the
stuttering and general communication competence. Much of
this information can be obtained during the interview with the
client and/or significant others.
Cognitive Assessment
The speech-language pathologist should also assess the client's
cognitive abilities, especially since some stuttering intervention
techniques require a level of self-monitoring of or insight into
stuttering that may be diﬃcult for clients with cognitive defi-
cits. In clients with acquired neurogenic stuttering, it is likely
that results from either the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE)59 or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)60
are included in their medical file as these are the most com-
mon assessment tools used by medical professionals, but
they can also be administered by a speech-language patholo-
gist. The MMSE is a short test, probing diﬀerent areas of
cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and
calculation, recall, and language. The MOCA aims to test cog-
nitive abilities in clients with mild cognitive impairments
regardless of etiology and may be more sensitive to the
clients typically seen by the speech-language pathologist for
acquired stuttering.
Speech and Language Assessment
Clients with acquired neurogenic stuttering often have other
speech and/or language disorders such as aphasia (including
word-finding diﬃculties), dysarthria, apraxia of speech, and
palilalia. Many of these disorders may lead to fluency disrup-
tions in speech, which can resemble features of acquired stut-
tering. Therefore, a thorough speech and language assessment
is necessary for diﬀerential diagnosis and intervention plan-
ning. Clinical manuals and textbooks of acquired language and
speech disorders provide extensive information on available
test instruments, both norm based and informal, that can be
used with this population. Some of the most commonly used
instruments are the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination
(BDAE)61 and the Comprehensive Aphasia Test (CAT).62 The CAT
also includes a cognitive section and a disability questionnaire
to address the impact of the disorder. To assess word finding,
tests such as the Boston Naming Test (BNT)63 could be used.
The Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (FDA)64 and the Apraxia
Battery for Adults (ABA)65 can be used to guide the assessment
of dysarthria or apraxia of speech, respectively. However, the
results of these tests should be interpreted with caution, given
that the diagnostic profiles for these speech disorders are a
topic of debate.66,67 Of course, not all clients will need to com-
plete each of these tests and the speech-language pathologist
should tailor the assessment protocol to the client's needs and
the underlying disorder(s) that is believed to have led to the
stuttering.
Speech Fluency Assessment
A detailed analysis of the typical and stuttering speech
disfluencies observed in the client's speech during various
speech tasks such as reading of single words, sentences and
text, picture description, monologue, conversation, and semiau-
tomatic serial speech (e.g., days of the week, months of the
year, counting) is an essential component of an assessment for
acquired stuttering. Ideally, speech samples should be collected
at multiple time points and in diﬀerent speech situations (e.g.,
in the clinic and at home).
The most common test for stuttering severity is the Stutter-
ing Severity Instrument, Fourth Edition (SSI-4),79 which meas-
ures stuttering frequency, duration of longest stutters, and
physical concomitants. These scores combine to yield an overall
severity score ranging from very mild to very severe. However,
the clinician should be aware that stuttering frequency may
change, sometimes dramatically, over time and across diﬀerent
speech situations and tasks. Furthermore, the scores on the SSI-
4 may not reflect the eﬀects of coping strategies, such as word
avoidances, or techniques learned in intervention (e.g., gentle
onset, slowed speech, or voluntary stuttering), on stuttering
frequency. Therefore, the SSI-4 should only be used as an
approximate estimate of observable stuttering severity at the
time of testing, not as a general some indication of some invari-
ant core stuttering severity.
Nonspeech Behaviors
In addition to a detailed analysis of the speech fluency behavior,
the speech-language pathologist should also note the presence of
concomitant behaviors, such as avoidance, escape, and struggle
17.4 Diagnostic Considerations
277

behaviors. Although the absence of these behaviors has tradi-
tionally been viewed as characteristic of acquired neurogenic
stuttering, more recent studies and reviews discussed earlier
in this chapter have shown that nonspeech behaviors are
often present in this population.
Speech-Related Attitudes and Quality of Life
The psychological and emotional reactions of individuals with
acquired stuttering should also be assessed. Again, contrary to
initial assertions, research has since shown that many people
with acquired neurogenic stuttering develop negative speech
attitudes similar
to those with developmental stuttering.
Indeed, acquired stuttering can have a significant impact on the
individual's quality of life. Instruments, originally developed for
the assessment of developmental stuttering, can be used or
adapted for use with clients with acquired stuttering. These can
include questionnaires such as the Overall Assessment of
Speaker's Experience of Stuttering (OASES),68, the Modified
Erickson Scale of Communication Attitudes (S-24),69 and the
Speech Situation Checklist (SSC).70 Other instruments, such as
the Communicative Participation Item Bank (CPIB),71 aim at
assessing the impact of communication disorders on a person's
self-perceived communicative participation and can also
provide useful assessment information.
Trial Intervention
Clinicians are encouraged to implement one or more trial
interventions during the assessment session. Such interven-
tions can consist of producing words or short sentences with
slowed or stretched speech, using modeled gentle onset dur-
ing picture naming or single word reading, chorus reading,
and speaking under delayed auditory feedback. The main
purpose of trial interventions is to provide insight into the
variability of the speech fluency disorder, which may guide
intervention planning. It also serves as a motivator for the
client who may become aware, sometimes for the first time,
that stuttering is not invariant and that clinical intervention
can modify severity. Finally, as we have discussed in the
section on acquired functional stuttering, the implementa-
tion of successful intervention strategies during the initial
assessment may help diﬀerentiate between neurogenic and
functional forms of acquired stuttering.
Summary of Findings and Diagnosis
At the end of the assessment, the clinician should attempt to
determine a diagnosis. Formulating a diagnosis, even if we
acknowledge that it may be modified as additional information
becomes available, is important. It will give the clinician and
other clinical service providers a better understanding of the
observed disorder and will guide the formulation of an inter-
vention plan. However, not every assessment necessarily will
result in a diagnosis of acquired stuttering. Although the
assessment is often motivated by the perception, either by
the client, the clinician, or someone else, that the speech
disfluencies are suggestive of stuttering, the clinician must
leave open the possibility that the disfluencies may not
represent acquired stuttering but rather are symptomatic of
other speech or language disorders. Even if the disfluencies
are indicative of stuttering, they may coexist with other
speech and language disorders.6 Considering the possibility
that acquired stuttering may very well co-occur with other
communication disorders is necessary to avoid underdiagno-
sis and thus a lack of focused treatment for the fluency prob-
lems. Even if the clinician is confident about a diagnosis of
acquired stuttering, it may not always be possible to deter-
mine the precise nature of the acquired disfluencies. For
instance, the clinician may have insuﬃcient information to
determine with certainty whether the problem is neurogenic
or functional in nature. In this case, a full descriptive sum-
mary of the findings would be the best approach to provide a
complete picture of the characteristics of the disorder to
guide future intervention or to communicate to other clinical
service providers.
Additional Assessment Considerations for
Acquired Functional Stuttering
The assessment and diagnosis of acquired functional stuttering
can be complex and requires input from other clinical medical
and neuropsychological experts. Furthermore, because the
diagnosis of a functional disorder is often primarily based on
the absence of an organic cause, the speech-language patholo-
gist should always consider the possibility that an organic neu-
rological cause for the stuttering may become apparent later.
Diﬀerential diagnosis requires that the clinician look beyond
the obvious speech characteristics and include additional infor-
mation, where available, especially from the case history, medi-
cal and psychiatric examination, and neuropsychological tests.72
For example, Baumgartner and Duﬀy39 reported that 35%
of their patients with acquired functional stuttering (without
co-occurring neurological disease) had a prior diagnosis of a
related or unrelated functional disorder.
Typical characteristics of a functional disorder include exces-
sive manifestation of the behavioral symptoms, inconsistencies
with the typical behavior expected in the organic disorder,
relative lack of variability in how the behavior manifests itself,
severe struggle behavior, and a previous diagnosis of functional
disorders.44 Additional signs include suggestibility and distract-
ibility of the patient in the manifestation of their symptoms
and the potential for rapid reversibility and improvement of the
symptoms.55 Normal or near-normal speech fluency within one
or two therapy sessions occurred for 77% of clients with func-
tional stuttering without an accompanying neurological condi-
tion, and for 63% of clients with such a condition.39 One of the
often referred to characteristics of functional acquired stutter-
ing is "la belle indiﬀerence" whereby the client has no obvious
concern about the stuttering or its impact. However, this may
also be present in neurological disorders and can sometimes be
influenced by personal or cultural expectations, such as stoic
attitudes toward disease.44 ▶Table 17.3 summarizes questions
that a clinician may consider when diﬀerentiating acquired
neurogenic and functional disorders.44,73 The answers to these
questions may not always be suﬃcient to arrive at a diﬀerential
diagnosis. However, the more questions answered aﬃrmatively,
the more confident a clinician can be of a functional origin to
the observed disfluencies.
Acquired Stuttering: Etiology, Symptomatology, Identification, and Treatment
278

Additional Assessment Considerations for
Feigned Stuttering
The diagnosis and management of people with factitious and
malingered stuttering is challenging due to the lack of defini-
tive objective assessments of deception. It also needs to be
considered carefully, as it can have significant medicolegal
implications and, if misdiagnosed, can prevent someone from
accessing necessary treatment.74 Therefore, the diagnosis
should be made in collaboration with a person experienced
with mental health disorders, and a speech-language pathol-
ogist who is familiar with the typical presentation of the
feigned disease. This will help identify several red flags for
malingering, such as inconsistent presentation style (e.g.,
changes in openness when asked about specifics of symptoms),
atypical symptoms (e.g., extreme presentation), internal incon-
sistencies (e.g., when asked to elaborate on case history), and
external inconsistencies (e.g., diﬀerences between self-report
and directly observed behaviors). Nonresponse to treatment
can also raise suspicions.74 This last factor is especially interest-
ing, as it contrasts with the rapid response to treatment often
seen in acquired functional stuttering.
Even when all the steps above have been followed, it may not
be possible to diﬀerentially diagnose neurogenic, functional,
and feigned stuttering with certainty.32,53,75 Notwithstanding
the underlying etiology, people who are negatively aﬀected by
acquired speech disfluencies should be oﬀered personalized
treatment for their fluency problems.
17.5 Treatment Options
17.5.1 General Considerations
To date, no intervention programs or strategies have been
developed specifically for treating acquired neurogenic or func-
tional stuttering. Our knowledge of the range of treatment
approaches and their eﬀectiveness, or lack thereof, has come
primarily from published case studies, sometimes reflecting the
clinician's repeated attempts at finding an intervention that
works. In addition, a number of published larger-scale clinical
survey studies shed some light on common clinical approaches
and their possible outcomes.5,76,77 Although the absence of
evidence-based guidelines for treatment certainly reflects the
lack of clinical research in this population, it also may reflect
the complex nature of acquired stuttering and its unique pre-
sentation in persons who often experience co-occurring motor
speech or language disorders resulting from neurological injury
or disease. Despite the lack of firm guidelines, there are several
principles that can guide the clinician in deciding what inter-
vention strategy to use.
First, not all individuals who develop acquired neurogenic
stuttering require treatment. The presence of stuttering may be
temporary and natural recovery may occur, especially in the
early stages following a neurological injury. For example, of 14
people identified with neurogenic stuttering in the acute phase
following stroke, 6 recovered from their stuttering symptoms
within 6 months.21 Also, the clinician should evaluate the
Table 17.3 Questions to guide the diﬀerential diagnosis of acquired neurogenic versus functional stuttering
Question
Rationale
1. Is there a history of other functional disorder diagnoses?
Many individuals with a functional disorder have had similar diagnoses in the past
2. Are there psychologically significant events that may help
explain the onset and presence of stuttering?
These may provide an indication of psychological factors underlying the stuttering.
In addition, remission and reoccurrence of stuttering can coincide with fluctuations in
those events
3. Is there no clear neurological event that precedes the
onset of stuttering?
A functional disorder is more likely if there is no known event or if the lag time is very
long
4. Is there evidence of secondary gain associated with the
presence of stuttering?
This may point to a functional disorder, but malingered stuttering may also need to be
considered in this case
5. Are the findings from the oral-motor examination
inconsistent with expected outcomes for motor speech
disorders or stuttering?
If they are, a functional explanation should be considered
6. Is the speech pattern incongruent with what we know
about stuttering?
Atypical speech symptoms should raise suspicions of a functional disorder
7. Do the speech disfluencies and concomitant behaviors
look exaggerated or excessive?
This should also raise suspicions of a functional disorder
8. Does the speech deficit show extreme fluctuations across
speech tasks or emotional content?
Fluctuations in disfluencies, especially during fluency-inducing conditions, can be
expected in acquired neurogenic stuttering. However, if such fluctuations are
extreme—from normal speech to severely disordered speech—they may be indicative
of functional stuttering
9. Can the presence or severity of the speech deficit be
influenced by suggestion?
In some individuals with functional stuttering, the suggestion by the clinician that a
task will be difficult or easy may affect the observed severity
10. Is the severity of the speech deficit susceptible to
distraction?
The presence or severity of functional stuttering may change significantly, for
example, if the conversation changes from a formal to a more casual interaction with
the clinician
11. Is the speech deficit reversible?
The fact that stuttering can often be dramatically reversed successfully during one or a
few sessions has been considered the strongest evidence for functional stuttering

279

presence and severity of stuttering within the context of oth-
er speech, language, and cognitive diﬃculties the person may
be experiencing. Sometimes treating other disorders is a pri-
ority and focusing on the stuttering may not be appropriate
or necessary at that stage in the individual's care. In addition,
some individuals may not experience the presence of stutter-
ing as unduly disruptive in their daily communication. Stut-
tering treatment often requires a high degree of motivation
on the part of the client, as well as the necessary cognitive,
metalinguistic, and motor skills to monitor and modify
speech. If the client is not able or ready to bring these skills
to the treatment or is not overly concerned about the stutter-
ing, it may be better to focus on other aspects of communica-
tion or delay starting stuttering therapy until the client is
ready.
Second, the clinician should not only focus their treatment on
the speech disfluencies but also address the individual's experi-
ences with stuttering and communication. In the case of
chronic acquired stuttering following brain lesions, the goal of
treatment should be to limit the severity of stuttering, optimize
communication and quality of life, and help the individual
with acceptance of residual speech fluency disruption. This is
especially the case when working with clients with neurodege-
nerative disorders, where the speech problems can be expected
to worsen over time.
Third, the goal setting, evaluation, and subsequent decision-
making regarding the direction of treatment should be done
collaboratively between the clinician and the client. To the
extent possible, it should also involve important people in the
client's environment, such as partners and other individuals
who provide support during recovery. As part of the interven-
tion, the clinician should always provide clients and their sup-
port networks with the necessary self-management skills to
continue working on maintaining and improving the progress
made once treatment is scaled back or terminated.
Fourth, individuals with acquired neurogenic stuttering may
experience cognitive diﬃculties, mobility issues, as well as
other physical and mental limitations. Therefore, it is important
for the speech-language pathologist to be an integral part of the
care team for the client, and coordinate their intervention in
consultation with the other health professionals involved in
the client's care. Referrals to other services will need to be
considered where necessary (e.g., for clients who could bene-
fit from mental health counseling or need advice regarding
occupational support).
17.5.2 Treatment Approaches
With these general considerations in mind, there are a number
of diﬀerent treatment approaches that can be used for people
with acquired stuttering.
Speech Intervention
Most clinical interventions for acquired neurogenic stuttering
consist of treatment techniques typically used for developmen-
tal stuttering. Survey results from 81 clinicians showed that
most chose a fluency-shaping approach, consisting primarily of
teaching a slow speech rate and easy onset, or a combination of
both. Far fewer listed a stuttering modification approach or a
focus on acceptance and relaxation, as their preferred interven-
tion.76 Other surveys found that clinicians preferred to use an
eclectic approach, consisting of a combination of slowed speech
rate and counselling,77 or fluency-shaping and stuttering modi-
fication approaches.77 Treatment outcomes are mostly reported
as being positive, although these results may be influenced by
spontaneous recovery, and are based on subjective clinical
impressions rather than documented measures.5,76,77
Although stuttering intervention techniques for developmen-
tal stuttering are often used with individuals with acquired
neurogenic stuttering, and can result in positive outcomes, the
clinician needs to be aware of the influence of other processing
diﬃculties that the client may experience. For instance, to
achieve speech rate control, clients must be able to monitor
their speech and manage their rate consistently, which may be
challenging for individuals with motor speech disorders and
cognitive deficits. In those cases, the use of self-pacing techni-
ques, such as a pacing board, a toggle switch, or finger tapping
may be useful.23 Other common management approaches for
dysarthria, such as rhythmic cueing and increasing loudness,
which often result in a slower speech rate, could also be used.73
Altered Auditory Feedback
Some clinicians have commented on the eﬀectiveness of de-
layed auditory feedback in treating clients with acquired neuro-
genic stuttering. However, the results are variable. Decreases in
stuttering frequency have been reported in some cases with
stuttering following TBI,78 but no change or an increase in
disfluencies has been reported in clients with stroke-induced
stuttering.79 When present, positive eﬀects did not transfer to
speech outside the clinic setting.78 Further clinical research,
especially focusing on long-term eﬀects, is needed before any
conclusions can be drawn about the usefulness of altered audi-
tory feedback. Whether altered auditory feedback can be used
eﬀectively as a treatment will also depend on the client's toler-
ance for the technology. Clinically, we have noticed that some
clients, especially those with concomitant cognitive problems
or those suﬀering from headaches, may find the auditory dis-
tortion caused by the altered feedback to be fatiguing and, as a
result, have a very low tolerance for this approach.
Drug Treatment
Although medication is typically not prescribed for the treatment
of acquired neurogenic stuttering, there have been several reports
describing the eﬀects of various therapeutic drugs. In some cases,
the stuttering may have resulted from the use of medications,75
such that once changed, a significant reduction in stuttering
occured.80 In individuals with Parkinson's disease, a direct rela-
tionship exists between the length and dosage of L-Dopa treat-
ment and the occurrence and severity of stuttering.81 Clearly, a
careful case history, including a detailed history of drug treat-
ment, is a critical part of the assessment of acquired stuttering. If
the clinician has reason to believe that drug treatment may be
one of the factors aﬀecting the presence or severity of stuttering,
they should consult with the appropriate medical professionals
to consider whether adjustments to the drug treatment, such as
stopping its use, adjusting the dosage, or switching to another
drug, would be appropriate.

280

Surgical Intervention
Surgical treatment for acquired stuttering is currently not
recommended. However, knowledge of the potential impact
of surgical intervention on stuttering is important as part of
mapping out clinical speech intervention. Most studies that
have investigated the link between neurosurgical treatment
and acquired stuttering have been done in Parkinson's dis-
ease, in particular regarding the eﬀects of deep brain stimu-
lation (DBS). Reports range from onset of stuttering following
DBS to worsening of preexisting stuttering to reemergence of
developmental stuttering.16,82 When the onset or severity of
stuttering may be related to a medical intervention, speech
therapy should be postponed until it is clear that modifying
the medical intervention (e.g., changing the medication or
making adjustments to the DBS, if deemed appropriate by the
treating physician) does not result in any significant improve-
ments in speech fluency.73
Additional Treatment Considerations for
Acquired Functional Stuttering
As stated earlier, symptomatic treatment of the functional stut-
tering behavior, as early as the initial assessment session, may
result in dramatic changes in the severity of stuttering. How-
ever, the speech-language pathologist should keep in mind that
there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment.
One of the important elements of treatment for acquired
functional stuttering is the acknowledgment of the disorder
and how the clinician communicates the nature of the disorder
to the client. The clinician needs to make it clear that they take
the problem seriously and explain that the diagnosis is based
on the behavioral features that the client is showing and experi-
encing, rather than the absence of certain features (i.e., no
known organic cause at the time of diagnosis).2 The use of the
term "functional stuttering," rather than "psychogenic stutter-
ing," often makes it easier for clients to accept the diagnosis and
the proposed treatment. It is also important to help the client
find appropriate ways to explain the diagnosis and potentially
rapid improvement to others in their social circle.
With regard to specific approaches to dealing with acquired
functional stuttering, a symptomatic approach focusing on
substituting a new speech pattern for the stuttering behavior
appears to be the most successful approach in many cases,72
especially when accompanied by a strong belief by the client,
and supported by the clinician, that they can and will recover
from stuttering. Nevertheless, the clinician needs to acknowl-
edge and accept that treatment may not always be successful.58
For instance, cognitive behavioral therapies have been proven
to be successful for treating functional disorders,83 but may not
be an acceptable intervention to all clients.2 The clinician
should also be aware that functional stuttering may co-occur
with other speech disorders or cognitive communication con-
cerns, which may need to be addressed as well in treatment.
The speech-language pathologist should acknowledge the limits
of their intervention skills, refer if appropriate, collaborate
regularly, and eﬀectively coordinate treatment with other pro-
fessionals, such as neurologists or mental health providers,
involved in the client's care.
Additional Treatment Considerations for
Feigned Stuttering
A multidisciplinary team approach is always necessary for
people who are feigning acquired stuttering, whether this is
factitious stuttering or malingering. Tactfully and nonjudg-
mentally presenting with inconsistencies in the presentation
of the symptoms to the client and oﬀering them a face-saving
way out could be a successful approach.74 Reviews of diﬀer-
ent intervention approaches with individuals with factitious
disorders or malingering showed that both supportive con-
frontational (e.g., discussing inconsistencies in symptoms)
and nonconfrontational (e.g., medication) approaches may
be useful, although not always successful, and that long-term
follow-up and support are usually required.84,85 As with
acquired functional stuttering, it is important to help the client
explain the presence of the behavior as well as the potentially
rapid change in the behavior to others in their environment.
17.6 Case Study
17.6.1 Background
B. was a 79-year-old woman without a history of developmen-
tal stuttering. An example of her speech prestroke can be seen
in ▶Video 17.1. One month after this video was recorded, B.
had a left occipital infarct, followed by a left total anterior circu-
lation stroke a month later. Following the strokes, she was diag-
nosed with expressive and receptive aphasia, apraxia of speech,
and cognitive impairments. Her expressive language was charac-
terized by perseverations, semantic and phonemic paraphasias,
word-finding diﬃculties, impaired writing, and mild disfluen-
cies. Her receptive language was mildly impaired, characterized
by greater diﬃculty understanding complex topics.
B. received 4 months of speech-language therapy, focusing on
word finding, easy onset speech, naturalness techniques, and
slowing down her speech rate. She was able to follow the
speech-language pathologist's models for easy onset speech,
naturalness techniques, and slowed speech; however, she could
not use these techniques independently and therefore did not
show notable improvements in her speech. Six months later, B.
experienced epileptic seizures, followed by an increase in part-
word repetitions, monosyllabic word repetitions, phrase repeti-
tions, and blocks. During therapy, easy onset techniques were
trialed as well as naturalness techniques, with little success.
Five months after the seizures, B. was referred to an aphasia
group. Although she chose not to attend this group because
she was embarrassed by her disfluencies, she did agree to indi-
vidual sessions.
17.6.2 Assessment
Assessments were carried out over two sessions, 1.5 months
apart, to allow monitoring of her disfluencies over a longer
period of time before starting intervention. The assessment ses-
sions aimed to collect information on (1) speech fluency during
diﬀerent speech tasks; (2) co-occurring speech, language, and
cognitive problems; (3) impact of the communication prob-
lems; and (4) possible treatment techniques.
17.6 Case Study
281

For the fluency assessment, speech samples were collected dur-
ing conversation and monologue. During conversation, stuttering
disfluencies occurred on 42% of syllables (▶Video 17.2). The par-
ticipant's concomitant behaviors consisted of facial movements
(e.g., jaw clenching) and movements of the extremities (e.g., fist
clenching and arm moving). These nonspeech behaviors were
mild and not distracting. Stuttering severity, as measured with
the SSI-486 was moderate. B. displayed negative emotions and
attitudes in reaction to her speech. When talking about how she
felt, she said, "I told them to just forget about me."
Assessment for co-occurring disorders started with the
CAT.62 The CAT results showed diﬃculties in all modalities of
language and cognition. To assess the impact of her communi-
cation diﬃculties on daily life, the Disability and Impact subtests
from the CAT were attempted, as was the CPIB,71 but the answers
were considered unreliable due to the comprehension diﬃculties.
Next, diﬀerent treatment techniques were trialed. B.'s fluency
improved dramatically during singing, unison speech, and sen-
tence repetition. During spontaneous conversation, her speech
was very fast paced and rushed. She could not slow down her
speech rate on request. When asked to tap along while speaking
to slow down her speech rate, she became distracted by her fin-
ger movements. However, when visual support for the tapping
was provided in the form of a makeshift pacing board, she was
able to slow down her speech rate and speak in a rhythm,
which led to a marked improvement in her fluency.
17.6.3 Treatment
Treatment sessions took place once a week for 1 hour. The treat-
ment was split into two blocks, with a 6-month intermission.
The first treatment block consisted of 9 sessions and the second
block of 10 sessions. B.'s speech, language, and cognitive prob-
lems required an approach that would not rely on comprehen-
sion of complex instructions, and considerable monitoring of
speech production. Thus, most treatment techniques developed
for adults with developmental stuttering could not be used
with this client. Based on observation, it was decided to use a
paced speech approach, with visual and tactile feedback from a
six-square pacing board (▶Fig. 17.4), complemented with low-
level cognitive restructuring.
The first treatment block focused on learning to use the pacing
board and regain confidence when speaking to other people. Each
session started with spontaneous conversation without the pacing
board to establish a baseline fluency measure. Then the pacing
board was introduced. The client was encouraged to tap on a
square on the pacing board with her finger, for each syllable that
she produced. During the training phase, the use of the pacing
board was modeled by the speech therapist. Then B. was encour-
aged to repeat what the speech-language pathologist was saying,
using unison speech with the clinician while tapping along. The
same sentence was repeated a couple of times, and the therapist
gradually provided less guidance. First, the therapist stopped tap-
ping along on the pacing board, then fully stopped tapping
along, and finally stopped the unison speech.
Once the pacing led to consistent fluency during sentence
repetition, this technique was applied during spontaneous
conversation. B. regularly needed reminders and modeling to
continue using the pacing technique. During this activity, her
fluency markedly improved (▶Fig. 17.5 and ▶Video 17.3).
Next, the names of family members were gradually introduced
into the conversation and practiced. This step was added as B.'s
fluency during conversation was often interrupted by word-
finding pauses when trying to say family member's names.
Video 17.2 This video provides supporting information for the case
study in the chapter. The selected video clip shows B. while having a
spontaneous conversation with the speech-language pathologist
during the first assessment session. It shows the occurrence of
stuttering disfluencies poststroke.

Video 17.1 This video provides supporting information for the case
study in the chapter. The selected video clip shows B. while having a
spontaneous conversation with a reporter for a TV interview. This
interview was recorded 1 month before B.'s first stroke and provides
evidence of her fluent speech prestroke.
Acquired Stuttering: Etiology, Symptomatology, Identification, and Treatment
282

During the sessions, strategies to increase B.'s confidence and
decrease her anxiety when talking to others were discussed.
B. reported always feeling rushed and under pressure to speak
quickly. She indicated that she would feel more comfortable if
people knew that she needed more time. Therefore, the fol-
lowing text was printed on the back of the pacing board: "My
name is B. I had a stroke. Please give me time to talk. Thank
you for your patience." B. was taught to show this to new con-
versation partners before starting a conversation, and she was
reminded that it was okay to take her time whenever she
started to rush her speech. Later in the treatment sessions, B's
frustration about getting stuck was addressed and strategies—
relaxation through deep breathing, self-imposed time-out, and
easy onset—to address this were implemented using modeling.
At the end of the first treatment block, B. had made significant
gains in fluency. This was reflected in a reduction in disfluencies
from 41 to 24% SS during spontaneous (non-paced) conversation,
a decline in stuttering severity from moderate to mild on the
SSI-4, and a decrease in secondary behaviors. In addition, she
had markedly more confidence when speaking. Treatment was
then paused for 6 months due to significant events occurring in
B.'s life. When treatment restarted, she reported not to have
worked on her speech during the break. Her disfluencies during
spontaneous conversation had returned to pretreatment levels
(66% SS, moderate severity). B. also reported to be socially
isolated and did not want to participate in any activities
organized at the retirement village. Using a shared goal-
setting approach, the end goal of the second treatment block
was increased participation in activities in her community.
After quickly regaining the ability to use paced speech, B.'s
treatment sessions focused on skill transfer and generalization.
To encourage this, a family member and a close friend under-
went conversation partner training during the last five sessions,
and B. practiced using her techniques with them. The conversa-
tion partner training consisted of instructed demonstration of
pacing and self-monitoring strategies so conversation partners
could remind B. to use these strategies. During transfer ses-
sions, B.'s speech improved from baseline (22% SS, mild
severity; ▶Fig. 17.5), but did not reach the same fluency levels
as during the conversations with the speech therapist alone.
More importantly, increasing B.'s awareness about the impor-
tance of participating in community activities, and working on
her confidence levels when speaking, led to a steady increase in
activity participation. Over the course of the second treatment
block, B. started to attend gatherings and outings organized in
her retirement village as well as weekly gym classes. As the
treatment sessions progressed, B. said she was more confident
and willing to engage with others.
17.7 Concluding Remarks
This chapter provides a review of the various forms of acquired
stuttering that may be seen in clinical practice, especially by
clinicians working in a hospital or rehabilitation environment.
Acquired neurogenic stuttering is a speech fluency disorder
that aﬀects individuals who most often, but not exclusively,
have experienced a stroke, TBI, or neurodegenerative disease.

study in the chapter. The selected video clip shows B. while using the
paced speech approach toward the end of the first treatment block. It
shows the increase in fluency while using this technique.
17.7 Concluding Remarks
283

In addition, acquired stuttering can be functional in nature as
well as factitious or malingered. Although acquired stuttering is
seen mainly in adults, it can also occur in younger individuals.
We have described principles of assessment and options
for intervention. Regardless of the nature of the acquired
stuttering, assessment and intervention approaches will need
to be highly individualized based on the characteristics of the
fluency problem, as well as any other communication or
health conditions. As clinicians become more aware of the
potential presence of acquired stuttering in the clients they
serve, and the impact this may have on their clients' personal
and professional life, they will be more likely to recognize
and diagnose the disorder, and researchers will be able to
provide a more accurate picture of its incidence and preva-
lence. This, in turn, should lead to a more thorough under-
standing of the nature of the disorder and ultimately to
investigations of eﬀective intervention approaches that not
only target speech disfluencies but also focus on communica-
tive competence, participation, and quality of life.
