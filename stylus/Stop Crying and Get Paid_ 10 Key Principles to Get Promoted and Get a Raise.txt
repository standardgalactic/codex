Introduction
This may be a breath of fresh air for you—or maybe, it will hit you where it hurts. I simply wrote this book for the generation of "Go-getters" vs. the "Whiners."
I have noticed a lot of newer generation employees (and sometimes seasoned professionals) working and whining like they are entitled to something more than what they are getting paid.
This sense of entitlement is what makes employers weary, agitated and annoyed. If you keep this in mind as you continue reading, you may understand your employer's (boss') point of view as a person, not just as a boss.
Just think of how much you detest dealing with people who make you weary, agitated or annoyed.
This sense of entitlement that I speak of is this: a feeling where some people believe that they simply deserve more—but instead of proving their worth (to the satisfaction of the payer), they complain and/or try to plead their case.
This book is designed to give you some key principles so you can use to demonstrate that you are a valuable commodity as a person, and show why your boss should pay you more or promote you in order to keep you instead of those other crybabies.
Even if you do not agree with or like what you read in this book, keep reading.
Stop complaining.
Then, apply what you have read. You will learn how to earn the money that you think you are entitled to.
If you are ready to stop crying and get paid ...
... Keep reading to learn the 10 Key Principles to Get Promoted and Get a Raise on your job!








My Story
So, who am I and why am I qualified to write this book?

 
I am more than qualified to give you tips for three main reasons:

Every job I have ever wanted, I got.
Every year I was employed, I was either promoted or got a raise (not a cost of living increase, an increase or bonus on my merit).
I have years of experience as an employer of hundreds of employees.

As you can tell from my age in the timeline, these jobs were not all after college and therefore did not require a college degree. In fact, I did not get my bachelor's degree until I turned 33!
For the jobs that did require a degree, the degree was used to get interviews and the rest was up to me.
What I will also tell you is that I attained many of these positions without applying for them. What I did was ...
... Well, continue reading to find out the steps I took.
These are simple steps to take and they have been working for centuries!
That is correct. I said CENTURIES!
I did not come up with these principles on my own; I learned them from studying other successful people in history as well as many I personally observed.
These principle still work today and they will work for you—no matter your age, race or gender.
Ready?
Good. Here we go!
















1. Get your MIND Set
Most successful people know this already; that is why they are successful.
Look, I am not going to get into a whole book about mindset and spirituality and faith. But mindset is very important and that is why I made it the first chapter.
The first thing you must do is get your mind set. With the right mindset, you will be able stay focused on what you really want. You will see past all obstacles. You will ignore all the negative people telling you what cannot be done. You will not succumb to procrastination. With the right mindset, you WILL succeed!
What I mean by mindset is that you must be very clear on what you want. Be specific.
 
What do you really want?
 


- A promotion to what position?


- What type of work are you going to be doing?


- What are you willing to accept?


- How long are you willing to wait?


- Why do you want it?


- How important is it to you?


- What are you willing to go through?


 
These are very important questions to consider before you get started. You have to get your mind set for all of the obstacles that you will turn into challenges to make you stronger.
 
The last three questions are the most important:


- Why do you want it?


- How important is it to you?


- What are you willing to go through?









Let me tell you a story ...
When I was 18, after realizing that college was not in my plans just yet, I set my eyes on being a District Manager for a fairly new cookie bakery chain in downtown Chicago.
 
 
Why did I want it?
I learned that the District Manager gets a salary, car allowance (I could get a new car and they would pay the car note) and a bonus check (valued more than the salary) every month made up of a percentage of sales from each of his stores.
I knew I was not going to make a living on an hourly wage, so I wanted the salary. I also knew that I could make as much as I wanted as long as I could assist my store managers to bring in sales. The bonuses would help me assist my family.
I skipped college to help my family financially, so I HAD to succeed. It was important.







How important was it to me?
This was the first job that I went out of my way to get because my family was going through hard times. Neither of my parents were working and we were in many situations where we ran out of food or had utilities turned off, and I knew they needed help to keep their house out of foreclosure.
I could not stand the pain of seeing my proud father feel hopeless. My mom did the best she could to figure out how to scrape together food to make meals. When my sister and I got hungry, we were fortunate to have mayonnaise sandwiches or sugar toast. We still had electricity so we were able to heat up pots of water to bathe over a sink, but in the wintertime, we sometimes wore our coats indoors as well as outdoors.
This was a very temporary state of undesirable living conditions, but I was dead set on making sure it never happened again!
I did the math that a monthly bonus from three to five stores would be more than enough to take care of everything, and help my little sister get to college.
... But I had to act fast to get into management and start getting bonuses.







What was I willing to go through?
I was willing to do whatever it took. In fact, my mindset was so strong that I KNEW that I was would be a District Manager in a couple of years, no matter what!
All I had to do was get to work ...
I got my mind set to work hard as if I owned the business. Keep in mind, I was an 18-year-old kid, just out of high school. So this was a big deal!
I was promoted to Store Opener/Crew Leader, which was a really big deal—because I made it a big deal.
While most of my co-workers and friends my age complained about having to go to work (then whining about not getting enough hours); I was excited.


- I was excited that this great, up-and-coming company trusted me with the keys to their store.


- I was excited that they trusted me with the safe combination to set up the cash drawers for the day.


- I was excited that they trusted me to take the money from yesterday's sales to the bank.


- I was excited that they trusted me to mix the cookie dough and brownie mix from scratch and bake these goods to serve to the public.


- I was excited that they trusted me to have another employee come in to assist me, and I could tell this employee what to do.


- I was excited that they trusted me to open the doors to the public at 6:00 am every morning and represent this great company.


My mind was set for success. My mind was set with excitement. My mind was set to represent the quality that this company had to offer, with pride!
My mind was set to become a District Manager in this company over at least five stores, and I would run it like my own business.







Again, what was I willing to go through?
I was willing to go through whatever was needed in order to become a District Manager. I knew it was not going to be easy, so I started out doing what most people did not want to do: getting up at 2 am to catch a bus and a train downtown.
I was willing to lose most of my friends who were out having fun, like most 18-year-olds. Many ridiculed me for wasting my time because they did not believe that the company would ever let anyone so young be an Assistant Manager, so it would take forever to be a District Manager.
Even one of my closest friends, Ed, egged on, "Besides, there are not even any Black managers, do you think they will ever let a Black man be in charge of a district of stores?"
While I was still 18, I became an Assistant Manager. Ed worked as a Crew Chief and continued the pressure: "They only made you an assistant because the new manager we have is Black, but you will have to wait forever to get your own store ..."
By age 20, I got my own store! This WAS a big deal!
 
It is a BIG DEAL... If you MAKE it a BIG DEAL!







Ed later came to work for me, now as an Assistant Manager. As my personal motivation, he continued, "... OK, so you got a store, but you see they put you in a low-volume store where no one will notice you. There is no way you can be a District Manager working here."
I realized he was right, and I set my eyes on the highest-volume store in Chicago, the third-highest volume store in the country: the Randolph store. I had to become manager here if I was to ever make it to District Manager.
By age 21, I was promoted to manager of the Randolph Store, the highest-volume store in Chicago! It was awesome! I was on my way ... until Black Monday hit.
For those that do not know, Black Monday was the day that the stock market crashed almost as bad as the Great Depression in the 1920s. Needless to say, customers stopped spending money and sales plummeted.
And the 21-year-old Black kid was blamed for the 20% drop in revenue, and demoted from the highest-volume store with the biggest bonuses to the lowest-volume store in Chicago.
But I was still employed, so I knew I still had a chance. I kept pushing, even in the lowest-volume store.
I learned to control cost by minimizing labor and cost of goods sold; while at the same time maximizing sales. I even shared my bonuses with my assistants to motivate them to bring more to the bottom line.
Within the same year, the company brought in this tough business troubleshooter, named Vance, to turn things around. His mission was to find the hardest workers with the winning mindsets within the company. Somehow my name came up and he sought me out. I had the reputation of a "Go Getter", believing that anything was possible.
- This is KEY to remember, people are always watching you and you are always building a reputation
 
As part of Vance's team, we were to come up with many innovative ideas to minimize costs and bring sales back up in the Midwest region, which included the Chicago metro area and suburbs as well as stores in Wisconsin and Indiana. This was a "do or die" mission, meaning that all on the team agreed that we would resign if we did not succeed!
First, I doubled the revenue in the low-volume store I was managing.
 
Then, I was promoted to a higher-volume store in a party area. The bars on this same street did not close until 5 am, so the store stayed open until 1 am. There were three managers in this store because of the long hours of operation. I was willing to take the third shift as a condition to the promotion to the store. I kept the store open until 4 am and made more sales in the third shift than the first and second shift combined. Because of this bold move, our store also moved up to the fourth-highest volume in the city.
This got me promoted to General Manager (over the other two managers). I made the decision to keep this "party store" open 24 hours on the weekends, since we normally opened at 6 am, and we picked up more sales, moving us up to the #3 store in the city (+ bigger sales bonuses).
This moved me to be promoted to Area Manager over two other stores. I was collecting bonuses from three stores now, instead of one!
 
By age 23, I was promoted to District Manager over five stores in the city of Chicago. A year later, I was collecting bonus checks for sales over nine stores!
I made enough money to help my parents keep their house, spoil my family and get a home of my own. And although my little sister got a scholarship, I was able to assist her when she needed it, and even get her a job when she came home for the summer.
My mind was set on the end result with definiteness of purpose. I knew that I was going to be a District Manager within a few years. I knew this so strongly that even behaved like a district manager, from the time I realized what I wanted.
I still remember at the age of 19, before I was even a store manager, how I used to follow the District Manager around in my free time. Mr. Voss was a hardcore multi-store manager that drove his managers through excellence in customer service, cleanliness, quality of product and meticulous financial record keeping. And after my shift, there I was right next to him making his afternoon rounds. Learning how to operate as a District Manager.
After a short while, many of the employees were calling me an Assistant DM.
 
I hand my mind set on what I wanted and I got it.
 
You can to.

2. Look Good, Get Paid
This may come as a surprise, but looking good does matter!
Now, do not get me wrong—I am not talking about attractive-looking, model-type people. Although, if you are in the entertainment profession or modeling industry, that matters too.
But I am talking about grooming and personal care.
This is going to be very important for you to get before you move on to the next chapter, so pay attention and do not take this for granted.
When you take the time to look good, you are telling other people that quality is important to you, and you expect excellence of yourself and others. You are also saying that other people are important, so you want to look good for them.
 
Looking good is actually a compliment to others







Think about your dating experience. What do you do to prepare for a date?


- You make sure you are freshly showered


- You put on an appealing fragrance


- Ladies get their hair and nails done


- Gentlemen get that fresh new haircut


- You dress really nice, with what you have


- You brush your teeth, floss and use mouthwash


- You make sure to have fresh breath all night


The point is, you go out of your way to look good in hopes of a successful date. You look good to get paid ... attention.







Now take those same key items to take time to look good and get paid at work:
 

Bathe right before you leave the house
Skip the perfume and cologne


Body spray and aftershave is OK


Brush your teeth


Floss to get the food from between teeth
Use mouthwash to kill the bacteria


Use peppermints or mint candy right before you speak
Trim your fingernails (no color polish)
Fix your hair (for the office, not the club)


Ladies: if you look better with your hair down, let it down
Gentlemen: clean-shaven is best, otherwise neatly trimmed facial hair


Dress professionally, including nice shoes

This short—but accurate—list makes a world of difference.
You do not have to go out of your way and wear a suit or dinner dress. Also, you do not have to spend a lot of money.
You may be thinking, "Why is he putting a list here about personal grooming?"
 
Why?
For the same reason why ...
... a person walks around with their pants unzipped
... someone walks through the office with toilet paper on the bottom of their shoe
... the person you are talking to still has lettuce stuck in their front teeth
... no one wants to sit next to your chain-smoking co-worker
... the attractive person in the office cannot hold a conversation for more than a few minutes because of her halitosis (really bad breath)
You know these people. You have seen them. You may be guilty of doing what most people do with these people:
 
WHY?
...Because we do not tell them. Instead, we talk about them behind their back; make up nicknames; and they become known for "not-so-good" things.
Think about it, if it were YOU, you would hope that someone would tell you, right?
 
Right.
So, I am telling you.
Pay attention every day. Do not get stuck in your routine or get too lazy with your casual days.
You only meet people for the first time, ONCE. That first time is the impression that you leave with them. So give them something good to remember and talk about.
 
Checklist to Look Good and Get Paid
So, I am putting this simple list here for you to think about YOU. What are people at work saying about you, and not telling you?
 

How is your body odor?


Do you bathe right before you leave the house?
Do you skip the perfume and cologne?

 

How is your breath and oral hygiene?


Do you brush your teeth at work?
Do you floss to get the food from between teeth?
Do you use mouthwash at work?
Do you use peppermints or mint candy right before you speak?


Are you dressed as a professional, as a lazy kid or as someone at the dance club?


Are your fingernails trimmed?
Did you fix your hair for the office, not the club?
Gentlemen, are you clean-shaven or neatly trimmed?
Are you dressed in business or business casual attire?

I realize that there is a different acceptable dress code for IT professionals vs. accounting vs. the stock room.
My point is, look like the PROFESSIONAL of that department. Better yet, dress like the next level above your own. You want to look professional, like someone who is getting paid professional wages.







Let me tell you a story ...
I remember when I went for my first job. I was a teenager with no money and only a bus pass to get around the city.
When I first went to apply for the job, I was dressed like a teen: jeans, T-shirt ... I asked if they were hiring, although I was already tipped off that they were, but I was told, "No."
I came back three more times after that, and each time I was told that there were no openings. Then I heard that an acquaintance was hired during the time that I was asking, so I knew it was something about me.
With hardly any money, I went to a thrift store and bought a nice dress shirt and a pair of slacks for about $2. I borrowed a tie from my dad and a pair of dress shoes from my brother. A female friend helped me clip my fingernails and cut my hair.
 
Looking more like a young man who already had a job, I went back to talk to the same manager again. My application was already on file and he was familiar with me from my previous visits. However, this time, he did not recognize me right away. I went right in as if it was my first visit and asked again if he was hiring.
He replied, "Well, yes young man, let me get you an application. What kind of hours can you work and when are you available?"
I smiled and said, "Mr. Voss, I already put in an application and I can work every day after school, plus I am ready to start today!"
Mr. Voss smiled back and quickly realized that I was the same teen who kept coming by his store, week after week. However, I had transformed into a sharply dressed young man who had the look of someone professional. I appeared as if I cared about how I looked, and it was important for others to view me as professional as well. This was a vision of excellence that I would portray to his customers. He gave me a hiring packet and told me to take it over to the hiring manager and I was able to start right away!
 
This is the IMPORTANT PART
When you take the time to show that you care about yourself with how you look, you set the impression that you care about the quality of work that you deliver.
How you take care of yourself tells your potential employers, current employers and co-workers how you care for your job.
This is the MOST Important Part
Looking good will give you no extra points whatsoever if you do not smell good. No matter what you are wearing, before you interact with anyone, do the following:

Bathe with soap, right before you leave the house
Use body spray, lotion and/or aftershave only
Avoid perfumes and colognes in the workplace
Brush and floss your teeth
Use mouthwash if you have it
Before you speak, freshen your breath with a mint or gum

 
People spread bad news faster than good news







When we experience someone with bad breath or body odor (B.O.), we are quick to tell others so they can share in the experience. You do not want to be the one remembered as "Dragon Breath" or the one who clears the room with "Bad B.O."
I have worked on many project teams where one person was known as hard to work with. Not because of their attitude but because of bad breath, strong perfume, smoky smelling clothing or simply bad B.O.
 
You want to be remembered as the good-looking, fresh-smelling person whom people love to be around! Trust me, they will love to work with you more.
You want to be that person EVERY day and ALL day. You never know when you are going to meet your next boss for the first time. The one who will promote you.
 
This carries us to the next chapter: letting people like you.

3. Let People KNOW, LIKE and TRUST You
This chapter may be one that is pretty easy to understand. That is because it is something that comes naturally.
Since we were kids, we have had a keen sense of knowing if we want to spend time around someone.
Plainly put, as a child and even as an adult, we as humans like to spend most of our time with people that we know, like and trust.
It is not a multiple choice. All three are important for us.
For example, you may know a member of your family and trust that they will not harm you. However, you may not like spending time with them because they have a negative attitude, or maybe have bad breath because of their smoking habit.
Here's another example: You may have a friend that you have known for years. You like to hang out and watch movies with them because you have the same taste in movies. However, this is the type of friend that does not like to dress nicely, and is regularly very loud and obnoxious. Therefore, you do not trust them enough to go out to nice dinners or to hang out with your business associates.
You also need all three (know, like, trust) in order to make more money.
Why?

Money comes from other people. Remember that!
Other people are going to pay you to do something for them. (This is regularly known as a job (W2 or 1099).








WHY you need all three
To get the job, these 'Other People'...

Get to KNOW you by your resume or reputation or observation
Must LIKE you from the interview or from what they heard about you
Will have to TRUST that you are the one who can fulfill their needs

If you are, they will pay YOU to do the job they need done instead of someone else.
But then it starts all over again with your boss, co-workers and future boss (whom you have not met yet).
 
Here is what I mean ...
Your bosses may not really know all of the employees that report to them. Yes, you have more than one boss: your current manager, their manager(s) and your future boss (who could very well be your current co-worker or the peer of your supervisor).
So, depending on which boss will be offering an opportunity for more money, you may or may not be known yet.
Your goal is to let people get to know you
— The good part of you.
Let them only hear good things. Let them only see good things about you on social media and in pictures online. Good things about your family, friends, previous jobs, your health—everything good. Envious people will speak badly about you, but the right people will like you and so will your bosses.
You will be known as the person who always has good things going on.
Your boss likes some of her employees better than others, but she must treat everyone (on the same level) equally. However, again, human instinct will have her to spend more time with some than others for simple reasons. She will dread spending time with ones with bad breath, poor attitude or those that complain or gossip all the time.
It is fairly simple for you to let your boss like you. You are not in competition with your co-workers; it is simply being a likeable person—just what was described above in letting them know your good stuff; plus, it is amazing how contagious smiles are.
Your boss will like you for your positive attitude when work gets tough and you have to work longer hours, and like you as a person simply because of how you care for yourself. Simply put: work hard, look good, smell good, never complain or gossip and other people—the right people—will like you.
Your boss trusts the ones that she can depend on to make her job easier and make them look good. She knows which ones deliver good, quality work and which ones she has to double-check and validate.

If your boss keeps giving you more work after you received a compliment for the work you already completed, she trusts you.
If your boss asks you to join her in a meeting with others at her level and above, she trusts you.
If your boss asks you to work late and assist her with a project that she may be working on, she trusts you.
If your boss asks you to validate the work of your co-worker or to check her work, she trusts you.
If your boss sends you to a meeting, a conference or to someone else on her level or above to find out information, she trusts you.

She knows that you will represent her well and will not make her look bad. You are considered dependable if she is giving you more work to do. This is not a punishment. It is actually more of a test for the next level, to see how well you do under pressure.
You are a candidate for promotion and/or a raise.
Trust me.
...Just stay Persistent















4. Persistence Is EVERYTHING
In 2008, I was in Cancun, Mexico, at a personal development event featuring Andy Andrews. At this event, Andy introduced us to his new book, The Traveler's Gift.
This is a story about a man who finds himself traveling back in time, meeting leaders and heroes at crucial moments in their lives—from Abraham Lincoln to Anne Frank. By the time his journey is over, he has received seven secrets for success—and a second chance.
One of those seven secrets for success is "Persist without exception."
Persistence is EVERYTHING
In reading Andy's book, I realized that I have used this secret many times in my life, and I always won when I did. What I realized was that I was more persistent than most people usually are.
 
Here is what I mean:
You hear many leaders tell you about being persistent. They usually follow it with a description of something like "Give it your all," "Do your best," or "Try, try again."
 
You see, they got the persistence part right. But what was missing was the most important part that guarantees your win.
Which part is that?
The "... without exception" part.







Persist without exception means just that. There are NO exceptions.
 
This means the following do not apply:

Persist until I run out of money
Persist until I run out of options
Persist until I do not have any energy

You Persist Without Exception = you stay persistent until you win.
This is a "do whatever it takes until I get what I want" type of attitude.
It is not to be arrogant or narcissistic, but more of a tenacious, "work through 10,000-plus ideas until you make the light bulb like Edison" type of attitude!
 
I am telling you, Persistence is EVERYTHING!
The story of success I shared with you earlier, about our "do or die" deal we made to increase sales, get big bonus checks and get promotions???
We set daily sales goals and did not close the stores until we achieved the goals.
Even the slogan of the company was, "Good Enough Never Is", and we took it to heart!
Here's more...
"Get rich or die trying" -- 50 Cent
"Never, never, never give up" -- Winston Churchill
"Champions keep playing until they get it right" -- Billy Jean King
"If you can't fly, then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward" -- Martin Luther King, Jr.
"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again"
"It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer." -- Albert Einstein
"A failure is not always a mistake. It may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying."-- B. F. Skinner
"You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it." -- Maya Angelou
The point is this, if you persist until you achieve what you set out to accomplish, you are guaranteed to achieve your goal.







Let me tell you a story ...
It is a story about a client of mine named Mike. From a young age, Mike always wanted to be an on-air personality for his own show on a major radio station in Chicago.


- He worked his way through high school as a DJ at parties and practicing his skill.


- He applied for jobs at just about every radio station in the city.


- Then he applied to radio stations outside of the city.


- Mike volunteered on college radio stations for more experience.


- Mike honed his skill as a DJ at parties at skating rinks, and special events.


 
Finally, Mike got a call from a small radio station in a small town in Arkansas. With little to no money, Mike drove to Arkansas to be a radio personality. Although it was an overnight time slot at a small radio station, Mike persisted.
 
With the little money he had, Mike was able to buy food to eat until he got his first check. However, he had no place to stay, so he slept in his car the whole time.
 
Mike could have tucked his tail and gone back home, but he knew that this was the beginning. He had to persist without exception, as this first gig was just a stepping stone.
 
Mike heard about an opening in Philadelphia and heard they had an ear for his show. He persisted until he got the job in Philly.
 
 
 
Goal achievers and problems solvers get promoted.
Excuse makers and finger pointers do not.







Next, Mike got wind of an opportunity as the host of a morning show in Cleveland, Ohio. It was in the wrong direction (away from Chicago) but it was a chance at a morning slot. He persisted without exception until he got it.
 
While in Cleveland, Mike commuted to Chicago on weekends and came up with more ideas to have the Chicago market take notice of him:


- He created his own TV show on a public cable channel.


- He promoted huge parties for special events and holidays.


- He made special appearances at Chicago's hottest dance clubs.


Mike came up with many ideas, until a major Chicago radio station finally took notice. He was able to come back home and got their afternoon show.
Mike never gave up until he reached his dream. Mike knew that "persistence is everything."
Without exception, against all odds, Mike persisted.







So how does persistence get you paid?

When you clearly have your desire set on a higher position at your job or more money, you will figure out a way to get it ... until you get it.
When your department has a problem that needs solving, you will be the one persisting without exception to solve it ... and will be rewarded.
When your boss comes to you and asks if something can be done, you will answer "Yes," and then figure out a way.
When talent reviews are done, your name will come up for promotion to the next position because of your persistent reputation.
When "they" are looking for someone they can pay money to assist them, they will call you.

5. Get on a Winning Team
"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful." -Psalm 1:1
In other words, when you do not take advice from bad people, or stand idly by people who are doing wrong, or sit around with people gossiping and talking bad about other people... You will be pretty well off.
Whether you are a Christian follower or not; this is a lesson that was written over 2,000 years ago, and successful people follow this.
Look, you will become whom you hang around most.
Birds of a feather flock together" is an assumption where a person is actually guilty by association.
This is true wherever you go in life, so make sure you get on a winning team. In other words, as much as possible, associate yourself with successful people.
Again, I am writing most of this book from the point of human nature—not to undermine all of the advice that is given by colleges and universities—but I am offering real-world advice from my own experience and the experiences of others.
Regardless of the level of education of your employers, they are still human and they cannot help but to behave as humans.
All of us will treat other people based on our own personal experiences; whether the experiences be from early childhood, during adolescence or adulthood, we make judgments of people based on what we think we know.
Sometimes it can be a good judgment but usually, it is bad. For some reason, most people are drawn to the negative (that is why the news and talk shows are so popular—but that is another story).
 
 
If you can, remember this:
 
Stay away from people with negative energy
 
Otherwise, you will be guilty by association and it will hurt your bank account!







Let me tell you a story ...
On a warm school day, in the evening after school, there was a group of teenagers (all wearing red shirts) hanging out on a street corner by a local store. They were just talking to each other and laughing, doing what teens do.
Then, all of a sudden, another teenager ran out of the store, chased by the shop owner after shoplifting. He passed off some of the stolen products to some of his friends and they all took off running in the same direction of the thief—all except one.
This one innocent teen had no idea what was going on. He just happened to walk to the store that day with his 'friends'.
When the shop owner yelled, "Stop!" as he was chasing the thief, this one innocent boy just sat there. He never ran, because he was innocent.
However, the shop owner berated the one that stayed behind.
The police were called and two patrol cars arrived, lights and sirens flashing. The teen began getting questioned right outside the store in front of a gathering crowd.
The local news team just happened to be nearby, thought they had a breaking story and started filming.
Now, even more people gathered as the shop owner went on and on about the "Red T-shirt gang" that robbed his store.
This once quiet little neighborhood became a spectacle on this once-quiet evening at the corner store, because of one kid who stole a bunch of candy and ran.
The kid who stayed behind was branded as a "Red T-shirt" gang member who was apprehended by police for questioning.
Everyone on location spread rumors, while this was all happening, and by the time this innocent kid got to school the next day, he had a new reputation.
... And he did not do anything wrong. Or did he?
Sure, he was innocent and was never arrested. However, rumors already started spreading. His face was on the evening news, with a caption, "alleged member of the red t-shirt gang robs store".
Now this poor kid's reputation follows him as he gets older
 
Now, that is an extreme story; however, a true story. But the same thing exists in the workplace. I see it all the time.
Stay away from the wrong people if you want to make more money.
 
There are one or two people in your office right now that have probably been there for quite a while doing the same job, and have a wealth of knowledge.
However, they ...


- Are barely pulling their weight (they glorify the minimum work)


- Avoid change (they like doing things the way they know how)


- Complain about anything (especially that they are not getting paid enough)


- Usually say things like, "That is not my job."


- Spend a lot of time gossiping and talking about people instead of sharing ideas


- They constantly focus on the actions of others and compare themselves to slackers


- They have negative things to say about ambitious workers who are trying to improve


- Do just enough work to not get fired, and get paid enough not to quit









I urge you:

Do not eat lunch with them
Do not stop by for idle conversation
Do not ask them for advice
Do not associate with them after work
Do not bring up their name in conversation
Do not even sit next to them in meetings

 
Why?
(1) Because others will see you as their associate and think that you are like them or want to be like them.
(2) Their negative energy will make you and your bank account negative.
 
Look, the BEST way to MAKE MORE MONEY is to hang out with people whom MAKE MORE MONEY.
 
If you are the wealthiest person in the room, it is time to go to another room!







Associate with Go-Getters to Better Your Best
Wherever and whenever possible, surround yourself with positive people.
Their energy will uplift you and promote you to others. These are the Go-Getters that you want as friends.
Be very careful of the friends who "accept you just the way you are".
Look, the cashier at the department store accepts you just the way you are.
I knew someone who was cheating on her husband and the encouraging words of her close were, "do what makes you happy"! Of course she is now unhappily divorced.
I knew another who landed a dream job with great pay. Their friend celebrated with them by getting high. That job went away on Monday after a failed drug test.
If these people were associated with Go-Getters they would be encouraged and driven to do the right thing and be the best version of themselves.







Your Closest Associations Determine Your Income
 
Your income is approximately the average of the five people you hang around the most.
 
Let me put this in another perspective with a little test ...

List the names of the people you share casual conversation with the most throughout your day.
Next to each name, list their estimated income.
Sum all the incomes, and divide that total by 5
Is the average close to your income (+/- 20%)?

 




Name


Estimated Income




_______________________________


$_________




_______________________________


$_________




_______________________________


$_________




_______________________________

Total of all income =


$__________




Average Income (Total divided by 5) =

6. Help Your Boss Help You
First, consider who your boss is. Seriously. Think about it.
Your boss is the one who employs you to do work, yes.
But consider what that really means to you. Because of your boss:


- You get paid on a regular basis


- You get to buy groceries for yourself and your family


- You can pay for your place to live


- You have money to buy the things you like


- You have an opportunity to make more money


- You get to buy clothes for your kids


- Your holidays are even more joyous


- You have a purpose


 
This is one of the main reasons why I say, "Stop crying and get paid." I have seen and heard so many whining employees complain about their boss or their job.
 
I agree that there are some supervisors who do not deserve to be in charge—but there are very few. Nonetheless, still appreciate the fact that you have gainful employment.
Now, here is the key to getting a raise and getting promoted: Help your boss help you. Here is what I mean:
 
No boss wants a whining, complaining employee.
Bosses want an employee that helps them look good.
 
How to help your boss help you make more money:


- You help your boss look good by doing a good job.


- Doing a better job than most will make you a favorite employee (it is human nature).


- Your reward will most likely be more work.


- More work means you will gain more experience.


- More experience means more opportunity.


- More opportunity means more money ... through promotions and raises.


 
Now, I should actually stop there.
 
However, I want to give you some specific tips to make your job more rewarding for you and your boss.
 
What you notice from the following list are items that the average employee will call "too much work".
The envious employee (the Hater) will ridicule you. They will call you a "brown-noser" and say you are kissing up to the boss.
 
But be sensible. It is best to show more gratitude and do more for the person who can get you more money right? Right.
 
So follow the list, make more money and start associating with some other go-getters who are earning more income. Refer back to the previous chapter.







Here is the list to help your bosses, help you make more money:
1. Get to know how your boss likes communication


- A quick phone call when you have questions?


- Email with details for documentation?


- Instant message or text messaging?


2. Find out how your boss likes to get the status of your work


- Constant updates as you work?


- Status update when work is completed?


3. Present problems quickly, but give alternative solutions


- Give your recommendation and let your boss make the decision


- Give at least two options for review, a good one and a better one


4. Be open to constructive criticism


- Think of your boss as your coach


- Your boss is financially motivated to help you get better


- Ask your boss if you delivered what he/she was looking for


- Take notes on their suggestions so you remember them later (this also shows you care about their opinion)









The points I am making here are so important.
Not many employees take the time to understand what their boss really wants. Most employees are so busy doing what they think is a "good job" that they never take time to see what makes their boss happy.
 
You may have a boss that is a stickler for punctuality. You could make them happy just by showing up early to work or meetings while everyone else is a minute or two late.
 
You may have a boss that is "visual." No matter how much you explain something, you will never get your point across without visual aids: a chart, graphs, outlined pros and cons, etc.
 
Some bosses just want the high-level explanation, with access to how you came to your conclusion. This is usually the busy executive that just wants a one-page summary.
For them, you will have to get good at consolidating all of your data into a neat conclusion—and have the detailed data organized in case they want to check your work.
The point is, get to know your boss to understand how they operate as a person; their likes and dislikes in the workplace. Help them help you by observing them and asking what their preferences are. They will in turn give you guidance on how to help them.
Now that you know what to do, do more and get paid more!

7. Be Nice—To Everyone
Yes, Mama always said, "If you do not have anything nice to say, do not say anything at all."
This wise advice was given by loving mothers worldwide who knew the great power of spoken words.
Some of the simplest comments can have a great impact to a person. The impact can be good or bad depending on the words that are spoken.
 
Rule #1: Be Nice
The most important thing to remember is—no matter what—you really cannot take back what you say. You can say something to someone that is not very nice, and apologize later, but the sting will remain.
That sting will be remembered more than your apology or any explanation that you try to give for speaking such unkind words. The feelings are what are impacted by your words. You are remembered by how the person feels about you.
 
People do not always remember what you say... they remember how you made them FEEL
The funny thing is, nowadays, many people have become so rude that when you actually apply the points in this chapter, you will be viewed highly as a professional. You will not be viewed in the same light as your not-so-polite, self-entitled competition.
 
It is especially important to be nice in the workplace.
I mentioned earlier that people want to do business with people they know, like and trust. People will like you based on how they feel about you. They will base their feelings on what you say to them.
Now, this does not mean that you go around saying superficially nice things to people just to get them to like you. You will only come across as being phony and people will get the impression that you have some ulterior motive.
 
Be nice in your communications.
Emails and text messages have become the normal way of communication in our personal lives as well as professional lives. We must keep in mind that the perception of your message is what matters most, since your voice is not there to present it.
With that, let me give you some phrases that my colleagues and I have proven to be most effective in getting results, even while being nice.

In making requests: "If you don't mind ..."
When delegating tasks: "Would you please ..."
While following up with action items: "Hi, I'm just checking in on ..."
When soliciting cooperation: "It would be great if ..."

It is best when your emails and text messages are preceded by a salutation and the person's name (Good Morning, Denise) and end with a "Thank you." It is something magical for a person to hear or see their name. It makes us feel important. There is also something magical about the words "Thank you." It makes us feel appreciated.
 
Remember the magic words
Trust me, this will go a long way these days. Simply by remembering the "magic words" that many of us were taught as children will make others feel pretty good.
You remember the magic words, right?
"Please" and "Thank You."
I have noticed that, especially in the workplace, the use of these words has become uncommon. I use them all the time, and to many it comes as some sort of surprise. I have even had a couple people tell me, "Oh, you do not have to thank me, this is my job." My reply is usually something like, "I am saying thank you because I appreciate your assistance."
I cannot tell you how many times I get such great feedback, recommendations, perks, favors offered, job offers, opportunities for advancement, etc.—mainly because people remembered how I made them feel important or appreciated.
This is viewed as professionalism and leadership in the workplace, because the more people feel appreciated by the things you say to them, the more they want to be around you.
The more they are around you and feel appreciated, the more they will respect you.
The more they respect you, the more they will follow your suggestions and recommendations.
The more they follow you, the more you are viewed as a leader.
Sure, it is a small gesture and may not seem like a big deal. But leaders are rewarded with promotions, bonuses and increase in pay.
Rule #2: Be Nice to EVERYONE
Let me tell you a story ...
This woman worked in an office with many other professionals in her field. They worked as a team and were managed by a not-so-nice supervisor. This supervisor would badger his employees, take credit for their work and was quick to blame them when results were not up to par.
He made unrealistic demands and did not manage the team well at all. Needless to say, employee turnover was beginning to rise and the professionals that had not quit were stressed and could not stand going to work, all because of him.
Later, the supervisor was demoted, and the two employees he plagued the most were promoted—one to team lead, over the team that he was now a part of; and the other got his job as the new supervisor.
I will let you use your imagination to play out how karma played its role, as this old supervisor had to report directly to his former employees.







Let me tell you another story ...
I played a game of real life monopoly while living in Indiana. I invested in real estate, buying several rental properties.
By the time I purchased my third property, I decided to hire help for repairs and maintenance.
Many times, I would have contractors come out to see me while I was doing work on the property myself. Now, I must admit that I look very young for my age, and it also was very common for "people of color" to be tenants and not owners in the area where my houses and buildings were.
So here I was, this young man, not so well-dressed, mowing the lawn or doing repairs, when the contractors showed up.
The first contractor walked right past me and entered my vacant property without so much as a "hello." Well, he did yell out "hello" as he walked into my empty house looking for the owner.
On his way back out, he mumbled something to his partner about being stood up. Then, he handed me his card and told me to tell my boss to call him when he was serious! Wow!
 
The second contractor showed up at another one of my properties and spoke to me for a little while. He greeted me as soon as he arrived and started asking me questions about the neighborhood and how I liked the area.
He asked about how much the rent was and what kind of repairs I thought the property needed. I noticed he kept looking at his watch, so then I asked him if he was there to bid. He said yes, but was waiting on the owner.
He actually chuckled and said he almost mistook me for the landlord until he got out of his truck and got a good look at me. He smiled and said, "I bet you would like to buy a house like this one day. Well, you keep working hard and maybe one day you will." I smiled back and said, "Yeah, maybe two or three of them!"
The third contractor came to me directly with hand extended for a handshake, introduced himself and said, "Hi, I'm from Lightfoot Construction. I am looking for Mr. Coleman."
After the first two contractors, this gentleman had my attention, and he continued to keep my attention as his excellence in attitude matched his excellence in work ethic.
I did business with Lightfoot for six years after that greeting. He was the first one I called on as I purchased property after property.
He was one of three main companies in Northwest Indiana that gained repeat business and referrals from me and other investors, mainly because he knew how to be nice.
Being nice earned them millions of dollars in a six-year period. You can put a price on being nice!

8. Be Prepared
"Be Prepared" has long been the motto of the Boy Scouts of America.
This is not by coincidence.
As a scoutmaster leading boys on many camping trips, we had to be prepared for several days in the wilderness, a change of weather or a host of opportunities to perform first aid, due to locations that may be away from civilization.
On your job, in order to be the one that your boss admires, you too must be prepared for a host of opportunities that may come your way.
Imagine if you are the one who can constantly raise your hand when management asks, "Is there anyone that is familiar with...?"








Project Mgmt.
Six Sigma
Change Mgmt.
SCRUM
Excel formulas
Business Cases
SQL statements
MS SharePoint
Process Maps
Business Objects
Outlook setup
This new ...








I just named a few items that are very common in Corporate America today. Depending on when you are reading this book, some of these may become obsolete, but the principle remains.
The principle is to be prepared.
Pay attention to what needs are not being fulfilled. Listen to what people are complaining about, or what they wish they had. Then, find the solution and get prepared to solve the problem before they even ask you.
Become the Expert
 
We live in an information age. You can become knowledgeable on almost any subject with your own research or by enrolling in a short course. Not everything requires going back to school and earning a degree.
Many of the items that I previously listed can be self-taught via research or tutorials that come with the common office programs. The other professional designations, such as Project Management or Six Sigma, require more time and money to invest, but the return on your investment can be well worth it.
 
With so many of your co-workers whining and complaining about their jobs and resisting change, just learning a couple of new things a month automatically makes you a more attractive employee for promotion.
Additionally, there are hundreds of thousands of process improvement projects across the world that are in need of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). You be the one to gain the knowledge, become a member of that project team as a SME (along with your regular job) and add to your experience.
Trust me, as such a valuable employee, managers will be fighting over you and enticing you with pay raises, perks and bonuses to come and join their team. Senior managers will offer you promotions to make sure you stay with the company.







How an accountant became a Project Manager
 
Let me tell you a story ...
My background is Accounting and Finance. But I didn't start that way and didn't end that way.

While in grade school, my dream was to be an aerospace engineer and work with NASA.
In my last year of high school, I was accepted to a major college with a double major in Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering.
Opting to skip college for a few years for financial reasons, I later went and earn a Bachelor of Science in Accounting.

Yes. I was a Technical Accountant.
From there, I got my first two major jobs: first at an insurance company, then a bank.
In my last trimester of college, my professor hired me to work in a major insurance company as an entry-level accountant. This grew to a lead position in a very short period of time.
Two years later, I found myself in the banking industry as a member of a special internal audit team. Within four years, two layoffs and one merger later, I did work in hedge funding, business continuity, disaster recovery planning, financial reporting and analysis, process improvements, employee training, meeting facilitation and business analysis.
Finally, managing project teams in two countries and three cities!
 
How did I do it?
I went into Corporate America literally right out of college (actually, during college) and continued learning everything I could, on my own.
I made friends with people who were smart and loved their job.
While working in insurance, I learned all I could about the insurance industry:

Claims adjustments,
Premium audits,
Third party administrators,
Actuarial analysis,
Etc.

I had never even heard of any of this "insurance stuff" until I worked at this insurance company. But I showed an interest and so I was invited to meetings and projects constantly.
... And was promoted three times in two years!
While working in banking, I learned all I could about the corporate industry and structure, not just banking. On my own, I learned how many departments operated and corporate business strategies:

Shared Services
Accounts Payable
Payroll
Risk Management
Lines of Business Structures (Business Units)

Then, after working on many projects, my eyes were opened to the world of project management—first as a subject matter expert, because I continued to learn and contribute; then, as a business analyst, because of my perceived organizational skills.
I say "perceived" organizational skills because this is what others saw in me during my everyday work life. The bosses are always watching, so show off!
Later, I took courses in Project Management and continued learning technical systems used in Finance.
Once the merger took place, there were a ton of projects and managers were needed.
 
I was prepared to be the leader!

9. BE the Leader
They say that it's lonely at the top. One thing's for sure: There is plenty of room up here. It is the bottom that is overcrowded.
One of the greatest commodities in any business is that of leadership. Every organization, in order to succeed, needs a leader.
Let me start by saying this: The best way to become a great leader and make yourself more attractive is to think of the big picture. Think beyond your job and your paycheck and think of everyone's job, opportunities to do more and earn more.
People will gladly follow you when you have a big vision that involves everyone winning.







So how do you be the leader?
It is actually quite simple—not easy, but simple.

Actively listen to the pains of others. Actively listening means being attentive to their needs. Take notes on what others are saying. Repeat what they said in an understanding fashion, letting them know that you care.

 

Ask questions to find out what they want. In my world, we call this "Requirements Gathering." After understanding what the pain is, a leader finds out exactly what is needed, with no guesswork or assumptions. Again, repeat what others say in an understanding fashion, letting them know that you care.

 

Gather solutions. Now that you know what they want and do not want, get to work to find solutions to solve the problem. The key is not to solve the problem just yet—simply find multiple solutions.

 

Lead them through to the resolution. The key here is that you do not need to know how to do all the work, which is for the team to do. Remember, team effort. You just have to know what needs to be done to solve the problem based on the option that is selected.

Here are some key points on gathering information:

Gather relevant information to present ideas to solve the problem. You want to lead the resolution, not do all the work. There are two reasons for this. First, if you do all the work, you take away the opportunity to make it a team effort. If there is no team, there is no need for a leader. Second, the leader is the one with vision. The leader brings the ideas, motivates the team and drives results through the combined efforts of others.

 

Come back with two or three options with pros and cons vetted. There are two reasons for this as well. First, you want to make sure you have more than one idea in case the first idea is not a winner. Second, it shows that you took time to research, because their problem was important enough to have more than one solution.

 

Let them choose between the options. People like to have options and feel like they are making a decision; especially your boss. Present two or more good options and the team will decide and feel they are included. Your bosses will feel like they are making a good decision based on the information provided, as opposed to just accepting your one and only idea.

When you follow these four simple steps over and over, you will get noticed. You will start to be known as the one that has a positive attitude because while everyone else is complaining, you are listening and finding solutions.
This does not take a lot of time. There can be many quick solutions to many small problems that get you noticed quickly. Solving the bigger problems will simply make you more valuable.
Remember I mentioned in the earlier chapter, "Let people know, like and trust you"? Well, people like to know the problem-solvers. They will also like you because you take the time to actively listen, while most people just listen for their turn to talk. Plus, when you present multiple options to solve their problem, they will trust you more because you do not come across as a know-it-all, but more as a person with great ideas to solve problems, and you get everyone involved.
Trust me. Before you know it, people will be following you, simply because you are the one listening to the problems and saying, "Follow me, I know what we can do to solve it." You are showing leadership.
BE the leader and in a short amount of time you will be promoted to officially be the leader!

10. Do It NOW

There is no time like the present.
Just do it!
Why put off until tomorrow something that you can do today?
Good things come to those who wait, but it is only the leftovers of those who hustle.
Sometimes later becomes never.
"As soon as I get around to it" is not a deadline.

This list could go on and on.
I am sure you have heard it all before, right?
But really, it is very important to remember that people who take action are the ones that are usually remembered and rewarded the best. This is especially true in the world of business and especially if you are an employee.
I mentioned in the previous chapter how leadership is one of the greatest commodities that employers are seeking. They need leaders to keep the business going. New leaders need to find replacements so they can move up as well.







Do it now because it is important
Learn the "do it now" attitude to become known as a person of action. One of the first things that your bosses notice are people of action. These are the people who respond rather quickly as issues arise. Most of the time, they take action without even being asked.


- When you get that email asking a question, respond immediately with an answer—even if the answer is, "That's a very good question, let me get back to you in an hour."


- When you get that voice mail, call back and let them know you got their call.


- When you are given an assignment, start on it right away. Then let them know that you started on it and give them an estimated time of completion.


Your boss, just like any other person, will appreciate your immediate action. It is the kind of thing that makes a person feel important.
Your boss actually needs you now. They are considerate with deadlines, but really, if they wanted you later they would ask you later. It sounds simple, but most people do not think of it this way. Most employees ask, "... When do you need this...?" and the boss responds with a deadline.
But if you deliver faster than the deadline, 99 percent of the time the boss is delighted, right?
Right.
Now, of course, you want to take correct action as much as possible, as I mentioned in step 3 in the previous chapter. However, action is sometimes commended, with feedback, even if you do not respond correctly.
Action from the brave is better than inaction from the timid.
Do it now to get rid of the excuses
Your co-workers are the ones who complain about having so much work to do, unrealistic deadlines and other excuses why they cannot get assignments completed on time.
But not you
You will receive assignments with gratitude and take action immediately.
By taking immediate action, you will not have time to come up with excuses. You are too busy taking action to think about the deadline or having enough time.
You are in action. You are doing it now.

Last Story...
Several years ago, on a hot summer afternoon, a group of rail workers were working on the railroad. They were interrupted by a slow moving train as it come to a stop in front of them.
The window in the last car was raised. A booming, friendly voice called out, " Dave, is that you?"
Dave Anderson, the crew chief called back, "Sure is, Jim, and it's really good to see you."
Dave Anderson was invited to join Jim Murphy, the president of the railroad, for a visit. The two men talked for over an hour then shook hands warmly as the train pulled out.
Dave Anderson's crew immediately ran over to him in astonishment that he knew Jim Murphy, the president of the railroad as a personal friend!
Dave then explained that 20 years earlier he and Jim Murphy had started to work for the railroad on the same day. One of the men asked Dave why he was still working out in the hot sun and Jim Murphy had gotten to be president.
Wistfully, Dave explained, "twenty- three years ago I went to work for $1.75 an hour and Jim Murphy went to work for the railroad."
