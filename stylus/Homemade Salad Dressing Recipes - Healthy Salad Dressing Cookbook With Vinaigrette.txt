INTRODUCTION

Salad dressings are that sauce, liquid or semi liquid used to blend and add flavor to salads. Dressings are that sauce that kicks life into our salad, without good quality salad dressing eating salad will be like chewing on grass. Salad dressings are the best way to bring life and spur up your salad to make them taste nicer and more enjoyable. It is very easy to make your own salad dressing at home, better than some of these store brought dressing, free from artificial sweetener and preservatives. This book will teach you how to be a master in making your own salad dressing just the way you like it.




You don't need a special skill to make your own salad dressing, with the right amount of all the required ingredients, you can make tasty and delicious dressing in no time. You can even be creative making your own dressing, play a little with some of the ingredients, a little of herb can help med flavors without ruining your dressing.
When you make your own dressing, it helps to save time, money and energy. Once you can get the quantity of the total ingredients needed, you can whip up one of the earth's best dressing in less than 5 minutes, you will have that magical, creamy and tasty salad dressing you have always wanted.

BASIC TIPS ON HOW TO MAKE SALAD DRESSING
Be Ready To Make Your Own Dressing
If you want to eat healthy, my advice is to go homemade. This is where you can control the amount of each ingredient you use and mend flavors to suit your dietary lifestyle. Many store brought salad dressing with big names often contain preservatives, artificial sweeteners or processed ingredients which are not totally necessary if you are making your own dressing. More so, the advantage of making your own dressing is you can make it taste just the way you want. It can be sour, spicy, salty, sweet, thick or thinner.




Always Bear In Mind The Oil Versus Vinegar Ratio
The general rule for vinaigrette is ratio 1:3, vinegar to olive oil. Too much difference in this ration can render your dressing tasteless. Too much vinegar will make the dressing come out too sour and too much oil will make it come out too heavy, so always remember to stitch to the ratio.1:2 also works if you want a slimmer dressing.
Whisk In A Bowl
It's just as east as it sounds, add all the dressing ingredients to a bowl and whisk until well incorporated. That's all that it takes, sometimes you need to hold back on the oil and whisk in a steady stream to help emulsify.

--------

Use Mason Jars
Mason jars are perfect for making homemade dressing seamlessly; they are similarly to the salad dressing shakers. They do not stick onto the jar, just add everything attach the lid and shake well.




Use Seasonings
In addition to using oil and vinegar for your dressing, you can spice things up by adding seasonings.  A blend of Italian herbs, teaspoon of ginger or adding salt and pepper can bring life and flavor into your dressings without shortage on the nutrition.
Taste As You Go
The best way to make a fine dressing is by tasting as you add each ingredient. If you don't want to ruin your salad after you have already toss everything together, then realize that it's too tangy, oily, salty or vinegary.  You could even over add some ingredients without know until you have finish mixing everything together; give your dressing a good taste.  The best way to do this is to take a piece of cabbage, dip into your dressing to get the feeling.
