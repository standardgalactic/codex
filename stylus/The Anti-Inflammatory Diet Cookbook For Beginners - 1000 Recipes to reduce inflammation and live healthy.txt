These are very easy to prepare and contain ingredients that may be already available in your cupboard. Most of all, they are delicious and perfect for all seasons.Let's get started! 









What are Inflammation and its causes?
Inflammation occurs when the body releases white blood cells to protect your body from unknown substances like foreign body contamination. It is specifically released to the injured or infected part of the body. Part of the body becomes red and swollen because the release of chemicals affects the blood flow. 
There are good and bad aspects of inflammation. Yes, you read it right. Not all inflammation is bad. There are two types of inflammation, and that is acute and chronic inflammation. 
Acute inflammation occurs when you have a sprain or sore throat. In this kind of inflammation, you are assured that the body is repairing itself, and the inflammation will go away when your body is repaired. It seems that inflammation is good for the body; however, there are times that the defense mechanism seems to crash. When it crashes, the inflammatory response is set in motion even if there is no foreign body contamination. It is what happens when you have arthritis. Chronic inflammation is a different story. It takes several days and stays for a long time, leading to inflammatory diseases. 
When the body has inflammation, it reacts to an injury it sends cells to fight the invading foreign objects. The immune system is being damaged and harmed. Instead of protecting the body, it causes harm and problems in the body. 
Several factors cause inflammation, and one of the primary causes is being linked to poor lifestyle choices. 

Poor diet - Are you fond of eating sugary foods? Is eating in fast-food chains one of your favorites? Eating unhealthy foods can trigger inflammation together with fat and increased blood sugar. A poor diet can result in higher weight or weight gain. It is known that having a higher body fat can result in several diseases that we don't want to have. It is essential to eat healthy so we can decrease our body fat. When we improve our diet, we make it better by reducing the body's inflammatory response. This makes our bodies more efficient in managing potential complications of weight gain. 
Aging - IIt is still controversial how aging affects inflammation, but the progressive degenerative process is tightly integrated with inflammation, according to science. As our bodies age, several body cells are starting to die. They cannot regenerate themselves. So when cells die, it becomes waste material or foreign substance in our body that can trigger inflammation.
Lack of physical activity - Lack of physical activity can result in obesity and overweight. There is a link between your lifestyle and your weight. Your unhealthy lifestyle can cause changes to your physiological response to inflammatory factors. Obesity, for instance, results in low-grade chronic inflammation. 



Poor sleep -  Having a good night's sleep is an excellent way to start our day, but what if we are sleep-deprived over a long time? Sleep deprivation can cause physical changes in our brain and body, leading to arthritis, periodontitis, and cancer. It can contribute to chronic diseases and mental health issues. Study shows that having less than 7-8 hours of sleep increases inflammation. It has also been linked to having chronic diseases like heart problems, diabetes, and hypertension.



Stress - Emotional, physical, or psychological stress is not suitable for you! All of that can raise cortisol in your body. Cortisol is a hormone that is produced by the adrenal glands. A higher level of cortisol can create inflammation. Studies found that chronic stress affects the body by altering immune cells activity. When you reduce stress, you live healthier. 



Smoking - We all know that smoking is not good for the body. Smoking affects and triggers an immunologic response to vascular injury that is known to be linked with increased levels of inflammatory markers. Inflammatory markers are white blood cells and c-reactive protein. 


There are a lot of factors affecting our body and their link to having inflammation. Thus, we must make to the things that we can control, like turning to healthier options, changing our lifestyles, and reducing our stress.

Now that you have an idea of how chronic inflammation can harm your body, you are more interested in the recipes that can help you achieve sustainable living.









Anti-inflammatory Diet?
A diet that is focused on anti-inflammatory principles is very helpful and is highly recommended. There is a study that having this diet can protect you from diseases and slow aging by maintaining your blood sugar and increasing metabolism. Optimize your health with an anti-inflammatory diet. You should incorporate the anti-inflammatory principles:
1.Fiber-rich foods - Reduce inflammation by eating foods rich in fiber like fruits and vegetables. You can also get it from whole grains like oatmeal and barley. 
2.Eight servings of fruits and vegetables every day - Increase your garlic, onions, leek, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower.
3.Stay away from saturated fats - Limit your red meat intake and use herbs and spices when you marinate meats to reduce the toxins formed when cooking.
4.Avoid processed foods and refined sugar - Artificial sweeteners and foods high in sodium are bad for your health and can trigger inflammation throughout the body. It can also cause other diseases like high blood pressure and increased insulin resistance.
5.Avoid trans fats - Saturated fats are no good but so are trans-fat. You need to avoid these kinds of fats because the higher the trans-fat in the body, the higher the c-reactive protein that is a marker for inflammation.
6.Omega 3 fatty acids - Consume foods that are rich in omegas-3 fatty acids like nuts, flax seeds, and beans. You can also take an omega-3 supplement, but make sure that it is the best quality.
7.Use oils with health fats - Organic oils such as virgin and extra virgin olive oil are good choices. You can also use sunflower oil and canola. It has the best anti-inflammatory benefits. 
Inflammation plays a part in so many diseases and has proven its association with the immune system. We may not understand how it works, but it is evident by what you eat. Poor diet adds to its causes. Be empowered and limit the amount of inflammation in your body.This cookbook is for people who already have inflammation or auto-immune disorders and for people who want to promote their overall well-being..
