Preface








Are you using warehouses now? What kind? How much does it cost? What functions do the warehouses perform? Are you using private, public, or contract warehousing? Maybe you shouldn't be using a warehouse at all. Perhaps it's time to let someone elsea third partydo some or all of that work. If outsourcing appears to be an option, do you know how to select a good warehousea logistics provider?








Technology is revolutionizing the generation, transmission, and use of order fulfillment and shipping information. Integrated warehouse management systems support logistics decisions throughout the supply chain, thereby improving customer service, reducing response time, and lowering inventory levels and costs. Emerging distribution concepts are beginning to affect storage, materials handling, and shipping methods. Experts are predicting a "paperless" and near "peopleless" warehouse in the not-too-distant future even the very need for warehousing is on the table.








While the basic concepts, principles, and objectives of adding value, increasing customer service performance, raising quality, and heightening cost-effectiveness will remain essentially the same, the new tools of the trade technology and information managementwill offer greater opportunities to improve business efficiency. The logistics industry is predicted to be a $200 billion business by the year 2000. Warehousing may represent between one third and one half of this amount.








There are many good texts on warehousing that deal with layout, construction, types, advantages and disadvantages, use, and operation of fixtures and materials-handling equipment; automation, inventory management, information systems, methods and procedures, personnel issues, labor, cost, and productivity measure-

ment. Most are cited in the Suggested Readings and Sources section of this book as worthy of further study. Instead, this text attempts to ask some basic questions about warehousing and shipping and present a framework for decision making. It discusses practical operating requirements as well as provides tips, do's and don'ts, background information, and examples. You are encouraged to stay up to date on industry developments through your own research, trade literature, attendance at seminars, and exchange and networking with your colleagues. It is hoped that the ideas and information presented in this text will help both companies that are looking for enhanced warehouse services and warehouse operators hoping to expand their services.

Inventories: Their Importance to Business Today








The purpose of business is to produce goods and provide services. Every business uses a variety of hard resourcescommonly defined as land, labor, and capitalcombined with soft resourcesthat is, knowledge. In the process, business incurs costs and generates revenue. In short, the objective of business is to optimize available resources, minimize costs, and maximize profit.








Manufacturing and trading enterprisesunlike service businesses convert resources into physical goods. They must have sufficient quantities of goods available and ready for use, consumption, and sale. Therefore, they must maintain physical inventory.








As they are produced or acquired in exchange for money, these goods have absorbed costs. Therefore, it can be said that inventory is physical resources converted into money. And until inventory is turned into sales, it is money at rest. Money at rest costs money.








To mobilize this tied-up money, business strives to carry as little inventory as necessary to serve customers effectively, keep inventory as close as possible to where it is needed, and move inventory as fast as possible.








Achieving these objectives is the mission of managers applying such concepts as quick response (QR), efficient consumer response (ECR), and continuous replenishment planning (CRP).








IS THIS YOUR MISSION?





 












Page 2




Inventory Is Money and Costs Money








There are three ways that inventory represents money being spent:








1. Inventory is money tied up in assets. Producers employ a variety of resourcescapital, materials, labor, knowledgeand convert them into an asset called stock, or inventory.








2. Inventory costs money to carry until it is used or sold. This cost is defined as carrying cost, which is the sum of all associated costs until goods are sold. A significant part of this is interest, the time value of money. Interest cost is based on inventory valuationfor example, first-in, first-out (FIFO), last-in, first-out (LIFO)and is calculated for the time period the inventory remains unsold.








3. Inventory generates expenses. These involve the costs of handling inventory into and out of storage and the cost of storage, which includes the costs for facilities and buildingsrent, depreciation, utilities, insurance, security, and related cost elements.








Tip: Carefully assess the inventory cost item of shrinkage, loss and damage, mysterious disappearance, theft, pilferage, and obsolescence.








An integrated warehouse management system (WMS) will help businesses achieve optimal use of space, time-efficient storage and retrieval, near-perfect inventory accuracy, improved response time, and a significant reduction in carrying cost. For instance, if you reduce the storage time of a $1 million inventory by just one day, you can reduce the carrying cost for interest aloneat a rate of 12% per yearby $329.








Exhibit 1-1 gives another example of carrying costs that include storage cost, obsolescence, and shrinkage. This example can be expanded by adding the transit time to destination for individual shipments that, especially in the case of long-distance transportation, will result in additional time cost.








DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE INVENTORY CARRYING COST IS FOR YOUR BUSINESS?





 












Page 3





Exhibit 1-1. Inventory value and carrying cost.



Inventory value at the end of o period is the sum (S) of product value (P) plus the interest (I) for the storage period (t) plus the storage cost (W), adjusted for loss and damage, shrinkage, and obsolescence (D).













Inventory Is Everywhere








Sand and road salt in silos; building materials in lumber yards; petroleum, oil, and gas in tanks at refineries, bulk terminals, and gas stations; grain in elevators; cars in new and used car lotsall are inventory. Also considered inventory are goods of all descriptions in public and private warehouses and distribution centers; those in supermarkets and department stores; and goods in-transit in trucks, railcars, containers, barges, and ocean vessels.








You keep inventory as fuel in the gas tank of your car, office





 












Page 4




supplies in the supply cabinet, food in the refrigerator, tools in your workshop, and money in your wallet. Wherever your inventory may be, you try to keep not too much, not too littlejust the fight amount for what you need at any given timeand you rely on the prompt availability of more when you need it.








Companies keep inventories to provide a continuous supply of raw materials and semifinished goods, equipment, parts, tools, and supplies to allow the uninterrupted manufacturing activities that yield benefits from long production runs. These companies work to ensure prompt availability of goods for sale to customers from plants, distribution centers, regional or local branch offices, customer service and store locations, as well as to respond to projected needs and emergencies.








Types of Inventory








Raw materials must be readily available when manufacturing has been scheduled; they are most likely to be stored at or near manufacturing and producing locations in private warehouses.








Supplies aid and assist in production. They are used inand/or used upduring production processes, after which some supplies are recovered or recycled; others are discarded. Like raw materials, most supplies are kept very near the point of usefor example, in company stockrooms.








In-process and semifinished goods are materials subject to further processing, conversion, and finishing; they are not yet ready to be sold. They are generally kept in private warehouses, but can also be stored in off-site locations, especially when they are to be transferred from one company plant or location to another.








Packaging materials are materials and supplies necessary to make goods ready for handling, temporary storage, transportation, and sale. Typically, they are held in manufacturing, as well as on-site warehouse locations.








Finished goods are ready-to-sell packaged merchandise, goods, and materials. They are prime candidates for off-site storage at company or public warehouses.








Replacement and spare parts are needed to maintain and repair a company's own machinery and equipment, and provide repair service and replacement parts for goods sold to customers.





 












Page 5




The level and variety of parts inventories are very hard to forecast. While unforeseen events such as breakdowns and accidents introduce a degree of uncertainty, companies know when equipment wears out, and operate preventive maintenance programs. For instance, auto and appliance manufacturers have studied which parts need periodic replacement or are damaged most frequently, developing sophisticated replenishment formulas.








Stockrooms








Traditionally, a distinction has been made between a stockroom and a pure warehouse. Stockrooms are located near production or sales facilities to keep small amounts of goods and supplies handy. They are just large enough to keep a very limited amount of goods to refill for instance, supermarket and department store shelves; industrial supply and consumer hardware stores; parts cages in machine, auto, truck, and other repair shops; tool cages in production and assembly plants; medical and surgical supplies in hospitals; paper and ink in printing shops, and so on.








When a stock reaches a certain depletion levelout-of-stock, stock-out, minimum reorder pointmore goods are ordered to restock, usually from a supplier's warehouse.








Note: Stockrooms are typical examples of replacement and spare parts inventories, and one of the targets of consumer-direct distribution.








WHAT TYPES OF INVENTORIES DOES YOUR COMPANY KEEP?








Consumer-Direct Distribution








In the mid-1980s, a paradigm shift* took place: The application of knowledgethat is, increasingly better informationto marketing and distribution techniques changed the logistics of inventory fundamentally.








* A "paradigm shift" can be defined as a fundamental change in the way things are done.





 












Page 6




Quality techniques began to take hold. Products became better, consequently consumer quality expectations rose substantially.








Consumer buying attitudes became more demanding.








Diminishing profit margins began to drive down inventories at manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and retailers.








Transportation deregulation spawned new logistics ventures.








Information technology advanced by leaps and bounds.








Information management was substituted for physical inventory.








Response times were reduced because consumers wanted their goods immediately.








Responding to this paradigm shift and attempting to meet these more demanding buyer attitudes, producers and providers of goods began to take money out of the supply chain. Their goal was to drastically reduce and ultimately eliminate even very small inventories by getting the goods directly to the consumer. One result was that the role of the wholesaler/distributor began to change dramatically. This new strategy was called consumer-direct distribution.








Early attempts at consumer-direct marketing and distribution were the Fuller Brush salesman, Tupperware parties, Sears, Roebuck & Company's wishbook, and a large variety of early mail-order houses. More recent examples include Amway, which sells a near-inclusive product line through its unique marketing technique in countries all over the world; Wal-Mart's revolution in food distribution and merchandising; and The Home Depot, Staples, computer warehouses, and a growing number of wholesale buying clubs. We have all become acquainted with home shopping networks. In the near future, we will be able to buy just about anything through interactive TV and computer video services.








The benefits of consumer-direct distribution are as follows:








Availability of a broad range of goods in one place








Wide brand selection








Fewer supplier inventory locations








Reduced overall inventory levels and associated cost








Better customer service through self-service stores








Increased revenue to the supplier and lower cost to the consumer





 












Page 7




Transportation Costs








The impact that customer-direct distribution has had on transportation costs is not clear-cut. On the one hand, more frequent and smaller shipments to more customer-direct destinations increases the transportation cost on a per-unit-shipped basis. On the other hand, load planning and consolidation techniques, as well as advances in information technology, tend to reduce transportation costs.








Inventory management policies have always recognized the monetary value of inventories and available trade-offs. For instance, you can achieve lower per-unit prices when buying greater quantities, lower per-unit manufacturing costs through longer production runs, and lower per-unit shipping costs by shipping in larger quantities. In each case, these lower costs generate and may offset some or all of the higher cost of storing more inventory.








Today's managers use the extensive amount of immediately available and detailed information to calculate best-cost solutions. Evolving trends appear to show that even though transportation costs increase, less inventoryat lower carrying costheld in fewer locations and handled by fewer intermediaries such as brokers, wholesalers, and distributors (often called the ''middle channel participants") can reduce the total cost of the supply chain.








Time will tell how robust this new system is under adverse conditions, and how the fundamental operational changes will hold up when raw material, labor, and facility shortages occur, and suddenly scarce resources must be allocated.

Warehouses, Leasing, and Storage Costs








As discussed in Chapter 1, every member of the supply chain seeks to minimize its inventory by bringing the producer closer to the consumer. While this is readily achieved for general merchandise, food, and groceries, there remain circumstances in which a specialized facility is needed, and a special service is required, which may not be available in a desired location. Depositors, therefore, must make a series of decisions as to which warehouse and which mode of operation best meets a company's marketing objectives, operating and administrative competencies, and its understanding of, and willingness to accept, defined levels of risks and costs. Types of warehouses include the following:








General merchandise warehouses are used to hold just about any type of goods.








Food warehouses are built and maintained to stringent cleanliness specifications.








Bonded warehouses are for handling valuable and taxable goods.








Customs warehouses, often located in foreign trade zones, (FTZs) are for dutiable goods.








Temperature-controlled warehouses handle perishable and temperature-sensitive goods.








Hazardous-materials warehouses are for storing regulated products or commodities.








Liquid and dry-bulk storage terminals and transfer facilities include tanks, silos, and elevators, as well as rail tank or hopper car-to-tank or hopper truck transfer; intermodal container





 












Page 9




storage and transfer, loading and unloading, break-bulk and consolidation facilities.








Each type of warehouse or storage facility can be operated as a private, public, contract, or leased facility.








Private Warehousing








A large portion of inventory is held in private warehouses. These warehouses represent a substantial corporate fixed investment in land, building, and equipment. Their operation generates labor, operating and administrative expenses, and obligations and liabilities.








Private warehouses can be on-site, either at a central location or dispersed throughout the manufacturing facilities. They store purchased raw materials, work in process, semifinished as well as resale goods, and materials and supplies to package finished goods for sale and shipment to customers. Off-site warehouses are satellite facilities located close to marketing areas to store excess on-site inventory and to serve as distribution centers for finished goods. Sometimes these locations are also used to further process, assemble, kit, package, and consolidate goods for shipment. Off-site locations are commonly used to hold replacement and spare parts and provide repair service.








The seven main considerations in owning and/or operating a private warehouse are:








1. Responsiveness. Many companies believe that private facilities offer more operating freedom in responding to customer demands and can meet internal storage requirements for raw materials, supplies, and work in process. Few companies, however, use on-site warehousing space efficiently. You've probably heard this: "It's there; you've got to pay for it; and it can't be used for anything else anyway." Because of business fluctuations, shortages or excess space are common results.








2. Availability and cost of capital. This raises the question: Should we invest limited capital resources in warehousing (nonpro-





 












Page 10




ductive) or in manufacturing (productive) facilities? Most companies prioritize capital investment requests based on return on asset (ROA), return on investment (ROI), and/or return on capital (ROC). Warehouses must, but rarely do, meet these stringent capital investment criteria and thus end up last on the priority list. Some managers, for example, will not approve requests for storage facilities at all, only for manufacturing facilities and equipment!








3. Management. Private warehouses should be managed with the same know-how as are public facilities. However, they are often controlled and run by sales, marketing, or manufacturing managers to achieve narrow, self-serving objectivesfor example, field or branch warehouses to service just their customers.








4. Warehouse labor competence and experience. Warehouse work requires a labor force trained in loading and unloading trucks, railcars, and containers; the safe and space-efficient operation of materials-handling equipment; and put-away, picking, packing, staging, and related jobs.
When and where union rules allow, warehousing activities are often assigned to production personnel: Joe will put this away when he is finished working on the machine and has nothing else to do. Be sure to ascertain the union status of your prospective third-party warehousing and/or logistics provider.








5. Control and visibility. Inventory control, optimum space utilization, maintenance of facilities and equipment, internal materials flow, handling routines, supervision, and associated cost control are tasks that more often than not are left too casually to production or marketing personnel. Successful integration of these functions into the organization is a full-time effort that must be carried out by materials-handling specialists.








6. Flexibility. Private on-site, as well as off-site, warehouses offer little, if any, inventory location flexibility.








7. Risks and liability. It is important to understand that in a private warehouse, all risks for damage and loss to facilities and inventory, as well as personal harm and injury, are borne by the company.








HOW WELL DO YOU CONTROL YOUR PRIVATE WAREHOUSING?





 












Page 11




Public Warehousing








Public warehousing offers users* these following five advantages:








1. Maximum inventory location flexibility. Depositors are not tied to a private facility in a fixed location for long periods of time; they can move in and out as needs indicate.








2. Short-term commitment. The commitment, or contract, covers receiving, storage, handling, shipping, and related services for a given time, usually on a monthly basis.








3. Professional operation. A trained and experienced staff relieves users of the burdensome operating, labor, safety, insurance, environmental, legal, and related responsibilities.








4. Predictable rates. These are charged on a per-unit occupancy and/or handling basis, as quoted or negotiated. Examples are dollars per square foot, per pallet, case, drum, or other stock keeping unit (SKU), only for the space and period of time used.








5. Fewer risks and liabilities. Public warehouse operators accept liability and risks in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code (UC; see Appendix A) and the Standard Terms and Conditions for Public and Contract Warehouse Operators.








Contract Warehousing








Contract warehousing is a variation on public warehousing, whereby users can do the following:








Enter long-term contracts for space and/or services.








Trade off inventory location flexibility for guaranteed space over the contract period and a known price that is usually lower than public warehousing rates.








Contract for either an entire building or for a defined, fixed portion of square-foot or cubic-foot space, sometimes with flexible options for additional, as well as allowances for unused, space.








Assume negotiated levels and types of risks.








* In public warehousing, users are called depositors.





 












Page 12




Leased Warehousing








Leasing all or part of warehouse structures and facilities affords users* the benefits of private warehousing while using someone else's (the lessor's) property. This alternative is chosen especially to accommodate fairly stable inventory levels. However, leasing is not feasible to accommodate inventories that are subject to wide swings as a result of seasonal demand, special sales promotions, opportunity purchases, or safety stock buildups in anticipation of shortages.








Lease commitments are typically long termat least a yearbut mostly for periods of five, ten, or more years. The lessor retains ownership of the real estate, with all its obligations and benefits. The lessee assumes part of, or all of, the responsibilities and pays for the corresponding expenses and costs that result from using the property, as defined in the lease. The major expense categories are:








Land/grounds








Depreciation when the facility is owned by the lessor or operator








Mortgage interest when the facility is financed by the operator








Rent or sublease when the owner rents or leases the facility








Roads, truck or trailer drop, holding and parking areas








Docks for rail and truck traffic








Taxes and permits








Insurance for building








Equipment, stationary pallet racks, stacking frames, shelves, belt and roller conveyors








Automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems, overhead cranes, bins








Automatic identification systems (AIS)








Communication, automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS)








Heating, cooling, air-conditioning, ventilating machinery








Handling equipment: lift trucks, tractors, carriers Tools, supplies








Maintenance of roads, grounds, facility, building, offices








Utilities: electricity, water, gas, fuel








* In a leasing contract the user (depositor) is called a lessee.





 












Page 13




Security, safety, and housekeeping








Personal property, liability, workers' compensation insurance








Wages, salaries, and benefits (including labor and supervision, administration and management)








Important! Before you commit to any lease, investigate the status of zoning, permits, facility access and egress, and, where it appears to pose potential problems, pertinent variances. You may even go as far as requesting disclosure of any pending legal action against your prospective lessor. These precautions may save you big legal bucks later on!








Types of Leases








Leases must be carefully negotiated and structured to reflect who is responsible for what, and to what extent. Generally, "gross" and "net" lease indicates which of the expense categories are the responsibility of landlord or tenant; the terms "flat rental'' or "adjustable" lease indicate the periodic, fixed, or variable amount to be paid by the tenant. For example:








Gross lease generally means that the tenant pays the fixed and variable cost of the facility, maintenance, building insurance, real estate taxes, utilities, security, and so on.








Net, net-net, and net-net-net lease means that the tenant is responsible for fewer and fewer fixed and variable expense categories. For example, in a net lease, the tenant is responsible for facility, building maintenance, building insurance, and real estate costs, whereas in a net-net-net lease the tenant only pays for facility and building maintenance costs.








Flat rental lease usually requires the payment of monthly rent, which remains unchanged for the duration of the rental period. The rental fee can include or exclude specified services, such as utilities, security, and maintenance.








Adjustable (graduated or graded) lease generally means that the tenant pays an agreed rental fee that, after an initial period at a fixed rental, can be escalated or de-escalated for successive lease periods,





 












Page 14




based on specific economic indicators such as the consumer price index (CPI).








Percentage lease generally means that the tenant pays an agreed minimum rental fee plus a percentage of the tenant's volume turnover, sales, or other specified activity.








Since lease descriptions and terms vary, the responsibilities of the parties must be carefully defined and clearly expressed in lease agreements or contracts. Whichever type of lease agreement you enter, the best advice is:








Always picture yourself in court!








Contracts are agreements between parties enforceable in courtexpressing in legal terms the objectives that the contracting parties intend to achieve. They should be designed, negotiated, and written with utmost care. Unfortunately, any shortcomings in the contractmisunderstood or poorly defined intent, omissions, oversights, imprecise languagebecome evident just when a solid document is needed most, namely during disputes. The form, format, and language of any contract must, therefore, always be developed and/or reviewed by legal experts.








Tip: Negotiating the lease agreement should follow a prescribed time and action schedule as shown in Exhibit 2-1.








Warehousing Costs








The differences among private, public, and contract warehousing become readily apparent when comparing the depositor's warehousing cost structurethat is, the type of expenses that may be incurred and assumed by each party, as shown in Exhibit 2-2.








Companies should review the design of their supply chain and related inventory policies and practices, then methodically match their requirements with available private, "pure" public, or contract warehousing alternatives. Corresponding cost structures must be

Logistics Services and Outsourcing Potentials








"If you always do what you always did, you will always get what you always got."Mark Twain








Users and providers of logistics services are meeting in a new environment, a business world where new concepts and practices of customer service and inventory management are supported by rapidly developing technology to reduce operating cost, inventory volume, and corresponding expenses. This chapter discusses some of these new concepts.








Expanded Services and New Providers








In an attempt to reduce costs, users of logistics services are radically changing the way they manage their supply chain. They have long known, for instance, that capital tied up in private warehousing could be more profitably applied to manufacturing and production. Moreover, after downsizing, many companies now recognize that they no longer possess the special expertise, resources, and administrative skills to operate logistics functions efficiently. Therefore, by transferring their essential logistics functions to specialists, companies can concentrate on their core business. Their costs are reduced because the companies often can employ logistics services on a variable-cost basisthat is, they can occupy warehousing space and/or hire transport carriers only as they are needed.








Concurrently, providers of those logistics serviceswarehouse





 












Page 18




operators, freight forwarders, common and contract carriers*mare competing to meet current and future needs. They have learned to act as extensions of their clients by offering professional logistics expertise, state-of-the-art services and technology, and a trained, specialized labor force.








Transportation deregulation has probably been the single most important factor in this unfolding development, the main force in the emergence of third-party logistics providers. These new services come in a variety of forms:








Warehouse operators are expanding their traditional warehousing functions of receiving, storing, order processing, and shipping by offering a growing list of value-added distribution services, including inventory management and control, order fulfillment, and pick and pack activities (see Exhibit 3-1).








Transportation carriers, especially trucking companies, which in many cases already provided some storage and warehousing services, are expanding this function.








Freight forwarders are capitalizing on their expertise in domestic and international business to combine with water, surface, and air carriers on the one hand, and storage and distribution facilities on the other, to offer a total logistics package.








Logistics companies are sprouting up left and right.








Caution! Providing third-party logistics is a new industry. To date, there have been as many successes as there have been failures. Poor definition of objectives and need, hasty selection of partners, and insufficient internal and external communications have been the overriding causes of failure.








Exhibit 3-1 illustrates how traditional single-service providers have, in stages and over a period of time, grown into true third-party providers.








* The Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 has eliminated the traditionaland familiarlegal distinction between common and contract carriers.








 For more information, see "Third Parties: Aiming at Profits," Distribution, April 1996, pp. 22-40.

HAVE YOUR WAREHOUSING NEEDS CHANGEDHOW? ARE YOU CURRENTLY OUTSOURCING?








Outsourcing Options








A number of corporate activities have long been outsourced to third parties: accounting to CPAs; annual financial reporting to public auditing firms; labor negotiations to negotiators and arbitrators; legal services to law firms; safety, OSHA, and environmental matters to consulting firms; plant and equipment maintenance to maintenance contractors; freight-bill audit and payment to outside auditors and banks; export forwarding and import clearance to brokers and freight forwarders; consolidation and distribution to consolidators and warehouses; transportation and associated services to contract carriersin fact, traditional warehousing and transportation in themselves are outsourced functions!








Outsourcing is a paradigm shiftit changes the way we work. Not every business can, should, or want to outsource logistics functions that are currently performed within the organization. To successfully outsource any corporate function means asking some fundamental questions:








1. What is the outsourcing objectivereduction of cost or reduction of personnel?








2. Are company personnel currently performing the function satisfactorily?








3. Does the organization at this time lack requisite expertise?








4. Which functions could or should be outsourced?








5. What will be the benefits of outsourcing?








6. What will the new cost levels be? Can real cost reductions be calculated?








7. How will outsourcing affect the way the organization operates?








8. Will you lose control? Would this be critical?








9. Will things be better?








10. How will quality be affected?








Outsourcing is a process of reengineering. Authors Michael Hammer and James Champy in their book Reengineering the Corpora-





 












Page 21




tion, ask the question, Why do we do what we do at all? They explain that "reengineering is about inventing new approaches to process structure that bear little or no resemblance to those of previous eras.* The process of deciding whether or not to outsource and, if the answer is yes, how to select the outsourcing partner is outlined in the following pages and developed further in Chapter 4.








Third-Party Services: Analysis and Decision








Review the Present Arrangement








Look at the investment in your logistics or distribution network: your warehouses and distribution centers, the modes and types of transportation, and the carriers you use.








Is your investment in logistics facilities and equipment as productive as your manufacturing investment?








Could you invest in state-of-the-art logistics hardware, software, and equipment? Would you want to do this?








What are your investment criteria? How do you prioritize?








What are the strengths and weaknesses in your current system?








What is the value-added?








What is your current structure of inventory and related taxes? Will this change?








What is your current liability exposure?








How will your insurance requirements be affected?








Develop Your Marketing (Qualitative) Information








Collect solid, reliable marketing-logistics information about your products, customers, suppliers, manufacturing process, inventory, and network from your existing data bases. If necessary, simulate your network with the aid of modeling techniques.








* Michael Hammer and James Champy, Reengineering the Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution (New York: HarperCollins, 1993), p. 49.

Products








What is their value?








What are their handling, storage, and transportation characteristicsshelf life, hazard?








Are your products seasonal?








Do they need special packaging?








Do they need temperature protection?








What is your loss and damage experience?








What is your obsolescence factor?








How much space do you need?








Which warehouse services do you need?








Customers








What are your domestic or global marketing areas and regions?








What are your channels of distribution?








Who are your customers?








Where are they locatedare they concentrated or dispersed?








What are your customers' delivery requirements?








What are your customers' value-added service requirements?








What are your modes and methods of outbound transportation?








Are they effective and cost-efficient?








What are your freight terms?








How many customers have you lost as a result of shipping errors?








Are your products readily available from the competition?








Suppliers








What determines your need for raw materials or supplies inventory?








Are raw materials and supplies readily available or do they have to be made to order?








What are your ordering patterns?








What are your freight terms?








Where are your suppliers located?








What are your receiving requirements?








Are they being met consistently?





 












Page 23




What are your methods and modes of inbound transportation? Are they cost-efficient?








Are delivery transit times reliable?








Manufacturing Process








Do your manufacturing processes and/or methods dictate your inventory levels?








Do you manufacture ''to order" or "to inventory"? Is there always something left over?








Could you match customer orders to production runs?








How good and reliable is your production and order scheduling?








Inventory








What determines your need for finished goods inventorycustomer ordering patterns and practices, market presence and share, or competition?








Have quality demands (JIT, ECR, QR, ISO 9000; see Abbreviations and Acronyms) increased or decreased inventory locations and volumes?








Have you calculated your response time?








What have you done to shorten your response time?








What determines your need for raw materials inventory?








Are your sources of supply reliable?








How responsive are your vendors?








Do you have or can you develop alternative sources?








Could you reduce raw materials and supplies inventories and related warehousing cost by changing your purchasing practices and method of production and scheduling?








Distribution Network








Why and how were inventory locations selected?








Are transportation transit times realistic?








How are inventory availability and required inventory levels determined?








Does each location provide enough or too much space?








What is the performance of each?








Could you reduce the number of warehouse locations and





 












Page 24




still maintain the service levels demanded by your customers?








In particular, a network review will help you determine how you could or should restructure your distribution and logistics network. It will help you answer the basic questions: (1) are the warehouses in the right location? Is the inventory in the right warehouse? and (2) Do you need warehouses at all? The next step is to collect quantitative information on your operations.








Develop Your Quantitative Information








Use the form in Exhibit 3-2 to assemble the relevant quantitative data.








Make the Decision








Should you outsource any logistics functions? If the answer is yes, you may decide to implement transfer of responsibilities in phases. Perhaps start with carrier selection, followed by order processing, order fulfillment, pick and pack, warehouse management, andmost likely as a last functioninventory management. Regardless of the scope of your outsourcing, the process and time schedule must be communicated to all involved well ahead of the target starting date. Prepare for a rough time during the transition!

Selecting a Third-Party Service Provider








"After all the concepts have been developed, the meetings are over and an action plan has been developed, everything boils down to hard, dirty work!"Peter Drucker, at a New York University seminar








Once you have developed your marketing, logistics, and quantitative information, and have decided to outsource, you are ready to select a suitable third-party provider to become your long-term business partner.








The first comprehensive listing of more than 400 third-party logistics providers and outsourcing organizations has been produced by Transportation and Distribution magazine. This T&D Contract Logistics Data Base will be updated annually. See the References for Chapter 4 for information on ordering.








Important! Keep in mind that your customers will come into contact with your third-party provider more frequently than with your own representatives!








The following pages contain a checklist for the outsourcing selection process (Exhibit 4-1), plus other exhibits to help in evaluating third-party logistics providers. Exhibit 4-2, a request for proposal checklist, will help you identify the value-added services to be outsourced and compare your service needs with your prospective service provider's operating capabilities. Exhibit 4-3, a public and contract warehouse profile, is a means for describing your prospec-

Warehouse Operations: Delivery and Storage








''The truck's at the gate, so what do we do next?"
Exasperated warehouse manager








Warehouse operationsthe things you doare the same whether you do them in a private, public, or contract facility. When you look around a warehouse it appears that nothing much is going on: only a few forklift trucks running between stacks of boxes and drums, placing pallets into racks; some cartons rolling down a maze of conveyors; someone picking parts out of one bin and placing them into another; trailer interiors yawning at the docks waiting to be loaded; two or three workers hanging around the water cooler. There don't seem to be all that many people working here!








But when you look more closely, there is work going on: Someone at Dock 15 is zapping bar code labels on the boxes being unloaded; somebody else is getting a pick list from a computer terminal; others are checking unloading tally sheets, loading drums on trucks, pushing cartons from slip sheets on to pallets, signing shipping documents. All these and more warehouse activities go on at the same time. Yet there is order in what at first sight appears to be random work! Let's identify who generates all this activity, who performs it, and for whom it is done.








We can identify four different, but interdependent parties:








1. The depositorscustomers of the warehouse who engage and rely on the services of a warehouse. They transfer their goods from manufacturing plants, ocean piers, and other shipping origins to the warehouse for future shipments to their customers.





 












Page 42




2. The common, contract, and private carriersoperators who, at the direction of the depositors, haul the goods to and from the warehouse. Many warehouses either run their own truck fleets or are closely affiliated with local or regional trucking companies.








3. The warehouse and its personnelemployees who receive, cross-dock, store, handle, pick, pack, and ship the goods and merchandise upon their depositors' instructions. In a growing number of cases, the depositors' customers can also place their orders directly with the warehouse.








4. The customersthe people or businesses that use the goods. Every task and function in the cycle of warehouse activities is aimed at the depositors' customers! Service-oriented warehouse operators are well aware that they are the immediate, direct contact with their depositors' customers; they represent their depositors and are the final link in the supply chain. A good warehouse operator performs as if its depositors' customers are its own!








The Cycle of Activities








The cycle of activities in a warehouse begins with the depositor's notification that goods will be shipped to the warehouse and ends with the delivery of goods to, and receipt at, the customer's destination.








To ensure that goods, products, and merchandise are received, handled, and shipped according to its wishes and requirements, the depositor should provide the warehouse with specific operating instructions and guidelines, contained in a formal compliance manual that becomes an integral part of the warehousing agreement or contract (more about compliance manuals in Chapter 7).








Have you, the depositor, provided the warehouse with a compliance manual?








Thus, depositors manage the warehousing function and leave the running of the facilities to warehouse operators. Those depositors rely on their operators' experience in performing the many warehousing tasks competently. These tasks include:





 












Page 43




Receipt and unloading of goods








Assignment of adequate space suitable for the goods to be stored: on the floor (bulk storage); in pallet, antilever, flow-through, drive-through, or sliding racks; on shelves or in drawers, bins, carousels of adequate size, operated manually or automatically








Space- and time-efficient location of goods for easy accessibility








Placement of goods by skilled personnel, using a wide variety of material-handling equipment, among them lift trucks for pallets and slip sheets, reach trucks, side loaders, turrets, robotic trucks, automated put-away machinery








Selection and application of appropriate order-picking methods and equipment








Adequate product maintenance and protection








Packing of orders, shrink- and stretch-wrapping, banding, marking, and labeling, loading with proper equipment, supplying and installing blocking and bracing as necessary








Documentation and reports








Loss prevention and control, security








Inventory control








Personnel and facility management








Warehousing activities must follow detailed, written procedures carried out by trained warehouse personnel. This chapter and the next present procedural highlights of interest to the depositor. For additional information on warehousing operations, see the specialized texts mentioned in the Suggested Readings and Sources at the back of this guide.








Depositor Responsibilities








Depositors should notify the warehouse by phone, electronic data interchange (EDI), or fax at least 24 hours in advance (48 hours is better!) that goods will be shipped to the warehouse on a certain day, with certain receiving hours. Reliable activity forecasts for deliveries and shipments will translate into lower costs for the warehouse operator. Conversely, short-notice, same-day, and off-hours deliveries and shipments generate higher costs; they throw off the





 












Page 44




warehouse work schedule, may require expensive overtime, and can generate truck detention charges.








Tip: The advance notice should be given by EDI or fax hard copy to confirm verbal communications; this establishes an audit trail that will minimize later disputes.








Order and schedule the outbound transportation equipment from your selected carrier roster or private truck fleet. You should also inspect the interior of the transport vehicle prior to loading to make sure that it is clean, contains no rubbish or waste, and the floors and walls are in safe condition and show no indication of roof or floor leakage. If the vehicle is unsatisfactory, return it to the carrier. This is especially important for trucks, trailers, intermodal containers, and railcars that will be "dropped," that is, placed for loading at the site for your convenience.








Tip: Rake the vehicle floor with a nail rake to detect any loose screws or nails on the floorboards.








Load the goods for shipment. Loading begins the transportation phase during which you, as shipper, are not in total control of the shipment. The carrier has physical, not legal, possession of the goods and assumes full liability in accordance with the terms and conditions of either the bill of lading or the shipper/carrier contract under which the shipment is made. Be sure to supply the driver at the shipping origin with placards, should the shipment include hazardous materials. Common and contract carriers are not required to provide such hazardous materials placards. Obviously, when loads are transferred between carriers you cannot supply those intermediate carriers with placards, but this is the intermediate, or delivering, carrier's responsibility.








Prepare your shipping documents. These include the bill of lading, shipping order, packing list, material safety data sheet, delivery receipt, and certificate of analysis. From the outset, establish which documents are needed. On shipments of nonhazardous materials, a shipping order and packing list may be sufficient; for hazardous materials, a "Haz Mat" manifest, material safety data sheet, and emergency response information must be added. The shipping doc-





 












Page 45




uments should include the product number and description, classification, hazard class, volume, weight, number of shipping items, type of packaging, special shipping and handling instructions, shippers' routing, and delivering carrier.








Retain the original bill of lading, copies of the delivery receipt, packing lists, and other shipping documents in hard copy or electronic format. You may need these and other documents later to substantiate and trace errors, investigate complaints, and file and settle freight bills, overcharges, and loss and damage claims.








Transport Carrier Responsibilities








The principles of transportation apply to inbound receipts from depositors, as well as outbound shipments to depositors' customers, irrespective of the mode of transport.








Many depositors use their private trucks to make deliveries to and shipments from warehouses. Since the trucking industry was deregulated by the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994 (TIRRA), and the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA), companies that operate private trucks can also operate as for-hire common or contract carriers.








Therefore, it can happen that the goods of Depositor A are delivered to and/or picked up from a warehouse in trucks owned and/or operated by Depositor B. This situation can become even more complicated when Depositor A, operating as private carrier for Depositor B, leases its trucking equipment; in this case, names such as Hertz or Rollins may appear on the vehicles.








While deliveries to a warehouse may not need verification of truck ownership, pickups by private trucks from a warehouse do require warehousing personnel to verify that the carrier was indeed sent by the depositor. When in doubt, warehouse shipping personnel must verify carrier status with the depositor before any goods are loaded.








Common and contract carriers must sign for any goods received and, as indicated by the depositor's routing instructions, transport those shipments to the consignee. In accordance with the routing, the origin carrier also transfers and interchanges shipments





 












Page 46




to intermediate or delivering carriers that, in turn, make the final delivery.








Warehouse Responsibilities








Truck Deliveries








When the depositor uses a common or contract carrier, the truck driver or his dispatcher makes the delivery appointment. The receiving warehouse will not pay any detention charges if the carrier fails to make a delivery appointment and, upon arrival, has to wait in line to have the truck unloaded. If a private carrier is used, the depositor makes the truck delivery appointment.








Rail Deliveries








Railroad agents should give advance notice to the warehouse that railcars have arrived at the nearest railyard and are available for placement at the warehouse rail siding. This first advice, called constructive structive placement, is made by phone, fax, or EDI. It starts the clock for calculation of demurrage charges.








The physical delivery of railcars or containers is called actual placement. The receiver gives the railroad agent, or railroad switching crew, instructions for the actual placement of cars so that they can be spotted in accordance with a switch list prepared by the warehouse and transmitted to the railroad agent ahead of time.








A constructive placement notice may also be given upon arrival of overseas shipping containers. Consignees should arrange for prompt pickup to avoid detention charges.








Tip: In today's lean-and-mean environment, the receiver will most often be in direct contact with the railroad switching crew. (In cases where a small railroad makes the delivery, even its president could double as locomotive engineer and agent!)








Railroad switching crews pick up empty and spot loaded rail-cars in accordance with the switch list prepared by the warehouse.





 












Page 47




At most warehouses, security guards must open a gate to allow trains to enter the property; at other warehouseswhere the rail gate is located farther from the guard housethe railroad crew can either be given a key to your gate or the key can be kept in a locked box at the gate. Most railroad switching personnel use mobile phones to communicate with the guardhouse. If at all possible, the receiving personnel should be present when railcars are spotted to check and verify car numbers and seal integrity. They should inform railroad personnel, preferably the agent, immediately of any irregularities.








Gatehouse Security Guards








Gatehouse guards check and verify the date and time of all carrier appointments. Indeed, efficient and safe receiving- and shipping-dock management begins at the gatehouse. An experienced gate-house guard works closely with the receiving foreman to avoid yard and dock congestion, detention, and delay, as well as provides a secure perimeter.








In particular, when deliveries are made by private truck, the security guard should verify truck ownership. Some security guards, in addition to checking the driver's paperwork (especially when hazardous or dangerous cargo is involved), verify that the truck and/or trailer complies with Department of Transportation regulations, for example, placards, equipment condition and cleanliness, visible violations, and driver appearance.








The gatehouse guard then directs the truck to a receiving dock, bay, or door number. When trailers or containers are to be dropped, they are directed to a drop area. Warehouse drivers, using yard horses (Ottawas), then shuttle the equipment to the designated docks for later unloading.








Tip: It will be impossible to manage the docks unless all inbound receipts are scheduled. Failure to do so will inevitably lead to unused docks while other trucks are waiting to be unloaded. Insist that truck drivers or their dispatchers call ahead to make delivery appointments; they'll get the point if you let them wait.





 












Page 48




Where space allows, reserve some receiving docks for small-parcel carriers, such as UPS, FedEx, and the Postal Service, as well as private trucks.








ReceivingDock Management








To begin, insist that the dock personnel receive shipments in the order they are delivered. Don't allow them to handle the easy ones first and leave problem shipments for last. If possible, there should be a separate receiving dock and unloading area for problem shipments. Also, provide adequate lighting and a small standup desk where dock workers can put their working papers, bar code scanners, labels, and a few other supplies. But don't let these locations get messy!








The receiving personnel identify vehicle numbers (truck, trailer, railcar, or intermodal container numbers), comparing and verifying them against numbers shown on advance notices and accompanying shipping documents. They accept delivery when these numbers agree, and reject the shipment when the numbers don't agree. However, before any truck is refused and sent back, the receiving personnel should call the shipper to find out what's wrongthe cause for rejection could be a minor paperwork error.








Dock personnel then direct the truck drivers to do the following:








Carefully open their trailer doors. Loads, especially in ocean containers, may have shifted in transit. The blocking and bracing may have been broken, and items may fall out of the vehicle and cause damage and personal injury.








Back the trailer against the dock. They should make sure the truck doors have been opened and secured so they don't flap around and hit someone or something. The drivers should be cautioned against hitting the dock bumper too hard. In addition to causing building and equipment damage, this may cause the load to shift and even fall out of the now open doors.








The receiving personnel then proceed with the receipt of the shipment. First, they chock the wheels. Always chock the wheels to prevent movementcreepingof the trailers. Dock personnel must





 












Page 49




observe OSHA, DOT, and other applicable regulations. They also attach grounding cables before any bulk loads are discharged. (Likewise, dock personnel should not forget to remove the wheel chocks before the truck leaves. Some jockeys pull their trailers over the chocks, with a resulting severe jolting of the load or worse.)








Warning! If a trailer drops on its nose because the stanchions (landing gear) have not been lowered, or a forklift falls off the trailer or dock, there can be severe injury, even death. These are the result of serious safety violations.








The next step is to carefully position the dock plate or adjust the dock leveler. Important: Loading and unloading docks are the most active areas of any warehouse. Receiving personnel walk and drive manual and powered lift trucks across dock plates or levelers thousands of times a year. For example, unloading and reloading one 53-foot trailer holding 25 pallets requires 50 entries and 50 exits, or a total of 100 dock crossings. Handling just two such trailers a day means 50,000 dock crossings a year. So these levelers must be positioned correctly to avoid accidents.








Although presumably standardized, truck heights can vary six inches or more, as well as vary from loaded to unloaded condition. To overcome height differentials, dock levelers are used to facilitate trailer entry. Power-assisted or automated, 6 to 8 feet long, these dock levelers are permanently installed at most receiving docks. Some docks feature truck restraints (a dock-installed hookup device) that prevent movement of trailers and their accidental or unscheduled removal from the dock.








Portable dock plates are generally used to load or unload rail-cars that vary in length, and are often "spotted," that is, located, at random along the rail siding. Portable steel dock boards are heavy and are placed in position by lift truck, an operation which requires skill; improper dock plate movement can cause severe injury.








Warehouse and dock construction dictates the method of unloading. Some warehouses are built at, or slightly raised from, ground level. Here, loading and unloading can be achieved by portable lift dock. When such a portable lift dock is used, it is raised to the level of the truck, the load is moved on to the lifting dock, and it is then lowered to the receiving dock height.





 












Page 50




Less frequently used are truck levelers that raise the rear wheels of the truck or trailer to meet dock height; or an inclined, depressed pit reaching into the warehouse. Either method places the vehicle at an incline (either the nose or the back of the vehicle) and presents loading and unloading difficulties. In addition, both methods are maintenance-intensive because of weather exposure and drainage.








During the warehouse selection process, depositors should ascertain the design, maximum allowable grade, and load-bearing capacity of dock levelers. These factors will affect the safe and efficient loading and unloading of goods.








At this point, receiving personnel extend the weather seals (or shrouds) to keep out the elements and maintain the goods in dry, temperature-controlled condition. They also open any seals. When delivery is made by sealed truck or container, the number on the seal must be compared to the seal number shown on the shipping document before the vehicle doors can be opened. Receiving personnel can break the seals only when the numbers agree, and this must be done in the presence of the carrier's driver. If drivers refuse to wait, call their dispatchers immediately.








The seals on railcars, spotted trailers, or containers must also be checked and verified as intact immediately after arrival and before the driver or railroad crew departs. If the receiving crew detect a broken seal after the delivering carrier has left, there are apt to be claim problems if any loss or damage is found. So dock personnel should carefully inspect the seals to verify they have not been tampered with. If seal numbers do not agree, or if seals have been broken, the vehicle must be rejected because the integrity of the load may have been compromised.








Tip: When seals have been broken in transit by U.S. customs agents, representatives of other government agencies, or police inspectors, new seals will have been applied and appropriate notation with new seal numbers will have been made on the shipping papers by those authorized officials.








A seal accountability procedure recommended by the U.S. Department of Transportation has been published in the code of federal regulations CFR 49, included in Appendix B.





 












Page 51




The receiving personnel should take pictures of the vehicle interior before they begin to unload. At first sight, a Polaroid camera and film appears to be an expensive proposition, but in the long run it's a cheap way to cover your bases! A picture is worth a thousand words. You can clip it to the receiving tally to verify the condition of the load inside the shipping vehicle, and add it to your permanent record, or submit it to the carrier in support of a claim. New technologyin 1996, still much more expensive than an inexpensive Polaroidwill let you record pictures on CD-ROM discs and, eventually, on microchips.








This is the point at which your personnel now unload the railcar, trailer, or container using hand trucks, dollies, powered lift trucks, and portable conveyors to shuttle the loose items, floor loads, unitized loads on pallets, slip sheets, and BOP sheets. Of course, you should make sure that the trailer or container floor can hold the weight of a forklift truck. Compact as they appear, they weigh 7,000 pounds and moreunloaded!








Tip: For safety, use bright spotlights mounted at the dock door on the lift truck. Working in poorly lighted or dark trailers invites damage to goods, or the forklift may be driven through the walls of the trailer. There's always the danger of protruding nails, splintered lumber, and broken dunnage, as well as shifted items that may fall down as workers begin to unload.








The receiving personnel should follow these steps:








1. Check and verify the shipment count and weight. Check the number of items, palletized units, boxes, crates, and drums. The number of items being unloaded must agree with the number in the carrier's bill of lading, delivery receipt, packing list, and/or other shipping documents. Obtain scale weights of bulk deliveries.








Increasingly, this function is performed using bar code scanners, which also can generate labels that, immediately upon unloading, are applied to packages or unitized loads (see Exhibits 5-1 and 5-2).








2. Check the condition of the shipment. Any discrepancies in nomenclature, description, weight, count or volume, overages,

shortages, or significant product codes or numbers must be established at the time of receipt. Detailed information must be noted immediately on the shipping document in the form of an exception notation.








3. Inspect for visible damage. Unloading personnel must make an exception notation on the receiving report (or bill of lading copy) by fully describing any loss and damage to goods. This must be signed by the delivering truck driver. Therefore, warehouse receiving personnel should be trained to make proper exception notations, fully describing the condition of packages and observed damage.








4. Remove damaged goods. Take the damaged goods, together with all packaging materials, to a holding area out of the way of the receiving area for inspection by the shipper, carrier's representative, or independent inspector. Leave these goodsand their packaging materialsuntouched. Obtain clear instructions from the shipper for disposition, for example, the warehouse may be asked to hold for inspection, return to origin, repackage (recooper), salvage, or dispose of the goods.








5. Notify the depositor immediately of discrepancies. In case of damage to hazardous materials, it is mandatory that all personnel comply with OSHA, EPA, DOT, and other regulations and procedures pertaining to documentation, labeling, temporary storage, transport, and disposal.








6. Prepare the receiving report. This document is the warehouse operator's equivalent of the carrier's bill of lading. It acknowledges receipt of goods by the warehouse. It is also the basis for all subsequent accounting, reconciliation, and potential transportation claims (see Exhibits 5-3 and 5-4).








7. Remove all waste from the vehicle. Hold the vehicle in a designated area for disposal. This includes removing dunnage, broken pallets, blocking and bracing materials, disposable load restraints, and spilled and loose material from broken bags, cartons, and drums. Personnel should be aware of their handling, storage, and disposal responsibilities with regard to hazardous materials and substances.








When the goods have been unloaded and receipt acknowledged, it is time to release the truck carrier. The warehouse advises

the railroad agent or shipping container provider that railcars and containers have been unloaded and can be picked up. This avoids demurrage and detention charges. Any transportation claims must be initiated as agreed between the depositor and warehouse, and be handled in accordance with established procedures and within prescribed deadlines (discussed further in Chapter 12). At this point, the receiving process is completed and the warehouse removes the goods from the receiving dock into storage. Many warehouses mark the boundary between their staging and their storage areas with a yellow line. Inbound goods should never cross this line until the paperwork (electronic input by bar code scanner, portable data terminal, or keyboard entry) is completed.








Tip: Never say "Just unload the trailer now and put the stuff somewhere. We'll complete the paperwork later, when we have more time."

Other Warehouse Operations








As mentioned in Chapter 5, warehouse services entail more than receipt and storage of goods. Particularly at a time when companies are looking to outsource some operations, warehouses can be cost-effective third-party providers.








Cross-Docking








Cross-docking is the ''direct flow of goods from the receiving process to the shipping process with the least handling and storage between. It is as much information handling as it is material handling."* Cross-docking compresses the receive-to-ship time period, as well as reduces handling between receipt and shipment of goods and merchandise.








Cost Reductions








Cross-docking is used especially for quick response (QR) and efficient consumer response (ECR) shipments to retailers. It shortens the replenishment cycle, increases the speed of inventory turns, and can drastically reduce storage, handling, and inventory carrying costs.








Much like back-hauling freightwhich matches inbound with outbound loads to effect round-trips, thereby reducing transportation costscross-docking matches inbound with outbound ship-








* From "Considerations for Cross Docking," by Gene E Schwindt, Material Handling Engineering, November 1995, p. 47.





 












Page 59




ments. Both procedures rely heavily on the timely receipt of accurate shipping information.








Efficient Use of Space








The turnover rate of goods determines their location inside the warehouse: slow-moving items are stored farther away, while fast-moving items are kept closer to the shipping dock. Items intended for cross-docking are usually moved only a very short distance from the inbound dock, at or near the staging area, in order to hold in-bound shipments just long enough for reshipment; break inbound shipments, then sort, package, and label as may be needed; and reassemble and unitize them into new shipments. (Reverse-order picking is a variant of cross-docking. Here, the warehouse holds a portion of one inbound order for combination with goods from other inbound shipments or from storage.)








Warehouse management must determine how much short-term space must be assigned in the staging area for cross-docking operations, and how this area will be managed. The staging area is already heavily usedin fact, it is the area of highest activity in any warehouseso the potential for confusion, mixups, accidents, and damage from crowding is great.








Cross-docking is becoming so popular that warehouse operators are beginning to change the basic configurations and layouts of their warehouses. In existing buildings, certain areas could be assigned to cross-docking. Future warehouses will be designed with separate cross-docking and handling space, with different areas for rail and truck receiving and shipping access. The layout of these new sections will be similar to a less-than-truckload carrier break-bulk terminal.








A Cross-Docking Checklist








Successful cross-docking depends on safe and smart dock management and control. It requires timely receipt of reliable information and careful scheduling of shipments. If you are contemplating cross-docking operations, answer the questions on the checklist in Exhibit 6-1.

Order Picking








Order picking, order filling, or simply picking can be described as the sequence of locating, extracting, and bringing forward customer orders for shipment. Selecting the most efficient order-picking procedure depends on the following:








Type of product








Turnover rate








Method of storage loose in bins or on shelves, packaged in cases or boxes, in full loads, break-bulk quantities, or unitized on pallets








Method of pickingavailability and use of automated storage and retrieval systems








Type and size of orders to be picked








Seasonality and related characteristics








Among the traditional picking routines are:








Discrete picking. Also called pick-by-order, this is the most common picking method; it is used when only single orders are picked.








Batch picking. Also called pick-by-article, this is used when more than one order is picked on the same picking run, taken to the staging area, sorted, and combined with other items for the same order; a variant is zone picking.








Wave picking. This is used when orders are picked in accordance with routing or shipping criteriafor example, pick all less-than-truckload orders or pick all orders for Yellow Freight.








Reverse-order picking. This is used when part of an order is held for combination with another order (see also cross-docking).








Shipping orders are received either from the depositor or from the customer, by phone, mail, fax, remote printer, or electronic data interchange. As an example, the following activity sequence describes the typical picking process. These activities are performed by warehouse customer service personnel, the warehouse supervisor, and pickers.





 












Page 62




Customer Service Personnel Duties








1. Identify the type of order as either a full-pallet truckload order, which requires locating and picking full-pallet unitized loads, or less-than-truckload and small-package orders, which may have to be picked from several locations, consolidated in an assembly area, and packaged.








2. Assign a customer order number.








3. Edit the customer profile information; that is, verify the product description and codes, quantities and sizes, type of packaging (including method of unitizing), ship-to and bill-to addresses, prescribed markings and labeling requirements, special instructions, delivering carrier, and delivery date.








4. Determine availability of inventory in the ordered quantities and sizes. If inventory is not available, the depositor must be advised, and a replenishment order must be generated and transmitted immediately.








5. Enter the order into the open (unshipped) customer order data base. In most electronic data-processing systems, orders are automatically sequenced and prioritized by delivery date and will appear in that order on the warehouse office computer terminal or be printed out in hard copy on a remote printer terminal.








6. Produce a customer order pick list in accordance with the picking method. It should display the following elements: number, size, and dimensions of items ordered; weight of items where this is important; lot numbers; product codes; product descriptions; storage location from which items are to be picked; and number and size of items picked.








This pick list is also sequenced by storage locations, positions, or slots (area, rack, block, tier, shelf, bin numbers/codes). It also lists alternative or secondary picking locations in the event the primary picking location does not contain sufficient inventory, so as to optimize travel distance and picking time. (Later, the picker must indicate on the pick list the actual location from which those goods were picked so that inventory records can be corrected and updated.) See Exhibit 6-2, Customer Order Pick List, for an example of pick list.








7. Transmit electronically or manually the pick list to the ware-house supervisor or shipping to office. Depending on the sophistication of the warehouse warehouse management system, the pick list is





 












Page 63

Page 64




accompanied by a work standardpick rates measured in the time measurement units (TMU) for each work component that, together with equipment-utilization factors, are used to calculate picking and other order-fulfillment costs.








Warehouse Supervisor Duties








1. Schedule and assign the pick list to a warehouse worker (by name), together with appropriate material-handling equipmenthandcarts, dollies, forklifts, bins, crates. The picking equipment should match the order; that is, the correct equipment must be selected so that it will handle the weight and dimensions of all items to be picked. For example, if inventory records show that order items are positioned exclusively at floor level, the order can be handled by a hand truck; if items are located in the second or third tier of a storage rack, a power-lift truck must be assigned; where the pick list requires picking of loose items, bins or crates must be provided.








2. Provide the selected picker with the pick list and any special instructions. Paperless pick lists are displayed on either portable terminals, which may be hand held, or fixed terminals that are attached to stationary or mobile picking equipment.








Picker Duties








1. Visit the locations on the pick list in the most efficient sequencewith no backtrackingto minimize travel time.








2. Pick (extract) the items from their storage position and place them on the lift truck or cart, or into the bins or crates.








3. Mark the picked item on the pick list, noting any irregularities, discrepancies, or variations. (Note: Order pickers should be trained to note and report any actual or impending stockouts.)








4. Proceed to the next picking location until the order is completed.








Single-pallet loads are picked and transported to a predetermined staging area. Many orders, especially truckload orders, require the picking of 24 or more pallet loads. To avoid transporting each pallet individually on repeated trips up and down the length





 












Page 65




and width of the warehouse, you can hook several warehouse trailers together to form trains, pulled around by a power-lift truck.








In many modern warehouses, picking orders are preroutedthe decision as to picking method and sequence is predetermined by the warehouse management system. Pickers do not have to decide which method to use.








Where paperless order picking is an integral part of a warehouse management system, the picking activity is automatically transmitted and entered into system data bases by radio frequency.








The picked orders are assembled or accumulated in the staging areas. Batch-picked or zone-picked orders, which must be sorted and/or assembled, are transported to the assembly area for consolidation and packaging. Discrete-picked orders are transported directly to the dock staging area assigned for pickup.








Tip: Orders placed too early at or near the dock, and late carrier arrivals, are the most common sources of misshipments. Make sure that orders to be loaded on the same truck are kept separate and are not mixed with other orders staged in the same area.








The order is then checked for completeness. In warehouses where picking operations are supported by bar code scanning and radio frequency identification and transmittal (RFID) technology, all manual recording is substituted for electronic location identification, data recognition, recording, and entry.








Following the check, the order is unitized, wrapped, containerized, and packed. Shrink- and stretch-wrapping of cartons, bags, and other shapes are preferred methods of unitizing, although disposing of these wrapping materials may become a waste disposal problem at the receiving location. Banding with plastic or steel bands is common, but if not properly applied or removed, these loose bands lying around can pose a significant hazard. Some shippers spot-glue bags and other packages, however, when disassembled, these loads may rip or tear. Smaller items should be overpacked in cartons.








For a complete description of picking methods, procedures, systems, and documentation, consult the texts in the References at the end of this book.

Packaging








Cartons, boxes, crates, drums, and pails are subject to multiple handling in the warehouse and during transportation. (More on this in Chapter 11.) For example:








From the truck to the staging area








From the staging area to the storage location








From the storage position back to the staging area








From the staging area into the truck








From the truck to the carrier's break-bulk dock








From the carrier's dock into another truck








From the truck to another carrier's break-bulk dock








From the carrier's dock into yet another truck








From the truck to the receiver's dock








From the receiver's dock to the storage area








From the storage area to the sales shelf








Therefore, all nonbulk goods must be packaged so they can be handled in automated (robotic) packaging systems, can be handled repeatedly, and can withstand the rigors of transportation (abrupt movement, acceleration and deceleration of vehicle, friction, grinding, chafing, rocking, swaying, shocks, and vibration). They also need to be protected from loss and damage or influences of the environment (extreme heat and cold, water, condensation, rust). They must not damage other goods while in storage or in transit, and must remain in salable or usable condition.








Packaging Hazardous Materials








Hazardous materials must be packaged in specified containers and packages. Detailed specifications are published by the U.S. Department of Transportation, CFR 49, parts 173-178. Under the definitions of the CFR, warehouses are considered shippers of hazardous materials, and thus must comply with all handling, packaging, labeling, marking, placarding, certification, and other regulations. All warehouse personnel must be thoroughly familiar and comply with these regulations, as well as EPA, FDA, and OSHA laws, regulations,





 












Page 67




and Responsible Care* initiatives. Warning! Noncompliance with hazardous-materials handling and packaging regulations may re-suit in substantial personal and corporate fines. (See Chapter 11, "Packaging: Containers and Methods.")








Marking, Tagging, and Labeling








To identify goods, labels, tags, and markingsin hand-written, printed, stenciled, or bar code formatsmust be exhibited on all goods. The shape, size, format, and content of these tags and labels are prescribed by shippers and depositors, as well as regulations governing freight classifications, hazardous materials, and other matters. The labels and tags must be of durable quality and/or a material to withstand the rigors of handling. They must remain legible and identifiable throughout the logistics cycle, and be permanently affixed or adhered to the goods in a manner resistant to wear and tear or accidental removal. The labels should be easily visible and in a recognizable place; palletized or unitized loads can be marked as a single unit.








The labels must show the following:








1. The name and address of the receiver (consignee)








2. The name and address of the shipper (consignor)








3. Any hazardous-materials warnings








4. The product identification, description, and codes








5. Any protective service symbols, such as high or low temperature limits








6. Any special handling symbols, such as forbidden handling methods and equipment (see Exhibit 6-3)








Pictorial precautionary markings, as shown in Exhibit 6-4, can be adhered as labels, exhibited within a border and with an opposing color or background color.








* Responsible CareÂ® is an initiative adopted by the members of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, 2501 M Street, Washington, D.C. 20037. It addresses environmental, safety, and health issues associated with chemicals in the workplace and in transportation.

Loading and Shipping








Goods that have been received and stored, as well as others that have been picked and assembled to fulfill orders, will eventually be loaded onto trucks or railcars and shipped out. The warehouse frequently performs these operations. This chapter touches upon some of these operations. Detailed instructions for routing and the preparation of shipping documents are described in Chapter 7.








Loading Responsibilities








The National Motor Freight Classification 100* states, in Rule 568 regarding the loading or unloading of heavy or bulky packaged freight:








Unless otherwise provided in carriers' individual tariffs, when freight (per package or piece) in a single container, or secured to pallets, platforms or lift truck skids, or in any other authorized form of shipment: (a) weighs 110 pounds or less, the carrier will perform the loading and unloading; (b) weighs more than 110 but less than 500 pounds: (1) the carrier will perform the loading and unloading where the consignor consignee provides a dock, platform or ramp directly accessible to the carrier's vehicle . . . (c) weighs 500 pounds or more . . . [and] . . . (d) exceeds 8 feet in its greatest dimension or exceeds 4 feet in each of its greatest and intermediate dimensions, the consignor will perform the loading and the consignee will perform the unloading. . . .








Many shippers and receivers perform loading and unloading operations with their own personnel and equipment, without driver assistance. Insurance limitations, safety rules, and other operating considerations frequently prohibit nonemployees from working on company premises.








Shippers should understand, however, that, where the labor cost for loading and unloading is part of the freight rate, they








* National Motor Freight Classification 100, National Motor Freight Traffic Association, Inc., Agent, American Trucking Associations, Inc., Alexandria, VA, June 25, 1995.





 












Page 76




should try to get a loading and/or unloading allowance from the carrier.








Bulk freight is generally loaded onto trucks by the shipper. Note that the loading and unloading of hazardous materials can be performed only by personnel trained in accordance with regulations. Railcars and intermodal containers are loaded by the consignor while unloading is the consignee's responsibility.








Should it happen that the loader cannot find all the units shown on the shipping papers, remember that the depositor's customer service group has already faxed the bill of lading to the warehouse. The depositor must transmit a corrected document to the warehouse to avoid inventory reconciliation problems. Make sure all copies of shipping documents are signed legibly by the accepting carrierusually the driver.








Dunnage








Dunnage is any type of material that does not constitute a shipping carrier, container, or package, and is used to separate and fill empty spaces to protect cargo from movement inside the transport vehicle while in transit, and protect the vehicle from damage by the cargo.








Carriers that use this definition do not include the weight of dunnage in the gross weight used to calculate freight rates. Item 995 of the National Motor Freight Classification states that








Any temporary blocking, flooring or lining, racks, standards, strips, stakes or similar bracing, dunnage or supports not constituting a shipping carrier, container or package, or a part of the vehicle, shall be excluded from the gross weight.








Commonly used as dunnage are floor linings, pallets, boards, inflatable paper or plastic bags, plastic foam sheets, and blankets. Many dunnage materials are returnable and reusable.








Blocking and Bracing








Blocking and bracing is required, especially when shipping hazardous materials. The equipment and devices used include bulkheads in railroad cars, damage-free bars in cars and truck trailers, strap-





 












Page 77




ping and banding, and friction tape. Also, 2''Ã4" studs and 4'Ã8' plywood sheets can be nailed to the floors and side walls of vehicles.








Carriers' safety and loss-prevention departments will assist shippers in selecting and using load-restraining devices. The recommendations for dunnage materials and blocking and bracing methods can be obtained from your rail, highway, and ocean carriers, the Association of American Railroads, and the American Trucking Association. For a complete description of blocking and bracing devices, see Smith et al., Freight Claim Prevention in Plain English. (See Suggested Readings at the end of this book.)








Routing








Routing is the selection of a carrier (or combination of carriers) to transport goods between origin and destination. Shippers select common, contract, and private carriers based on rates and services, including carrier capabilities, reputation, financial stability, equipment type and availability, responsiveness, and performance. Service agreements, including transportation and warehousing contracts, should contain explicit routing instructions.








Although single-sourcing of carriers and other service providers has its adherents, the vagaries of business suggest that you or your third-party service provider seek protection from service failures of primary carriers by selecting and ranking alternate carriers. For instance, you could assign shipment volume on a rotating business: Carrier A gets 75% of the business for three months, Carrier B gets 25%; for the next three months, you reverse the order.








Shipping Responsibilities








At the end of the line, there must be one person responsible for the accuracy of the shipment and all associated information, whether it is in hard copy or electronic format.








The shipping checklist (Exhibit 6-5) will help you perform this task before the doors of the loaded vehicle are closed.








Some warehouses employ the following security procedure: Loaded truck trailers and containers keep their loading doors open while proceeding to the gatehouse. The security guard checks the load against the shipping papers and applies seals, as necessary.

Inventory Control








When depositors are preparing their corporate financial statements, they take a physical inventory to determine their total assets in inventory, in accordance with standard accounting and valuation methods. Inventories of all their materials are counted: raw materials, supplies, semiprocessed and semifinished goods, and finished goods. These annual physical inventory counts may be conducted even in companies that keep manual or computerized cycle counts or perpetual inventory records. Errors in record keeping occur whether a company uses an electronic or a manual data-entry system. Nevertheless, the physical inventory is the best time to identify slow-moving, overage, obsolete, lost, damaged, and broken items. It's also an opportunity to clean up the inventory and initiate the disposition of unsalable or unusable goods. In figuring costs as well as assets, depositors should understand that a warehouse charges the same rates for the storage and handling of damaged, obsolete, and otherwise unsalable inventory as it does for salable inventory.








Reporting the inventory status periodically is part of inventory control, and is the responsibility of warehouse operating personnel. Inventory control should not be confused with inventory management, which is the manner in which optimum inventory levels are deployed for maximum availability to users and customers. (Inventory management techniques are beyond the scope of this text; see the Suggested Readings at the end of this book.)








Inventory reports reflect the current level of inventory, by line item, product, or stock keeping unit. They are a way to monitor, measure, and control inventory accuracy and operating performance, and to catch errors in item posting, order picking, recording and reporting, overages, and shortages.








Methods of Counting Inventory








Inventory control is performed in three ways:








1. Perpetual inventory. Daily activities are reported in compliance with the depositor's instructions and the warehouse proce-





 












Page 80




dures, and inventory is brought up to date daily. Perpetual inventories must be reconciled at least once a year, during the annual physical inventory.








2. Annual physical inventory. Actual and book inventory records are reconciled once a year during the annual physical inventory. Inventory reports are prepared for each product or product group or class and should follow the general, simplified format shown in Exhibit 6-6.








3. Cycle counting. To achieve maximum accuracy by detecting discrepancies in a timely fashion, and to reduce the labor-intensive annual or semiannual inventory counting and reconciliation effort, companies are increasingly using cycle counting. In this system, inventory activity and balances are reported daily, weekly, monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly for a group of items, product lines, or stock locations (zones) only. Cycle counting is applied specifically to items that are sensitive, perishable, expensive, and/or particularly subject to theft and pilferage. This cycle count must agree with the sum of daily activity reports for the counting period, and in case of discrepancies, is reconciled, item by item, with the warehouse book inventory. See Exhibit 6-7.








ReconciliationOverages and Shortages








In the normal course of manufacturing and production, large volumes of goods are handled. In spite of sophisticated counting methods, and adherence to quality operating and handling procedures, certain discrepancies between inputs and outputs will be encountered. They may be the result of process-yield variances, loss and damage, defective materials and products, packaging, and shrinkage. Since in virtually all cases* the manufacturer or producer owns (has title to) the goods and materials, some of these differences are recognized and absorbed by company management as part of the process, while others may be written off.








The wide variety and large number of warehousing transactions similarly result in overages and shortages. Generally, ware-








* Exceptions are, for instance, tolling operations where a manufacturerthe toileraccepts the product of another company for further processing and returns the processed product to the original manufacturer. In such cases, the original manufacturer retains title.

house operators do not own, i.e., do not have title to, the goods while in their care and custody; therefore, they are not presumed to own any overages and will report these to their depositors. For shortages, warehouse operators are responsible only as a reasonably careful man would be under like circumstances. (See Chapter 12, "Liability, Claims, and Insurance," and Appendix A, the Uniform Commercial Code.)








Inventory reconciliation to the last penny may cost more in time and effort than the discrepancy is worth. To reconcile small differences, depositors and warehouse operators may agree on a specified shrinkage allowance, such as an amount of loss both parties accept for which the warehouse operator shall not be responsible. An alternative is to average the overs and shortsthat is, to offset the shortages with overages, which can be the result of oversights, recording, or counting errors.








Responsibility for loss and damage in excess of agreed allowances or averages, obviously, influences the rates that warehouse operators charge their depositors. The depositors, therefore, have the option of absorbing such losses (self-insurance), buying excess insurance, or accepting higher warehousing rates in exchange for full-loss coverage by the warehouse. For a detailed discussion of such alternatives, see several of the documents in the Appendixes.








Tip: When negotiating and/or accepting agreements or contracts, depositors must carefully review their potential exposure to loss and damage, responsibility limitations of the parties, insurance requirements, and resulting warehousing rates and charges.








WHAT ARE YOUR INVENTORY PRACTICES AND ROUTINES?





 












Page 84




7
The Compliance Manual








The compliance manual is a document prepared by the depositor. It contains detailed instructions to the warehouse operator for the execution of all depositor-related activities. The warehouse's own procedures, combined with depositors' compliance manuals, form the basis for effective operations, performance measurements, and compliance audits. Depositors should provide a compliance manual to each of their warehouses.








This chapter presents the basic elements of and guidelines for developing such a depositor's compliance manual. There are suggestions for typical methods, sample procedures, and appropriate forms, as well as examples of useful phrases. Individual users should develop their own format in conformance with their corporate practices, ISO 9000, and similar quality guidelines.








Essential to many of these operations is the collection of operating, personnel, and administrative data by the warehouse. This information can be collected, either manually, using paper documents, forms, time cards, tags, and reports, or with an automated warehouse management system, using bar code scanning, radio frequency identification and transmittal (RFID), and related electronic means.








The information can then be conveyed to the depositor via phone, mail, remote printer, fax, e-mail, or batch or real-time electronic data interchange (EDI). Individual companies often devise their own forms, systems, routines, and methods for the warehouse operations they have contracted for. The following are examples of some warehouse activities that will need to be managed, controlled, and reported using the depositor's desired method of documentation.





 












Page 85




Daily Activity Report








A daily activity report (DAR) (see Exhibit 7-1) is generated by the warehouse to supply the depositor with specific information about all daily activities carried out on its behalf. This is the warehouse's most important report because it becomes the basis for all subsequent reporting and billing.








The depositor will specify the time of day the DAR must be received. The company may also stipulate that daily activity reports be transmitted at the specified time even when no activity has occurred.








A daily activity report includes the following for all inbound receipts and outbound shipments, and transfers to other warehouses, distribution centers, and other destinations:








Date and time of report and transmittal








Receiptsinbound to warehouse








Orders shippedoutbound from warehouse








Number of units, pallets, boxes, or drums








Overages and shortages








Returns to manufacturing plants or vendors








Returns from customers








Orders not shipped as requested








Transportation damages








Spills, damage, and/or accidents in the warehouse generated by or affecting the depositor's goods








Emergency responses








Other significant events








Name and signature of preparer








Time and date of preparation








Receipts: Inbound








The warehouse receipt is the document that transfers possession (not title!) of the goods described. (See Appendix C: Standard Terms and Conditions for Public and Contract Warehouse Operators.)








A warehouse receipt must be issued for each shipment. This is the source document proving possession of the goods. It is used to

establish acceptance of goods and becomes the basis for inventory status and reconciliation. Receiving personnel must note overages and shortages on the receipt, and demand signature by the delivering carrier's driver or agent.








In particular, the warehouse receipt should show:








Date and time of receipt (time stamp, if possible)








Origin name and location








Delivering carrier, routing








Bill of lading numbers with corresponding warehouse receiving report numbers








Description of goods: name, product code, lot number








Count, weight, or number of units per shipment; for purchased goods, vendor name, purchase order number; for returns, customer name and condition of goods








Discrepancies and exceptions, overages and shortages








Damage noted upon receipt and not noted on shipping papers at origin (loss and damage during transportation)








Condition of shipment








Carrier Deliveries and Inspection of Goods








Carriers must be instructed to make delivery appointments. A shipping order with detailed information on the goods should accompany each shipment from the depositor; a bill of lading accompanies each shipment from other origins (such as vendors) for the depositor.








Damage, broken seals, and other discrepancies between the shipping order and the load, discovered when the goods are received, must be noted. The warehouse then informs the depositor immediately of the situation.








Returns From Customers








All returns from customers to the warehouse must have prior approval from a depositor's representative. The customer returning





 












Page 88




the goods has been instructed to affix return tags to the goods. Un-tagged shipments must be set aside for disposition by the depositor.








Record the following information on the paperwork detailing the returned goods:








The name of the customer returning the goods








Verification of bill lading data with returned goods received








Description of product








Volume, quantity, and weight of containers returned








Condition of the goods; description of any damage or broken seals








Signed bill of lading; also the delivering carrier's signature noting any exception








The warehouse must advise the depositor's representative immediately of the return. The goods are set aside and held for the depositor's disposition. When the goods have been approved by the depositor as acceptable, it is time to remove the return tags, place the goods into storage, and adjust the inventory records.








Discrepancies








Documentation supporting discrepancies in volume or quantity, number of pieces, condition of shipment, or damage to goods must be submitted to the depositor for claim preparation.








The documentation must include:








Signed bill of lading (carrier's delivery receipt) with exception notation by warehouse receiving personnel








Receiving report with description of damage or loss








Packing list








Photographs








When the shipper requests a carrier inspection at the warehouse, the inspection report must be submitted to the shipper. Transportation loss and damage claims are prepared, filed, and settled by the depositor; see Chapter 12.





 












Page 89




Handling and Disposition of Damaged Goods








Damaged goods must be stored as received. They can be repackaged or secured only if in their present condition they may deteriorate further or pose a hazard to the facility or persons. Immediately upon notification from the warehouse, the depositor determines the methods of handling and disposition. All applicable safety regulations must be observed.








Withdrawals From Storage








Orders for shipments to customers are transmitted to the warehouse by the depositor's customer service representatives via an approved communication mediumremote printer, fax, EDI, mail, or messenger. The depositor provides the warehouse with a list of personnel authorized to initiate warehouse withdrawals.








Tip: When orders are transmitted by phone, they must be confirmed in writing, with the warning ''do not duplicate the shipment."








Shipping Orders








All significant information on the shipping order must be reviewed and verified. Any changes made by the warehousesubstitutions of lot numbers, short shipmentsmust be noted in the following detail:








Customer order or purchase order number








Bill of lading number








Outbound carrier, routing








Description of goods: name, product code, lot number








Classification of goods








Count and/or weight per piece or per shipment








Unit of measure








Total weight shipped








Scheduled shipping date or pickup date for customer pickup





 












Page 90




Freight terms: prepaid, collect, COD (collect on delivery)








Special instructions








Name of person preparing the shipment








When the warehouse is unable to meet the scheduled shipping date, it must contact the depositor's representative immediately to explain the reason and agree on a revised shipping date.








Stock Transfers








There are two types of stock transfers. In the first, the ownership of goods is transferred from the account of the depositor to the account of a customer, but the goods remain in the same warehouse facility. The depositor issues a bill of lading. In the carrier instructions section, the words "stock transfer" are inserted. The depositor also advises the warehouse to establish a separate account on behalf of the new customer, noting that the depositor will consign the goods to the new customer c/o the warehouse facility. To maintain proper inventory records, the warehouse moves all the goods to a separate warehouse location and labels the goods with the new customer's name and address. From this point on, the warehouse will treat these goods as the new customer's goods; any instructions for disposition of this inventory must be given by the new owner.








There should be no charges for this transfer, since the depositor's warehousing cost usually includes the cost of one move in and one move out. Any charges after this transfer is completed are made to the new customer's account.








In the second type of stock transfer, ownership of the goods is retained by the depositor, but the goods are either physically transferred to another warehouse location of the same warehouse operator or are transferred to another warehousing company.








In each case, the depositor issues the appropriate shipping instructions and provides the necessary documents.








Labeling and Marking








The warehouse must label and mark goods and articles for shipment in strict adherence to the depositor's instructions. The depositor willor, when agreed, will notsupply the necessary labels.





 












Page 91




Shipping Documents








The preparation and issuance of shipping documents depends on the type and extent of services for which the depositor and the warehouse have contracted. Services may include the preparation, distribution, filing, and control of domestic as well as export documentation. Preprinted bills of lading and other required forms may be provided by the depositor. Warehouse personnel should be familiar with the types and purposes of these documents, as well as the importance of their proper preparation.








Bill of Lading








The bill of lading (B/L) is a "document of title" controlling the acceptance, transportation, and delivery of goods in accordance with the terms and conditions stated either on the back of the document or in classification and/or rules tariffs to which carriers are a party.*








Important! Regarding the use of the "standard" bill of lading form: Motor carriers that are participants in the NMFC and shippersmay use the Standard B/L forms, terms, and conditions published in NMFC 100-V. Shippers must confirm carriers' participation in this tariff!








The bill of lading serves as a receipt for goods, issued and signed by the carrier. It has long been customary for shippers to prepare the B/L in order to save time in preparing the document, ensure the accuracy of information, and comply with the increasing complexity of product descriptions and regulatory requirements imposed by federal, state, and local governments.








Also, the bill of lading is a contract of carriage between shipper and carrier. It is a contract separate from any other contract. If you use the B/L form, or if it is referenced in a transportation contract or agreement, such contract must clearly state whether its terms and








* The Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994 (TIRRA) provides that: "a motor carrier of property, the application of whose rates is determined or governed by a tariff on file with the [Interstate Commerce]Commission cannot collect its rates unless the carrier is a participant in those tariffs." (Section 206(b)(3), amending par. 10761 (a) of USC 49.)





 












Page 92




conditions, or those specified in the contract, apply. When shipping hazardous materials, waste products, and other regulated goods, the shipper must certify that descriptions and classifications on the B/L are correct.








Lastly, the bill of lading is evidence of title. "Ownership" of the goods is established in accordance with the freight terms negotiated between the shipper and receiver. Carriers do not own the goods entrusted to their care and custody, unless they are abandoned to them by parties to the document.








A standard bill of lading is shown in Exhibit 7-2. It may be prepared by either the depositor or the warehouse. For additional information on preparing bills of lading, see Appendix E which has the terms and conditions used by National Motor Freight Commission participants.








Bill of Lading Prepared by Depositor








When bills of lading are prepared by the depositor, they are transmitted to the warehouse by remote printer, EDI, or other means. Since most information has been shown on the depositor's bill of lading, the warehouse supplies only the following information:








Corrected carrier's name and four-digit Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) or routing if different from the name shown on the bill of lading








Date shipped (some depositors and warehouses include the clock time of shipment)








Weight of shipment: gross weight of packaged goods in the required unit of measure, net weight for bulk shipments








Gross, tare, and net weights when transportation containers (bulk truckloads, intermodal containers, and railcars) are scale-weighed








Seal number, as applicable








Legibly signed name and date of shipping personnel and carrier's driver or agent








Bill of Lading Prepared by Warehouse








When bills of lading are prepared by the warehouse, the following information must be provided in accordance with the depositor's instructions:

Depositor's order number and customer order number








Date shipped








name and address of destination








Route descriptionhighway carrier's name, railroad route, or sequence of participating carriers for international shipments








Special carrier instructionsany in-transit temperature control, delivery, stopoff, or consolidation information








On shipments that have been preloaded by the depositor, the warehouse adds the shipper's load and count (SL&C) notation. Do not accept any SL&C notation made by the carrier. Remember: the carrier's driver must verify the count of goods when signing for their receipt. Also, insert the number and abbreviation of the type of package (for bulk shipments, show 1 T/T (tank truck), 1 T/C (tank car), 1 CTR (container), etc.). The number of pieces loaded and signed for by the driver or agent must agree with the number shown on the bill of lading. On unitized (for example, shrink-wrapped pallets) loads you can show, for example, "1 pallet containing 20 cartons." Insert the product description as provided in the freight classifications, followed, if desired, by the classification item number and product or trade name. Mark with an X each line describing a hazardous material. The method and sequence of product and hazard description is mandated by HazMat regulations and must be observed.








Shipping weight: gross weight of shipment, weight of pallets shown separately; on bulk shipments, show net weight of load.








If charges are to be prepaid: In accordance with the shipping order, enter as prepaid if shipping charges are to be prepaid.








Subject to section 7: This will be completed by the warehouse upon the instructions of the depositor.








Collect on delivery: Insert the dollar amount of the value of the shipment plus the transportation charges (provided by the depositor); a check will be collected by the carrier prior to unloading. Mark the appropriate box and type, stamp, or





 












Page 95




write "COD" in letters not less than 1 inch in height in the body of the form. Some bill of lading forms have COD printed prominently on the document.








Car or vehicle number: Insert the vehicle identification number.








Customer pickup disclaimer: When shipments are picked up by customers in customer-owned trucks, a disclaimer should be placed in the body of the document, for example:








"This is a receipt only for material delivered in good order and loaded onto customer-owned vehicle for movement by customer truck. This is not a bill of lading subject to the terms and conditions stated thereon or [name the applicable classification]. All loss and/or damages incurred after delivery to customer-owned vehicle are the responsibility of the customer."








The warehouse must not release goods to a customer pickup carrier unless the carrier has been authorized by the depositor or the warehouse has confirmed with the depositor the authenticity of an unknown pickup carrier. The depositor will hold the warehouse responsible for failure to verify unknown carriers, should loss of or damage to the shipment occur.








At times, several individual orders for the same customer, each with a separate bill of lading or other shipping document, are combined into one shipment. In such a case, the warehouse can issue a master bill that lists the individual bill of lading numbers constituting the shipment.








Note: Many companies pay their freight bills using a third-party service or a bank payment plan. The Depositor will advise the warehouse when the following notation must be made on the document: "Transmit [by EDI or mail] a copy of the bill of lading together with carrier's freight to [name of bank/payment plan address]."








Distribution of Bill of Lading Forms








Document retention is determined by the depositor's legal accounting department. To establish a reliable audit trail, depositors and warehouses agree on a bill of lading distribution. For example, the original is retained by the warehouse and periodically submit-





 












Page 96




ted to the depositor; the second copy is retained by the carrier for freight billing; the memo copy is retained by the shipper for future use in claims filing; the warehouse copy is retained by the warehouse; and the customer's shipping notice is sometimes given to the driver and sometimes attached to the load. It can serve as delivery receipt and proof of delivery.








Packing List








A packing list must accompany every inbound and outbound shipment; sometimes a copy of the bill of lading serves as the packing list. The list usually describes the contents of the package in greater detail than the bill of lading. It must be placed in a prominent place on the shipping unit, preferably on the side of a unitized pallet or on the side of the last pallet facing the truck or container door. Upon opening the vehicle, receiving personnel remove the packing list and compare it to the goods as they are being unloaded.








The packing list specifies:








The number of shipping units in the shipment








The number of cartons, boxes, or packages per pallet








A detailed description of the contents of packages on the pallets








The total number of packages shipped








Production and shipping lot numbers to ensure proper storage, order picking, and shipping sequence








Additional numbers and codes








Certificate of Analysis








A certificate of analysis (C/A) will accompany shipments of bulk itemsfor instance, chemicals and chemical compounds, agricultural goods, food, and a number of bulk products sold based on a named specification. The C/A must be securely attached to the shipping papers.








Material Safety Data Sheets








The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the Department of Labor requires that "chemical manufacturers and





 












Page 97




importers shall obtain or develop a material safety data sheet for each hazardous chemical they produce or import,"* and, furthermore, that "employers shall provide employees with effective information and training on hazardous chemicals in their work area," and "[c]hemical-specific information must always be available through labels and material safety data sheets."








Warehouses are "workplaces," and therefore, warehouse operators are held responsible to comply with all regulations through a written program of information and training of all personnel. The Hazard Communication Manual, the compliance guide to the OSHA Hazard Communication Standards enables warehouse operators to establish and implement hazard communication programs for their employees in compliance with OSHA regulations.








The applicable portions of the Code of Federal Regulations are reprinted in Appendix B. An outline of Materials Safety Data Sheet Information Requirements is shown in Exhibit 7-3. OSHA has developed a nonmandatory format, OSHA Form 174, which may be ordered from your OSHA regional office listed in your local phone directory or from the OSHA Office of Information and Consumer Affairs at (202) 219-8151.








IMPORTANT: Readers must familiarize themselves with these rules and regulations. Noncompliance entails substantial fines.








Manifests and Other Shipping Documents








These must accompany the bill of lading, and copies must be retained and, where required and as agreed, periodically submitted to the depositor.








Export Shipments








Export shipments must be handled in strict accordance with the depositor's instructions. The documentation requirements depend on the country of destination and may include, in addition to the ocean

bill of lading, dock receipts, shipping instructions, delivery instructions, certificates of origin, packing lists, insurance certificates, and pro-forma, commercial, and consular invoices. The export documents must be completed accurately; the information must be identical in all respects. Any discrepancies in documents will mean the shipment could be delayed.








Shipping Control Record








The warehouse must maintain a consecutive record of shipments for control, billing, and reconciliation purposes. This record verifies the sequence in which orders were received and shipped. The shipping control record must show the shipping order, or purchase order or ''pro" (progressive) number, and the carrier name and/or routing.








Routing Instructions








Depositor-preferred carriers are listed in a master carrier roster. This list is then split into specific routing guides for each of the depositor's shipping origins, plants, warehouses, and distribution centers. Depending on the negotiated freight terms, deliveries to the warehouse can also be routed by the receiver and, correspondingly, the warehouse is supplied with routing instructions.








For highway shipments, the truck carrier's points list shows the destinations to which it makes either direct or interline deliveries (see Exhibit 7-4). In most cases, the carrier at the origin is also the carrier at the destination.








For railroad shipments, the routing has been negotiated between carrier and shipper. It must be shown on the shipping documents.








The warehouse must use depositor-selected preferred carriers. Upon receipt of a shipping order, and depending on inventory availability, the warehouse's customer service desk assigns a "ship-from" and a "ship-to" location. The carrier is assigned from the carrier roster as the preselected, primary, and/or alternate choice. When orders are transmitted by EDI, the system will have automatically assigned the preselected carrier from the carrier roster.

Exhibit 7-4. Carrier points list.



Reprinted with permission of ABF Freight System, P.O. Box 10048, Fort Smith, Ark. 72917-0048.

 












Page 103




Tip: When the warehouse routes the shipment, it must ensure that the interline and delivering carriers protect any rate discounts the depositor may have negotiated with the originating carrier.








The routing guide shows the following:








"Ship-from" originname and address of warehouse








Name of the selected primary carrier








Names of alternate carriers








Contact information: carrier EDI code, phone and fax numbers, dispatcher name








Territories, states, or regions served by the primary and alternate carriers








Volume (number of shipments) assigned for a period








Deviation from the depositor's preferred carrier list is considered noncompliance. If a preferred carrier cannot be used for any reason, warehouse personnel must notify the depositor. Upon receiving the depositor's approval, warehouse personnel must correct or change the routing description on the shipping papers and show the carrier actually used. Failure to change the name of the carrier or the routing can result in excess freight charges, for which the depositor can hold the warehouse responsible.








Unsuitable Transportation Equipment








Any transportation equipment delivered to the warehouse must be inspected by warehouse shipping personnel prior to loading to ensure its suitability. Equipment exhibiting signs of damage, leaks, protruding nails and splinters, waste, dirt, contamination, or odors must be rejected, and the rejection must be noted on the daily activity report.








Tip: Reeferi.e., temperature-controlled trailers, rail-cars, or containers are often used for food and meat shipments. Warehouse personnel must ensure that such equipment has been steam-cleaned to avoid contamina-





 












Page 104




tion and remove odors. A notice that the trailer must be steamed is usually affixed to the inside of the trailer or car.








Also, transportation equipment used for carrying hazardous materials must be properly certified. In case of doubt, consult the depositor to ensure the equipment's suitability.








Demurrage and Detention Control








Advance pickup scheduling and delivery notices, plus proper yard and dock management, should keep railroad demurrage and truck and container detention to an absolute minimum. Any receiving and shipping delays resulting from improper practices will not be paid for by the depositor.








Spills, Leaks, Breakage








In the event of an involuntary release of hazardous or nonhazardous materials, the warehouse must contact and notify the depositor immediately, before attempting to mitigate the spill or clean up and dispose of the materials.








When the depositor and warehouse have agreed to use third-party emergency-response contractors, these should be called in to control the event.








Invoicing








The warehouse must submit an original and the stipulated number of invoice copies for any services rendered during the service period. Invoices must be supported by substantiating documentationwarehouse receipts, daily activity reports, and shipping reports. For a sample invoice, see Exhibit 7-5.








A separate invoice must be submitted for storage charges, supported by the inventory report. For example, a full month's storage charge is assessed for goods received between the first and the 14th day of the month, and one-half month's storage is charged for goods

Page 107




received on the 15th day of the month and thereafter. A separate invoice is also used to bill services other than storage, including stenciling, labeling, picking and packaging, repackaging, and unitizing.








The invoice is submitted in EDI, fax, or hard copy format. When billing once a month, send the invoice no later than two days after the end of the month. When billing twice a month, send it no later than two days after the first of the month, and two days after the 15th of the month.








Note: When more than one product management group or corporate division is storing goods in the warehouse, the invoices may have to be submitted to more than one person or department. The depositor must provide all necessary addresses.








All invoices are reviewed and approved by the authorized depositor personnel before payment. The billing cycle and payment terms are a negotiated part of the warehouse agreement.








Annual Physical Inventory








Depositor Responsibilities








During the physical inventory period, all receiving and shipping operations should be suspended. The depositor advises the warehouse of the activity cutoff date. When using its own personnel to conduct the physical inventory, the depositor:








Develops a detailed physical inventory plan and procedure in cooperation with warehouse personnel. This plan includes a schedule of working hours, lunch, and rest periods. A copy of the plan is sent to the warehouse.








Notifies the warehouse, in writing, ahead of time (30 to 60 days) of the inventory cutoff date so that both parties can begin preparations.








Prepares and prints the inventory reports and stock cards for each stock item as near as possible to the physical inventory date. These inventory reports should show the book inventory amount, item code, type and size of packaging, and warehouse stock location.





 












Page 108




Obtains labels and tags for identification of and placement on goods.








Selects and trains company personnel to perform the physical tasks of counting, including what to count, how to count, how to complete the inventory reports, and how to affix labels and tags. Ideally, the depositor's office or customer service personnel work as the counters, checkers, and controllers because they are most familiar with the product names and numbers and can spot inconsistencies and discrepancies:








Gets name tags for counting personnel.








Familiarizes the counting personnel with the warehouse layout, including locations of first-aid kits, fire extinguishers, sprinklers, emergency showers, water fountains, restrooms, canteens, and vending machines; perhaps a simple map of the warehouse facilities is handed out.








Instructs counting personnel to follow all safety rules of the warehouse, such as wearing suitable work clothing, hard hats, safety glasses, and steel-tipped shoes. Safety instructions should include cautions against riding power equipment or climbing onto second or third tiers to read labels.








Instructs counting personnel to stay with the job and stay in the assigned area.








Ensures that all warehouse safety, work, and union rules are observed.








Warehouse Responsibilities








As at the depositor's facility, the warehouse should cease all shipping and receiving operations for the duration of the physical inventory activity, if possible. Delivering carriers should have been advised not to pick up or deliver during this time. Obviously, emergency shipments must be handled; special instructions should cover such an event. In addition, the warehouse:








Prepares inventory, including all activity records, for reconciliation.








Provides counting and tally sheets, electronic scanning equipment, tags, labels, markers, and other necessary supplies.





 












Page 109




Provides and assigns the necessary experienced warehouse personnel and materials handling equipment, including hand carts, lift trucks, and dollies.








Accompanies the depositor's counting personnel to move pallets, carboys, gaylords, bundles, or rolls from their location inside the racks, storage slots, and shelves so they can be readily viewed, inspected, verified, counted, recorded, and tagged or labeled. Remember, the depositor's personnel are not allowed to operate materials-handling equipment for reasons of safety as well as the depositor's and warehouse's liability exposure.








Makes sure all counted items are replaced in storage locations when released by depositor personnel.








Secures sufficient space in the aisles and staging areas to inspect, verify, count, label, and tag.








Instructs its own personnel to work with extra care because the depositor's personnel are in unfamiliar territory and not fully aware of day-to-day operating hazards.








Encourages a spirit of cooperation during this disruptive, once-a-year event.








A carefully planned physical inventory can be fun for the participants; they get away from their daily work routine, meet people they normally talk to only on the phone and, when the work is done, often cap the event with an inventory party.

Performance Standards and Audits








"Quality is conformance to requirements."Philip B. Crosby in Quality is Free








Chapter 7 outlines the depositor's performance expectations of the warehouse. This chapter measures to what degree the warehouse has met those expectations. The performance audit also bears out whether or not the depositor's selection of a warehouse was a good one.








Performance Standards








Standards can be summed up in the familiar phrase: Deliver the right goods in the fight quantity, in the right package, at the fight time, at the right cost, in good condition to the customer. But that's not enough. You have to qualify: What is right? Will the customer accept a little more or a little less? How much more or less is acceptable? What is the right time8 A.M. on the button, or is the delivery window "all morning"? If the delivery is only Tuesday through Thursday, and you delivered on Monday, you have not met the standard, even though you were one day early. In addition, you may have incurred extra cost to prepare the order overtime for Saturday work and a weekend layover for the truck driverand yet you have made a nonstandard deliveryyou have not met the requirement!








If your policy is to always answer the phone no later than the second ring, to process orders within one hour of receipt, to ship





 












Page 111




each order the same day, you have to ensure that this can be done. Do you have enough phones and enough people? Can the warehouse really ship this order the same day? The order may have to be assembled, repackaged, unitized, restenciledand the lead time you got from your customer (and, unfortunately, you accepted) was unrealistic.








Today, compliance manuals and performance audits apply the processes developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9000-9004 series of standards. As of this writing, these standards have been adopted by more than 50 countries. They are known in the United States as the ANSI/ASQC Q90-94 series and describe, in generic terms, the elements of the ISO system needed to ensure that products and services meet or exceed customer expectations. The warehouse must, therefore, confer with its customers and its transport providers on the level of expected service before it implements any quality program.








Performance standards must be:








Clearly identified. The standards for performance must be described and explained by the depositor. Each customer has different requirements; to fulfill them, a warehouse must develop a customer profile that reflects customer-specific service requirements and mutual commitments.








Achievable. Standards must be reasonable. The warehouse cannot, for instance, receive an order at 3 P.M., process it, package it, and have the trucker deliver it at 8 A.M. the next morning, 1,000 miles away.








Measurable. Keep the performance measurements simple measure only what is essential to the operation, and use only measurements that can be expressed in numbers. Measure daily activity, overs, shorts, damages, inventory discrepancies, shipping errors, and the like. Understand that quality improvements may result in a reduction in productivity as well as an increase in costs.








Consistent. Change causes confusion and errors. For example, new customer delivery times require worker and equipment reassignments, rescheduling of carriers, perhaps even relocation of and adjustments in inventory. Change the performance standards only when absolutely necessaryand only after you have reached





 












Page 112




agreement with service providers that the new standards can be successfully implemented.








Performance Measurement








Activities that produce meaningful periodic measurements against established productivity benchmarks include:








Space utilization: Space reserved, rented, or contracted versus space used








Order fulfillment: Total number of orders, month-to-monthbudget versus actual, variances, processed on-time and complete versus incomplete and partial








Order picking and assembly: Standard versus actual time, variances, and errors








Cross-docking, consolidation: Orders completed on time versus delays and extra handling








Inventory accuracy: Book inventory versus overages and shortages; out-of-stock; back orders








Total throughput: Stock keeping units (SKUs), pallets, cases, pounds handled








Transportation: Number of shipments by mode, cost per shipment, cost per unit shipped, picked up on time versus late








Loss and damage: Warehouse storage and handling, transportation damages








To ensure compliance with depositor standards, warehouse operators must provide depositors with periodic performance reports. In addition, a complete annual warehouse performance audit is recommended.








The performance audit should be scheduled ahead of time and conducted during a period of normal warehouse activity. Warehouse managers should specify the functions, procedures, processes, or criteria to be reviewed, and these should cover a distinct activity periodmonth, quarter, or year. The audit should be objectivesthat is, conducted by knowledgeable personnel. Send an auditing team made up of accountants to check inventory levels and billing records; regulatory personnel to check safety and environ-





 












Page 113




mental conditions; manufacturing personnel to check packaging, product integrity, age, condition, and obsolescence; transportation personnel to check transit damage; and warehousing personnel to check procedures. Exhibit 8-1 illustrates an audit form and rating system. The rating points shown in Exhibit 8-1 serve merely as an example; you will use your own point system based on the importance you attach to each audit item.








The audit should be concluded with a postinspection conference to discuss areas that require immediate improvement or change. There should also be a reasonable time period for the warehouse operator to correct shortcomings, and a date should be set for a follow-up audit.

Pricing of Warehouse Services, Quotations, and Contracts








Warehousing costs are developed by the warehouse operator. This chapter should help depositors understand the costing process and mechanism used. It will also assist depositors in developing the information needed by the warehouse operator to come up with a mutually acceptable price.








Pricing Factors








Warehouse costs are the product of four factors. First, they involve features unique to a specific warehouse. These include the geographic location, with consequent climate and environmental circumstances; the age of the facilities and their structural integrity, level of maintenance, and repair; the type of ownership and method of financing and amortization; any real estate taxes or local business incentives; utility and other ongoing costs; labor availability and union status; and management commitment.








Second, there are the depositor requirements, including the type of services needed and the volume and quantity of goods offered for storage.








The third factor is the goods tendered for storage. Rates and charges are dependent on the value of the goods. Thus, the depositor must disclose value as well as any unique and critical properties of the goods so that the operator can prepare a representative quotation.








The fourth factor is whether the warehouse operator chooses an aggressive or a defensive pricing approach. This decision de-





 












Page 123




pends on the state of the economy and market conditionswhether it's a buyer's or seller's market. It also depends on the nature of the competition, the present and projected level of warehouse occupancy (fill rate), and the depositor's statuswhether it is a new or a current user.








To make educated decisions, depositors should understand the cost structure of the warehouse and the pricing approach taken by its operator. For instance, when comparing warehouses, some depositors believe that a great-looking new warehouse in itself is better than an old one. However, ownership costs for an older facility may be lower; furthermore, its management may provide the same or even superior quality of service. When geographic location, safety, product stewardship, customer service performance, and management are comparable, looks should be secondary, and cost must be the selection criterion.








Activity-Based Costing








Cost accounting has been used in manufacturing to associate costs with the product as it progresses through the production process. Fixed, semivariable, and variable costs are recorded in cost centers, and are charged to the product either in full or allocated based on mathematical formulas or empirical estimates. In the dynamic logistics environment and, specifically, warehousing, it becomes essential to associate costs with activities.








The activity-based costing (ABC) concept recognizes the following:








Each process consists of a sequence of activities.








Each activity absorbs distinct and measurable amounts of resources.








Each customer order calls for the application of a sequence of activities.








The sum of activities defines the total resources employed and/or consumed by the process.








The total resources employed and/or consumed are the economic basis for service pricing.





 












Page 124




Thus, ABC enables warehouse operators to prepare representative cost and price estimates to meet their cost recovery and profit objectives. To apply the ABC concept effectively, depositors and warehouse operators must take the following steps:








Understand the process and its components.








Identify the activities that make up the process. Each service performed and each customer order employs distinct procedures that, strung together, make up the process.








Ascertain the cost elements of each activity.








Find out where these costs elements are recorded. Traditional accounting systems are rarely set up to reflect activity cost. Individual cost components are spread all over the chart of accounts; for ABC, they must be extracted and recombined.








Set up an activity-based (functional) cost statement and collect all costs relevant to the process: labor costs from time, payroll, and benefits records; equipment costs from depreciation, repair, and maintenance records; building, utility, and related costs from operating statements; supplies costs from purchasing records, and so on.








Analyze and describe each activity in detail. For instance, to unload a trailer means: walk to forklift, mount forklift, drive to trailer, enter trailer, pick up pallet, exit trailer, travel 50 feet, lift into the second tier of a storage rack, place pallet into position, extract fork-lift, lower forks, return to dock. For a packaging operation, it's: walk to forklift, mount forklift, travel to predetermined rack position, raise fork to third tier, enter and extract pallet, lower pallet to floor level, verify package identification, note on pad (scan by hand-held wand), travel to stretch-wrapping machine, position pallet, remove fork . . . and so on, for every discrete step in the activity.








Measure the time it takes to carry out each activity. This is done either by actual time measurementsecondsor by a predetermined time measurement unit (TMU) in a time and motion study and work factor analysis.








Develop the time cost for each activity phase based on the number of seconds or TMUs used.








Calculate the time cost for the complete activity (loading, unloading, picking, packing).








Add the costs of all the activities.





 












Page 125




Develop the total cost of the work sequences applicable to individual customer orders.








Industry-Wide Cost Standards








Elaborate time and motion studies have been conducted to develop standard time values (STVs), as well as TMUs for each warehouse activity and process. These values have been published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Navy, American Warehouse Association, the Warehouse Education and Research Council, the Distribution Center Management, several logistics consulting firms, and individual companies in the United States and overseas. For more on this, see the Suggested Readings and Sources at the end of this book.








Warehouse operators no longer individually calculate work processes and other costs. Today, computer software programs provide predetermined time units, cost distributions, and allocation algorithms. Warehouse management systems permit the precise calculation of time values and all other costs associated with warehouse operations.








Customer Activity Profile








Chapters 5 and 6 described the sequence of all warehousing functions. Warehouse operators analyze a depositor's projected warehousing activities to come up with a price proposal. But to do this, depositors must provide a detailed description of all planned warehousing services. The basic document is a customer activity profile, an example of which is shown in Exhibit 9-1.








Warehouse Quotation and Contract








Many warehouse transactions between depositors and warehouse operators are conducted based on the standard terms and conditions of the Warehouse Quotation and Contract. It is understood that the depositor accepts the standard terms and conditions, that the quotation prepared by the warehouse states the rates and charges for the desired warehousing services is usually good for thirty days, and

that the period of the standard agreement is for thirty days only (Exhibit 9-2). Using this standard format, the only negotiable items are usually rates and charges.








When the depositor desires to enter a long-term relationship with the operator (one year or more) and desires to negotiate terms in addition to rates and charges, the parties usually enter a contract or lease agreement. For an example of a contract, see Appendix D; for an example of a lease agreement, see Appendix E.








Guidelines for Contract Development








All such contracts and agreements should be formulated and reviewed by your corporate legal counsel or legal department. The following are some general guidelines for the development of such documents.








Purpose. Give a brief, general statement of intended facility use: storage, subassembly, minor manufacturing, distribution; define the limitations, exclusions, and prohibited use/s.








Parties. The parties to the agreement or contract give their full names, addresses, states in which they are incorporated, and addresses where necessary notification, notice, or demand must be given, and where lease or rent payments must be made.








Status of Parties. Clarify whether the lessor owns the premises or facilities or is subleasing to lessee, and whether the premises or facilities are encumbered in any way. If so, determine what exposure the lessee may have to such encumbranceyou may not want to enter the lease.








Relationship of Parties. Legal counsel should address secondary employer consequences.








Term. Commencement, duration, extensions, cancellation, and renewal dates and provisions should be specified.








Tip: Beware of ''evergreen" clauses! Should you forget the expiration date, you could commit yourselfby oversightto a "like period" following the original period!








Permits and Restrictions. Where necessary, the lessor should provide copies of applicable zoning, hazardous materials and waste

Page 130




handling, storage and hauling, food hauling, and storage permits. Consider also access and local traffic routing and noise restrictions; many warehouses are in or near residential areas.








Description of the Property. Indicate the location (address) of the premises, including buildings (height, total square footage of storage, office, storage, HazMat, subassembly, packing, filling, staging areas); perimeters and ancillary facilities (roads, trailer drop, and parking lots); fences; rail sidings, barge or vessel docks. Attach a representative drawing of the facilities.








Modifications to Premises. Installation of fixtures (racks, shelves, interior walls, overhead cranes, automated guidance systems) should be allowed only upon prior permission by the landlord. The responsibility for maintenance of installations, terms of removal of installations, and restoration of premises to prior condition at lease termination should be noted. Structural changes are generally not permitted. In the event the landlord determines that certain improvements installed by the lessee should remain for lessor's continued use, the parties would negotiate appropriate termination settlement and compensation.








Maintenance. Define the responsibilities of each party for structural components, exterior and interior walls, roofs, sprinkler, heating and cooling, air-conditioning, safety, and other systems, as well as repair and maintenance of improvements.








Signs. The agreement should establish conditions for erecting and maintaining signs.








Insurance. Delineate clearly who buys insurance for fire, weather, storm, earthquake, other casualty, or damage or loss to lessee's property. Define and assign responsibility for maintaining the premises in insurable condition. Mention the exclusion and/or prohibition of storage of goods or activities that would affect the insurance rate or insurability of premises.








Taxes. Identify responsibility for real estate and any other premises-related local, county, state and federal taxes, and inventory (personal property) taxes.








Liability. Next to cost, this is one of the most important areas to consider when contemplating a lease contract. Duties and responsibilities of the partiesin the event of loss of and damage to existing facilities (as leased), lessee-installed improvements, injury and loss of life arising out of the presence and activities of persons on-





 












Page 131




site, and accidents caused by third parties (truck and rail operations)should be very carefully delineated.








Tip: Events causing or leading to loss and damage may be detailed to include poor ground drainage, weather-related structure and sprinkler leaks, overflow from sewers, malfunctioning water, heating, cooling, gas and electrical systems, etc.








Utilities and Other Services. Responsibility for electric power, heat, gas, water, sewer, phone, security, snow removal, grounds-keeping and repair, paving, parking, and truck trailer and container drop space should be precisely defined. In cases where parts of buildings and facilities are leased, allocation formulas for common services should be agreed upon, or, where possible, separate utility (electric, gas, water) meters installed to ensure precise cost assessment.








Cost of Facilities. In "consideration" for use of a specified space (defined either as building, or square feet of area to be used), lessor agrees to pay a negotiated monthly fee, for a specified term, and agrees to make each periodic payment on a specified date.








Access by Lessor. This is usually granted by lessee "upon prior notice" and "during normal business hours."








Assignment. This almost always requires the concurrence of the lessor; it should be spelled out.








Compliance with Laws and Regulations. It is implied that the parties to a lease will comply with local, state, and federal laws, rules, and regulations. Many legal experts feel that a clause reminding each party of its compliance responsibilities, although perhaps redundant, should be included in a contract.








Signatures. Only personnel empowered to bind their company to the significant responsibilities, major expenses, obligations, and exposure should appear on these documents. Some managers are impressed by their power to sign agreements. Remember that your signature can entail corporate as well as personal liabilities.

Bar Coding and Electronic Data Interchange








Applications of bar coding and electronic data interchange (EDI) are everywhere. In department and retail stores, on supermarket shelves, in video rental shops, in auto parts and repair shops, every Â· item displays the little rectangle with black linesthe universal product code, or UPC. Checkout counters everywhere scan customers' purchases (and discount coupons); UPS and FedEx package labels are read by bar code scanners. Even some toll roads have installed automatic toll booths that read a bar code on a car's windshield.








Meanwhile, behind the scenes, paperless transactions are taking place between manufacturers and distributors, between buyers and sellers, and in all manner of service businesses. The future is bright for even more types of electronic data exchange.








The Universal Product Code








The UPC is an internationally recognized system of unique numbers (to be read by people) and bar codes (to be read by machines). Initiated by the grocery industry in the early 1970s, it is used by virtually all manufacturing and service companies, especially logistics industries, the U.S. government, and the military.








This automated UPC system generates a wealth of instant data supporting marketing decisions. It improves the inventory management process, and provides real-time information on inventory





 












Page 133




status. In addition, it can initiate replenishment orders at the point of sale or point of use. The UPC system speeds up the supply-chain transaction cycle and decreases response time. It reduces recording errors to 2 to 3 per million, and eliminates manual and keyboard data entry. In short, it improves worker and facility productivity and utilization. In the United States, "the uniform code council [UCC] administers the assignment of all UPC manufacturer identification numbers to preserve the uniqueness of each individual item. The full UPC system is intended to provide readers of the codeboth people and machineswith a reliable way to make business work more effectively through accurate product identification."*








Bar codes have fundamentally changed the way producers, distributors, retailers, and warehouses manage their businesses. Planners and managers now rely on information generated at the point of activity for the efficient scheduling, deployment, and control of goods. In the warehouse, this includes:








Order transmittal and advance order notification








Receiving and label printing








Storage location assignment








Put-awaymanually, assisted by automatic identification equipment, or totally automated








Inventory updates by downloading data from portable or fixed devices to a mainframe computer








Order picking and handlingmanual or by automated equipment








Packing and order consolidation








Checking at the loading dock








Shipping and documentation








Inventory management and control, especially cycle counting








Billing








Loss and damage








Performance reporting

Available publications include the WINS standards manual Read Me First: Getting Started With the Universal Product Code, an EDI Supplier Directory, and a large selection of UPC manuals and videos.








Electronic Data Interchange








Paperless transactions are gaining acceptance through the medium of computer-to-computer electronic data interchange (EDI). Modern warehousing activity is supported by an integrated warehouse management system that applies Warehouse Information Network Standards (WINS) to the individual hardware and software technologies of automatic identification (auto ID), including:








Bar coding based on bar code symbology specifications








Bar code application standards developed by the Uniform Code Council (UCC)








Bar code scanners and other optical or magnetic recognition devices, hand held or fixed, to read bar codes and other recognizable symbols








Label printers, using laser-based ink, thermal, impact, and other techniques, to mark and label goods








Radio frequency identification and transmittal (RFID)








Electronic data interchange between compatible computer systems and software








For a brief description of the availability and application of this technology, see Exhibit 10-1. This system has been implemented by a major East Coast grocery warehouse and distribution center.

Packaging: Containers and Methods








Goods that are not shipped in bulk must be shipped in packages designed in accordance with detailed specification or performance criteria. Compliance with these criteria ensures that:








Goods do not present a hazard to other goods in storage and transport.








Goods are protected to withstand the ''normal rigors" of storage and transportation, and arrive undamaged and in usable condition at their destination.








Shippers' loss and damage claims confirm the use of approved containers.








"Normal rigors" include:








The forces of static load, compression, shock, drop, moisture and corrosion, as well as vibration, rocking, pounding, and swaying of vehicles in transit








Undesirable influences of the environment, such as moisture, dust and dirt, contamination, and other causes of deterioration








Loss, theft, and other "mysterious disappearances"








Multiple handling of goods by all types of materials-handling equipment, especially robotics, including automated trucks, conveyors, and picking, sorting, and packing machinery used to unload from transport vehicles, put into storage, move around the warehouse, pick from storage, and load on to transport vehicles





 












Page 140




Warehouse operators and shippers can select proper containers and packaging methods using either "specification" or "performance-oriented" packaging standards.








Specification Packaging








The National Motor Freight Classification (NMFC) 100* describes in great detail about 1,000 different packaging specifications to be applied to numbered items. Materials of construction and methods of fabrication, wall thickness, dimensions, weight-carrying capacity, and taping or gluing of packages are indicated. To ensure compliance with these regulations, package manufacturers are required to display a certification seal on each package or container; see Exhibit 11-1 for examples of these seals.








The specifications for numbered packages are published in the NMFC, which is applicable only to carriers that participate in it, in accordance with the provisions of the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994. When using containers and packaging complying with these standards, make sure that your preferred carriers are shown on the "List of Participating Interstate and Intrastate Carriers."








This traditional method of selecting and using specification packages is onerous to shippers. It does not provide flexibility in packaging. Furthermore, incorrect packages may or could be used; unfortunately, these packaging specifications often are neglected or not observed. The result is endless finger-pointing when failures Occur.








Performance-Oriented Packaging








Instead of prescribing detailed specifications for each item, in late 1990, the U.S. Department of Transportation adopted performance-oriented packaging standards, published in the Code of Federal Regulation 49, part 178, originally applicable to domestic and international shipments of hazardous materials. Effective June 24, 1995,

Note 3Actual Test Above Required Minimum:The test stated in this certificate must be not less than the minimum required for the gross weight and dimension limit, except as provided in Note 4 of Item 222-1, and the combined weight of facings for required bursting strength must be the minimum prescribed by Item 222, Sec. 3. When the actual test is in excess of the minimum test required, the actual test may be stated below the certificate, but in such case all classes and rules in this Classification as provided for a box having minimum test will apply.Note 4Nonconforming Boxes:In the separate description of articles when boxes not having to meet the requirements of Item 222 are authorized, such boxes are not required to be guaranteed by certification. Boxes may bear the circular certifcate only when the provisions of Item 222 have been met. Such boxes may bear a straight line stamp indicating the box manufacturer and the test of the fibreboard on a voluntary basis.Note 5Boxes of Mixed Components:For boxes having more than one fibreboard component part making up the outside shipping container, the Box Manufacturers' Certificate must reflect the lowest represented bursting test or edge crush test of any given part.Note 6Fibreboard Master Pack:The rates or classes for freight in properly certified fibreboard or special numbered packages will also apply on such freight when the boses complying with Item 222 or containers complying with special numbered Packages are enclosed in outer fibreboard boxes, the fibreboard meeting the construction requirements of Item 222. Inner boxes or special numbered packages must reasonable occupy available capacity without creating voids affecting the performance of the Master Pack. Outer box must be securely closed or fastened. No certificate is required on outer box.




Gross weight of Master Pack must not exceed 4 times the allowable gross weight authorized for the lowest burst or edge crush test of any component part of the master pack container. Gross weights exceeding this maximum weight limit must be tendered on pallets of sound construction.



(b) NUMBERED PACKAGES:(1) Numbered Packages which contain provisions specifying boxes, containers, trays and component parts thereof to be made of fibreboard complying with the burst test, puncture test or edge crush test and other requirements of Tables A and B of Section 3 of this rule, must bear a legible certificate of box manufacturer on an outside surface, in the form size (3Â½ inches Ã 2 inches, plus or minus Â¼ inch), type and wording as illustrated in either subparagraph (2) or (3). City and state may be either that of the manufacturing or corporate location.




For triplewall box and doublewall box specifications which refer to puncture test units, substitute the words 'Puncture Test Units' for 'Bursting Test Lbs. per Sq. in.' in the certificate below.








Where numbered Packages authorize different tests of fibreboard for bodies and caps, test of the body only need be shown within certificate.

the NMFTA adopted performance-based packaging standards, published in NMFC 100-V Rules, item 180; see Exhibit 11-2.








The new standards mean that a package or shipping container of any design may be used as long as it meets certain performance criteria, including drop, crush, moisture, compression, and corrosion tests. Eventually, the existing specification packaging standards will be replaced by these performance-oriented packaging standards. Warehouse operators who provide packaging services should be familiar with these new rules.








Package Testing








The members of the International Safe Transit Association (ISTA)* perform package testing. In addition, many carriers and logistics service providers offer testing services, including FedEx and UPS. Some charge a fee for testing; others offer it as part of their value-added service.








Seek expert advice from such reliable testing services. Contact the International Safe Transit Association and/or your carriers' safety and loss and damage-prevention departments for information, advice, and assistance. Especially for small shipments, testing the packages you use will reduce disputes and help eliminate loss and damage claims.

Exhibit 11-2. Performance testing of shipping containers.



ITEM 180This Rule provides an alternative to: the Test Shipment Permit program (Item 689); other packaging Rules except those relating to drums, pails and bags; and numbered Packages. It is recommended for solving chronic damage problems and for providing an acceptable assurance level of packaging for articles of great value. In order to qualify as authorized methods of packaging under this Rule, shipping containers, including palletized laods, must be preshipment tested and successfully pass the following prescribed performance teset requirements and meet the acceptance criteria as indicated.




For lack of a simulation test method, but to accommodate the use of this Rule for see-through, tightly-wo8und stretch or full-shrink plastic film wrap-style shipping units, in addition to meeting the following applicable performance requirements, spans of open space (apertures) between clearance forms on vertical sidewalls or vertical corners of packaged articles must not exceed 18 inches (0.46 m) in width when inner clearance between outer film wrap and surface of inner article is not less than 1 inch (25 mm) and total thickness of film prior to stretching is not less than 4 mils (0.01 mm). For clearances of not less than Â¾ inch (19 mm), span width must not exceed 12 inches (0.30 m).








Shippers will be required to perform the specified minimum tests as often as necessary to maintian a satisfactory performance level of the packaged article (see Certification section). Multiple test specimens are recommended when available and all specimens tested must pass.



PERFORMANCE TEST REQUIREMENTS: All applicable shipping units must be tested as follows:




Section I. Compression/Vibration Test



Two alternate methods of testing are permissible, Methods (A) or (B). Either may be utilized, depending on test capability or product characteristics. Unless the shipping container has a skid or pallet outside base, or is marked with upright arrow symbols, the container must be tested in all three planes.




Method (A)



Shipping units must be vibration tested under a stacked compressive load for one (1) hour using the procedures of ASTM D4169 Element E, assurance level II, for random vibration.




Use a concentrated dead load (see description of load following formula) to simulate miscellaneous freight loaded on top of a floor-stowed shipping unit in a trailer of 9 ft. (2.7 m) inside height, determining the amount of load from this formula:

LOAD:



The concentrated dead load shall consist of the following: RSC style corrugated container(s) of doublewall construction having a corrugated medium maximum basis weight of 33 lb. (15 kg); a plywood sheet with a minimum thickness of Â½" (13mm) resting inside the container on the complete area of the bottom inner flaps of the container; and sand contained in plastic bag(s) evenly distributed over the bottom surface of the container to complete the required calculated load (sand weighs approximately 110 lb/ft3; 50 kg/m3). The dead load container(s) must be larger than the test specimen, but must not overhang the specimen by more than 1Â½" (38mm). The dead load container(s) must be fixtured so that it cannot move inside the perimeter of the test specimen during testing. The test specimen should not be fastened to the vibration table and should be allowed some lateral movement, yet restricted so that it does not move from under the perimeterer of the dead load.

Page 147





ITEM 180ContinuedNOTE: When test units have large top surfaces, i.e., any dimension exceeding 18 inches (0.46 m), the dead load must be subdivided into smaller portions. If only one dimension exceeds 18 inches (0.46 m), the load must be divded into two (2) equal portions along the longer dimension. If both dimensions exceed 18 inches (0.46 m), the load must be divided into four (4) equal portions (See Figure #1).

TEST SPECIMEN SHOWN IN EXAMPLE MEASURES 30" X 20" X 20", LARGER THAN 18" IN BOTH LENGTH AND WIDTH, REQUIRING THAT THE DEAD LOAD BE DIVIDED INTO 4 EQUAL PARTS.








Method (B)



Shipping units must be subjected to compression and vibration in separate tests. A compression test is conducted first and then the same shipping unit is vibration tested.(1) Conduct a machine compression test (per ASTM D642) on the shipping unit, applying a force in the normal vertical shipping axis as calculated from the following formula:

(2) Using the same shipping unit, conduct a vibration test for total of 60 minutes. Any of the three following vibration methods may be used: random, ASTM D4169 Element G Level II; repetitive shock, ASTM D4169 Element F (vertical-linear motion); repetitive shock, ASTM D4169 Element F (rotary motion).NOTE: For high or unstable shipping units, random or vertical-linear tests may be preferred.




Section II. Impact/Handling Test



Following compression/vibration tests, the same shipping units must be impact/handling tested using the following procedures:




Procedure (A)



For packages having no external attached or integral pallet or skid and not in a palletized load, perform an impact/handling test as follows:(1) Under 200 pounds (91 kg) gross weight - perform a free-fall drop test in accordance with ASTM D5276, using the following height and sequence:




For Shipping Weight, lb (kg)0 through 40 (0-18)
41 through 80 (19-36)
81 through 100 (37-45)
101 through 199 (46-90)








Drop Height, in (m)24 (0.61)
18 (0.46)
12 (0.30)
10 (0.25)



Drop in sequence on these package surfaces for a total of 6 drops: top; two adjacent bottom edges; and two diagonally opposite bottom corners. The final drop must be on the bottom from a drop height at 1.5 times the specified height, where the bottom is defined as the surface upon which the package is most likely to rest during shipment (upright arrows also define the bottom for transport).NOTE: The package should be designed to withstand drops from the specified height from any drop orientation.(2) For 200 pounds (91 kg) gross weight and over - perform an incline impact or a pendulum impact test according to ASTM D880, or a horizontal impact on a test machine with short duration shock programmer (ASTM D4003), as follows:Impact the top, two adjacent sides and bottom at a final dolly minimum velocity of 5.75 feet per second (1.75 m/sec).




Alternately, the impact test may be provded by free-fall from a drop height of 6.0 inches (0.15 m) on the top, two adjacent sides and bottom.








Also conduct a rotational drop test (ASTM D1083) from a 6.0 inch (0.15m) height on a bottom corner and on a bottom edge radiating from the diagonally opposite bottom corner.








[ 3 ]








(Exhibit continued on next page)





 












Page 149





ITEM 180Continued








Procedure (B)



For individual packages with external attached or integral pallets/skids, including crates, perform impact and handling tests as follows:




(1) Based on the gross weight of the total load, perform a Raised Edge Drop Test according to ASTM D1083 as follows:








WeightUp to 500 pounds (227 kg)
500 pounds (227 kg) and over








Drop Height12 inches (0.30 m)
9 inches (0.23 m)



With one bottom handling edge of the shipping unit supported by the floor, raise the other end to prescribed height and release it to fall flat on the floor. Repeat the test by lifting and dropping opposite bottom edge of shipping unit from same height.




(2) Impact Test - Perform an incline impact test or a pendulum impact test according to ASTM D880, or a horizontal impact on a test machine with short duration shock programmer (ASTM D4003), impacting each of the four (4) sides at the final minimum velocity of 5.75 feet per second (1.75 m/sec).








Procedure (C)



For palletized loads made up of a multiple number of containers or unitized loads of a bulk configuration, perform both impact tests listed above in Procedure (B). In addition, conduct a fork truck handling test according to ASTM D1083:




Pick up shipping unit with lift truck having 36-inch-long (0.9m) forks (for longer forks, penetrate pallet only 36'' (0.9 m)); transport around test course, and set down. Repeat the moves four (4) more times for a total of five (5) moves. The test course should include at least one (1) right angle turn on a rigid flat surface representative of carrier terminals and warehouses. A nominal 2 x 4 board shall be placed on the course in a position where both lift truck wheels on one side must pass over it during each handling sequence, and a second 2 x 4 shall be placed on the course after the right angle turn in such a position that both lift truck wheels on the opposite side must pass over it duringh each handling sequence. The speed of the truck passing over the 2 x 4's and rounding the right angle turn shall be at least 2 mph (0.9 m/sec). Vertical alignment of palletized containers must be reasonable maintained throught the test.








Section III. Ambient Test Conditions



All specimens must be conditioned in an atmosphere of 73Â°F (12Â°C) minimum and 50 percent RH minimum for a minimum of 24 hours for paper-based packaging and 12 hours for all others. Testing should be conducted in the same minimum atmosphere and conditions must be recorded for each test conducted. If testing cannot be conducted in the minimum atmosphere, conduct the tests as soon after removal from the minimum atmosphere as practicable.




Section IV. Documentation



Test methods, conditions, and results must be recorded on the following form and permanently held on file for the duration the article is subject to this Rule. The name shown above the certificate (Section VI) shall be the contact for such documentation. Changes in articles or packages require subsequent testing and documentation. At a minimum, the report should include the following: (1) description of article, including model number, size, weight and other distinguishing features; (2) description of shipping unit, including specifications of container and interior packaging; (3) testing performed; (4) conditioning and test conditions; (5) acceptance criteria; (6) condition of specimens (article and packaging) after testing; and (7) laboratory performing tests.

ITEM 180Concluded








Section V. Acceptance Criteria



The shipping unit shall be deemed acceptable after performance testing if the following criteria are met:




(a) The article is neither damaged nor nonfunctional.
(b) The shipping unit has maintained its integrity and still affords reasonable protection against the normal hazards of transportation.








The acceptance criteria of article damage and nonfunctionality must be predetermined before testing and included in the report.








Section VI. Certification



(a) Packages tested in accordance with this Rule must conspicuously bear the following triangular symbol (3 inches in width at top and 3Â¾ inches in height) showing that they meet the minimum performance requirements specified. This marking is the responsibility of the shipper, ISTA (International Safe Transit Association), or any other third party identified above the symbol by name, city, and state. Testing may be conducted by the shipper or any other competent test laboratory.








(b) In the event of a damage claim, carriers may request a retest at a third party laboratory (see Note 1). Should the shipping unit fail the retest, a second retest of two shipping units may be conducted at the third party laboratory and both shipping units must pass the retest.




(c) All shipping unit configurations and article sizes and variations must be tested and new reports filed for the purpose of certification by this Rule (see Note 2). Any time a packaging or product change is made, the required performance tests must be repeated.








When minor variations are made in articles, a single test sequence may be performed for certification, provided the variations have no effect on the degree of protective packaging required. Examples of minor variations may be color differences, electrical voltage/wiring, left hand/right hand.








NOTE 1: To qualify as a third party laboratory, such facilities must register with the National Classification Committee (NCC). A list of registered third party laboratories will be made available upon request.








NOTE 2: When the shipping unit certified is a palletized load or a unitized load, the packaged products in the load are not certified as individual shipping units unless they are also successfully tested as individual packages and are so certified. Such palletized or unitized loads must show the triangular certificaiton symbol on an upper position of not less than one sidewall.

Liability, Claims, and Insurance








As earlier chapters of this book have stressed, damage to or loss of goods is costly, whether it happens in the warehouse or in transit. Such situations lead to confusion, claims, and losses. To avoid problems, learn about your responsibilities and guard your liabilities.








Warehouse Liability








The famous "reasonable and prudent man" doctrine contained in Sir William Blackstone's (1723-1780) Commentaries on the Laws of England, says that "[a person] . . . if he undertakes specially to keep the goods safely he is bound to take care of them, as a prudent man would take care of his own." From this principle evolved the present liability and responsibility standards for warehouse operators, as codified in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), Article 7, Part 2, Sections 7 to 204. They are restated in the Standard Terms and Conditions:








(1) A warehouseman is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by his failure to exercise such care in regard to them as a reasonably careful man would exercise under like circumstances but unless otherwise agreed he is not liable for damages that could not have been avoided by the exercise of such care.








(2) Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement limiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage, and setting forth a specific liability per article or item, or value per unit of weight, beyond which the warehouseman shall not be liable; pro-





 












Page 153




vided, however, that such liability may on written request of the bailor at the time of signing such storage agreement or within reasonable time after the receipt of the warehouse receipt be increased on part or all of the goods thereunder, in which event increased rates may be charged based on such increased valuation, but no such increase shall be permitted contrary to a lawful limitation of liability contained in the warehouseman's tariff, if any. No such limitation is effective with respect to the warehouseman's liability for conversion to his own use.








(3) Reasonable provision as to the time and manner of presenting claims and instituting actions based on the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt or tariff.








(4) This section does not impair or repeal . . .








Note: Insert in subsection (4) a reference to any statute that imposes a higher responsibility upon the warehouseman or invalidates contractual limitations which would be permissible under this article.








Loss and damage to depositors' goods can range from the occasional damage as result of improper handling or minor accident and mysterious disappearance as result of theft or pilferage, to total loss as result of fire, flood, roof collapse following an unusually heavy snowfall, or other natural catastrophe. Depositors, therefore, should evaluate the potential extent of such losses and their corresponding exposure.








Some of the more common causes of losses occurring in the normal course of warehousing operations are:








Overages and shortages. These are usually averaged on a dollar basis and resolved between the parties periodically. For instance, when the net balance reflects excess inventory (overage), the inventory records are adjusted, adding the excess inventory. When the net balance reflects an inventory shortage, the parties may agree to limit the operator's liability, and a loss claim will only be for an amount in excess of the set limit.








Inventory shrinkage. This is normallyand should beresolved by determining a reasonable shrinkage allowance acceptable to the depositor or owner of the goods.





 












Page 154




Consequential damages. These are the result of untimely delivery, shipment of incorrect or defective product, interruption of a customer's business, or loss of depositor's business. Such damages, when occuring in a warehouse or during transportation, are often difficult to substantiate and prove; the parties may wish to mutually limit or altogether waive liability.








Claims








The Uniform Commercial Code states that the depositor, when filing a claim against a warehouse, is required to prove that the warehouse did not perform in accordance with the standard agreement; in other words, the depositor has to prove the warehouse operator's gross neglect.








The bone of contention in many claims is the value of the goods in question. The warehouse operator'sas well as the depositor'sinsurance rates are based on the value of the goods. In addition, the rates charged by the warehouse are dependent on the value of those goods. Therefore, it is essential that the depositor disclose the value of the goods to the warehouse operator in the customer activity profile (see Exhibit 9-1), so that the operator knows what the depositor will store and can prepare a complete and representative quotation.








Insurance








Depositors should be aware of the legal consequences of increasing the warehouse operator's liability beyond that which is provided in the UCC, Section 7-204. Insurance policies contain an exclusion against losses where the warehouse operator has accepted a greater degree of care than that stipulated by law. With the assistance of their professional legal counsel and insurance carrier, the depositor must conduct a risk-benefit analysis to determine the desired and needed level of insurance.








Contracts and agreements between depositors and warehouse operators for the storage and handling of goods, therefore, must carefully address responsibility for loss and damage, overages, shortages, shrinkage (and consequential damages, as feasible). They must specify who insures the goods while in storage, and for how much.





 












Page 155




Warehouse operators typically carry the following types of insurance:








Workers' compensation, coverage A and B








General liability








Auto liability, including physical damage








Property coverage, including business interruption








Product and contents liability








Depositors must familiarize themselves with their warehouse operators' general responsibilities, as well as insurance coverage, limits, provisions, and exclusions. They should request a copy of the current insurance certificates from the operator's insurance company before goods are tendered for storage. Depositors should make sure they fully inform the warehouse operator when offering goods of extraordinary value or sensitive and hazardous materials for storage. The insurance requirements are more stringent.








No warehouse contract subject to standard terms and conditions can address all possible situations and events. Therefore, depositors often add, modify, or change the standard terms of the agreement to fit their intent, business practice, and objectives. Among the supplementary terms to a warehouse agreement are those addressing insurance, truck and container detention, rail demurrage, handling and disposition of warehouse and transportation claims, averaging of overages and shortages, shrinkage allowances, and disposition of damaged goods as well as hazardous materials.








Liability of Carriers








In his widely used work Goods in Transit, Saul Sorkin devotes well over 1,000 pages to the subject of claims, court interpretations, and decisions. The following discussion, therefore, can present only a brief summary of loss and damage claim principles, procedures, recommendations, and forms. Organizations providing information on the filing of freight claims are listed at the end of this book.








Warehouse Operator vs. Carrier Liability








The law imposes different care and custody liability standards for warehouse operators and transportation carriers. There are situa-





 












Page 156




tions when carriers must temporarily store goods in a warehouse, such as when the carrier is unable to deliver goods or the shipper or receiver has failed to pay for shipment.








The warehouse operator's liability has been outlined earlier in this chapter. The transport carrier's liability is codified in the NMFTA's Bill of Lading Terms and Conditions (see Appendix F). Section 2 specifies that when a carrier stores goods in its possession for any reason, its strict liability for loss and damage as carrier changes to the differentand less stringentterms and conditions as warehouse operator.








Carrier Responsibility








Carriers must deliver goods in the same condition as received. Like warehouse operators, carriers have possession of but do not own the goods they transport; they are virtual, not absolute, insurers of the goods. Therefore, they are responsible only for what they should have done but did not do.








Common carriers are held strictly liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading for any loss of or damage to goods while they are in the carrier's care and custody. This is the essence of the 1972 Carmack amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act. Together with the landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court defining "burden of proof" in Missouri Pacific Railroad v. Elm-ore and Stahl, the Interstate Commerce Commission* formulated the regulations, rules, practices, and procedures for the settlement of claims.








The Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994 (TIRRA) and the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA) have left the Carmack amendment intact; however, in the new, deregulated environment, carriers will attempt to reduce their statutory liabilityand thereby their cargo insurance premiumsby offering lower rates in exchange for reduced liability limits.








As a result of transportation deregulation, claims rules vary between carrier modes, and within carrier modes, they may vary from








* As of January 1, 1996, the Interstate Commerce Commission was abolished. Its remaining functions were transferred to the Surface Transportation Board at the Department of Transportation.





 












Page 157




one carrier to another. Claims rules vary especially between different railroads, so you must contact the railroads you use to obtain their specific rules. For instance, railroads do not pay claims on shipments in privately owned or leased equipmentthat is, tank and hopper cars, trailer, and container shipmentsunless this equipment has been in a derailment, accident, or otherwise mishandled.








Tip: Because much truck traffic, and the vast majority of railroad traffic, is handled under contract, it is extremely important that cargo liability and loss and damage claim provisions included in a transportation contract are written so as to pertain to the particular transportation mode.








Claim rules for other modes of transportair, water, UPS, FedEx, and other small-parcel carriersmust be obtained from individual carriers.








Contract carriers are responsible for goods in transit to the extent of the negotiated liability provisions set forth in lawful transportation contracts between shippers and carriers.








Loss and Damage Claims








Strictly speaking, the party that owns (has title to) the goods in transit must file any claims and provide sufficient documentary proof. That proof includes the count and condition of the goods as tendered to and as delivered by the carrier, and the measurethe valueof the claim. If these conditions are met, the claimant has established a prima fade case and a presumption of carrier liability, which the carrier must overcome with factual evidence.








The value of the claim is based on two principles: (1) carriers must make whole the owner of the goods; and (2) the owner must mitigate the loss, that is, only claim the value that existed at the point of loss. Oversimplified, this means that any anticipated profit cannot be included in the claimed value.








Truck carriers then have a double burden of proof. First, they must prove that the damage is the result of the five common-law bill of lading exceptions: act of God, act or omission of the shipper, authority of law, public enemy, or inherent vice. Second, they must

show freedom from negligence. There is no contributory negligence ("I am a little at fault and you are a little at fault") in claims law pertaining to truck shipments. (An exception is with rail shipments. Proof of in-transit damage in railroad-owned cars must be provided by the owner of the goods.)








In many cases, small customers ask the shipper to file the claims regardless of freight terms; either they don't know how or it's too much trouble and they won't pay their invoice unless the shipper files and settles the claim. Some customers even deduct the value of the lost or damaged goods from their invoice, before the claim is filed. Claims must be filed against the delivering carrier, regardless of how many times the goods were transferred between carriers. Under the law, the delivering carrier must process the claim and then collect from the carriers participating in the routing.








Tip: Some delivering carriers insist the claim be filed against the carrier that made an exception notation on the shipping papers. Some truck carriers may suggest that the claim be filed with the truck carrier's insurance company. Don't do it, lest you lose the claim!








Warehouses do not file or pay freight claims because, as a rule, the warehouse operator only has possession of, but does not own, the goods (does not have title). However, where freight claims handling is part of the service contract, the warehouse must handle the claims function.








Most warehouses do their own trucking. Where this is the case, the trucking operation is most likely conducted under a separate corporation, so the loss and damage claim must be filed against this trucking company.








To avoid improper claims against carriers for damage that occurred during loading, unloading, or receiving at the warehouse, careful documentation of shipping and receiving activities is crucial. Use preshipment and receiving report checklists.








Claims Filing and Disposition








All claims must be in writing and transmitted by mail or electronically. A standard claim form is recommended. If you do not have





 












Page 159




one, ask your carrier for an acceptable format or use the form included here; see Exhibit 12-1. Exception notations on shipping papers, inspection reports, railroad bad order reports, and the like are not freight claims; they are considered supporting documents.








The following supporting documents must accompany the claim form:








Original bill of lading or bond of indemnity








Original freight bill or bond of indemnity








Certified copy of the original invoice, or a statement of destination value where goods have not been invoiced








Copy of the carrier's delivery receipt showing the exception notation








Original packing slips








Carrier's or independent inspector's report








Consignee's concealed loss and damage form








Photographs








Unless the transportation contract specifies otherwise, the following time limitations must be observed in filing loss and damage claims (see also ''Notice to Claimants" and Exhibit 12-1):








Each shipment is inspected upon receipt.








Upon receipt of damaged goods, an exception notation is made on the carrier's delivery receipt or bill of lading copy.








Goods are inspected within 15 days to determine concealed damage.








Claim is filed immediately, but not later than nine months from delivery.








The carrier must acknowledge all claims within 30 days of receipt.








The carrier must either pay the claimant, decline, or explain the delay within 120 days from receipt of claim.








Every 60 days thereafter, the carrier must inform the claimant of the claim status.








Within two years after denial, and if not settled earlier, the shipper can file a lawsuit, go to arbitration, or drop the claim.








Keep a good claim file, showing the claim number, date filed, shipping document numbers, carrier name, date of acknowledg-

NOTICE TO CLAIMANTS








Claimants are requested to make use of this form for filing claims with carriers. Claims may be filed with the carrier's agent either at the point of origin or destination of shipments, or direct with the Claim Department of the carrier, and will be considered properly presented only when the information and documents called for on the other side of this form have, as far as possible, been supplied.








Before presenting a claim on account of loss and damage, the following important information respecting claims should be given careful consideration:








1. The terms under which property is accepted and transported by a carrier are stated on the bill of lading isued by the carrier; also in tariffs and classification issued or subscribed to by the carrier. Persons intending to file claims should, before doing so, examine the terms and conditions under which the property was accepted and transported.








2. Carriers and their agents are bound by the provisions of law, and any deviation therefrom by the payment and claims before the facts and measure of legal liability are established will render them as well as the claimant, liable to fines and penalties by law.








3. In order that carrier may have an opportunity to inspect goods and thereby properly verify claims, any loss or damage discovered after delivery should be reported to the agent of the delivering line, as far as possible, immediately upon delivery, or within 15 days after receipt of goods by consignee. Concealed loss and damage claims should be supported by an "Inspection Report Form" covering the joint inspection of the loss or damage by consignee and carrier's representative.








4. It is a common practice for manufacturers and others to ship large quantities to key points for warehousing and later distribution to surrounding areas. In many instances, the original container is not opened and the contents examined before re-shipment to final destination. When this practice is followed, it is impossible to determine after delivery to final destination whether loss or damage of a concealed nature occurred before or after re-shipping. Consignees can usually expedite settlement by securing initial shipper's and warehouse's cooperation in supplying necessary billing reference so that shipment can be identified in handling with carriers rendering transportation to the distribution point.








5. Under the provisions of Part II of Interstate Commerce Act, it is unlawful for a carrier to charge or demand or collect or receive, any greater or less or different compensation for the transportation of property than the rates and charges named in tariffs lawfully on file. To refund or remit in any manner or by any device, any portion of the rates and charges so specified through the payment of fraudulent, fictitious or excessive claims for loss or damage to merchandise transported is as much a violation of law as is a direct concession or departure from the published rates and charges.








In this connection, attention is also called to the following important quotation from Section 11904 of the Interstate Commerce Act [49 USC Â§11904(b)]:








A person or an officer, employee or agent of that person, that (1) knowingly offers, grants, gives, solicits, accepts, or receives a rebate, concession, or discrimination in violation of a provision of this subtitle related to motor carrier transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under subchapter II of chapter 105 of this title, or (2) by any means knowingly and willfully assists or permits another person to get transportation that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under that subchapter at less than the rate in effect for that transportation under chapter 107 of this title, shall be fined at least $200 but not more than $500 for the first violation and at least $250 but not more than $2,000 for a subsequent violation.

PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES FOR THE INVESTIGATION
AND DISPOSITION OF FREIGHT CLAIMS








(Provisions names herein are NOT applicable on interstate or foreign commerce for account of carriers referenced with "WATCAR" (except SEAU or TOTE) shown in the list of participating interstate and intrastate carriers of this Classification, or as amended.)



300122




TWO OR MORE CLAIMS PRESENTED ON SAME SHIPMENT








When investigation of a claim develops that one or more other carriers has been presented with a similar claim on the same shipment, the carrier investigating such claim will communicate with each such other carrier and, prior to any agreement entered into between or among them as to the proper disposition of such claim or claims, will notify all claimants of the receipt of conflicting or overlapping claims and will require further substantiation, on the part of each claimant of his title to the property involved or his right with respect to such claim.

REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE INSPECTION OF FREIGHT BEFORE OR AFTER DELIVERY TO CONSIGNEE AND ADJUSTMENT OF 
CLAIMS FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE








(Provisions names herein are NOT applicable on interstate or foreign commerce for account of carriers referenced with "WATCAR" (except SEAU or TOTE) shown in the list of participating interstate and intrastate carriers of this Classification, or as amended.)



300125




APPLICATION








Loss of or damage to contents of package, not definitely known to exist at time of delivery by carrier to consignee may be due to negligence in packing, handling or unpacking, or abstraction from containers, and is the subject of frequent claims and controversies. In order to avoid any discrimination, and so that practices will be certain and uniform in the treatment of claims of this character, the following rules apply.



300130




PILFERAGE








When offering a shipment for delivery, if any portion of shipment bears any indication of having been pilfered, a joint inventory of contents must be made by carrier and consignee and the results of inventory so noted on carrier's delivery receipt.



300135




REPORTING CONCEALED DAMAGE








When damage to contents of a shipping container is discovered by the consignee which could not have been determined at time of delivery it must be reported by the consignee to the delivering carrier upon discovery and a request for inspection by the carrier's representative made. Notice of loss or damage and request for inspection may be given by telephone or in person, but in either event must be confirmed in writng by mail. If more than fifteen days pass between date of delivery of shipment by carrier and date of report of loss or damage, and request for inspection by consignee, it is incumbent upon the consignee to offer reasonable evidence to the carrier's representative when inspection is made that loss or damage was not incurred by the consignee after delivery of shipment by carrier. While awaiting inspection by carrier, the consignee must hold the shipping container and its contents in the same condition they were in when damage was discovered insofar as it is possible to do so.



300140




INSPECTION BY CARRIER








Inspection by carrier will be made as promptly as possible and practicable after receipt or request by consignee. Inspection will be made within five normal work days after receipt of request from consignee, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. A day will be considered as the passing twenty four (24) hours from 9 A.M., local time from the date of receipt of request for inspection. Inspection of carrier will include examination of the damaged merchandise, the shipping container, and any other action necessary to establish all facts. If a shortage is involved, inspector will check contents of package with invoice, weight the shipping container and contents, or conduct any other type of investigation necessary to establish that a loss has occurred. In either case inspection will be limited to factual report. Consignee must cooperate with carrier in every way possible to assist in the inspection. A written record of carrier's findings will be made at least in duplicate. The original of the report will be given the consignee for claim support. Any inspection report issued must be incorporated in claim file.



300145




FAILURE TO INSPECT








In the event carrier does not make an inspection the consignee must make the inspection and record all information to the best of his ability pertinent to the cause. Consignee's inspection, in such case, will be considered as the carrier's inspection and will not jeopardize any recovery the consignee is due based on the facts contained in the report.



300150




SALVAGE RETENTION








When visible or open damage to a shipment has been established by notation having been given at time of delivery or concealed damaged established by inspection report, it is the duty of the consignee to retain damaged merchandise and shipping container until carrier desires to take possession of merchandise as salvage. If record conclusively reflects carrier liability, carrier will take possession of the damaged merchandise as soon as possible and in any event, within thirty (30) days from date shipment was noted damaged on carrier delivery receipt or from date of inspection report, if damaged was concealed. If carrier does not take possession of the damaged merchandise within the time prescribed above, consignee must contact delivering carrier and request removal of goods from his premises within fifteen (15) days from the date of such communication. The above applies only when the carrier and consignee agree that the carrier will handle disposition of the salvage, and does not in any manner affect the legal duty that the consignee, when there is substantial value in the salvage, must accept and handle it in such a manner as to mitigate the carrier's loss as much as possible. If there is doubt of carrier liability, the carrier will so advise consignee; in which event the consignee may hold the merchandise until liability of carrier is determined, or may dispose of it so as to mitigate the damage, and may file claim for such damage. Carrier will remove the damaged goods within the fifteen (15) day period or advise consignee that carrier liability is in doubt and that damaged merchandise is to be retained by the consignee until carrier has completed investigation of claim.



300155




PRIOR TRANSPORTATION








If a concealed damage inspection report covers merchandise which has had prior transportation movement, consignee is required to assist carrier in determining if shipment was opened and inspected by shipper prior to reshipment, and if not, shall then assist carrier in every way possible to establish record of prior transportation.

PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES FOR THE INVESTIGATION
AND DISPOSITION OF FREIGHT CLAIMS








(Provisions names herein are NOT applicable on interstate or foreign commerce for account of carriers referenced with "WATCAR" (except SEAU or TOTE) shown in the list of participating interstate and intrastate carriers of this Classification, or as amended.)



300100




APPLICATION








These Rules are published in compliance with the report and order of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Ex Parte No. 263, Rules, Regulations, and Practices of Regulated Carriers with Respect to the Processing of Loss and Damage Claims, served February 24, 1972.








(a) To obtain uniformity on the part of all carriers and uniform treatment of all claimants in the disposition of claims of like nature.








(b) To secure and preserve harmonious relationships in claim matters between carriers and their patrons.








(c) To effect and maintain a prompt and efficient service to the public in connection with the investigation and disposition of freight claims.



300105




FILING OF CLAIMS








(a) Claims in writing required. A claim for loss or loss or damage to baggage or for loss, damage, injury, or delay to cargo will not be voluntarily paid by a carrier unless filed in writing, as provided in subparagraph (b) below, with the receiving or delivering carrier, or carrier issuing the bill of lading, receipt, ticket, or baggage check, or carrier on whose line the alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay occurred, within the specified time limits applicable thereto and as otherwise may be required by law, the terms of the bill of lading or other contract of carriage, and all tariff provisions applicable thereto.








(b) Minimum filing requirements. A communication in writing from a claimant, filed with a proper carrier within the time limits specified in the bill of lading or contract of carriage or transportation, and (1) containing facts sufficient to identify the baggage or shipment (or shipments) of property involved, (2) asserting liability to alleged loss, damage, injury, or delay, and (3) making claim for the payment of a specified or determinable amount of money, will be considered as sufficient compliance with the provisions for filing claims embraced in the bill of lading or other contract of carriage.








(c) Bad order reports, appraisal report of damage, notations of exceptions on freight bills or other documents, inspection reports issued by carrier inspectors or inspection agencies, tracers or inspection requests do not comply with claim filing requirements.



300110




DOCUMENTS REQUIRED IN SUPPORT OF CLAIMS








(a) A written demand for payment, asserting carrier liability for alleged loss, damage, injury or delay, and containing facts sufficient to identify the shipment or shipments involved will constitute a claim, regardless of form, and will be required.








(b) When claimant does not appear from the supporting documents to be an interested party, carrier will require any necessary written assignment or other proof to determine the claimant is the proper party to receive any claim payment.








(c) Claim must be supported by either the original invoice: a photographic copy of the original invoice; an exact copy thereof, or an extract therefrom, certified by the claimant or his authorized representative to be true and correct with respect to the property involved in the claim and reflecting all trade or other discounts, allowances, or deductions of any nature. When the original invoice is not submitted, such document must be made available for inspection by carrier representative upon request.








(d) When determined by the carrier to be a necessary part of the investigation, the following will be required:








1. The original freight bill and bill of lading or other contract of carriage. When claimant cannot furnish these documents, carrier may require suitable indemnity from the claimant.








2. When the property involved in the claim has not been invoiced to the consignee or where invoice does not show price or value, or where the property has not been sold but transferred at bookkeeping values only, or where property has been shipped on consignment or approval, documentation to establish destination value in the quantity shipped and certification of the correctness thereof.








3. In order to establish the full recoverable loss caused by the carriers, the original account of sale, showing the date of sale and the amounts realized on the damaged and undamaged portions, respectively, showing grade, brands, quality, variety, size and condition, together with any deductions, allowances, and commissions, or a copy thereof certified correct over the signature of the claimant or an authorized representative thereof.








4. When shipment has received prior transportation and is reshipped from a distribution or warehousing point but has been opened and examined and contents verified as being in undamaged condition, certification thereof must be made by a person having actual knowledge of such inspection and a statement to the effect incorporated in such certification.








5. When an asserted claim for loss of an entire package or on an entire shipment cannot be otherwise authenticated upon investigation, the carrier will obtain from the consignee of the shipment involved, a certified statement in writing that the property for which the claim is filed has not been received from any source.



300115




CLAIMS FILED FOR UNCERTAIN AMOUNTS








Whenever a claim is presented against a proper carrier for an uncertain amount, such as "$100 more or less", the carrier against whom such claim is filed will determine the condition of the shipment involved at the time of delivery by it, if it was delivered, and will ascertain as nearly as possible the extent, if any, of the loss or damage for which it may be responsible. It will not, however, voluntarily pay a claim under such circumstances unless and until a formal claim in writing for a specified or determinable amount of money has been filed in accordance with the provisions of item 300105.



300120




ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISPOSITION OF CLAIMS








Carrier will acknowledge claim in writing within 30 days after receipt thereof, informing the claimant of identifying number assigned thereto, and will pay, refuse payment, or make a firm compromise offer within 120 days after receipt of claim, except, that if claim cannot be disposed of within this period, carrier will at that time and at the end of each succeeding 60 day period thereafter while claim remains pending, inform the claimant in writing of the reason for failure to conclude claim.








A separately numbered file will be established for each claim filed in accord with the provisions of this tariff. All documents, records and correspondence pertaining to such claim will be identified with this file number.

ment by carrier, follow-up dates, and final disposition. A good claim procedure and file save money.








Claim Prevention








The following suggestions may help avoid the expense and bother of filing a claim:








Ask your carrier's advice. Consult the safety or loss-prevention department of your rail, truck, ocean, or air carrier and freight-claim-prevention organizations.








Purchase only approved shipping containers and supplies from reliable sources.








Perform preshipment testing of packages and packaging methods.








Package goods only in approved and/or tested packaging.








Request trailers and railcars equipped with load restraints and air ride. Household-goods carriers operate easy-riding trailers and use lots of blankets.








Load in accordance with the carrier's loading procedures; trained drivers will tell you how to distribute a load evenly throughout the vehicle.








Observe safe and correct loading procedures; develop training courses, materials, videos, manuals.








Secure shipments with sufficient dunnage, load restraints, blocking, and bracing.








Form a claims and damage-prevention task force.

Part 2
Warehouse Receipts: Special Provisions








Section 7-201. Who May Issue a Warehouse Receipt; Storage Under Government Bond.








(1) A Warehouse Receipt may be issued by any warehouseman.








(2) Where goods including distilled spirits and agricultural commodities are stored under a statute requiring a bond against withdrawal or a license for the issuance of receipts, a receipt issued for the goods has like effect as a warehouse receipt even though issued by a person who is the owner of the goods and is not a warehouseman.








Section 7-202. Form of Warehouse Receipt; Essential Terms; Optional Terms.








(1) A warehouse receipt need not be in any particular form.








(2) Unless a warehouse receipt embodies within its written or printed terms each of the following, the warehouseman is liable for damages caused by the omission to a person injured thereby:








(a) the location of the warehouse where the goods are stored;








(b) the date of the issue of the receipt;





 












Page 173




(c) the consecutive number of the receipt;








(d) a statement whether the goods received will be delivered to the bearer, to a specified person, or to a specified person or his order;








(e) the rate of storage and handling charges, except that where goods are stored under a field warehousing arrangement a statement of this fact is sufficient on a non-negotiable receipt;








(f) a description of the goods or the packages containing them;








(g) the signature of the warehouseman, which may be made by his authorized agent;








(h) if the receipt is issued for goods of which the warehouseman is the owner, either solely or jointly or in common with others, the fact of such ownership; and








(i) a statement of the amount of advances made and liabilities incurred for which the warehouseman claims a lien or security interest (Section 7-209). If the precise amount of such advances made or of such liabilities incurred is, at the time of the issue of the receipt, unknown to the warehouseman or to his agent who issues it, a statement of the fact that advances have been made or liabilities incurred and the purpose thereof is sufficient.








(3) A warehouseman may insert in his receipt any other terms which are not contrary to the provisions of this Act and do not impair his obligation of delivery (Section 7-403) or his duty of care (Section 7-204). Any contrary provisions shall be ineffective.








Section 7-203. Liability for Non-Receipt or Misdescription.








A party or purchaser for value in good faith of a document of title other than a bill of lading relying in either case upon the description therein of the goods may recover from the issuer damages caused by the non-receipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extent that the document conspicuously indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or all of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, as where the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity or condition, or the receipt or description is qualified by "contents, condition and quality un-





 












Page 174




known," "said to contain" or the like, if such indication be true, or the party or purchaser has otherwise notice.








Section 7-204. Duty of Care; Contractual Limitation of Warehouseman's Liability.








(1) A warehouseman is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by his failure to exercise such care in regard to them as a reasonably careful man would exercise under like circumstances but unless otherwise agreed he is not liable for damages which could not have been avoided by the exercise of such care.








(2) Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement limiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage, and setting forth a specific liability per article or item, or value per unit of weight, beyond which the warehouseman shall not be liable; provided, however, that such liability may on written request of the bailor at the time of signing such storage agreement or within reasonable time after the receipt of the warehouse receipt be increased on part or all of the goods thereunder, in which event increased rates may be charged based on such increased valuation, but that no such increase shall be permitted contrary to a lawful limitation of liability contained in the warehouseman's tariff, if any. No such limitation is effective with respect to the warehouseman's liability for conversion to his own use.








(3) Reasonable provision as to the time and manner of presenting claims and instituting actions based on the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt or tariff.








(4) This section does not impair or repeal . . .
NOTE: Insert in subsection (4) a reference to any statute which imposes a higher responsibility upon the warehouseman or invalidates contractual limitations which would be permissible under this Article.





 












Page 175




Section 7-205. Title Under Warehouse Receipt Defeated in Certain Cases.








A buyer in the ordinary course of business of fungible goods sold and delivered by a warehouseman who is also in the business of buying and selling such goods takes free of any claim under a warehouse receipt even though it has been duly negotiated.








Section 7-206. Termination of Storage at Warehouseman's Option.








(1) A warehouseman may on notifying the person on whose account the goods are held and any other person known to claim an interest in the goods require payment of any charges and removal of goods from the warehouse at the termination of the period of storage fixed by the document, or, if no period is fixed, within a stated period not less than thirty days after the notification. If the goods are not removed before the date specified in the notification, the warehouseman may sell them in accordance with the provisions of the section on enforcement of a warehouseman's lien (Section 7-210).








(2) If a warehouseman in good faith believes that the goods are about to deteriorate or decline in value to less than the amount of his lien within the time prescribed in subsection (1) for notification, advertisement and sale, the warehouseman may specify in the notification any reasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and in the case the goods are not removed, may sell them at public sale held not less than one week after a single advertisement or posting.








(3) If as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouseman had no notice at the time of deposit the goods are a hazard to other property or to warehouse or to persons, the warehouseman may sell the goods at public or private sale without advertisement on reasonable notification to all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. If the warehouseman after a reasonable effort is unable to sell the goods he may dispose of them in any lawful manner and shall incur no liability by reason of such disposition.





 












Page 176




(4) The warehouseman must deliver the goods to any person entitled to them under this Article upon due demand made at any time prior to sale or other disposition under this section.








(5) The warehouseman may satisfy his lien from the proceeds of any sale or disposition under this section but must hold the balance for delivery on the demand of any person to whom he would have been bound to deliver the goods.








Section 7-207. Goods Must Be Kept Separate; Fungible Goods.








(1) Unless the warehouse receipt otherwise provides, a warehouseman must keep separate the goods covered by each receipt so as to permit at all times identification and delivery of those goods except that different lots of fungible goods may be commingled.








(2) Fungible goods so commingled are owned in common by the persons entitled thereto and the warehouseman is severally liable to each owner for that owner's share. Where because of overissue a mass of fungible goods is insufficient to meet all the receipts which warehouseman may have issued against it, the persons entitled include all holders to whom overissued receipts have been negotiated.








Section 7-208. Altered Warehouse Receipts.








Where a blank in a negotiable warehouse receipt has been filled in without authority, a purchaser for value and without notice of the want of authority may treat the insertion as authorized. Any other unauthorized alteration leaves any receipt enforceable against the issuer according to its original tenor.








Section 7-209. Lien of Warehouseman.








(1) A warehouseman has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse receipt or on the proceeds thereof in his possession for charges for storage or transportation (including demurrage and terminal charges), insurance, labor, or charges present or future in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods or reasonably incurred in





 












Page 177




their sale pursuant to law. If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for like charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the receipt that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouseman also has a lien against him for such charges and expenses whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouseman. But against a person to whom a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated a warehouseman's lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified on the receipt or if no charges are so specified then to a reasonable charge for storage of the goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.








(2) The warehouseman may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for a maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection (1), such as for money advanced and interest. Such a security interest is governed by the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).








(3) A warehouseman's lien for charges and expenses under subsection (1) or a security interest under subsection (2) is also effective against any person who so entrusted the bailor with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by him to a good faith purchaser for value would have been valid but is not effective against a person as to whom the document confers no right in the goods covered by it under Section 7-503.








(4) A warehouseman loses his lien on any goods which he voluntarily delivers or which he unjustifiably refuses to deliver.








Section 7-210. Enforcement of Warehouseman's Lien.








(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), a warehouseman's lien may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods in bloc or in parcels, at any time or place and on any terms which are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim any interest in the goods. Such notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of proposed sale and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a





 












Page 178




different method from that selected by the warehouseman is of itself not sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. If the warehouseman either sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, or if he sells at the price current in such market at the time of his sale, or if he has otherwise sold in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold, he has sold in a commercially reasonable manner. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.








(2) A warehouseman's lien on goods other than goods stored by a merchant in the course of his business may be enforced only as follows:








(a) All persons known to claim an interest in the goods must be notified.








(b) The notification must be delivered in person or sent by registered letter to the last known address of any person to be notified.








(c) The notification must include an itemized statement of the claim, a description of the goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than ten days after the receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within that time the goods will be advertised for sale by auction at a specified time and place.








(d) The sale must conform to the terms of the notification.








(e) The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to that where the goods are held or stored.








(f) After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the sale must be published once a week for two weeks consecutively in a newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held. The advertisement must include a description of the goods, the name of the person on whose account they are being held, and the time and place of the sale. The sale must take place at least fifteen days after the first publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the adver-





 












Page 179




tisement must be posted at least ten days before the sale in not less than six conspicuous places in the neighborhood of the proposed sale.








(3) Before any sale pursuant to this section any person claiming right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred under this section. In that event the goods must not be sold, but must be retained by the warehouseman subject to the terms of the receipt of this Article.








(4) The warehouseman may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section.








(5) A purchaser in good faith of the goods sold to enforce a warehouseman's lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against whom the lien was valid, despite noncompliance by the warehouseman with the requirements of this section.








(6) The warehouseman may satisfy his lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but must hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to whom he would have been bound to deliver the goods.








(7) The rights provided in this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against his debtor.








(8) Where the lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of his business the lien may be enforced in accordance with either subsection (1) or (2).








(9) The warehouseman is liable for damages caused by the failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and in case of willful violation is liable for conversion.

Bills of Lading: Special Provisions
[Omitted]








Part 4
Warehouse Receipts and Bills of Lading: General Obligations








Section 7-401. Irregularities in the Issue of Receipt or Bill or Conduct of Issuer.








The obligations imposed by this Article on an issuer apply to the document of title regardless of the fact that








(a) the document may not comply with the requirements of this Article or of any other law or regulation regarding its issue, form or content; or








(b) the issuer may have violated laws regulating the conduct of his business; or








(c) the goods covered by the document were owned by the bailee at the time the document was issued; or








(d) the person issuing the document does not come within the definition of warehouseman if it purports to be a warehouse receipt.








Section 7-402. Duplicate Receipt or Bill; Overissue.








Neither a duplicate nor any other document of title purporting to cover the goods already represented by an outstanding document of the same issuer confers any right in the goods, except as provided in the case of bills in a set, overissue of documents for fungible goods and substitutes for lost, stolen or destroyed documents. But the issuer is liable for damages caused by his overissue or failure to identify a duplicate document as such by conspicuous notation on its face.





 












Page 181




Section 7-403. Obligation of Warehouseman or Carrier to Deliver; Excuse.








(1) The bailee must deliver the goods to a person entitled under the document who complies with subsections (2) and (3), unless and to the extent that the bailee establishes any of the following:








(a) delivery of goods to a person whose receipt was rightful as against the claimant;








(b) damage or delay, loss or destruction of the goods for which the bailee is not liable [but the burden of establishing negligence in such cases is on the person entitled under the document];








NOTE: The brackets in (1)(b) indicate that State enactments may differ on this point without serious damage to the principle of Uniformity.








(c) previous sale or other disposition of the goods in lawful enforcement of a lien or on warehouseman's lawful termination of storage;








(d) the exercise by a seller of his right to stop delivery pursuant to the provisions of the Articles on Sales (Section 2-705);








(e) a diversion, reconsignment or other disposition pursuant to the provision of this Article (Section 7-303) or tariff regulating such right;








(f) release, satisfaction or any other fact affording a personal defense against the claimant;








(g) any other lawful excuse.








(2) Any person claiming goods covered by a document of title must satisfy the bailee's lien where the bailee so requests or where the bailee is prohibited by law from delivering the goods until the charges are paid.








(3) Unless the person claiming is one against whom the document confers no right under Section 7-503(1), he must surrender for cancellation or notation of partial deliveries any outstanding negotiable document covering the goods, and the bailee must cancel the document or conspicuously note the partial delivery





 












Page 182




thereon or be liable to any person to whom the document is duly negotiated.








(4) ''Person entitled under the document" means holder in the case of a negotiable document, or the person to whom delivery is to be made by the terms of or pursuant to written instructions under a non-negotiable document.








Section 7-404. No Liability for Good Faith Delivery Pursuant to Receipt or Bill.








A bailee who in good faith including observance of reasonable commercial standards has received goods and delivered or otherwise disposed of them according to the terms of the document of title or pursuant to this Article is not liable therefor. This rule applies even though the person from whom he received the goods had no authority to procure the document or to dispose of the goods and even though the person to whom he delivered the goods had no authority to receive them.








Part 5
Warehouse Receipts and Bills of Lading: Negotiation and Transfer








Section 7-501. Form of Negotiation and Requirements of "Due Negotiation."








(1) A negotiable document of title running to the order of named person is negotiated by his endorsement and delivery. After his endorsement in blank or to bearer any person can negotiate it by delivery alone.








(2)








(a) A negotiable document of title is also negotiated by delivery alone when by its original terms it runs to bearer.








(b) When a document running to the order of a named person is delivered to him the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated.





 












Page 183




(3) Negotiation of a negotiable document of title after it has been endorsed to a specified person requires endorsement by the special endorsee as well as delivery.








(4) A negotiable document of title is "duly negotiated" when it is negotiated in the manner stated in this section to a holder who purchases in good faith without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves receiving the document in settlement or payment of a money obligation.








(5) Endorsement of a non-negotiable document neither makes it negotiable nor adds to the transferee's rights.








(6) The naming in a negotiable bill of a person to be notified of the arrival of the goods does not limit the negotiability of the bill nor constitute notice to a purchaser thereof of any interest of such person in the goods.








Section 7-502. Rights Acquired by Due Negotiation.








(1) Subject to the following section and the provisions of Section 7-205 on fungible goods, a holder to whom a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated acquires thereby:








(a) title to the document;








(b) title to the goods;








(c) all rights accruing under the law of agency or estoppel, including rights to goods delivered to the bailee after the document was issued; and








(d) the direct obligation of the issuer to hold or deliver the goods according to the terms of the document free of any defense or claim by him except those arising under the terms of the document or under this Article. In the case of a delivery order the bailee's obligation accrues only upon acceptance and the obligation acquired by the holder is that the issuer and any indorser will procure the acceptance of the bailee.





 












Page 184




(2) Subject to the following section, title and rights so acquired are not defeated by any stoppage of the goods represented by the document or by surrender of such goods by the bailee, and are not impaired even though the negotiation or any prior negotiation constituted a breach of duty or even though any person has been deprived of possession of the document by misrepresentation, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft or conversion, or even though a previous sale or other transfer of the goods or document has been made to a third person.








Section 7-503. Document of Title to Goods Defeated in Certain Cases.








(1) A document of title confers no rights in goods against a person who before issuance of the document had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in them and who neither








(a) delivered or entrusted them or any document of title covering them to the bailor or his nominee with actual or apparent authority to ship, store or sell or with power to obtain delivery under this Article (Section 7-403) or with power of disposition under this Act (Sections 2-403 and 9-307) or other statute or rule of law; nor








(b) acquiesced in the procurement by the bailor or his nominee of any document of title.








(2) Title to the goods based upon an unaccepted delivery order is subject to the rights of anyone to whom a negotiable warehouse receipt or bill of lading covering the goods has been duly negotiated. Such a title may be defeated under the next section to the same extent as the rights of the issuer or a transferee from the issuer.








(3) Title to goods based upon a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subject to the rights of anyone to whom a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated; but delivery by the carrier in accordance








with Part 4 of this Article pursuant to its own bill of lading discharges the carriers' obligation to deliver.





 












Page 185




Section 7-504. Rights Acquired in the Absence of Due Negotiation; Effect of Diversion; Seller's Stoppage Delivery.








(1) A transferee of a document, whether negotiable or non-negotiable, to whom the document has been delivered but not duly negotiated, acquires the title and rights which his transferor had or had actual authority to convey.








(2) In the case of a non-negotiable document, until but not after the bailee receives notification of the transfer, the rights of the transferee may be defeated








(a) by those creditors of the transferor who could treat the sale as void under Section 2-402; or








(b) by a buyer form the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to the buyer or received notification of his rights; or








(c) as against the bailee by good faith dealings of the bailee with the transferor.








(3) A diversion or other change of shipping instructions by the consignor in a non-negotiable bill of lading which causes the bailee not to deliver to the consignee defeats the consignee's title to the goods if they have been delivered to a buyer in ordinary course of business and in any event defeats the consignee's rights against the bailee.








(4) Delivery pursuant to a non-negotiable document may be stopped by a seller under Section 2-705, and subject to the requirement of due notification there provided. A bailee honoring the seller's instructions is entitled to be indemnified by the seller against any resulting loss or expense.








Section 7-505. Endorser Not a Guarantor for Other Parties.








The endorsement of a document of title issued by a bailee does not make the endorser liable for any default by the bailee or by previous endorsers.





 












Page 186




Section 7-506. Delivery Without Endorsement: Right to Compel Endorsement.








The transferee of a negotiable document of title has a specifically enforceable right to have his transferor supply any necessary endorsement but the transfer becomes a negotiation only as of the time the indorsement is supplied.








Section 7-507. Warranties on Negotiation or Transfer of Receipt or Bill.








Where a person negotiates or transfers a document of title for value otherwise than as a mere intermediary under the next following section, then unless otherwise agreed he warrants to his immediate purchaser only in addition to any warranty made in selling the goods








(a) that the document is genuine; and








(b) that he has no knowledge of any fact which would impair its validity or worth; and








(c) that his negotiation or transfer is rightful and fully effective with respect to the title to the document and the goods it represents.








Section 7-508. Warranties of Collecting Bank as to Documents.








A collecting bank or other intermediary known to be entrusted with documents on behalf of another or with collection of a draft or other claim against delivery of documents warrants by such delivery of the documents only its own good faith and authority. This rule applies even though the intermediary has purchased or made advances against the claim or draft to be collected.








Section 7-509. Receipt or Bill: When Adequate Compliance with Commercial Contract.








The question whether a document is adequate to fulfill the obligation of a contract for sale or the conditions of a credit is governed by the Articles of Sales (Article 2) and on Letters of Credit (Article 5).





 












Page 187




Part 6
Warehouse Receipts and Bills of Lading: Miscellaneous Provisions








Section 7-601. Lost and Missing Documents.








(1) If a document has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a court may order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document and the bailee must without liability to any person comply with such order. If the document was negotiable the claimant must post security approved by the court to indemnify any person who may suffer loss as a result of non-surrender of the document. If the document was not negotiable, such security may be required at the discretion of the court. The court may also in its discretion order payment of the bailee's reasonable costs and counsel fees.








(2) A bailee who without court order delivers goods to a person claiming under a missing negotiable document is liable to any person injured thereby, and if the delivery is not in good faith becomes liable for conversion. Delivery in good faith is not conversion if made in accordance with filed classification or tariff or, where no classification or tariff is filed, if the claimant posts security with the bailee in an amount at least double the value of the goods at the time of posting to indemnify any person injured by the delivery who files a notice of claim within one year after the delivery.








Section 7-602. Attachment of Goods Covered by a Negotiable Contract.








Except where the document was originally issued upon delivery of the goods by a person who had no power to dispose of them, no lien attaches by virtue of any judicial process to goods in the possession of a bailee for which a negotiable document of title is outstanding unless the document be first surrendered to the bailee or its negotiation enjoined, and the bailee shall not be compelled to deliver the goods pursuant to process until the document is surrendered to him or impounded by the court. One who purchases the





 












Page 188




document for value without notice of the process of injunction takes free of the lien imposed by the judicial process.








Section 7-603. Conflicting Claims; Interpleader.








If more than one person claims title or possession of the goods, the bailee is excused from delivery until he has had a reasonable time to ascertain the validity of the adverse claim or to bring an action to compel all claimants to interplead and may compel such interpleader, either in defending an action for non-delivery of the goods, or by original action, whichever is appropriate.

Subpart AGeneral








SEC. 101-1.1 Purpose. (a) The purpose of this Part is to set forth minimum procedures and guidelines that should be observed in order to institute and maintain an effective seal program.





 












Page 191




(b) The provisions herein are general and each may not apply to every transportation mode.








Sec. 101-1.3 Definitions. As used in this part:








Seal means a device applied to a rail car, trailer, marine container, or air cargo container door fastening which:








(1) Indicates whether the door has been opened or the fastening tampered with, and. if so. at what point in the chain of custody the tampering occurred;








(2) Is easily applied to all types of fastenings;








(3) Readily shows when it is not properly fastened;








(4) Is of sufficient strength to resist accidental breaking;








(5) Cannot be made to appear intact when broken;








(6) Has sufficient letters to identify the carrier or shipper; and








(7) Is serially numbered to facilitate identification of the person who applied the seal.








Transportation unit means a container, piggyback trailer, or standard semi-trailer used by a motor carrier.








Subpart BDistribution ans Accountability








SEC. 101-l.11 Purpose. The purpose of this subpart is to suggest measures designed to assure that seals are strictly accounted for from receipt from the manufacturer to time of application. Resources devoted to a seal program are wasted unless this goal is achieved








SEC. 101-1.13 Ordering seals front the manufacturer. (a)(1) To simplify security control for both the company using the seals and the manufacturer, all seals should be ordered from the manufacturer by one person or office. preferably in company headquarters, regardless of the number of terminals or other locations involved.








(2) The manufacturer can send the necessary seals directly to the individual terminals, but only at the request of the person or office identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.








(b) Seals should be ordered for each terminal in such a way that the terminal responsible for a particular group of seals is readily identifiable. This can be done by assigning specific blocks of numbers to each terminal. or. more easily in most cases. by using terminal prefix numbers.








SEC. 101-1.15 Company identification. In addition to a prefix and a serial number, the name or initials of the company rising the seal or of the carrier should be stamped on each seal.








SEC. 101-1.17 Storage. (a) The purpose of storage is to prevent seals from being acquired by unauthorized persons for substitution or other illegal use.








(b) Seals should be stored in a locked room. cabinet or drawer. depending on the number of seals to be stored.








SEC. 101-1.19 Records. (a) If seals are sent from the manufacturer to a central office for further distribution to terminals. precise records. by seal serial number. should be maintained showing how many seals were sent to each location.








(b) When the terminals or other locations receive seals. either directly from the manufacturer or from company headquarters. a log should be maintained showing the lowest aerial number and highest serial number of any seal received. and the date the seals were received.








SEC. 101-1.21 Employee accountability. (a) To maintain positive accountability. each employee authorized to apply seals should be required to sign or initial for the seals he applies, by their serial numbers.








(b) The person responsible for dispensing seals at a terminal should maintain a Seal Application Log showing. for each seal. the (1) Date tile seal is applied;








(2) Number of the transportation unit to which it is applied;








(3) Name of the person to whom the seal is issued; and








(4) Name of the person applying the seal to the transportation unit, if other titan the person to whom the seal is issued.








SEC. 101-1.23 Accountability at terminals. The manager of the terminal where seals are applied should assign one person responsibility for the safekeeping. issuance. and record keeping of seals applied at that terminal. This is the most important step in an effective seal program.








Subpart CSeal Records








SEC. 101-1.31 Purpose. (a) Common sense and the particular circumstances. of each company dictate the types of records necessary. The goal of seal records is to pinpoint where in the chain of custody a transportation unit's security was breached. in order to simplify determination of where the loss occurred, who was responsible. and other in formation necessary to prevent future losses. Problem areas cannot be pinpointed unless there are adequate accountability and complete records.








(b) The purpose of tiffs subpart is to suggest. measures designed to determine:








(1) Who had custody of each seal;








(2) When, where, and to which unit each seal was applied; and








(3) When, where. and by whom each seal was broken.








SEC. 101-1.33 Seal serial numbers. (a) Record should be maintained d of the serial numbers of seals:








(1) Received at each terminal; and








(2) Issued to authorized employees for application to transportation units.








(b) In addition to being entered in seal record books. forms. and logs used by a company. seal serial numbers should also be entered on all pertinent documents (e.g., manifests. load charts or diagrams, travel orders, gate passes, bills of lading. freight bills).





 












Page 192




SEC. 101-1.35 Broken seals. When necessary to break a seal en route or at an intermediate terminal, the following minimum information should be entered on the manifest (and seal log, If used):








(a) Date and time seal was broken;








(b) Nine of person who broke seal;








(c) Reason seal was broken;








(d) Serial number of the seal replacing the broken seal (and the serial number of the broken seal, if a seal log Is used);








(e) Name of person applying the replacement seal; and








(f) Names of witness.








SEC. 101-1.37 Use of guards. Where a gate guard is used, he should check the seal serial number against the gate pass and travel order and, ideally, enter in a gate log the serial number of:








(a) Each seal;








(b) The transportation unit to which the seal Is applied; and








(c) The tractor to which a trailer is attached.








Subpart DSeal Application








SEC. 101-1.41 Time of seal application. (a) Seals should be applied:








(1) As soon as the transportation unit has been loaded, or








(2) As soon as a loaded unsealed or improperly sealed unit is detected, or








(3) After a necessary opening en route, as soon as the rein for the opening has been accomplished. A ''necessary opening en route" may be dictated by either an authorized person or an emergency situation.








(b) Application of seals should be supervised. Failure to supervise or allowing the hostler to move an unsealed transportation unit to a staging area offers opportunity to:








(1) Pilfer prior to applying the seal; or








(2) Apply a bogus seal, break the seal later, remove cargo, and then apply the legitimate seal.








SEC. 101-1.43 Authority to apply seals. (a) The manager of the terminal should authorize specific persons on each shift to apply seals at that terminal, and only those so authorized should be permitted to apply seals.








(b) The number of persons who should be authorized to apply seals depends on the particular circumstances at each terminal. The number should be kept to a minimum to facilitate adequate supervision to assure that operational expediency does not permit application of seals by unauthorized persons.








SEC. 101-1.45 Application. Locking device nuts on trailers and containers should be spot welded to prevent release of the locking handle without disturbing the seal.








SEC. 101-1.47 Final check. (a) The seal should be choked by the line haul or interline driver before the vehicle to which it is applied leaves the terminal.








(b) If there is a guard at the gate, he should ensure that the seal Is legitimate and intact before releasing the vehicle to which it is applied.








Subpart EDestination Removal








SEC. 101-1.51 Authority to remove seals. (a) The terminal manager should authorize specific persons to remove seals from inbound transportation units, and, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, only those so authorized should be permitted to remove seals.








(b) To insure before unloading that the seal removed is the original, if a hostler has to break and remove a seal on a swing-door transportation unit before spotting it at the dock, the breaking of the seal should be witnessed from the dock by an authorized person described in paragraph (a) of this section, who should physically check the serial number on the seal against the seal serial number entered on the pertinent documents. A hostler should not be permitted to break a seal prior to spotting the transportation unit to which it is applied when the breaking cannot be observed from the dock.








SEC. 101-1.53 Discrepancies. (a) A seal removed from a transportation unit should be kept with the manifest and bills until the transportation unit is stripped.








(b) If there is not a discrepancy between the manifest and the cargo the seal may be discarded; if there is a discrepancy, especially in tail-loaded freight, the seal should be sent with a report on the discrepancy to the security section.








(c) A discrepancy between the serial number on the seal and the seal serial number entered on the manifest should be reported immediately to a supervisor and a notation of the details made on the manifest and other pertinent documents.








Subpart FRoad Procedures








SEC. 101-1.61 Truck trailers. (a) Each seal should be checked prior to leaving the terminal and at each stop en route to destination, including truck stops, diners, and other service areas.








(b) If a highway unit's seal has been tampered with, the driver should immediately contact home terminal, central dispatch, or the nearest company terminal for instructions.








SEC. 101-1.63 Container and piggyback operations. (a) In a container or piggyback operation each seal should be checked at each transfer point and the serial number on each seal recorded.








(b) As used in this section, "transfer" includes:








(1) Movement of containers on and off vessels;








(2) Movement of trailers on and off flat cars: and








(3) Trailer-on-flat-car movements from one railroad to another.








SEC. 101-1.65 Rail cars. Consistent with manpower and available time. but at the very least when high value/high risk shipments are involved, each seal on a rail car should be checked at each interchange





 












Page 193




point to establish the responsibility of individual railroads for losses that occur.








Subpart GShipper's Load and Count (SL&C)








SEC. 101-1.71 General. It is to the advantage of carriers in every mode to insure the security of Shipper's Load and Count Seals. This could be accomplished by use of "seal locks", offering both physical and liability protection, or, at a minimum, strong wire or cable in addition to a normal seal. This precaution increases the time and effort necessary to break into a rail car, container, or trailer. with concomitant protection to a carrier against errors in count by shipper and/or consignee.








SEC. 101-1.73 Application. (a) The Shipper's Load and Count Seal should be applied at the shipper's premises by the shipper's representative.








(b) The seal serial number should be recorded on all copies of the bill of lading and transcribed to the waybill.








SEC. 101-1.75 Removal for inspection. When a Shipper's Load and Count Seal is removed to inspect the load, the following minimum information should be entered in the bill of lading and freight bills;








(a) Date seal was removed;








(b) Name of person who broke the original seal and applied the new seal;








(c) Reason the seal was broken;








(d) Serial number of the seal which replaced the broken seal; and








(e) Location where seal was broken.








SEC. 101-1.77 Destination procedure. At destination, whether interline or consignee, the person receiving a trailer or rail car sealed with a Shipper's Load and Count Seal should examine the seal and record its serial number above his signature on the delivery receipt and/or interchange agreement.








SEC. 101-1.79 Responsibility of the driver. (a) A driver should not break a Shipper's Load and Count (SL&C) Seal under any circumstances unless he is so directed by the consignee or his representative and the person so directing witnesses the breaking of the seal.








(b) If the consignee or his representative directs a driver to break an SL&C seal:








(1) The consignee or his representative should examine the broken seal; and








(2) The consignee or his representative, or if necessary, the driver, should record the seal serial number on the delivery receipt.








Subpart HU.S. Government and "In Bond" Seals








SEC. 101-1.81 General Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, neither a U.S. Government seal nor any "in bond" seal applied under U.S. Customs supervision should be broken without adhering to the rules and regulations pertaining thereto.

AUTHORITY: Sec. 9(e)(1), 80 Stat. 944 (49 U.S.C. 1657(e)(1)); 49 CFR 101.3.








Subpart AGeneral








SEC. 101-2.1 Purpose. (a) The purpose of this part is to set forth minimum procedures and guidelines that should be observed in order to minimize the risk of loss of high-value cargo.








(b) The provisions herein are general and each may not apply to every transportation mode.








SEC. 101-2.3 Definitions. As used in this part:








Custodian means a person having direct day-to-day control of a security crib, including custody of and responsibility for the contents thereof.








High-value cargo means cargo handled at a facility, which cargo. because of its monetary value. utility, desirability, or history of frequent theft, requires greater protection than other commodities normally handled at the facility.








Security crib means an enclosure for tem-





 












Page 194




porary storage of high-value cargo; also referred to as cage, corral, vault, or lockup.








Subpart BLocation of Security Crib








SEC. 101-2.11 Location. (a) A security crib should be located in the vicinity of and, ideally, within sight of, the terminal or dock office. It should not be located in a remote area of the facility.








(b) The location should be conducive to frequent, if not continuous, surveillance by supervisory personnel.








(c) Large facilities may require two security cribs, one at each end, provided there is opportunity for reasonable surveillance of both security cribs.








SEC. 101-2.13 Separation from over, short, and damaged crib. A security crib should be separate from an over, short, and damaged crib. Over and damaged freight should not be stored in a security crib unless it is of high value.








SEC. 101-2.15 Small facilities. (a) In a small facility space limitations may prevent the use of a security crib. In such an instance high value cargo should be stored in an area specifically designated and reserved for this purpose.








(b) The area described in paragraph (a) of this section should be:








(1) Clearly marked;








(2) Made off-limits to unauthorized personnel;








(3) Within sight of the dock office; and








(4) Capable of constant supervisory observation.








Subpart CConstruction of Security Crib








SEC. 101-2.21 Materials. A security crib should be constructed of substantial materials which make the crib resistant to forced entry on all sides, underneath, and overhead.








SEC. 101-2.23 Size. (a) A security crib should be of a size adequate for storage of all high-value cargo present at the facility at any time. It should not be so large, however, as to encroach upon space necessary for normal operations, thereby resulting in the use of security crib space for other than high-value cargo.








(b) The walls of a security crib should extend to the ceiling of the room in which it is located or be at least 10 feet high with a substantial top or roof resistant to forced entry.








(c) When a shipment of high-value cargo is too large to be stored entirely within a security crib, it should be:








(1) Segregated from other cargo;








(2) Stored within sight of supervisory personnel; and








(3) Physically inspected at least daily by a supervisor for indication of theft or pilfer-age.








SEC. 101-2.25 Visual observation. Construction should permit visual observation of the entire security crib from the outside to deter unauthorized entry and covert tampering with the high-value cargo therein.








SEC. 101-2.27 Portable security crib. In the event that use of a portable security crib is necessary, its sides should be securely fastened to the ground to prevent entry underneath by raising of the security crib with a forklift, jack, or other lift equipment.








Subpart DAccess and Control








SEC. 101-2.31 Custodian. (a) When size of an operation or volume of high-value cargo requires extensive use of a security crib, a custodian should be designated as the one person directly responsible for control of the security crib. At all times access to the security crib should be under the direct control of the custodian and should be limited to those persons having legitimate business in the security crib.








(b) If the size or nature of the particular operation does not warrant the designation of a custodian, supervisory or other predesignated responsible personnel should be authorized to conduct necessary business at the security crib so long as access is properly documented.








SEC. 101-2.33 Entrance in absence of custodian. (a) Where the volume of business conducted at a security crib is substantial and a custodian has been designated, any additional duties assigned to the custodian should be limited to minimize the necessity to enter a security crib in his absence.








(b) If entrance to a security crib in the absence of the custodian is unavoidable, the entrance should be:








(1) Conducted in the presence of supervisory personnel;








(2) Subsequently reported to the custodian; and








(3) Entered on appropriate records.








Subpart EAccountability








SEC. 101-2.41 Control log. (a) A control log should be maintained at a security crib, listing all cargo transferred into and out of the security crib.








(b) The log should contain information sufficient to identify positively:








(1) The cargo transferred;








(2) The time of the transfer; and








(3) The identity of the persons involved in the transfer.








(c) Every transfer should be observed by a supervisor or other predesignated responsible person. or the custodian if one has been designated, and entered in the log.








SEC. 101-2.43 Physical inventory. (a) Consistent with the size of the security crib and the amount of cargo stored therein, a physical inventory of all freight in the security crib should be made periodically. Comparison should then be made with the log described in Â§ 101-2.41 of the part or with a running inventory.








(b) The interval between inventories should not exceed 30 days. Cleared inventory records should remain on file.





 












Page 195




SEC. 101-2.45 Theft or pilferage. Whenever there is evidence of theft or pilferage from the security crib an immediate and thorough investigation should be conducted. Proper records will indicate when a loss occurred and the persons involved.








SEC. 101-2.47 Discrepancies. A security crib should be inspected daily by the facility manager or his representative with discrepancies investigated immediately and errors in procedures brought to the attention of supervisors concerned as quickly as possible.








SEC. 101-2.49 Completed logs. Completed logs should be kept in a secure place for at least one year or such other period of time as the company feels they may be needed for investigation of claims.








Subpart FSecurity








SEC. 101-2.51 Lock. (a) A security crib should be securely locked when unattended.








(b) The lock should be changed:








(1) Periodically to minimize the effect of unauthorized duplication of the key; and








(2) Immediately whenever a key to the lock Is miming or otherwise unaccounted for.








(c) Serial numbers should be removed from the lock and all keys.








SEC. 101-2.53 Keys. (a) Keys to the lock on a security crib should be kept by authorized supervisory or other predesignated responsible personnel, or the custodian if one has been designated, and be placed in a locked key box or other secure place at the close of business.








(b) To preclude surreptitious duplication, keys should never leave the facility nor be given, even temporarily, to unauthorized persons.








(c) The number of duplicate keys should be kept to a minimum, and duplicate keys should be accorded the nine protection as the original keys.








SEC. 101-2.55 Surrounding area. Floor space immediately adjacent to a security crib should be kept clear of stocked cargo which can reduce visibility.








SEC. 101-2.57 Electronic surveillance. Depending upon the value of cargo stored in a security crib. the number of transfers thereto and from. and other variables, continuous electronic surveillance of a security crib may be advisable. In such a case, a responsible person or persons should be assigned responsibility of monitoring the television receivers. The versatility of closed circuit television combined with a video tape recorder is ideal for electronic surveillance of a security crib when continuous monitoring of the television receivers is not possible. If tapes are used, they should be reviewed periodically to determine whether unauthorized entry occurs.








SEC. 101-2.59 Procedures in lieu of a security crib. The size of an operation. the geographic area in which a facility is located, and the prior loss record may indicate that a security crib is not needed at a particular facility. Special procedures for controlling high-value cargo should still be used and may include:








(a) Storage in a special area;








(b) Storage in the over, short, and damaged crib;








(c) Daily inventories; and








(d) Continuous surveillance.








SEC. 101-2.61 Protective lighting. To enhance visual surveillance of and to deter the theft of items from security cribs, adequate lighting should be provided within and without the crib. Such lighting should be sufficient to permit detection and later identification of intruders by electronic surveillance or by security guards.

SEC. 101-3.13 General. Shippers should:








(a) Number all shipping containers in a shipment and record such numbers on the shipping documents. In addition, each container in a shipment of more than one container should be marked thusly: One of four, two of four, etc.








(b) Place clear and complete delivery and handling instructions on one end, one side, and the top of each shipping container.








(c) In marking shipping containers. use indelible inks and paints and water-resistant labels to preclude phiiteration or loss of marks, shipping instructions, and handling symbols.








(d) Forward all shipping documents promptly to minimize delay at domestic and international transfer points.








(e) Count the number of pieces in each shipment and retain a record of the count and condition of the pieces and of the legible signature and employee number of the employee making the count.








(f) When practical, enclose a packing list in each container in a shipment to permit timely and complete investigation of any pilferage or damage.





 












Page 197




(g) Consolidate small or non-uniform containers into single-load units. Unitize, palletize, and use intermodal containers whenever possible. Pilfer-proof sealing tape, corrugated fasteners, string wrapping. strapping. and banding reduce theft and pilferage.








(h) Require carrier personnel to verify their identity and restrict them to authorized areas. For each shipment. record the names of the driver and carrier, vehicle number. name of consignee, and number of pieces and total weight of the shipment.








(i) Before releasing a shipment to a carrier obtain in ink or indelible pencil the of the driver verifying receipt of the freight listed on the manifest.








(j) File in tamper- and theft-proof repository all copies of bills of lading, dock receipts, airbills, waybills, manifests and other documents. Generally, documents should be kept for one year; bills of lading should be kept for three years.








(k) Refrain from preprinting well-known trade names. or stenciling information about contents, on shipping cartons.








(l) If secondhand containers are used. obliterate all previous markings.








Subpart CCarrier Cargo Accountability and Procedures








SEC. 101-3.21 Equipment controls. At facilities at which cargo is handled, there should be established and maintained controls on the use on docks and platforms of all handling and moving equipment such as handcarts, forklifts, etc.








SEC. 101-3.23 Outbound freight procedures: Pickup. (a)(1) When a pickup call is received. a pickup order or slip for the pickup driver should be prepared.








(2) The pickup order should Include the date and time of call, the names of the shipper and the consignee, the number of pieces and total weight of the shipment, and the name of the driver.








(b) When the pickup driver arrives at the shipper's facility, he should note the condition of the shipment, count the pieces therein, and compare the count with that shown on the bill of lading. He should then record the date, the number of pieces, and his truck number on the pickup order and the bill .of lading and sign his name legibly in ink or indelible pencil.








(c) Upon return to the carrier's terminal, the pickup driver should report to the cashier and surrender all documents and receipts. At this time all documents and receipts should be checked for completeness and accuracy.








(d)(1) The cashier should forward the bills of lading and pickup orders to the manifest clerk who prepares the dock manifest showing the names of the driver, the shipper, and the consignee, the unit number, date, and number of pieces and total weight of the shipment. A copy of the bill of lading should be forwarded to the billing office where the invoice is prepared, the bill of lading is retained. and the line haul manifest is prepared.








(2) Control copies of all bills of lading and other documents used at the terminal should be retained.








(3) Documents for high-value cargo should be specially designated, as by a stamp such as "Supervisor sign". Such cargo itself should be handled in accordance with part 101-2 of this appendix, "High-Value Commodity Storage".








SEC. 101-3.25 Outbound freight procedures: Stripping and loading. (a) At the carrier's terminal. a separate area should be designated for each of the following types of cargo; outbound. inbound. hold-on-dock. order notify. and OS&D (over. short and damaged).








(b) Upon receiving a dock manifest. a supervisor should code the manifest as to door and unit number and assign a dockman to the particular manifest. Bay doors and equipment should be clearly and properly marked.








(c) The dockman should work from the dock manifest. He should strip the unit and, if freight is docked, note its location on the bill of lading and forward the bill to the office. Bills of lading should not be left with docked freight. If high-value commodities are docked, they should be placed in a security crib pending delivery or transfer in accordance with part 101-2 of this appendix, "High-Value Commodity Storage."








(d) If freight is loaded the dockman should note on the manifest, in ink or indelible pencil, the number of the outbound trailer, dock number, number of pieces and total weight of the shipment. date, origin number, and his legible signature, and return the manifest to the supervisor.








(e) Exceptions should be brought to the attention of the O. S. & D. clerk and the supervisor immediately. Drivers should be questioned about exceptions as soon as practical. Any trends should be noted, recorded, and acted upon.








(f) The supervisor should compare the manifest with the typed bills of lading, record the line haul unit number on the bills, and sort the bills by destination terminal and line haul unit. Matching bills with freight maintains the audit trail and obviates having bills for which there Is no freight and freight for which there are no bills.








(g) The line haul unit should then be closed by a switcher or supervisor. Whoever Is authorized to apply seals should then seal the unit and record on the seal log, in ink or indelible pencil, the seal serial number and his legible signature.








(h) The outbound manifest and typed bills by unit should be put together and seal serial numbers recorded in the office by a supervisor.








(f) The outbound manifest and bills of lading should be given to the line haul driver and the unit and seal serial numbers should be checked at the gate upon depar-





 












Page 198




ture Both verbally and in writing, the driver should be given instructions regarding handling of any high-value, sensitive, or hazardous cargo.








SEC. 101-3.27 Return freight. (a) Procedures should be established requiring that all returned high-value cargo and other selected commodities be stripped and the appropriate bills of lading returned to the office. Common sense should dictate the handling of bulk cargo.








(b) Return freight and its paperwork should be reinserted into the cargo handling process as soon as possible. The driver's legible signature, the location of the return freight on the dock, and the reason for its return should become permanent records of the carrier. A substantial part of claims paid is attributable to improper handling of return freight.








SEC. 101-3.29 Inbound freight procedures: stripping and loading. (a) When the line haul unit arrives at the destination terminal, the unit number and seal serial number should be checked at the gate and recorded. The driver should take the inbound manifest and bills of lading to the office where the bills should be routed to the delivery unit by door number. One control copy of the manifest and of each bill should be kept in the office.








(b) Only authorized personnel should remove a seal from an inbound trailer. If a hostler has to break and remove a seal on a swing-door trailer before spotting it at the dock, the breaking of the seal should be witnessed from the dock by an authorized person who should check the serial number on the seal against the seal serial number entered on pertinent documents, in accordance with part 101-1 of this appendix, "Seal Accountability and Procedures."








(c) The Inbound Supervisor should record on the line haul dispatch sheet the date, arrival time, and unit number. He should also check the number of bills against the manifest and record the date and unit number on each bill.








(d) When the dockman receives the bills he should begin to strip and load. If freight is docked, he should record on the appropriate bill, in ink or indelible pencil. the location of the freight on the dock. his legible signature, and dock number. If high-value commodities are docked, they should be placed in a security crib in accordance with the provisions of part 101-2 of this appendix, "High-Value Commodity Storage" If the freight is loaded, the dockman should record on each bill, in ink or indelible pencil, the unit number and his legible signature before returning the bills to the supervisor.








SEC. 101-3.31 Inbound freight procedures: Delivery. (a) The supervisor should match the bills of lading signed and returned by the dockman with the control copies and verify the signature of the dockman. He should then prepare the city manifest and put it into the unit "pigeon hole", pouch, or file.








(b) The assigned driver should receive the city manifest and bills from dispatch. He should note and place in the driver pouch the delivery receipt, consignee memo, driver work card, tally sheet, and detention slip.








(c) Upon leaving the terminal, the driver should be checked at the gate for seal or lock, as appropriate. Unit number, time, and date should be recorded.








(d) Upon return to terminal, the city driver should turn in to the cashier the receipts, bills, and city manifests.








Subpart DExceptions








SEC. 101-3.41 LTL freight. LTL (Less Than Truck Load) freight should be counted and checked for visible damage at each step of the cargo handling process. This should begin at pickup where the carrier's liability attaches with the driver's signature. This should continue as the freight moves through the carrier's operation and should terminate only when the consignee accepts delivery with a clear receipt.








SEC. 101-3.43 Deckman responsibilities. The dockman who strips the pickup unit. the one who loads the line haul unit, the one who unloads the line haul unit, and the one who loads the delivery unit each should sign for the count and apparent physical condition of each shipment that he handles,








SEC. 101-3.45 Driver responsibility. Drivers should call in any exceptions immediately and a call-in log should be maintained.








SEC. 101-3.47 Supervisor responsibility. Exceptions should be immediately reported to a supervisor who should attempt to resolve them immediately. Exceptions which should be reported to supervisors include not only those of count and damage but also those of instances of bills of lading for which there is no freight and freight for which there are no bills.








Subpart EInterchange








SEC. 101-3.51 General. A substantial part of cargo is interchanged between carriers, often in the same mode. Cargo moving by water or air often must be handled at terminals and/or over piers, where cargo moves from railroad or truck to forwarder or stevedoring company and then to aircraft or vessel. At the terminus of the movement, the process is reversed. These transfer points are the most vulnerable places for loss of cargo. The same type of accountability procedures apply equally well to export, import, and domestic cargo.








SEC. 101-3.53 Air cargo. (a) Air carriers should count the number of shipping containers and their condition when receiving or delivering cargo. Cargo going from terminal to ramp via cart should be counted as it enters the belly of the aircraft. At destination, it should again be counted as it comes out of the aircraft prior to arrival at the terminal.





 












Page 199




(b) The carrier should manifest all shipments for delivery on a trucking manifest. The manifest should show:








(1) Names of drivers and the motor carrier and truck number.








(2) Name of air carrier employee checking cargo into truck.








(3) Date and station preparing manifest.








(4) Names of shipper and consignee. air bill number, number of pieces and total weight of shipment.








(5) Any exceptions and name of agent preparing manifest.








(6) Legible signature of the truck driver. in ink or indelible pencil, verifying receipt of cargo as shown on manifest.








SEC. 101-3.55 Marine cargo. (a) Stevedoring companies or terminal operators should keep a tally of cargo as it is off-loaded from the vessel to the terminal and provide tally and O. S. & D. reports to the water carrier or his agent.








(b) Marine checkers should be assigned to count pieces. verify count and legibly sign appropriate documents in ink or indelible pencil. The original dock receipt should be retained as a permanent record.








(c) Cargo should not remain in terminals overly long. Delay in sorting, depalletizing. vanning. or devanning contributes to theft and pilferage.








(d) Longshoremen should be supervised and cargo checked when loaded from terminals. Marine checkers should be present to count and verify and obtain legible signatures. during loading and tie-down on truck or railcars.








SEC. 101-3.57 Interchange: truck and rail or vessel and rail. Interchange between truck and rail or vessel and rail generally involves movement into a terminal and then to a railcar. Accountability is generally assumed by the party responsible for the loading. counting. and sealing per tariffs duly filed with the Federal Maritime Commission or the Interstate Commerce Commission. The rail carrier checks the seal and as long as the seal remains intact assumes no liability for shortages discovered at destination. In a situation of Shipper Load and Count. if seals remain intact. the shipper assumes liability for shortage.








Subpart FContainers, Palletizing, and Unitizing








SEC. 101-3.61 Intermodal containers. (a) Intermodal containers. adaptable to carriage by truck, railcar, barge. and ocean-going vessel, reduce vulnerability to pilfer-age and theft and eliminate multiple handling of individual items of cargo. A shipper can use such containers to convey goods directly from his premises to his customers.








(b) Reduced handling requirements simplify accountability for shipper, carrier. and consignee. Shippers assume responsibility for accuracy of the count; so long as containers remain sealed and intact. carriers are not liable for shortages.








(c) Verification and recording of seal serial numbers in accordance with company procedures (see part 101-1 of this appendix. "Seal Accountability and Procedures") assures accountability in the chain of custody.








SEC. 101-3.63 Air cargo containers. Air cargo containers designed specifically for the configuration of aircraft offer the same advantages as intermodal containers. They provide for more efficient use of the capacity of the aircraft, reduce the number of pieces that must be counted and handled. and minimize exposure to weather. theft. pilferage. and damage, thereby simplifying accountability.








Subpart GConsignee Cargo Accountability and Procedures








SEC. 101-3.71 General Delay in taking delivery or cargo increases the possiblity of theft and pilferage and makes recovery of lost shipments and pieces more difficult Since pilferage from shipping containers can sometimes escape detection at time of delivery, consignees should:








(a) Inspect shipping containers for signs of break-in. opening. crushing, and resealing. Shipping containers should be inventor-led in the presence of a carrier employee.








(b) Weigh shipping containers and compare the weights with those recorded on pertinent documents.








(c) Note on the carrier's receipt the number of pieces in each shipping container as well as their condition.








(d) Obtain, in ink or indelible pencil, the legible signature of the driver on consignee's copy of the receipt.








(e) Inspect cargo as soon after receipt as practical to determine any loss or damage, regardless of the apparent condition of the cargo at time of delivery, and report any exceptions.








(f) Obtain a copy of the carrier's delivery receipt and file it with copies of the other documents concerning the cargo.








(g) Retain as a permanent record the legible signature, in ink or indelible pencil. piece count, and condition verification of the employee accepting the cargo.








(h) Retain all essential documents for at least one year;, bills of lading should be retained for three years.








Subpart H"In Bond" Cargo








SEC. 101-3,81 General. Special care should be taken with "in bond" cargo handled under Customs supervision. United States Customs inspectors count, to the greatest extent possible. merchandise landed and quantities delivered. They also verify selected bills of lading at time of unloading. Ordinarily they do not use tally sheets, O. S. & D. (over. short, and dam-

Subpart AGeneral








Sec. 101-4.1 Purpose. (a) The purpose of this part is to set forth minimum procedures and guidelines that should be observed in establishing a cargo loss reporting system.








(b) The provisions herein are general and each may not apply to every transportation mode. Adaptation may be necessary to suit mode pecularities and individual carrier needs.








Sec. 101-4.3 General. The movement of cargo by carrier involves an inherent risk of loss from theft and other pauses due mainly to its exposure in the transportation system. Thus, the transportation carrier with this inherent characteristic should establish a cargo loss reporting system which will provide information, safeguards, and practices to protect the cargo entrusted to him by the shipping public. The need for timely, accurate and definitive cargo loss information is essential to a successful cargo claims prevention program. Early identification of the cause of cargo losses through theft. hijack, pilferage, or other reasons is an essential step to prevention and cure.








Sec. 101-4.5 Definitions. As used in this part:








Bill of lading means the document by which a carrier acknowledges receipt of freight and contracts for its carriage. Also known u ocean bill of lading and air bill of lading.








Carrier means a common or contract carrier, but does not mean a private carrier.








C.O.D. means collect on delivery for invoice value of the goods.








Connecting line means another carrier with whom the original carrier interlines a shipment for thru movement from origin to destination. Also known as interline.








Consignee means the designated receiver of merchandise.








Consignor means the shipper of merchandise.








Damage means impairment of cargo shipment or contents.








Destination terminal means the terminal from which carrier makes final delivery. Also known as destination port.








Exception means a deviation from the condition or quantity as shipped.








Forced billing means an internal document used by carriers to cover movement of a shipment from one terminal to another. when there is no way bill to cover, and is also used as a delivery receipt until the proper paperwork is found or prepared.








Free astray means a form used by carriers to cover movement of an over-shipment from one terminal to another until it can be matched up with paperwork or other disposition made.








Hijack means stealing a cargo vehicle by force or threat of bodily harm.








High-value cargo means cargo handled at a facility, which because of its monetary value. utility, desirability, or history of frequent theft, requires greater protection than other commodities normally handled at the facility.








Intermediate terminal means a location through which a shipment moves at some point between origin and destination. It can also be a carrier's break-bulk terminal or re-handling location. Also known as intermediate point and intermediate port.








Loss means disappearance of cargo under circumstances where the cause cannot be defined.








Manifest means tabulation of waybills on the loaded vehicle. Often used by checkers as a check sheet when loading and unloading to verify the count.








Order notify means a shipment is consigned to order of the shipper, with instructions to notify another party of the arrival of the freight who can claim the shipment by surrendering the original bill of landing. Also known as sight draft.








Origin terminal memos the terminal at which the shipment begins its travel to destination. Also known as origin port.








O. S. & D. means over. short. and damaged cargo.








Overage means a cargo shipment that is not covered by a bill of lading or waybill.








Pilferage means theft of cargo in small amounts.

Traffic means goods moved by a transportation carrier. Also known as cargo or freight.








Waybill means a document prepared from a bill of lading that accompanies shipment from origin to destination. Also known as freight bill.








Subpart BElements of a System








Sec. 101-4.11 General. An effective cargo loss reporting system must contain certain elements for successful implementation by employees and management. This subpart sets forth the minimal elements of such a system.








Sec. 101-4.13 Procedures. Detailed procedures for identifying and handling over. short, and damage cargo should be prepared by each carrier's management office and placed in terminals for reference. guidance, and training of all personnel involved in the cargo movement.








Sec. 101-4.15 Training. (a) Employees should have knowledge of the operating authority and traffic patterns of the carrier. This includes terminal locations, points served, service restrictions and exceptions. and average service schedule to all points.








(b) Drivers. dock workers and others involved with the traffic should have known. edge of customer freight movements, commodities shipped and pecularities of specific customers.








(c) Employees should have full knowledge of the loss reporting system and the company's claim prevention program.








(d) All supervisory and management per-sonnet should be involved in the training and fully understand the loss reporting system, how it functions, its objectives. the mechanics thereof, and who to contact in making the system work.








Sec. 101-4.17 Management Review and Analysis. (a) Reports in appropriate detail from the Cargo Loss Reporting System should be reviewed by the following: (1) General management, (2) security officers, (3) claims managers, (4) directors of operations. and (5) terminal managers.








(b) The cargo loss data should form the basis for reports on cargo claims which are or may be required by a regulatory agency.








(c) Reports should be analysed to pinpoint needed improvements in the claims prevention program.








Subpart CSystem Organization, Guidlines and Procedures








Sec. 101-4.21 General. (a) The cargo loss reporting system is intended to be responsive to management in the claims prevention program.








(b) The system should provide the most effective means and times to report all discrepancies in shipments to minimize claims exposure. and to provide better service to the customer.








(c) The reports generated by tile system will serve u information to the claims department for denial or approval of claims presented by customers.








Sec. 101-4.23 Organization. (a) A central office to serve as the clearinghouse for all reports of shipment discrepancies should be established preferably at the corporate or company headquarters.








(b) This central office should be the focal point for all reports of overages. shortages. and damages and is responsible for: (1) Clearing reports on discrepancies; (2) matching overages and shortages; (3) issuing disposition instructions to terminals; and (4) developing advisory instructions for terminals with special problems.








(c) The central office should be in the claims department with direct communication with all terminals by means of teletype or telephone.








Sec. 101-4.25 Guidelines. (a) The loss reporting procedures should be implemented immediately upon discovery of an overage, shortage, or damage in shipment.








(b) The reports of an overage, shortage, or damage shoed include information defining who, what, when, where and how.








(c) Effectiveness of the procedures depends on detailed facts and prompt action.








(d) When a shortage is discovered at a terminal. usually one of the following errors has occurred:








(1) A billing error was made.








(2) Driver failed to pick up the entire shipment.








(3) A theft occurred from the pickup unit enroute to the terminal.








(4) The freight was loaded on the wrong unit at the shipper's dock.








(5) Another carrier picked up the freight In error.








(e) Action to be taken when such shortages are discovered:








(1) Check for billing or typographical error on bill of lading.








(2) Review with checker and crew that unloaded pickup unit.








(3) Check dock area for the missing freight.








(4) Interview the pickup driver promptly. by telephone if necessary, for his recollection of facts surrounding pickup and his count.








(5) Contact the shipper for possible error in his billing and have him recheck his dock for the missing freight. Obtain names of





 












Page 202




other carriers who made pick ups that day at his dock.








(6) Call other carriers and ask them to check for the missing freight.








(7) Check with the consignee to determine if he received the freight via another carrier.








(8) Advise the central clearing office and other terminals of the shortage with a full description.








(f) Other actions that should be taken:








(1) If shortage was part of a shipment, move the balance to destination with accompanying shortage report. Do not hold up the freight.








(2) If shortage is a complete shipment, a report should be prepared immediately for the central clearing office.








(3) If theft is indicated. notify all appropriate law enforcement authorities.








(4) Make a daily check for the missing freight with other terminals for the next five workdays.








(5) If the missing freight is located as a complete shipment, ship it promptly to destination on original waybill, free-astray bill or forced billing, depending on circumstances.








(6) If the recovered freight is a part shipment. and the balance of the shipment has already moved to destination, prepare a free-astray bill and move the freight to destination promptly for final delivery.








(7) If the shortage is from an interline carrier, a signed and dated exception should be noted by the checker on connecting carriers freight bill.








(8) If the shortage is noted at an intermediate terminal, it should be recorded by the checker who should notify his supervisor. The central clearing office should be notified as well as the original and destination terminal.








(g) Copies of all over. short, and damage reports should be sent to the central clearing office where records and statistics should be compiled from each day's receipts, detailing all pertinent facts regarding each incident. Such facts should serve to furnish the carrier's management with facts and figures to formulate an improved claim prevention program.








(h) The central clearing office should maintain a daily follow-up with terminals on outstanding shortages and other omissions, thereby encouraging the terminals to intensify the search for facts to close out those files.








(i) When discrepancies are found and reported, immediate action should commence to correct the cause or causes.








(j) A daily schedule should be established for reporting all shortages and overages. Each carrier, based on experience, length of haul, and other factors should establish a timeframe within which discrepancies are reported to the central office and to other terminals to clear them and for a match-up. The report on losses should contain the following information:








(1) Name of Shipper;








(2) Name of Consignee;








(3) Waybill number;








(4) Date of shipment;








(5) Commodity;








(6) Weight;








(7) Type of shipment (container, truckload, pallet, etc.);








(8) Part missing (in shortage shipment);








(9) Part damaged;








(10) C.O.D. or order notify:








(11) Prepaid/collect;








(12) Where checked and by whom;








(13) How many times handled;








(14) Type loss (theft/hijack/pilferage/unknown) and








(15) Location where loss was detected.








(k) Any failure of the system in reporting losses should be investigated to determine and institute corrective measures.








(l) Prompt investigation of distressed freight and immediate reporting to the central control is essential to curtail cargo loss claims. This enhances the opportunity for correction and recovery before the audit trail becomes obliterated.








(m) Liaison should be established with all law enforcement agencies for help as needed. All theft losses and break-ins or attempted break-ins of facilities should be reported to these agencies.








(n) Shipments found without identification should be segregated and placed in the security cage while a search is made by an authorized person for packing slips or invoices to determine ownership. If identification is made, the freight should be recoopered and proper marking should be applied to each shipping container for prompt movement to destination.








(o) Overages found in the carrier's terminals should be reported in the sane manner u shortages, for an overage can well mean a shortage elsewhere.








(p) All damaged freight should be reported to the central office. Local terminals should recooper such freight promptly to prevent further damage. Dry freight containers (cartons, bags, etc.) should be securely recoopered with sealing tape, banding wire, or other material to prevent further loss of contents or further damage. Waybills should be marked to indicate that shipment has been damaged.








(q) Each carrier should have printed forms for all reports in a format best suited to its needs for recording all types of discrepancies. The data content of the form should be tailored to its loss reporting system so that information can be retrieved.








(r) The carrier should issue advisory bulletins as needed to all terminals on specific problems or situations that arise. Changes in the existing Loss Reporting System should be made as necessary.








Sec. 101-4.27 Procedure. (a) A comprehensive over. short, and damage manual





 












Page 203




should be prepared and maintained based on the guidelines in section 85-4.25 of this subpart.








(b) An employee at each terminal should be designated the O. S. & D. clerk. Such person should be experienced in freight. movement, company routes, customer identify, commodities shipped. all movements of specialized cargoes, and high-risk movements. The O. S. & D. clerk should also possess a knowledge of claims handling, cargo claims prevention procedures. cargo security. packaging required by tariffs, recoopering practices, customer service, tracing. and related activities. He should be able to detect and correct flaws in handling and checking procedures, security measures and identification of problems relating to cargo claims prevention.








(c) The O. S. & D. clerk, who may be the terminal's Claims Prevention Manager. should be knowledgeable enough to judge when security has been breached and advise management. who in turn should call in law enforcement personnel.








(d) A daily inventory should be taken of freight docks to detect over and damaged freight. Such discoveries should be taken to recoop any damaged shipments, segregating those that are likely to damage other cargo, and to provide security for high-value cargo. The O. S. & D. Clerk and the Tracer Clerk should maintain close coordination to expedite delivery of overages.








(e) A centralized reporting procedure for O. S. & D.'s should be established for the central office to receive reports of all discrepancies from all locations, both verbal and written. This will enable that office, along with terminal help, to match up shortages, clear other discrepancies, and provide for disposition of O. S. & D. freight.








(f) The central office should have final authority in advising terminals on disposition of shipments involved in discrepancies and possible claims. This insures that all overages are promptly forwarded to proper destination with bills to cover until they can be matched up with proper billing at destination. Shortages should be given preferred attention, since they represent the single greatest dollar loss to a carrier.








(g) The central office should establish daily reports to account statistically for O. S. & D. activity and provide management with information to reflect error experience each day. High O. S. & D. activity is a sign of operational problems and a forerunner to severity in cargo loss claims.








(h) Daily written records of all events relating to O. S. & D.'s must be maintained and be part of the carrier's files and available for inspection by the claims department as needed.








(i) The central office should maintain a cross-reference file of O. S. & D.'s that is continually updated for accurate reference. It should be posted and purged daily. It is a source of reference for terminals seeking information on outstanding O. S. & D. items. for tracer information. and other O. S. & D. information. It also serves as the, source for daily trends.








(j) The central office should compile discrepancy data on shippers. such as failure to mark shipments properly. and the use of poor quality containers. Such discrepancies should be called to the shipper's attention for correction.








(k) A daily conference call among terminals on the communications network should be established, preferably at an hour when telephone traffic is light and most of the in-bound traffic is out for delivery. This provides the best opportunity to have a clear picture of the day's discrepancies. This call should be monitored by the central office since it provides information to and about all terminals.








(l) When teletype is used in lieu of telephone, messages should be short and meaningful, delivered on receipt to the O. S. & D. clerk and other addresses. and acted upon promptly.








Sec. 101-4.29 Training. (a) Training sessions should be held at each terminal location for all personnel in relation to their participation in the loss reporting procedures. Office. dock, and driving employees as well as management should participate in order to be acquainted fully with the carrier's practices involving O. S. & D.'s and reporting procedures.








(b) Personnel trained in the Loss Reporting System must of necessity be knowledgeable of the carriers's physical operations. routings, points served and terminal locations, as well as the care and handling of specialized cargo, hazardous materials, and high-risk cargo.








Sec. 101-4.31 Review and Analysis. (a) The Loss Reporting System's explicit purpose is loss prevention through Intensified management of freight handling activities. Information developed in the Loss Reporting System will assist management in identifying problem areas within the system. and prompt corrective action.








(b) Periodic reports should indicate trends, problem areas, problem freight, problem customers, and problem employees and proposed corrective action. They will identify theft-prone areas and commodities.








(c) The report should advise management of the relationship of O. S. & D.'s to cargo claims filed. O. S. & D.'s to shortages never recovered, and O. S. & D.'s to claims never filed. billing errors, checker errors, and causes previously unknown or ignored.








(d) The report will also furnish data on other matters such as:








(1) Frequency of billing errors;








(2) Errors on S. L. & C. trailers, at shipper's dock. where drivers signing for loads tip not count the freight: and








(3) Packaging problems on S. L. & C.








(e) The report should also:





 












Page 204




(l) Identify geographic areas of loss such as large distribution centers. high-value cargo shippers and receivers. and dangerous and hazardous material shipment problems;








(2) Provide data on frequency of shipments picked up that lack proper or complete address which prevent delivery or seriously delay shipment and cost carrier time and money in determining the correct identification; and








(3) Identify shipments pickup up lacking any markings which must be delayed until somewone with proper authority opens cartons and checks for identification in the form of packing slips. invoices. or advertising.








(f) The report can provide data on shippers who should unitize their small carton shipments. Small containers are easily lost, stolen, or damaged when shipped loose. These multiple small pieces are costly to the carrier in extra labor as well as claims exposure. Unitizing can reduce carrier's handling cost and protect contents of shipment from loss and damage.








(g) A periodic review of the Loss Reporting System and its results should be done by








management to determine:








(1) Its effectiveness, and








(2) Methods for improvement.

AUTHORITY: Sec, 9(c)(1), Department of Transportation Act (80 Stat. 944, 49 U.S.C. 1657(e)(1)), E.O. 11836 (3A CFR 123. Comp. (1975)), and sec. 101.3 of the Regulations of the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (49 CFR 101-3).








Subpart AGeneral








SEC. 101-5.1 Purpose. (a) The purpose of this part is to set forth special transit procedures designed to protect high-value or sensitive cargo against theft and pilferage.








(b) The provisions herein are general and each may not apply to every transportation mode.








SEC. 101-5.3 Application. The guidelines presented herein apply equally to high-value or sensitive cargo in full load trailers/ containers/rail cars moving in line haul and in less than full load shipments. Compliance with this advisory standard is voluntary and not mandatory. This standard does not repeal or modify any statutory requirement or regulatory authority vested in any Federal, State or local governmental body.








SEC. 101-5.5 Definitions. As used in this part:








High-value cargo means cargo which because of its monetary value, utility, desirability, or history of frequent theft requires greater protection than other commodities normally handled in the transportation facility. In addition. it includes commodities which are attractive, pilferable and highly salable, such as clothing, jewelry, and alcoholic beverages.








Sensitive cargo means cargo which because of its strategic value or potentially hazardous nature warrants greater security protection and care than other commodities normally handled in the transportation facility. Such sensitive cargo, if lost, could constitute a threat to law and order or to the safety and tranquility of the general public.








Subpart BRouting and Communication








SEC. 101-5.11 General. Routing and communications should be carefully planned for high-value or sensitive shipments. Written instructions to drivers would eliminate the possibility of a breakdown in personal communications or misunderstandings.








SEC. 101-5.13 Routes. (a) Whenever possible. travel should be restricted to limited access highways, turnpikes, freeways, etc.








(b) Unnecessary stops should be avoided. The shipment is most vulnerable when stopped.








(c) Trailers, containers or rail cars should be locked and protective devices activated.








(d) Estimated arrival times and delays should be expeditiously communicated to destination stations.








SEC. 101-5.15 Communication. (a)Where radios are available on local delivery vehicles, the route should be designated. and scheduled radio contact between the dispatcher and the vehicle should be maintained.








(b) For pickup or delivery vehicles without radio, the driver should telephone the dispatcher when leaving the shipper or arriving at the consignee, as appropriate. The dispatcher should notify the police if the





 












Page 205




driver does not contact him within the scheduled or reasonable time.








SEC. 101-5.17 Escorts. In cases where extremely high-value or sensitive cargo is transported, an escort should be used especially in areas which are high-risk or shipment is highly vulnerable. The escort should have radio communication with a central station. Any use of armed escorts must be in conformity with laws governing the use of firearms and armed escorts.








Subpart COperating Procedures








SEC. 101-5.21 General. The general details for high-value or sensitive cargo shipments should be standard operating procedures.








(a) To facilitate planning of necessary or special procedures, details of quantity, value, destination, etc., should be ascertained when initial pickup is arranged.








(b) High security padlocks should be provided on all pickup and delivery trucks.








(c) The dispatcher should know the identity of the shipper and consignee of each high-value or sensitive cargo and coordinate pickup and delivery with each.








(d) The company's operating procedures for transporting high-value or sensitive shipments should be published and maintained in each vehicle and at all loading terminals. The procedures should be readily accessible for use by drivers, shippers. consignees and dispatchers.








SEC. 101-5.23 Delivery. Every attempt should be made to have the load arrive at the local terminal for same-day delivery. This is extremely important in high-crime areas where cargo may be vulnerable in terminals or railyards.








SEC. 101-5.25 Seals. (a) Seal Accountability and Procedures are covered in part 101-1 of this appendix.








(b) The use of security type seals is highly recommended. As a minimum, use security wire twist in conjunction with nonsecurity type seals.








(c) The serial number of a seal applied at the shipper's facility or the terminal should be recorded on the bill of lading and the manifest.








(d) The condition of the seal and its serial number should be checked upon entering and leaving each terminal or facility. The seal should also be checked by the driver after any other stops, and by railroad personnel on interchange of rail cars.








SEC. 101-5.27 Physical security. (a) Trailers, containers and rail car door hasps should be secured with a lock, wire or cable to deter the casual pilferer and delay more persistent thieves. Cable or wire twisted and secured through the safety latch, to be cut at destination, has proven to be an effective preventive measure.








(b) Door bolts, especially those on the locking bar and latch, should be peened or welded.








(c) Motion alarms are available commercially. These can be attached to trailers, containers and rail cars when parked to signal attempts at access or movement.








SEC. 101-5.29 Terminal security. (a) High-value or sensitive cargo temporarily placed on the dock or spotted in a railyard should be located in a special area which affords good visibility from the terminal office and should be checked frequently.








(b) Kingpin-locked trailers can be parked door-to-door to block access to other high-value or sensitive cargo. In the absence of kingpin locks, security can be achieved by hooking the tractor to the trailer, removing the Ignition key and locking the tractor.








(c) Unauthorized persons should not be allowed entry into the terminal area.








(d) When company identification badges are used, they should be worn at all times by employees.








(e) Procedures should be established to have the count certified by drivers and loaders. Any exceptions should be reported immediately to the supervisor.








SEC. 101-5.31 Security crib. (a) High-value or sensitive cargo which cannot be outloaded immediately should be placed in a security crib or cage, in accordance with part 101-2 of this appendix, ''High-Value Commodity Storage.''








(b) The following should be recorded:








(1) The count and the name of the person doing the counting;








(2) The condition of the shipment; and








(3) The fact that the shipment was intact when placed in the crib.








(c) Cargo should only be removed from the crib when scheduled for immediate placement in a delivery or line unit. The count and condition should be certified by a supervisor.








SEC. 101-5.33 Supervisor responsibilities. (a) An effective loss control program requires participation by all supervisory personnel.








(b) A supervisor should inspect all bills of lading from incoming pickups promptly to identify high-value or sensitive items and provide necessary security.








(c) A supervisor should verify the count and condition when cargo is stripped from pickup or interline unit and direct the movement into the line trailer, container or rail car.








(d) Any overages, shortages or damages should be reported in accordance with Part 100-4 of this Appendix, "Cargo Loss Reporting System and Procedures."








(e) High-value or sensitive cargo should be loaded in the front end of the trailer, container or rail car. The supervisor should monitor the loading to ensure that the commodity is "buried" and to provide necessary documentation for accountability. Adherence to safe loading procedures is necessary to avoid overloading the front end or creation of unsafe conditions.

1. Lessor, for and in consideration of the rents and covenants hereinafter mentioned, does hereby demise, lease and let unto Lessee, and Lessee does hereby hire, lease and take from Lessor 30,000 square feet of warehouse space in the city of Great Midwest, State of Illinois, within the building and premises commonly known as "Best Warehousing, Inc.," as more particularly described on Exhibit "A" attached hereto and made part hereof, in accordance with the schedule hereinafter set forth, viz.:








(a)30,000 square feet for a term of eleven (11) years beginning December 1, 1982, and terminating November 30, 1993.








2. Lessee covenants and agrees to pay Lessor as rental for the above described premises the amounts hereinafter set forth, payable on or before the first day of each and every month during the terms of this lease:

[1]





 












Page 233




(December 1, 1982, to December 31, 1982) is waived by Lessor.








3. The premises shall be used for warehouse and distribution purposes and any other purposes incidental to Lessee's particular type of business and no other. Premises shall not be used for any illegal purposes; nor in violation of any valid regulation of any governmental body, nor in any manner that would vitiate the insurance on premises; unless Lessee pays for any such increase.








4. Lessee accepts premises for use as packaged food warehouse. Lessor shall not be required to make any repairs for improvements to premises, except structural repairs necessary for safety and tenantability. Lessor shall keep in good repair and order the roof, exterior walls, and outside water and sewer provided that Lessor shall be under no obligation to repair any defect unless and until Lessee gives Lessor written notice of the existence of such defect or Lessor knows or should know of the existence of such defect. Lessor also agrees to maintain the sprinkler system. Lessee agrees to keep and maintain demised premises in good condition during the term of this Lease, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Lessee shall supply janitorial services at its own cost and expense.








5. The Lessor shall maintain Fire Insurance with Extended Coverage on the building structures and demised premises. Lessor and Lessee hereby release each other from responsibility for loss and damage occurring on or to the demised premises or the premises of which they are a part or the contents thereof caused by fires or other hazards ordinarily covered by Fire and Extended Coverage Insurance policies and each waives all fights of recovery against the other for such loss and damage; negligence lawfully attributable to either party, whether in whole or in part a contributing cause of the casualty giving rise to the loss or damage, shall not affect the foregoing release and waiver.








Within the use set forth in Paragraph 3 of this Lease, Lessee shall not use or permit said premises or any part thereof to be








[2]





 












Page 234




used, nor acts to be done, which will increase the existing rate of insurance upon the building in which said premises are located, or upon Lessor's adjacent property or cause a cancellation of any insurance policy covering said building or property or any part thereof, nor shall Lessee keep in or about said premises any article which may be prohibited by any standard form of Fire Insurance. Lessee shall at Lessee's expense, comply with all insurance company requirements pertaining to the use of said premises so that said premises shall at all times be insurable for fire and extended coverage.








6. All personal property of every kind and description which may at any time be in the leased premises shall be at the sole risk of Lessee, or of those claiming under Lessee. Lessor shall in no event be liable for loss or damage to said property, or loss suffered by the business or occupation of the Lessee including loss or damage to the property held by Lessee on the leased premises as bailee, arising from the bursting, overflowing or leaking of water, drain, soil or sewer pipes, sprinkler leakage, or from the heating or plumbing fixtures, or from electric wires, or from gas or odors in any manner whatsoever, or from any other condition of the leased premises, including loss or damage of any kind or nature whatsoever arising from or occasioned by the failure of the sewage and water systems.








7. Lessee shall protect, indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from and against claims, demands and liabilities of any nature whatsoever including legal expenses arising from injury to or death of person or persons or loss of or damage to property occurring in, on, or about the leased premises, or in any manner growing out of or connected with Lessor's ownership or Lessee's use and occupancy of the leased premises or the conditions thereof during the term of this lease or any renewal hereof, unless such injury, death, loss or damage is caused by the negligence of Lessor.








8. Lessee shall not assign this Lease or any interest thereunder or subject the premises or any part thereof, or permit the use








[3]





 












Page 235




thereof without first obtaining the written consent of Lessor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Consent to one assignment or subletting shall not be deemed a waiver of this provision as to any subsequent assignment or subletting. Lessee shall nevertheless remain liable for all the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease. If any subletting is at a rental higher than that which is paid by the Lessee hereunder, the rental paid to the Lessor shall be increased by fifty per cent (50%) of the difference between such rentals.








9. If the premises are totally destroyed (or so substantially damaged as to be untenantable) by storm, fire, earthquake or other casualty, this lease shall terminate as of the date of such destruction or damage, and rental shall be accounted for as between Lessor and Lessee as of that date. If premises are damaged but not rendered wholly untenantable by any such casualty, rental shall abate in proportion as the premises have been damaged and Lessor shall commence restoration within fifteen (15) days from the date of said damage and complete restoration within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding one hundred-twenty (120) days, from the date of said damage. Full rent shall recommence on completion of restoration. In the event there is a dispute as whether or not any damage occasioned by reason of this paragraph renders the premises wholly untenantable, then and in such event each of the parties shall choose an arbitrator, who shall together choose a third, and the decision of the majority shall be binding upon the parties hereto.








In the event the entire leased premises are taken under the power of Eminent Domain proceedings, this lease shall terminate as of the date of such taking and all rent paid or payable by the Lessee shall be apportioned as of such date. If a portion of the leased premises are taken under Eminent Domain, either party may elect to terminate this Lease by written notice to the other party within fifteen (15) days of such taking and rentals shall be accounted for as of the date the Lessee surrenders possession.

10. Lessee may, at its sole cost and expense, with the prior approval of Lessor, make and install such fixtures, items and equipment, and other improvements in the premises, herein leased as may be necessary or convenient in the use of such premises.

The erection of signs by Lessee on the exterior of the premises herein leased shall be done only with the prior written approval of the Lessor.








11. Lessor agrees to provide snow removal services at no additional cost to Lessee. Lessee shall pay for electricity (to be separately metered), telephone, water, sewer, existing and additional security service and heat attributable to Lessee's occupancy. Heat shall be apportioned on the basis of occupancy and temperature maintenance. If Lessee does not pay the same, Lessor may pay the same and any amounts so paid shall be additional rent due hereunder.








12. As additional rental during the term of the Lease, or any extension thereof, the Lessee shall pay its proportionate share of any increase in the annual real estate taxes and installments of special assessments over those due and payable in 1982, payable by Lessor on the building and appurtenances leased and demised herein, including real estate taxes applicable to land on which said building and appurtenances and parking lot are situated for each of the years contained in said term. It is further understood that Lessee shall pay all taxes applicable to any leasehold improvements whether such improvements are considered for tax purposes as part of the realty or as personality.

Appendix F
Bill of Lading (Domestic) Terms and Conditions





 












Page 241




The Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994 (TIRRA) provides that: ''a motor carrier of property, the application of whose rates is determined or governed by a tariff on file with the [Interstate Commerce] Commission cannot collect its rates unless the carrier is a participant in those tariffs" (Section 206(b)(3), amending par. 10761 (a) of USC 49). The use of provisions contained in the NMFC, including, but not limited to . . . bills of lading . . . is reserved exclusively for the benefit of carriers listed as participants in the NMFC. Motor carriersand shippersthat are participants in the NMFC may use the Standard B/L forms, terms, and conditions published in NMFC 100. Shippers must confirm carriers' participation in this tariff.








Customer Pickup Disclaimer








Pickup in the customer's vehicle (usually a private truck) constitutes a nonregulated carriage, which is not subject to the terms and conditions of the bill of lading. To avoid any liability for negative events that may occur during this kind of transit, shippers are advised to disclaim any responsibility and liability, and make an appropriate notation on the shipping document/s; for instance:








This is not a bill of lading subject to the terms and conditions printed thereon or contained in freight classifications. It is a receipt only issued by the private carrier for goods shown on the shipping paper/s. The person, firm or corporation shown on these shipping papers as carrier represents that it is providing or arranging a transportation service which is not regulated by any federal, state or local agency or commission and agrees to accept full responsibility and liability for any and all loss, damage and/or delay of the property described herein and delivered to consignee. Title to picked-up goods passes to consignee when goods are loaded onto customer's conveyance and have been signed for by the driver.








It is recommended that, on customer pickups, the consignor elect freight terms to assure passage of title when goods have been





 












Page 242




loadedfor example, "F.O.B. [origin]." Origin must be defined as a geographical location, such as "F.O.B. ABC Company, Pontiac, Mich."








Bill of Lading Terms and ConditionsSummary








The following summary presents a brief overview of the language printed either on the back of bill of lading forms or in the applicable classifications and/or carrier rules. Application and interpretation of specific terms must be made only in connection with the complete text of the terms and conditions.








Section 1. Liability. Carriers are subject to common law bill of lading liability and warehouse liability. Common carriers are completely liable for loss and damage without proof of negligence. Exceptions are acts of God, government authorities, the public enemy, acts of negligence or omissions by the shipper, and inherent vice of the goods transported.








Section 2. Reasonable dispatch. Shipper instructions to deliver at specified times are not binding on the carrier. The carrier may observe such notations or, if requested to deliver at specified times, charge for the extra service.








Section 3. Repackaging. Where necessary, the carrier will perform repackaging and recoopering at shipper's cost.








Section 4. Warehousing and storage of unclaimed freight (including storage and disposition of perishable freight). When, after reasonable attempts, carrier is unsuccessful in delivering freight, carrier's liability as common carrier ends. Subsequent liability while in storage will be limited to that of warehouse only for the storage period. Shipper will be responsible for all related charges.








Section 5. Articles of extraordinary value. Carriers will not transport, and having transported unknowingly, will not be liable for loss and damage.








Section 6. Hazardous materials. Carrier will transport only in accordance with applicable regulations.








Section 7. Responsibility for freight charges. The owner or consignee of the goods or consignee must pay freight charges. The carrier must not deliver goods until all charges have been paid, except





 












Page 243




when carrier has been authorized to do so. The "without recourse" clause states that on "collect" shipments the shipper is liable for freight charges even when the carrier makes delivery without first collecting the freight charges. However, if consignor signs the "without recourse" clause, there is no liability for freight charges.








Section 8. Substitute bill of lading. This provides for the liability of a shipper when a substitute or exchange bill of lading is issued. Shipper's signature on the prior bill of lading with respect to value is considered same as if written thereon.








Section 9. Water carrier exceptions. (Refer to Exhibit 7-2.)








Section 10. Unauthorized changes. These are prohibited and, when made, not effective.








Note: Terms and 'conditions used for export, government traffic, household goods, and air and water transportation are different from the standard bill of lading terms.

(b) The consignee is an agent only and has no beneficial title in the property and








(c) Prior to delivery the consignee has notified the delivering carrier in writing that he is only an agent and has no beneficial title in the property (provided that this requirement does not apply if the consignee is a for-hire carrier), and





 












Page 246




(d) In cases where the shipment has been reconsigned or diverted to a point other than that specified in the bill of lading the consignee has also notified the delivering carrier in writing of the name and address of the beneficial owner of said property. Where the consignee is not liable for certain transportation charges in accordance with this provision and the preceding conditions, the shipper or consignor, or, in the case of a shipment so reconsigned or diverted as specified in condition (d), the beneficial owner shall be liable for such additional charges.








PROVIDED FURTHER, that where the shipment is designated 'prepaid,' the shipper or consignor shall remain liable for undercharges which result from an erroneous determination of the transportation charge assessed.








If the consignee has given to the carrier erroneous information as to who the beneficial owner is, such consignee shall himself be liable for such additional charges. Nothing herein shall limit the right of the carrier to require at time of shipment the prepayment or guarantee of the charges.

Â§ 1910.1200 Hazard communication.








(a) Purpose. (1) The purpose of this section is to ensure that the hazards of all chemicals produced or imported are evaluated, and that information concerning their hazards is transmitted to employers and employees. This transmittal of information is to be accomplished by means of comprehensive hazard communication programs, which are to include container labeling and other forms of warning, material safety data, sheets and employee training.








(2) This occupational safety and health standard is intended to address comprehensively the issue of evaluating the potential hazards of chemicals, and communicating information concerning hazards and appropriate proactive measures to employees, and to preempt any legal requirements of a state, or political subdivision of a state, pertaining to this subject. Evaluating the potential hazards of chemicals, and communicating information conceding hazards and appropriate protective measures to employees, may include, for example, but is not limited to, provisions for: developing and maintaining a written hazard commutation program for the workplace, including lists of hazardous chemicals present; ladling of containers of chemicals In the workplace, as well as of containers of chemicals being shipped to other workplaces; preparation and distribution of material safety data sheets to employees and downstream employers; and development and implementation of employee training programs regarding hazards of chemicals and proactive measures. Under section 18 of the Act, no state or political subdivision of a state may adopt or enforce, through any court or agency, any requirement relating to the issue addressed by this Federal standard, except pursuant to a Federally-approved state plan.








(b) Scope and application. (1) This section requires chemical manufacturers or importers to assess the hazards of chemicals which they produce or import, and all employers to provide information to their employees about the hazardous chemicals to which they are exposed, by means of a hazard communication program, labels and other forms of warning, material safety data sheets, and information and training. In addition, this section requires distributors to transmit the required information to employers. (Employers who do not produce or import chemicals need only focus on those parts of this rule that deal with establishing a workplace program and communicating information to their workers. Appendix E of this section is a general guide for such employers to help them determine their compliance obligations under the rule.)








(2) This section applies to any chemical which is known to be present in the workplace in such a manner that employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency.








(3) This section applies to laboratories only as follows:








(i) Employers shall ensure that labels on incoming containers of hazardous chemicals are not removed or defaced;








(ii) Employers shall maintain any material safety data sheets that are received with incoming shipments of hazardous chemicals, and ensure that they are readily accessible during each workshift to laboratory employees when they are in their work areas;








(iii) Employers shall ensure that laboratory employees are provided information and training in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, except for the location and availability of the written hazard communication program under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section; and,








(iv) Laboratory employers that ship hazardous chemicals are considered to be either a chemical manufacturer or a distributor under this rule, and thus must ensure that any containers of hazardous chemicals leaving the laboratory are labeled in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and that a material safety data sheet is provided to distributors and other employers in accordance with paragraphs (g)(6) and (g)(7) of this section.








(4) In work operations where employees only handle chemicals in sealed containers which are not opened under normal conditions of use (such as are found in marine cargo handling, warehousing, or retail sales), this section applies to these operations only as follows:








(i) Employers shall ensure that labels on incoming containers of hazardous chemicals are not removed or defaced:








(ii) Employers shall maintain copies of any material safety data sheets that.





 












Page 249




are received with incoming shipments of the sealed containers of hazardous chemicals, shall obtain a material safety data sheet as soon as possible for sealed containers of hazardous chemicals received without a material safety data sheet if an employee requests the material safety data sheet. and shall ensure that the material safety data sheets are readily accessible during. each work shift to employees whet, they are in their work area(s); and,








(iii) Employers shall ensure that employees are provided with information and training in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section (except for the location and availability of the written hazard communication program under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section). to the extent necessary to protect them in the event of a spill or leak of a hazardous chemical from a sealed container.

(iii) If a mixture has not been tested as a whole to determine whether the mixture is a physical hazard, the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer may use whatever scientifically valid data is available to evaluate the physical hazard potential of the mixture; and,








(iv) If the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer has evidence to indicate that a component present in the mixture in concentrations of less than one percent (or in the case of car-





 












Page 254




cinogens, less than 0.1 percent) could be released in concentrations which would exceed an established OSHA permissible exposure limit or ACGIH Threshold Limit Value, or could present a health risk to employees in those concentrations, the mixture shall be assumed to present the came hazard.








(6) Chemical manufacturers, importers, or employers evaluating chemicals shall describe in writing the procedures they use to determine the hazards of the chemical they evaluate. The writ. ten procedures are to be made available, upon request, to employees, their designated representatives, the Assist. ant Secretary and the Director.

(e) Written hazard communication program. (1) Employers shall develop, implement. and maintain at each workplace. a written hazard communication program which at least describes how the criteria specified in paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section for labels and other forms of warning, material safety data sheets, and employee information and training will be met, and which also includes the following:








(i) A list of the hazardous chemicals known to be present using an identity that is referenced on the appropriate material safety data sheet (the list may be compiled for the workplace as a whole or for individual work areas); and.








(ii) The methods the employer will use to inform employees of the hazards of non-routine tasks (for example. the cleaning of reactor vessels), and the hazards associated with chemicals contained in unlabeled pipes in their work areas.








(2) Mufti-employer workplaces. Employers who produce. use, or store hazardous chemicals at a workplace in such a way that the employees of other employer(s) may be exposed (for example. employees of a construction contractor working on-site) shall additionally ensure that the hazard communication programs developed and implemented under this paragraph (e) include the following:








(i) The methods the employer will use to provide the other employer(s) on-site access to material safety data sheets for each hazardous chemical the other employer(s)' employees may be exposed to while working;








(ii) The methods the employer will use to inform the other employer(s) of any precautionary measures that need to be taken to protect employees during the workplace's normal operating conditions and in foreseeable emergencies; and,








(iii) The methods the employer will use to inform the other employer(s) of the labeling system used in the workplace.

(iii) Name and address of the chemical manufacturer, importer. or other responsible party.








(2)(i) For solid metal (such as a steel beam or a metal casting). solid wood, or plastic items that are not exempted as articles due to their downstream use, or shipments of whole grain. the required label may be transmitted to the customer at the time of the initial shipment, and need not be included with subsequent shipments to the same employer unless the information on the label changes;








(ii) The label may be transmitted with the initial shipment itself, or with the material safety data sheet that is to be provided prior to or at the time of the first shipment; and.








(iii) This exception to requiring la-





 












Page 255




bels on every container of hazardous chemicals is only for the solid material itself, and does not apply to hazardous chemicals used in conjunction with, or known to be present with. the material and to which employees handling the items in transit may be exposed (for example, cutting fluids or pesticides in grains).








(3) Chemical manufacturers. importers, or distributors shall ensure that each container of hazardous chemicals leaving the workplace is labeled, tagged, or marked in accordance with this section in a manner which does not conflict with the requirements of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) and regulations issued under that Act by the Department of Transportation.








(4) If the hazardous chemical is regulated by OSHA in a substance-specific health standard, the chemical manufacturer, importer, distributor or employer shall ensure that the labels or other forms of warning used are in accordance with the requirements of that standard.

(F) To design or assess engineering controls or other protective measures for exposed employees; and,








(G) To conduct studies to determine the health effects of exposure.








(iii) The request explains in detail why the disclosure of the specific chemical identity is essential and that. in lieu thereof, the disclosure of the following information to the health professional, employee, or designated representative, would not satisfy the purposes described in paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section:








(A) The properties and effects of the chemical;








(B) Measures for controlling workers' exposure to the chemical;








(C) Methods of monitoring and analyzing worker exposure to the chemical; and,








(D) Methods of diagnosing and treating harmful exposures to the chemical;

(ii) The health professional, employee, or designated representative has supported the claim that there is a medical or occupational health need for the information; and,








(iii) The health professional, employee or designated representative has demonstrated adequate means to protect the confidentiality.








(10)(i) If OSHA determines that the specific chemical identity requested under paragraph (i)(3) of this section is not a bona fide trade secret, or that it is a trade secret, but the requesting health professional, employee, or designated representative has a legitimate medical or occupational health need for the information, has executed a written confidentiality agreement, and has shown adequate means to protect the confidentiality of the information, the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer will be subject to citation by OSHA.








(ii) H a chemical manufacturer, importer. or employer demonstrates to OSHA that the execution of a confidentiality agreement would not provide sufficient protection against the potential harm from the unauthorized disclosure of a trade secret specific chemical identity, the Assistant Secretary may issue such orders or impose such additional limitations or conditions upon the disclosure of the requested chemical information as may be appropriate to assure that the occupational health services are provided without an undue risk of harm to the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer.








(11) If a citation for a failure to release specific chemical identity information is contested by the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer, the matter will be adjudicated before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission in accordance with the Act's enforcement scheme and the applicable Commission rules of procedure. In accordance with the Commission rules, when a chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer continues to withhold the information during the contest, the Administrative Law Judge may review the citation and supporting documentation in camera or issue appropriate orders to protect the confidentiality of such matters.








(12) Notwithstanding the existence of a trade secret claim, a chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer shall, upon request, disclose to the Assistant Secretary any information which this section requires the chemical manufacturer, importer, or employer to make available. Where there is a trade secret claim, such claim shall be made no later than at the time the information is provided to the Assistant Secretary so that suitable determinations of trade secret status can be made and the necessary protections can be implemented.








(13) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring the disclosure under any circumstances of process or percentage of mixture information which is a trade secret.








(j) Effects dates. Chemical manufacturers, importers, distributors, and employers shall be in compliance with all provisions of this section by March 11, 1994.








NOTE: The effective date of the clarification that the exemption of wood and wood products from the Hazard Communication standard in paragraph (b)(6)(iv) only applies to wood and wood products including lumber which will not be processed. where the manufacturer or importer can establish that the only hazard they pose to employees is the potential for flammability or combustibility. and that the exemption does not apply to wood or wood products which have been treated with a hazardous chemical covered by this standard. and wood which may be subsequently sawed or cut generating dust has been stayed from March 11. 1994 to August 11, 1994.








Appendix A to Â§ 1910.1200Health Hazard Definitions (Mandatory)








Although safety hazards related to the physical characteristics of a chemical can be objectively defined in terms of testing requirements (e.g. flammability), health hazard definitions are less precise and more subjective. Health hazards may cause measurable changes in the bodysuch as decreased pulmonary function. These changes are generally indicated by the occurrence of signs and symptoms in the exposed employees such as shortness of breath, a non-measurable, subjective feeling. Employees exposed to such hazards must be apprised of both the change in body function and the signs and symptoms that may occur to signal that change.








The determination of occupational health hazards is complicated by the fact that many of the effects or signs and symptoms occur commonly In non-occupationally exposed populations. so that effects of exposure are





 












Page 261




difficult to separate from normally occurring illnesses. Occasionally. Â· substance causes an effect that is rarely seen in the population at large. such as snglosarcomas caused by vinyl chloride exposure, thus making it easier to ascertain that the occupational exposure was the primary causative factor. More often, however, the effects are common, such as lung cancer. The situation is further complicated by the fact that most chemicals have not been adequately tested to determine their health hazard potential, and data do not exist to substantiate these effects.








There have been many attempts to categorize effects and to define them in various ways. Generally, the terms ''acute" and "chronic" are used to delineate between effects on the basis of severity or duration. "Acute" effects usually occur rapidly as a result of short. term exposures. and are of short duration. "Chronic" effects generally occur as Â· result of lone-term exposure, and are of lone duration.








The acute effects referred to most frequently are those defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard for Precautionary Labeling of Hazardous Industrial Chemicals (Z129.1-1988)irritation. corrosivity. sensitization and lethal dose. Although them are important health effects, they do not adequately cover the considerable range of scuts effects which may occur as a result of occupational exposure, such as, for example, narcosis.








Similarly, the term chronic effect is often used to cover only carcinogenicity, teratogenicity. and mutagenicity. These effects are obviously a concern in the workplace, but again, do not adequately cover the area of chronic effects, excluding. for example, Mood dyscrasias (such as anemia), chronic bronchitis and liver atrophy.








The real of defining precisely, in measurable terms, every possible health effect that may occur in the workplace as a result of chemical exposures cannot realistically be accomplished. This does not negate the need for employees to be informed of such effects and protected from them. Appendix B, which is also mandatory, outlines the principles and procedures of hazard assessment.








For purposes of this section, any chemicals which meet any of the following definitions, as determined by the criteria set forth in Appendix B are health hazards. However, this is not intended to be an exclusive categorization scheme. If there are available scientific data that involve other animal species or test methods, they must also be evaluated to determine the applicability of the HCS.7








1. Carcinogen: A chemical is considered to be a carcinogen if:








(a) It has been evaluated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and found to be a carcinogen or potential carcinogen; or








(b) It is listed as a carcinogen or potential carcinogen in the Annual Report on Carcinogens published by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) (latest edition); or,








(c) It Is regulated by OSHA as a carcinogen.








2. Corrosive: A chemical that causes visible destruction of, or irreversible alterations in, living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact. For example. a chemical is considered to be corrosive if. when tested on the intact skin of albino rabbits by the method described by the U.S. Department of Transportation in appendix A to 49 CFR part 173, it destroys or changes irreversibly the structure of the tissue at the site of contact following an exposure period of four hours. This term shall not refer to action on inanimate surfaces.








3. Highly toxic: A chemical falling within any of the following categories:








(a) A chemical that has a median lethal dose (LD30) of 50 milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight when administered orally to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 grams each.








(b) A chemical that has Â· median lethal dose (LD30) of 200 milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight when administered by continuous contact for 24 hours (or less if death occurs within 24 hours) with the bare skin of albino rabbits weighing between two and three kilograms each.








(c) A chemical that has Â· median lethal concentration (LC30) in air of 300 parts per million by volume or less of Was or vapor, or 2 milligrams per liter OF less of mist, fume, or dust, when administered by continuous inhalation for one hour (or less if death occurs within one hour) to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 frame each.








4. Irritant: A chemical, which Is not corrosive, but which causes Â· reversible inflammatory effect on living tissue by chemical action at the Bite of contact. A chemical is a skin irritant if, when tested on the intact skin of albino rabbits by the methods of 16 CFR 1500.41 for four hours exposure or by other appropriate techniques, it results in an empirical score of five or more. A chemical is an eye irritant if so determined under the procedure listed in 16 CFR 1500.42 or ocher appropriate techniques.








5. Sensitlzer: A chemical that causes a substantial proportion of exposed people or animals to develop an allergic ruction in normal tissue after repeated exposure to the chemical.








6. Toxic. A chemical fallings within any of the following categories:








(a) A chemical that has Â· median lethal dose (LD30) of more than 50 milligrams per kilogram but not more than 500 milligrams per kilogram of body weight when administered orally to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 grams each.








(b) A chemical that has Â· median lethal dose (LD30) of more than 200 milligrams per kilogram but not more than 1.000 milligrams per kilogram of body weight when administered by continuous contact for 24 hours (or





 












Page 262




less if death occurs within 24 hours) with the bare skin of albino rabbits weighing between two and three kilograms each.








(c) A chemical that has a median lethal concentration (LC30) in air of more than 200 parts per million but not more than 2,000 parts per million by volume of gas or vapor, or more than two milligrams per liter but not more than 20 mill rams per liter of mist, fume, or duet, when administered by continuous inhalation for one hour (or less if death occurs within one hour) to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300 grams each.








7. Target organ effects.








The following is a target organ categorization of effects which may occur, including examples of signs and symptoms and chemicals which have been found to cause such effects. These examples are presented to illustrate the range and diversity of effects and hazards found in the workplace, and the broad scope employers must consider in this area. but are not intended to be all-inclusive.








a. Hepatotoxins: Chemicals which produce liver damages
Signs & Symptoms: Jaundice; liver enlargement
Chemicals: Carbon tetrachloride; nitrosamines








b. Nephrotoxins: Chemicals which produce kidney damage
Signs & Symptoms: Edema; proteinuria

h. Eye hazards: Chemicals which affect the eye or visual capacity
Signs & Symptoms: Conjunctivitis; corneal damage
Chemicals: Organic solvents; acids








Appendix B to Â§ 1910.1200Hazard Determination (Mandatory)








The quality of a hazard communication program is largely dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of the hazard determination. The hazard determination requirement of this standard is performance-oriented. Chemical manufacturers. importers. and employers evaluating chemicals are not required to follow any specific methods for determining hazards, but they must be able to demonstrate that they have adequately ascertained the hazards of the chemicals produced or imported in accordance with the criteria set forth in this Appendix.








Hazard evaluation is a process which relies heavily on the professional Judgment of the evaluator, particularly in the area of chronic hazards. The performance-orientation of the hazard determination does not diminish the duty of the chemical manufacturer, importer or employer to conduct a thorough evaluation. examining all relevant data and producing a scientifically defensible evaluation. For purposes of this standard, the following criteria shall be used in making hazard determinations that meet the requirements of this standard.








1. Carcinogenicity: As described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section and Appendix A of this section, a determination by the National Toxicology program, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, or OSHA that a chemical is a carcinogen or potential carcinogen will be considered conclusive evidence for purposes of this section. In addition, however, all available scientific data on carcinogenicity must be evaluated in accordance with the provisions of this Appendix and the requirements of the rule.








2. Human data: Where available, epidemiological studies and case reports of adverse health effects shall be considered in the evaluation.








3. Animal data: Human evidence of health effects in exposed populations is generally not available for the majority of chemicals produced or used in the workplace. Therefore, the available results of toxicological testing in animal populations shall be used to predict the health effects that may be experienced by exposed workers. In particular, the definitions of certain acute hazards refer to specific animal testing results (see Appendix A).








4. Adequacy and redwing of data. The results of any studies which are designed and conducted according to established scientific principles, and which report statistically significant conclusions regarding the health effects of a chemical, shall be a sufficient basis for a hazard determination and reported on any material safety data sheet. In vitro studies alone generally do not form the Basle for a definitive finding of hazard under the HAS since they have Â· positive or negative result rather than a statistically significant finding.








The chemical manufacturer, importer, or





 












Page 263




employer may also report the results of ocher scientifically valid studies which tend to /refute the findings of hazard.








Appendix C to Â§ 1910.1200Information Sources (Advisory)








The following is a list of available data sources which the chemical manufacturer, importer, distributor, or employer may wish to consult to evaluate the hazards of chemicals they produce or import:








Any information in their own company files, such as toxicity testing results or illness experience of company employees.








Any information obtained from the supplier of the chemical, such as ma-aerial safety data sheets or product. safety bulletins.

portunlty to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. It may be a formula for a chemical compound, a process of manufacturing, treating or preserving materials, a pattern for a machine or other device, or a list of customers. It differs from other secret information In a business (see s759 of the Restatement of Torts which is not Included in this Appendix) in that it is not simply information as to single or ephemeral events in the conduct of the business, as, for example, the amount or other terms of a secret bid for a contract or the salary of certain employees, or the security investments made or contemplated, or the date fixed for the announcement of a new policy or for bringing out a new model or the like. A trade secret is a process or device for continuous use in the operations of the business. Generally it relates to the production of goods, as, for example, a machine or formula for the production of an article. It may, however, relate to the sale of roods or to other operations in the business, such as a code for determining discounts, rebates or ocher concessions in a price list or catalogue, or a list of specialized customers, or a method of bookkeeping or other office management.








Secrecy. The subject matter of a trade secret must be secret. Matters of public knowl-





 












Page 265




edge or of general knowledge in an industry cannot be appropriated by one as his secret. Matters which are completely disclosed by the woods which one markets cannot be his secret. Substantially, a trade secret is known only in the particular business in which it is used. It is not requisite that only the proprietor of the business know it. He may, without losing his protection, communicate it to employees involved in its use. He may likewise communicate it to others pledged to secrecy. Others may also know of it independently, as, for example, when they have discovered the process or formula by independent invention and are keeping it secret. Nevertheless, a substantial element of secrecy must exist, so that, except by the use of improper means, there would be difficulty in acquiring the information. An exact definition of a trade secret is not possible. Some factors to be considered in determining whether given information is one's trade secret are: (1) The extent to which the information is known outside of his business; (2) the extent to which It is known by employees and others involved in his business; (3) the extent of measures taken by him to guard the secrecy of the information; (4) the value of the information to him and his competitors; (5) the mount of effort or money expended by him in developing the information; (6) the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others.








Novelty and prior art. A trade secret may be a device or process which is patentable; but it need not be that. It may be a device or proem which is clearly anticipated in the prior art or one which is merely a mechanical Improvement that a good mechanic can make. Novelty and invention are not requisite for a trade secret us they are for patentability. These requirements are essential to patentability because a patent protects against unlicensed use of the patented device or process even by one who discovers it properly through Independent research. The patent monopoly is a reward to the inventor. But such is not the case with a trade secret. Its protection is not based on a policy of rewarding or otherwise encouraging the development of secret processes or device. The protection is merely against breach of faith and reprehensible means of learning another's secret. For this limited protection it is not appropriate to require also the kind of novelty and invention which is a requisite of patentability. The nature of the secret is, however, an important factor in determining the kind of relief that is appropriate against one who is subject to liability under the rule stated in this Section. Thus, if the secret consists of a device or process which Is a novel invention, one who acquires the secret wrongfully is ordinarily enjoined from further use of it and is required to account for the profits derived from his past use. If, on the other hand, the secret consists of mechanical improvements that a good mechanic can make without resort to the secret, the wrongdoer's liability may be limited to damages, and an Injunction against future use of the improvements made with the aid of the secret may be inappropriate.








Appendix E to Â§ 1910.1200(Advisory)Guidlines for Employer Compliance








The Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) is based on a simple conceptthat employees have both a need and a right to know the hazards and Identities of the chemicals they are exposed to when working. They also need to know what protective measures are available to prevent adverse effects from occurring. The HCS is designed to provide employees with the information they need.








Knowledge acquired under the HCS will help employers provide safer workplaces for their employees. When employers have information about the chemicals being used. they can take steps to reduce exposures, substitute less hazardous materials, and establish proper work practices. These efforts will help prevent the occurrence of work-related illnesses and injuries caused by chemicals.








The HCS addresses the issues of evaluating and communicating hazards to workers. Evaluation of chemical hazards involves a number of technical concept, and is a process that requires the professional Judgment of experienced expert. That's why the HCS is designed so that employers who simply use chemicals, rather than produce or import them, are not required to evaluate the hazards of those chemicals. Hazard determination is the responsibility of the producers and importers of the materials. Producers and importers of chemicals are then required to provide the hazard Information to employers that purchase them products.








Employers that don't produce or import chemicals need only focus on those parts of the rule that deal with establishing a workplace program and communicating information to their workers. This appendix is a general guide for such employers to help them determine what's required under the rule. It does not supplant or substitute for the regulatory provisions, but rather provides a simplified outline of the steps an average employer would follow to meet those requirements.








1. Becoming Familiar With The Rule.








OSHA has provided a simple summary of the HCS in a pamphlet entitled "Chemical Hazard Communication." OSHA Publication Number 3084. Some employers prefer to begin to become familiar with the rule's requirements by reading this pamphlet. A copy may be obtained from your local OSHA Area Of-tics, or by contacting the OSHA Publications Office at (202) 523-9667.








The standard is long, and some parts of it are technical, but the basic concepts are simple. In fact, the requirements reflect what many employers have been doing for years. You may find that you are already largely in compliance with many of the pro-





 












Page 266




visions, and will simply have to modify your existing programs somewhat. If you axe operating in an OSHA-approved Brats Plan State, you must comply with the State's requirements, which may be different than those of the Federal rule. Many of the State Plan States had hazard communication or "right-to-know" laws prior to promulgation of the Federal rule. Employers in State Plan States should contact their State OSHA offices for more information regarding applicable requirements.








The HCS requires information to be prepared and transmitted regarding all hazardous chemicals. The HCS covers both physical hazards (such as flammability), and health hazards (such as irritation, lung damage, and cancer). Most chemicals used in the workplace have some hazard potential, and thus will be covered by the rule.








One difference between this rule and many others adopted by OSHA is that this one is performance-oriented. That means that you have the flexibility to adapt the rule to the needs of your workplace, rather than having to follow specific, rigid requirements. It also means that you have to exercise more judgment to implement an appropriate and effective program.








The standard's design is simple. Chemical manufacturers and importers must evaluate the hazards of the chemicals they produce or import. Using that information, they must then prepare labels for containers, and more detailed technical bulletins called material safety data sheets (MSDS).








Chemical manufacturers, importers, and distributors of hazardous chemicals axe all required to provide the appropriate labels and material safety data sheets to the employers to which they ship the chemicals. The information is to be provided automatically. Every container of hazardous chemicals you receive must be labeled, tagged, or marked with the required information. Your suppliers must also send you a properly completed material safety data sheet (MSDS) at the time of the first shipment of the chemical, and with the next shipment after the MSDS is updated with new and significant information about the hazards.








You can rely on the information received from your suppliers. You have no independent duty to analyze the chemical or evaluate the hazards of it.








Employers that "use" hazardous chemicals must have a program to ensure the information Is provided to exposed employees. "Use" means to package, handle, react, or transfer. This is an intentionally broad scope, and includes any situation where a chemical is present in such a way that employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency.








The requirements of the rule that deal specifically with the hazard communication program are found in this section in paragraphs (e), written hazard communication program; (f), labels and other forms of warning; (g), material safety data sheets; and (h), employee information and training. The requirements of these paragraphs should be the focus of your attention. Concentrate on becoming familiar with them, using paragraphs (b), scope and application, and (c), definitions, as references when needed to help explain the provisions.








There are two types of work operations where the coverage of the rule is limited. These are laboratories and operations where chemicals are only handled in sealed containers (e.g., a warehouse). The limited provisions for these workplaces can be found in paragraph (b) of this section, scope and application. Basically, employers having these types of work operations need only keep labels on containers as they are received; maintain material safety data sheets that are received, and give employees access to them; and provide information and training for employees. Employers do not have to have written hazard communication programs and lists of chemicals for these types of operations.








The limited coverage of laboratories and sealed container operations addresses the obligation of an employer to the workers in the operations involved, and does not affect the employer's duties as a distributor of chemicals. For example, a distributor may have warehouse operations where employees would be protected under the limited sealed container provisions. In this situation, requirements for obtaining and maintaining MSDSs are limited to providing access to those received with containers while the substance is in the workplace, and requesting MSDSs when employees request access for those not received with the containers. However, as a distributor of hazardous chemicals, that employer will still have responsibilities for providing MSDSs to downstream customers at the time of the first shipment and when the MSDS is updated. Therefore, although they may not be required for the employees in the work operation, the distributor may, nevertheless, have to have MSDSs to satisfy other requirements of the rule.








2. Identify Responsible Staff








Hazard communication Is going to be a continuing program in your facility. Compliance with the HCS is not a "one shot deal." In order to have a successful program, it will be necessary to assign responsibility for both the initial and ongoing activities that have to be undertaken to comply with the rule. In some cases, these activities may already be part of current job assignments. For example, site supervisors are frequently responsible for on-the-job training sessions. Early identification of the responsible employees, and involvement of them in the development of your plan of action, will result in a more effective program design. Evaluation of the effectiveness of your program will also be enhanced by involvement of affected employees.








For any safety and health program, success depends on commitment at every level of the organization. This is particularly true





 












Page 267




for hazard communication. where success requires a change In behavior. This will only occur If employers understand the program, and are committed to its success, and if employees m motivated by the people presenting the information to them.








3. Identify Hazardous Chemicals in the Workplace.








The standard requires a list of hazardous chemicals in the workplace as part of the written hazard communication program. The list will eventually serve as an inventory of everything for which an MSDS must be maintained. At this point, however, preparing the list will help you complete the rest of the program since it will give you some idea of the scope of the program required for compliance in your facility.








The best way to prepare a comprehensive list is to survey the workplace. Purchasing records may also help, and certainly employers should establish procedures to ensure that in the future purchasing procedures re-suit In MSDSs being received before a material is used in the workplace.








The broadest possible perspective should be taken when doing the survey. Sometimes people think of "chemicals" as being only liquids in containers. The HCS covers chemicals in all physical forms-liquids, solids, gases, vapors, fumes. and mists-whether they are "contained" or not. The hazardous nature of the chemical and the potential for exposure are the factors which determine whether a chemical is covered. If it's not hazardous, it's not covered. If there is no potential for exposure (e.g., the chemical is inextricably bound and cannot be released), the rule does not cover the chemical.








Look around. Identify chemicals in containers, including pipes, but also think about chemicals generated in the work operations. For example, welding fumes, dusts, and exhaust fumes are all sources of chemical exposures. Read labels provided by suppliers for hazard information. Make a list of all chemicals in the workplace that are potentially hazardous. For your own Information and planning, you may also want to note on the list the location(s) of the products within the workplace, and an indication of the hazards as found on the label. This will help you as you prepare the rest of your program.








Paragraph (b) of this section, scope and application, includes exemptions for various chemicals or workplace situations. After compiling the complete list of chemicals. you should review paragraph (b) of this section to determine if any of the items can be eliminated from the list because they are exempted materials. For example, food, drugs, and coametics brought into the workplace for employes consumption are exempt. So rubbing alcohol in the first aid kit would not be covered.








Once you have compiled as complete a list as possible of the potentially hazardous chemicals in the workplace, the next step is to determine if you have received material safety data sheets for all of them. Check your files against the inventory you have Just compiled. If any are missing, contact your supplier and request one. It is a good idea to document them requests, either by copy of a letter or a note regarding telephone conversations. If you have MSDSs for chemicals that are not on your list, figure out why. Maybe you don't use the chemical anymore. Or maybe you missed it in your survey. Some suppliers do provide MSDSs for products that are not hazardous. These do not have to be maintained by you.








You should not allow employees to use any chemicals for which you have not received an MSDS. The MSDS provides information you need to ensure proper protective measures are implemented prior to exposure.








4. Preparing and Implementing a Hazard Communication Program








All workplaces where employees are exposed to hazardous chemicals must here a written plan which describes how the standard will be Implemented in that facility. Preparation of a plan is not just a paper exerciseall of the elements must be implemented in the workplace in order to be In compliance with the rule. See paragraph (e) of this section for the species requirements regarding written hazard communication programs. The only work operations which do not have to comply with the written plan requirements are laboratories and work operations where employees only handle chemicals in sealed containers. See paragraph (b) of this section, scope and application, for the specific requirements for these two types of workplaces.








The plan does not have to be lengthy or complicated. It is intended to be a blueprint for implementation of your programan as-surface that all aspects of the requirements have been addressed.








Many trade associations and other professional groups have provided sample programs and other assistance materials to affected employers. These have been very helpful to many employers since they tend to be tailored to the particular Industry involved. You may wish to investigate whether your industry trade groups have developed such materials.








Although such general guidance may be helpful, you must remember that the written program has to reflect what you are doing in your workplace. Therefore, if you use a generic program it must be adapted to address the facility it covers. For example, the written plan must list the chemicals present at the site, indicate who is to be responsible for the various aspects of the program in your facility. and indicate where written materials will be made available to employees.








If OSHA inspects your workplace for compliance with the HCS. the OSHA compliance officer will ask to see your written plan at the outset of the inspection. In general, the following items will be considered in evaluating your program.





 












Page 268




The written program must describe how a the requirements for labels and other forms of warning, material safety data sheets, and employee information and training, are going to be met in your facility The following discussion provides the type of information compliance officers will be looking for to decide whether those elements of the hazard communication program have been properly addressed:








A. Labels and Other Forms of Warning








In-plant containers of hazardous chemicals must be labeled, tagged, or marked with the identity of the material and appropriate hazard warnings. Chemical manufacturers, importers, and distributors are require to ensure that every container of hazardous chemicals they ship is appropriately labeled with such information and with the name and address of the producer or other responsible party. Employers purchasing chemicals can rely on the labels provided by their suppliers. If the material is subsequently transferred by the employer from a labeled container to another container, the employer will have to label that container unless it is subject to the portable container exemption. See paragraph (f) of tats section for specific labeling requirements.








The primary information to be obtained from an OSHA-required label Is an identity for the material, and appropriate hazard warnings. The identity is any term which appears on the label. the MSDS, and the list of chemicals, and thus links those three sources of information. The identity used by the supplier may be a common or trade name ("Black Maric Formula"), or a chemical name (1.1.1-trichloroethane). The hazard warm nit is a brief statement of the hazard-cue effects of the chemical ("flammable," "causes lung damage"). Labels frequently contain other information, such as precautionary measures ("do not use noir open flame''), but this information is provided voluntarily and is not required by the rule. Labels must be legible, and prominently displayed. There are no specific requirements for size or color, or any specified text.








With these requirements in mind, the compliance officer will be looking for the follow-ins types of information to ensure that labeling will be properly implemented in your facility:








1. Designation of person(s) responsible for ensuring labeling of in-plant containers:








2. Designation of person(s) responsible for ensuring labeling of any shipped containers;








3. Description of labeling system(s) used;








4. Description of written alternatives to labeling of in-plant containers (if used); and,








5. Procedures to review and update label information when necessary.








Employers that are purchasing and using hazardous chemicalsrather than producing or distributing themwill primarily be concerned with ensuring that every purchased container Is labeled. If materials are transferred into other containers, the employer must ensure that these are labeled as well, unless they fall under the portable container exemption (paragraph (f)(7) of this section). In terms of labeling systems, you can simply choose to use the labels provided by your suppliers on the containers. These will generally be verbal text labels, and do not usually include numerical rating systems or symbols that require special training. The most important thing to remember is that this is a continuing dutyall in-plant containers of hazardous chemicals must always be labeled. Therefore, it is important to designate someone to be responsible for ensuring that the labels are maintained as required on the containers in your facility, and that newly purchased materials are checked for labels prior to use.








B. Material Safety Dara Sheets








Chemical manufacturers and importers are required to obtain or develop a material safety data sheet for each hazardous chemical they produce or import. Distributors are responsible for ensuring that their customer, are provided a copy of these MSDSs. Employers must have an MSDS for each hazardous chemical which they use. Employers may rely on the information received from their suppliers. The specific requirements for material safety data sheets are in paragraph (g) of this section.








There is no specified format for the MSDS under the rule, although there are specific information requirements. OSHA has developed a non-mandatory format. OSHA Form 174, which may be used by chemical manufacturers and importer, to comply with the rule. The MSDS must be in English. You are entitled to receive from your supplier a data sheet which includes all of the Information required under the rule. If you do not receive one automatically, you should request one. If you receive one that is obviously inadequate, with, for example, blank spaces that are not completed, you should request an appropriately completed one. If your request for a data sheet or for a corrected data sheet does not produce the information needed. you should contact your local OSHA Area Office for assistance in obtaining the MSDS.








The role of MSDSs under the rule is to provide detailed information on each hazardous chemical, including its potential hazardous effects, its physical and chemical characteristics, and recommendations for appropriate protective measures. This information should be useful to you as the employer responsible for designing protective programs, as well as to the workers. If you are not familiar with material safety data sheets and with chemical terminology, you may need to learn to use them yourself. A glossary of MSDS terms may be helpful in this regard. Generally speaking, most employers using hazardous chemicals will primarily be concerned with MSDS information regarding hazardous effects and recommended protective measures. Focus on the sections of the MSDS that are applicable to your situation.





 












Page 269




MSDSs must be readily accessible to employees when they are in their work areas during their workshifts. This may be accomplished in many different ways. You must decide what is appropriate for your particular workplace. Some employers keep the MSDSs in a binder in a central location (e.g., in the pick-up truck on a construction site). Others, particularly in workplaces with large numbers of chemicals, computerise the information and provide access through terminals. As long as employees can get the information when they need it, any approach may be used. The employees must have access to the MSDSs themselvessimply having a system where the information can be read to them over the phone is only permitted under the mobile worksite provision, paragraph (g)(9) of this section, when employees must travel between worm during the shift. In this situation, they have access to the MSDSs prior to leaving the primary work-site, and when they return, so the telephone system is simply an emergency arrangement.








In order to ensure that you have a current MSDS for each chemical in the plant as required, and that employee access is provided, the compliance officers will be looking for the following types of information in your written program:








1. Designation of person(s) responsible for obtaining and maintaining the MSDSs;








2. How such sheets are to be maintained in the workplace (e.g., in notebooks in the work area(s) or in a computer with terminal access), and how employees can obtain access to them when they are in their work area during the work shift;








3. Procedures to follow when the MSDS is not received at the time of the first shipment;








4. For producers, procedures to update the MSDS when new and significant health information is found; and,








5. Description of alternatives to actual data sheets in the workplace, if used.








For employers using hazardous chemicals, the most important aspect of the written program in terms of MSDSs is to ensure that someone is responsible for obtaining and maintaining the MSDSs for every hazardous chemical in the workplace. The list of hazardous chemicals required to be maintained as part of the written program will serve as an Inventory. As new chemicals are purchased, the list should be updated. Many companies have found it convenient to include on their purchase orders the name and address of the person designated in their company to receive MSDSs.








C. Employee Information and Training








Each employee who may be "exposed" to hazardous chemicals when working must be provided information and trained prior to Initial assignment to work with a hazardous chemical, and whenever the hazard changes. "Exposure" or "exposed" under the rule means that "an employee is subjected to a hazardous chemical in the course of employment through any route of entry (inhalation, ingestion, skin contact or absorption, etc.) and Includes potential (e.g., accidental or possible) exposure." See paragraph (h) of this section for specific requirements. Information and training may be done either by Individual chemical, or by categories of hazards (such as flammability or carcinogenicity). If there are only a few chemicals in the workplace, then you may want to discuss each one Individually. Where there are large numbers of chemicals, or the chemicals change frequently, you will probably want to train generally based on the hazard categories (e.g., flammable liquids, corrosive materials, carcinogens). Employees will have access to the substance-specific information on the labels and MSDSs.








Information and training is a critical part of the hazard communication program. Information regarding hazards and protective measures are provided to workers through written labels and material safety data sheets. However, through effective information and training, workers will learn to read and understand such information, determine how it can be obtained and used in their own workplaces, and understand the risks of exposure to the chemicals in their workplaces as well as the ways to protect themselves. A properly conducted training program will ensure comprehension and understanding. It Is not sufficient to either Just read material to the workers, or simply hand them material to read. You want to create a climate where workers feel free to ask questions. This will help you to ensure that the information is understood. You must always remember that the underlying purpose of the HCS is to reduce the incidence of chemical source illnesses and injuries. This will be accomplished by modifying behavior through the provision of hazard information and information about protective measure. If your program works, you and your workers will better understand the chemical hazards within the workplace. The procedures you establish regarding, for example, purchasing, storage. and handling of these chemicals will improve, and thereby reduce the risks posed to employees exposed to the chemical hazards involved. Furthermore, your workers' comprehension will also be increased, and proper work practices will be followed in your workplace.








If you are going to do the training yourself, you will have to understand the material and be prepared to motivate the workers to learn. This is not always an easy task, but the benefits are worth the effort. More information regarding appropriate training can be found in OSHA Publication No. 2254 which contains voluntary training guidelines prepared by OSHA's Training Institute. A copy of this document is available from OSHA's Publications Office at (202) 219-4667.








In reviewing your written program with regard to information and training, the following items need to be considered:





 












Page 270




1. Designation of person(s) responsible for conducting training;








2. Format of the program to be used (audiovisuals, classroom instruction, etc.);








3. Elements of the training program (should be consistent with the elements in paragraph (h) of this section); and,








4. Procedure to train new employees at the time of their initial assignment to work with a hazardous chemical, and to train employees when a new hazard is introduced into the workplace.








The written program should provide enough details about the employer's plans in this area to assess whether or not a good faith effort is being made to train employees. OSHA does not expect that every worker will be able to recite all of the information about each chemical in the workplace. In general, the most important aspects of training under the HCS are to ensure that employees are aware that they are exposed to hazardous chemicals, that they know how to read and use labels and material safety data sheets, and that, as a consequence of learning this information, they are following the appropriate protective measures established by the employer. OSHA compliance officers will be talking to employees to determine if they have received training, if they know they are exposed to hazardous chemicals, and if they know where to obtain substance-specific information on labels and MSDSs.








The rule does not require employers to maintain records of employee training, but many employers choose to do so. This may help you monltor your own program to ensure that all employees are appropriately trained. If you already have a training program, you may simply have to supplement it with whatever additional information is required under the HCS. For example, construction employers that are already in compliance with the construction training standard (29 CFR 1926.21) will have little extra training to do.








An employer can provide employees information and training through whatever means are found appropriate and protective. Although there would always have to be some training on-site (such as informing employees of the location and availability of the written program and MSDSs), employee training may be satisfied in part by general training about the requirements of the HCS and about chemical hazards on the job which is provided by, for example, trade associations, unions, colleges, and professional schools. In addition, previous training, education and experience of a worker may relieve the employer of Mine of the burdens of informing and training that worker. Regardless of the method relied upon, however, the employer is always ultimately responsible for ensuring that employees are adequately trained. If the compliance officer finds that the training is deficient, the employer will be cited for the deficiency regardless of who actually provided the training on behalf of the employer.








D. Other Requirements








In addition to these specific items, compliance officers will also be asking the following questions in assessing the adequacy of the program:








Does a list of the hazardous chemicals exist in each work area or at a central location?








Are methods the employer will use to inform employees of the hazards of non-routine tasks outlined?








Are employees informed of the hazards associated with chemicals contained in unlabeled pipes In their work areas?








On multi-employer worksites, has the employer provided other employers with information about labeling systems and precautionary measures where the other employers have employees exposed to the initial employer's chemicals?








Is the written program made available to employees and their designated representatives?








If your program adequately addresses the means of communicating information to employees in your workplace, and provides an-ewers to the basic questions outlined above, it will be found to be in compliance with the rule.








5. Checklist for Compliance
