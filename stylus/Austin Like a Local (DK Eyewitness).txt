NICOLAI MCCRARY
Nicolai landed in Austin in 2008 and has called the city home ever since. When he's not pursuing his career in food photography, he can usually be found on one of Austin's many bike trails, trying out the latest taco trucks, or hosting Malaysian pop-up dinners around town.
JESSICA DEVENYNS
As they say, although she wasn't born in Texas, she got there as fast as she could. Jessi enjoys hiking through the beautiful Hill Country greenbelts, languishing away afternoons on patios with a coffee in hand, and learning to grow green things on urban farms.
JUSTINE HARRINGTON
Travel writer Justine moved to Austin to be with her people: rescue dog-loving outdoor enthusiasts and live music fans. She enjoys volunteering with Austin Mutual Aid and rallying for progressive causes. In her downtime, you'll probably find her browsing the city's indie bookshops.

Austin
WELCOME TO THE CITY
Cattle wranglers, football players, two-stepping old-timers: forget those time-worn images of Texas. This is Austin, a city that's as politically liberal and socially diverse as Texas is big. So what makes an Austinite? A love of tacos. Just kidding (well, kinda, this city is Tex-Mex obsessed). Austinites are laid-back, warm-hearted, and community spirited. This is a place where everyone is greeted with a "Hey y'all"; where the hippies who moved here in the 70s and techies who followed their companies to the Silicon Hills share a coffee shop; and where born-and-bred Texans and generations of immigrants spearhead campaigns to support their local theater or bookstore.
And, boy, have Austinites had to band together over the years. Flash floods, winter storms, and decades of segregation have all left their mark on the cityscape. Glinting skyscrapers over-look historic bungalows, and swanky cocktail bars sit kitty-corner to no-frills food trucks. And though rising rents have pushed out some of the music venues and honky-tonks that earned this city the title of "Live Music Capital of the World," Austin still moves to a unique beat.
"Keep Austin weird," locals cry. And beneath the facade of strip malls, chain restaurants, and big tech companies, Austin's quirky soul is alive and kicking in indie boutiques, offbeat graffiti, and downright wacky attractions. And that's exactly where this book will take you. We know the places that Austinites adore, from the BBQ joints they'll camp outside for to the swimming spots they'll linger in till late. Of course, these pages can't capture every local's experience but rather offer a snapshot of the city.
Whether you're a long-time local looking to shake up your routine or a visitor seeking inspiration for your first trip, this book will help you discover the real spirit of the city. So buckle up, and enjoy Austin the local way.
Austin | WELCOME TO THE CITY




Liked by the locals
"Austin is the biggest small town that you'll ever live in. I love the contrast of knowing the name of my neighborhood barista but also being able to see world-class music acts and art shows. I couldn't ask for more."
JESSICA DEVENYNS, WRITER

Austin
THROUGH THE YEAR
Escaping the heat is a common theme throughout the year, but Austin still has distinct seasons, each with their own traditions and events.





SPRING
FESTIVAL FUN
Despite a short winter, locals are still grateful for the arrival of spring. And in the Live Music Capital of the World, there's only one way to celebrate: at an outdoor music festival like SXSW or Pachanga Presents.



BLOSSOMING BLUEBONNETS
In March and April, the city comes to a halt - literally - as locals stop to admire deep-blue carpets of bluebonnets, the state flower, in their neighbors' gardens and on roadsides.


FARMERS' MARKETS
Each weekend, Austinites head to their nearest pop-up market to pick up farm-fresh produce, chow down on tacos from top-notch trucks, and enjoy live entertainment.






SUMMER
SUMMER SWIMS
Carrying coolers and inflatable tubes, locals seek relief from the sweltering temperatures at the city's swimming holes and outdoor pools.



OUTDOOR MOVIE THEATERS
As evenings become longer and warmer, screens pop up across Austin. Classic movies are enjoyed with picnic blankets, deck chairs, and ice-cold beers. The coolest screenings? Deep Eddy's Splash Party Movie Nights, held in Texas's oldest swimming pool.


THE GREAT ESCAPE
At the height of summer, Austin reaches melting point and locals flee the city in search of colder climes. They migrate to the Hill Country for walks and wine tastings, or relive their summer camp days with sleep outs in state parks.






FALL
PATIO PARTIES
After chasing air-conditioning for months, Austinites finally return to their beloved alfresco lifestyle with fall's easing temperatures. People (and their pooches) park up on patios for coffee, cocktails, and everything in between.



COMMUNITY CELEBRATIONS
Austinites are proud of their diverse city and celebrate its many communities. In fall, the LGBTQ+ community and its allies come together for Pride, while Latin American culture is celebrated on Mexican Independence Day and during Hispanic Heritage Month.


HARVEST TIME
Fall marks the start of the wine harvest season, and budding sommeliers flock to dedicated festivals and vineyards to sample the new vintages. Beer fans aren't forgotten, with breweries releasing seasonal brews, including pumpkin craft beers. Nothing says fall like a bit of spiced pumpkin, after all.






WINTER
HOLIDAY CHEER
Come December, the holidays get a uniquely Austin spin. Tacos are stuffed with turkey, musicians play Christmas tracks on repeat, and weird and wacky lights festoon 37th Street, including the likes of life-size, illuminated dinosaurs and fairy lights spelling out "Joy to the Weird."



POLAR PLUNGE
Whether winter brings mild or freezing temperatures, Austinites ring in the new year with a refreshing dip in a swimming hole on New Year's Day. Barton Springs hosts the biggest splash, with hordes of goose-pimpled revelers jumping in here.


FREE WEEK
Austinites know how to beat the postholiday blues - music. And during the first week of January, venues open their doors for music fans to enjoy hundreds of local music acts for free.

Austin
KNOW-HOW
There's an art to being an Austinite, from
                    the do's and don'ts of eating out to negotiating the city's streets. Here's a
                    breakdown of all you need to know.
For a directory of health and safety
                    resources, safe spaces, and accessibility information, turn to directory. For everything else, read
                    on.
EATAs you may have heard, Austin is a food truck haven, and locals
                    chow down on Tex-Mex, BBQ, and other street food at all hours of the day and
                    night. There are no real hard-and-fast rules when it comes to mealtimes, or when
                    to eat what. Tacos for breakfast? It's an Austin institution.
At upscale restaurants, reservations are a
                    must. But there's never a need to dress up - unless you want to, of course.
DRINKAustin's patio culture is legendary, and nearly every bar and
                    café has a cute outdoor spot. Locals are notoriously fond of day drinking, with
                    people chatting over frozen margaritas and glasses of Texan rosé at any time of
                    the day. Those who hold out till 4pm are generally rewarded with happy hour
                    deals.
That's not to say that it's all about boozing.
                    The coffee revolution has reached this corner of Texas, with cold brews
                    replacing standard drip coffees. And this health-conscious city takes juices and
                    smoothies very seriously.
SHOPThe phrase "keep Austin weird" is more than just a marketing
                    slogan - it's a way of life. Austinites prefer to shop at indie stores, farmers'
                    markets, and local boutiques over chain stores.
Most shops open around 10am, and close at 6pm.
                    Sales associates are generally helpful and friendly, so don't be surprised if
                    they start doling out advice and coaxing you toward a fitting room. Oh, and
                    although they're not outlawed, plastic bags are universally frowned upon, so
                    carry a tote.
ARTS &
                        CULTUREAustin's big museums and galleries aren't cheap to
                    enter, with some costing upward of $10. Fortunately, many have free admission
                    days. Theater tickets are similarly pricey, but you can find deals online. The
                    dress code is the same throughout Austin: jeans all the way.
NIGHTLIFEMusic is the lifeblood of the city and dominates the
                    nighttime scene. Nights out often start in the late afternoon with country music
                    at a honky-tonk or with a happy hour deal at a dive bar. After, locals push on
                    to a live music venue or club. Austinites don't pull all-nighters, especially as
                    most clubs close by 2am. Wherever you go, expect a low-key dress code and to
                    have to show ID.
OUTDOORSAustinites are an outdoorsy bunch. On sunny days, they
                    flock to the city's parks, greenbelts, and swimming holes to escape the heat.
                    Picnicking is permitted in the city's green spaces, but alcohol typically isn't.
                    Be sure to pick up your trash - littering carries a hefty fine (and dirty looks
                    from eco-conscious locals). Austin has a growing homeless population, so it's
                    not unheard of to be approached for food in the city's parks.




Keep in mind
Here are some tips and tidbits that will
                        help you fit in like a local.
» Keep cash handy Much of the city
                        is cashless, but a select few places remain cash only. So it's probably best
                        to carry both cards and dollars.
» No smoking Lighting up is a
                        definite no-no in public places, including parks, restaurants, and bars. If
                        you have to smoke, do so in a designated spot outside.
» Always tip Adding at least 15,
                        if not 20, percent to your bill is a must at restaurants, bars, and even
                        food trucks.
» Stay protected Wear a strong
                        sunblock and carry a water bottle with you at all times. This city is
                        hot.


GETTING
                    AROUNDAustin is a pretty small city - it measures just 7 miles by 7
                miles - and though it's built up of neighborhoods, some only comprise a handful of
                blocks. Generally speaking, though, locals think of Austin both physically and
                culturally as five distinct areas - north, south, east, west, and Downtown. Lady
                Bird Lake (or Town Lake, as it's called by locals) divides the north and south parts
                of the city, while Congress Avenue is the dividing line for addresses east and west.
                Bordered by Lamar Boulevard to the west and I-35 to the east, Downtown - the
                cultural center of the city - straddles both east and west. Austin is organized in
                not one but seven grid systems, meaning that some roads jut out at odd angles and
                streets that you would expect to be parallel, like West 28th and West 29th, are
                anything but. This can make navigation a little bit tricky at times.
To keep things simple, we've provided what3words
                addresses for each sight in this book, meaning you can quickly pinpoint exactly
                where you're heading.
On
                footThe car is king when it comes to Austin's roads, but some
                neighborhoods, like Downtown, The Drag, and Rainey, are wonderfully walkable. That
                being said, walking in the midday heat is not recommended. Stick to the sidewalks as
                much as possible, and if you do need to stop and check a what3words location, step
                to the side, out of the way.
On
                    wheelsBiking is not for the faint of heart here in car-happy
                Austin. If you're willing to brave it, avoid bigger roads like South Lamar
                altogether, wear a helmet, always signal when turning, and never listen to music
                while you ride.
The city's official bikeshare program, MetroBike,
                rents out bikes for one ride (for the bizarrely precise amount of $1.09 plus 23¢ per
                minute) or for 24 hours ($12.99). You can rent a MetroBike via the CapMetro and
                BCycle apps. Keep in mind that regardless of your pass or membership level, all
                MetroBikes must be returned to a docking station after 60 minutes. Yes, even if
                you've booked your bike for the whole day, you'll need to dock it every hour. Once
                you've docked your bike, you can check it back out for an additional hour using the
                    app.
By public
                    transportationThe Capital Metro Bus System covers the city, with 82
                routes and 1,600 bus stops. But don't be alarmed - it's easy to use. Buy a ticket
                via the CapMetro app before boarding or ask the driver for a Single Ride or Day Pass
                - just remember that you will need exact change. When you want to board, motion to
                the driver; then, when you're about a block from your destination, trigger the stop
                signal by pushing the button or pulling the cord.
By car or
                    taxiLike the rest of Texas, Austin is car-centric. So using a
                rideshare app or rental car is the way to go if you're planning on zipping around to
                different parts of the city in a short period of time. Some of the most popular
                rideshare apps include Uber, Lyft, and the nonprofit RideAustin. Taxis are less
                common than rideshares, but if that's more your style Lone Star Cab Austin and
                Yellow Cab Austin are good options.
When driving, avoid getting on I-35, the Interstate
                Highway that bisects the city to the east of Congress Avenue, at rush hour (or
                anytime, really) if you can help it - the traffic is real. Be aware that Downtown is
                full of confusing one-way streets and parking is scarce, so be prepared to fork out
                some cash to park in a garage if necessary.

Austin
NEIGHBORHOODS
Austin is a patchwork of old and new neighborhoods, each with its own character and community. Here we take a look at some of our favorites.
12th Street Cultural DistrictAfter the 1928 Austin city plan forced Black Americans to relocate to the east side of the city, 12th Street became a hub for Black-owned businesses. Today, it remains so, with food trucks and boutiques keeping the place buzzing. {map 2}
Barton HillsWhen outdoorsy Austinites want to escape the city, they head to leafy Barton Hills, an area known for its hiking trails, swimming spots, and scenic views. {map 6}
Central East AustinYou'd be hard-pressed to find an area with a better food scene than Central East's. Top-notch BBQ spots, taco trucks, and Italian bistros can all be found here. {map 2}
CherrywoodFamilies love this quiet enclave of East Austin where coffee shops and taco truck owners know every local's order. {map 3}
ClarksvilleFounded by freedman Charles Clark, this historic area was deprived of many basic utilities under the 1928 Austin city plan, until the 70s. Today, Clarksville attracts an arty crowd who hang out in the trendy local restaurants and wander around the area's many outdoor galleries. {map 4}
CrestviewThis northern corner may still cling to its slightly seedy history (spot the strip clubs), but its collection of cool bars and breweries tempts young professionals to make this 'hood their home. {map 6}
DowntownDuring the day, Austin's central business district is busy with techies putting in the hours. Come nightfall, the area's bars open their doors and office workers let loose on raucous 6th Street. {map 1}
The DragUT's local area is ruled by students staking out the coffee shops, browsing bookstores, and exploring the city's museums. On the weekend, families descend on these institutions for a cultural day out. {map 4}
East Cesar ChavezHistorically Mexican and Latin American, East Cesar Chavez is a colorful commotion of murals and independent boutiques. Unsurprisingly, you'll find some of the city's best Tex-Mex joints here, too. {map 2}
Hyde ParkHome to high-earning families, gorgeous Victorian houses, and popular juice bars and bakeries, Hyde Park is Austin at its most charming. {map 4}
MuellerThe city's old airport once occupied this site (hence the arrow-straight boulevards). After it closed in the 90s, the area was redeveloped as a sustainable residential community. These days, it's not the roar of jet engines you'll hear but the sounds of families relaxing in Mueller's modern parks and eco-conscious friends stocking up on veggies at the farmers' markets. {map 3}
North LoopLocals here (namely students and artists) will tell you North Loop is where Austin really stays weird. By and large the area's stores and homes have resisted the tide of gentrification. Expect anarchist bookstores, quirky bakeries, and eclectically decorated front yards. {map 4}
RaineyBars, bars, and more bars. Rainey's all about the good times, with neighborhood watering holes packed with young guns drinking under the fairy lights and listening to live music. {map 1}
Red River Cultural DistrictWant to know why Austin's called the "Live Music Capital of the World"? Head to Red River. Here, historic country music spots vie for space with heavy metal venues. The area's popular nightclubs keep the good vibes going late, too. {map 1}
South CongressSouth Congress - or SoCo as locals call it - was once the center of the counterculture that defined what keeps Austin weird. While swanky shops and boutique hotels have set up shop here, community bookstores and food trucks still serve the loyal locals. {map 5}
South FirstVintage clothes stores, third-wave coffeehouses, vibrant street art: SoCo's little sister is the epitome of laid-back cool, and Austin's hipsters love it. {map 5}
St. ElmoArt studios, distilleries, and coffee roasteries have taken over St. Elmo's industrial complexes and made this nonresidential patch a weekend hub for fun-loving locals. {map 6}
TarrytownHard to beat for that small-town feel, Tarrytown is known for its enviable (read: pricey) properties, bougie waterside cafés, and close-knit community. {map 6}

In Texas, a breakfast sandwich should consist
                    of fried chicken wedged between a pillowy biscuit. The best place in Austin to
                    get your hands on this classic dish? Bird Bird Biscuit. The biscuits are fluffy
                    yet flaky, the chicken is spiced and succulent, and it's all covered in either
                    bacon-infused chipotle mayo, basil pesto, or a mind-blowing BBQ sauce.

TAMALE HOUSE EAST
Map 2;
                    1707 East 6th Street, East Cesar Chavez; ///sheep.fast.kettles; www.tamalehouseeast.com
The Valeras are a culinary dynasty. Carmen
                    and Moses opened the first Tamale House in 1958, serving tamales (cornmeal
                    rolled with ground meat or beans, wrapped in corn husks, and steamed) from a
                    tiny window. Their five children followed suit, becoming restauranteurs, and
                    then their children caught the
                    bug, opening Tamale House East in 2012. This generation has added some
                    millennial touches to the business: a plant-filled patio, lengthy cocktail menu,
                    and weekend brunch accompanied by a live jazz band.

Just like the best diners, Joe's Bakery is
                    family-owned and serves breakfast all day, every day. But unlike traditional
                    American joints, Joe's is all about Tex-Mex dishes (this is Austin, after all).
                    Highlights include pork carne
                        guisada (slow-cooked pork) and migas tacos con todo (tortillas

If you grew up with a grandmother that could
                    make tacos half as good as Granny's, you should consider yourself lucky. And if
                    you didn't, you need to come here. Instead of keeping her grandmother's cooking
                    to herself, Maria Rios Vega decided to share her abuela's recipes with other
                    Austinites, turning an old ambulance into a taco truck in queso emergencies (sorry). The
                    morning crowd can't get enough of the egg-and-cactus breakfast tacos and chilaquiles (shredded chicken,
                    cheese, onions, and pickled jalapeños). Both are topped with a mind-blowing mole
                    sauce that will have you begging Maria for the recipe.

                    Black American pharmacist), the exterior is pretty pastel green, while inside is
                    replete with pentagon-patterned flooring and wooden cabinets lined with vintage

A day on the taco trail in
East Austin
Did we mention that Austinites love tacos? Originally hailing from south of the border, this Tex-Mex dish is emblematic of Austin's historic and cultural connection to Mexico. Historically home to the city's Mexican American community, East Austin is the best place to experience Mexican American culture, hopping between the neighborhood's many taco trucks and taquerias, museums, and cultural centers.

The bar was once a brothel masquerading as a massage parlor - in fact, a sign proclaiming "Midnight Cowboy Modeling Oriental Massage" still stands.

Whole Foods

Frustrated at the lack of organic produce in
                    Austin's supermarkets, hippie couple John Mackey and Renee Lawson set up Whole
                    Foods in 1980. It had a tough start - located in a 100-year flood zone, the
                    uninsured building was hit by the 1981 Memorial Day flash flood. But the
                    community rallied around the store, cleaning up, making repairs, and lending
                    money, and the flagship soon moved to this watertight location. Now owned by
                    corporate giant Amazon, it might seem like Whole Foods has forgotten its humble
                    beginnings, but this branch retains some of the store's original quirky charm -
                    like a rooftop dining area that turns into an outdoor ice rink each winter.

Austin's century-old theater was once the home of the legendary Sam Houston's War Department of the Republic of Texas. The alumni is just as legendary: ever heard of the Marx Brothers or Houdini? Today, this historic (and rumored haunted) venue hosts a variety of acts - from 70mm movie showings to sold-out Sheryl Crow concerts.

What was once a sex toy factory in East Austin is now The Museum of Human Achievement (www.themuseumofhumanachievement.com) - a multidisciplinary arts space that hosts a variety of offbeat film screenings, immersive installations, live theater productions, and more. But that's about all we can tell you. Visitors have to become a member of MoHa to get the address and the calendar of events. Are you getting cult vibes yet? Because you should be.

Three years later, he awoke to hundreds of outraged texts and tweets telling him that his mural had been painted over by a new art gallery. With the neighborhood's historically Black population dwindling as a result of rising rents, the destruction of the mural became a symbol of the area's gentrification and whitewashing. (Despite the fact that Las Cruxes, the gallery responsible for the mural's destruction, promotes Mexican American culture.)

                Americans were relocated to "Six Square"- the six square miles east of what is now

                    exactly where you'll find Volstead Lounge. It's kinda like a gritty dive bar
                    cosplaying as a cool nightclub, and it's kept the best bits of both: the city's
                    hottest DJs and occasional live music acts, New Orleans-style cocktails and
                    tallboy beers, an intimate interior and a huge, no-frills patio. What's not to

Volstead shares its patio with
                            neighboring bar, Hotel Vegas, so you can hop between the two with

As well as the highest concentration of music venues in the US, this area lures fans with brimming record stores; fun music museums; and quirky, guitar-themed gift shops that stay open well into the evening.

ANN AND ROY BUTLER HIKE-AND-BIKE TRAIL
Map 5; start at Lamar Bridge, Downtown; ///star.competent.magical; www.austintexas.gov
The Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail has a story that sounds like something out of US sitcom Parks and Recreation. In 1971, Ann Butler (wife of mayor Roy Butler) met up with her friend (and First Lady) Lady Bird Johnson in London, England. Sat on a patio overlooking the Thames Path, they were struck with the idea of creating a river trail in their hometown. The women started fundraising immediately, with Ann roping in local garden clubs to maintain the plants. The result was coined the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail. But that's a mouthful, so most locals just call this 10-mile (16-km) path the Town Lake Trail. Now surrounded by skyscrapers and punctuated with modern sculptures, the path's landscape may have changed, but it's still the community space that Ann and Lady Bird envisaged.
» Don't leave without caffeinating up at The Perch on the northern shore of the lake. This coffee shop has a perennially sun-drenched patio that'll be hard to leave when it's time to continue on the trail.

» Don't leave without trying some two-step at Gruene hall, the oldest continually running dance hall in Texas.

SAN ANTONIO
1.5-hour drive from Austin; www.visitsanantonio.com
When Austin starts to feel a little small, culture-craving 20-somethings hop on the train to San Antonio. It's the next big city south of the capital, and it's packed with things to do. On the bucket list? The iconic Alamo monument to Texas independence, the Japanese Tea Gardens, and the gorgeous River Walk. But that's not all. This city is also home to the Texas grocery institution H-E-B - okay, we know it doesn't sound super exciting, but shelves lined with Texan brands really get the locals hyped. Young guns also love the long roster of festivals San Antonio hosts; head over when the Fiesta Primavera or Dia de Los Muertos events are on and you'll see the very best of this lively city.

Not to go on about the booze in the Hill Country, but we've got one more recommendation for y'all: wine-lover's haven Fredericksburg. This day trip destination is the epicenter of the Texas wine movement and a favorite among groups dressed in their summer best and couples partial to a glass of the good stuff. And with 50 local vineyards here, plus some of the Hill Country's best fine-dining options, it's easy to see why.

A day out in
idyllic Zilker
Austin is an oasis in an arid state, and locals take advantage of the great outdoors at every opportunity. And nowhere is this more evident than in the wonderfully green, waterfront neighborhood of Zilker. Come the weekend, Austinites flock here to work up a sweat, take a dip in the water, and soak up the city views while chilling out in a park or on a patio.

Route map

6. Savor plant-based fare at
ATX FOOD CO.
517 South Lamar Boulevard, Zilker; www.atxfoodco.com ///enabling.rescue.rankings
Cardiologist Dr. Joel Kahn serves up 100 percent plant-based dishes from his bright green truck. Tuck into some vegan tacos and then grab some sea moss to go.

Meet the illustrator
Award-winning British illustrator David Doran is based in a studio by the sea in Falmouth, Cornwall. When not drawing and designing, David tries to make the most of the beautiful area in which he's based; sea-swimming all year round, running the coastal paths and generally spending as much time outside as possible.
