Preface

The core topic of the book is the explore the methodologies that help UX practitioners keep the user in the center of any solution presented. The book takes readers on a journey with personal insights to discover everything about the user: their goals, pain points, and behavior. We will investigate practices for analyzing and theming all research data and sharing it effectively. Later, we will discuss fixing the problem, i.e., how simple design can create powerful solutions and ensure that you're continually improving your product, service, or experience.
This book is meant for students, early career practitioners, and professionals who wish to learn more about the methodologies applied for UX research and design. Scaling teams and working with people who might come from different backgrounds and have varying skillsets is part of understanding cross-functional teams and educating and understanding key stakeholders.
This book is divided into 15 chapters that will cover UX core practices, key methodologies for user research, and exploration of the idea of end-user as primary stakeholder. This book is not an exhaustive solution to user research or user experience design, but it acts as a summary of the author's personal experiences in the domain.
Chapter 1: It's tempting for product teams to make assumptions about who they're developing the product for. The first chapter explores the importance of starting with the user and working backward. Developers, designers, and stakeholders have lot of insider knowledge and must step out of their studios to get a grasp of their users' reality. Biases restrict startups from succeeding and products going to market. Embracing the detail from user research allows companies to earn the right to build products for their customers.
Chapter 2, 3 and 4: In these chapters, we will look at the various types of user research methods. The next chapter heavily relies on a four-part matrix that focuses on the quantitative and qualitative axis and the observational and attitudinal axis. Each quadrant is summarized, and each method is listed, described, and explained. The pros and cons of each quadrant are explained, and this chapter aims to point the reader toward observational research, i.e., being able to see what users do.
Chapter 5: With so much user research data, it's important to get clarity of everything. To avoid getting swamped, we will look at ways to help the reader understand the research via themes. 
Chapter 6: This and the following chapters explore how to articulate and communicate the research data in useful ways, or in other words, finding what to focus on and telling the story of research. These methods show how to showcase the research findings in useful ways, especially for stakeholders.
The chapter takes you through how to ensure that you're building the right product for the audience. It also looks at how to prioritize based on meeting the goals of users rather than just building features.
Chapter 7: By the time you reach this chapter, you should have a firm understanding of the priorities and user research that are driving a product's development. This chapter looks at multiple ways to start designing solutions to the problem.
Chapter 8: Continuing the journey, we will explore the many ways of designing a solution. This chapter emphasizes on the fact that it's more cost effective to iterate with low-quality design than to spend money creating expensive-spec designs.
Chapter 9, 10, and 11: In these chapters, we will explore the world of user-centered design, which will transform the way you create experiences. You will learn to create products that provide maximum value to the customer to save you time and money. You will also learn to develop strong empathy for the user, which will help you create usable software. Creating credible and desirable software for the user will help improve sales conversions and make users stay loyal to your products. Finally, you will learn that deploying interfaces that are findable will cut your organizational support costs.
Chapters 12, 13 and 14: In the last few chapters of the book, you will study how continuous deployment can work in any organization, and how you can create a roadmap to continually improve your product, system, or service. This includes looking at methods for tracking, benchmarking, and iterating.
Chapter 15: Summarizing the final chapter to cover everything again. Explain how the author hopes that the book is practical and up to date. Mention how 'always learning' is important. 
I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did while working on it. UX is always an organizational responsibility, but for the end user, we, the practitioners, are the only voice at the table. However, user advocacy does not qualify us to assume the character of our users. This is simply because you are not the user.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction - You're Not the User




Introduction
One of usability's most hard-earned lessons is that 'you are not the user.'; concludes, Jakob Nielsen, one of the founding fathers in the domain of studying modern user experience design, in his 2006 article titled 'Growing a Business Website: Fix the Basics First'.
While the summary of the article states that "Clear content, simple navigation, and answers to customer questions have the biggest impact on business value ", everyone who has written or read a brief from a client, manager, or product owner would instantly identify with these words.
Still, the need to establish a connection between 'clear content and simple navigation' while being told that 'you are not the user' never quite goes the distance in practice or gets the due it deserves.
It's tempting for product teams to make assumptions about who they're building for. This chapter explores the importance of starting with the user and working backward. Developers, designers, and stakeholders have too much insider knowledge and must step out of their studio to get a grasp of their users' realities.
Biases restrict startups from succeeding and products from going to market. Embracing the detail from the user research allows companies to earn the right to build products for their customers.
Structure
We will cover the following topics in this chapter:

The ivory tower: OECD study results
Different biases, and how to avoid them
Assumptions
Get out of the building concept
Defining user experience
Start with the user and work backward

Objectives
The biggest pitfall of any user experience design exercise remains the fact that often a manager, a client or even a UX practitioner themselves begins to believe that they know everything there is to know about the end users. This assumption has led to numerous failures and caused millions of dollars to go down the drain. The objective of this chapter is to encourage practitioners to take a deep breath and think at least once - what if I am wrong? 
We will look at some hard data sources and findings of deep studies before looking at standard (or vanilla) practices to finding the best UX there is for your product or service.
The ivory tower - OECD study results
An ivory tower is a symbolic placeâor an atmosphereâwhere people are happily cut off from the rest of the world in favor of their pursuits, usually mental and esoteric ones.
In the modern-day scenario, it means living in one's bubble, oblivious to (or refusing to acknowledge) other paths of life and challenges that people face in their lives.
Once we learn to perform a new task, we assume that it should not be difficult for others since we command the new skill at ease. It may have taken us a lot of time and effort, but once we get a hang of it, the sense of ease for the task overshadows the complexities we faced while learning. Riding a bicycle, swimming, driving a car, typing without having to look at the keyboard, playing any musical instrument, juggling three eggs while jumping on a trampoline - if you can do any of this, can you remember the time when you couldn't? Can everyone do these things? Is there anything on this list that is not feasible to achieve?
Similarly, when we are dwelling on new digital eco-systems, debating about skeuomorphism's demise, trying out new Git repositories, exploring a new plugin for Sketch, or discussing the latest features and design language upgrades from iOS - remember that not everyone makes a head or tail of what you are talking about.
The skills study
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), published a report in 2016 titled Skills Matter: Further results from the survey of adult skills.
The research focused on data from 2011 to 2015 from the 33 industrialized nations about how technology skills vary among a broad population. The research was aimed at people who are between 16 to 65 years of age. The survey targeted at least 5,000 people in each country to quantify their findings, which meant a total of 2,15,942 participants.
The age range here is a significant factor, as they did the research to measure the digital skills of the workforce, excluding people above 66 years of age. Since it has been pointed may times over countless studies that the elderly come with specific sets of usability needs and have significantly lower skills when it comes to digital interactions, exclusion of this sample demographic means that the general population has even lower skills than presented in the findings of this report.
The tests were conducted on similar toolsets to serve an equal number of complexities to users. Each participant was asked to perform 14 computer-based tasks on simulated software in a controlled testing environment in the user's preferred language of communication.
The participants were asked to perform tasks with various levels of difficulties. The easiest task had clear instructions to follow, 'reply to all three people in the mail thread' - explicit, direct, single step and with a single constraint of three people.
The complex task was to schedule and book a meeting room based on the information gathered from referencing multiple emails in a scheduling application. For many of us who have become accustomed to checking mutually shared calendars and booking meeting rooms with options for virtual participation from people in multiple time zones, this may feel like an everyday chore.
Instructions for this supposedly difficult task were implicit. There was a degree of switching and referencing between data sources that was required. The cognitive load and emotional pressure of not making a mistake while trying to perform a task that may be simpler without the use of a computer may be too much for some users.
The results
In broader strokes, the report concludes that across the 33 rich countries where the study was conducted, only 5% of the population has high computer-related abilities, and only one in three people can complete medium-complexity tasks.
The participants were divided into four levels of proficiency based on their abilities to complete tasks of various difficulties:

Level <1

14% of the adult population
Tasks in this category were singular, explicit, and direct action based
The participants in this category were able to perform simple tasks such as deleting an email message in an app
Level 1

29% of the adult population
Tasks in this category may require a few steps and minimal or optional operators
The email reply to all the people in the existing thread is an example of level 1 complexity
Level 2

26% of the adult population
Tasks at this level can be generic or specific technology operations that may be explicit and may involve multiple steps and operators
An example task would be to find a financial report sent to you by a client at the end of the last quarter
Level 3

5% of the adult population
This is where the most skilled participants were categorized
The tasks typically require the use of both generic and more specific technology applications where the task may include multiple steps and operators
The scheduling task from the example above falls under this category, or an example can be determining how many people have sent emails for overlapping holidays for Thanksgiving

And yes, you are correct when calculating that the total number of participants in each of these categories only gets to 74%.
Now hear this, over a quarter of the participants, which is a mountainous 26%, did not perform any task as they cannot use a computer at all.
This is your level 0.
The following figure explains the graphical representation of the OECD skills study results.



Figure 1.1: The stacked bar graph represents the country-wise distribution of people's proficiency level in using computers
Now, imagine that you have designed a screen where a user can book a meeting by cross-referencing participants; invite multiple stakeholders in multiple time zones; and it would be easy to perform this task. 
Think again.
Your computer skills are in the top 5% to 8% of the entire population of 33 of the richest countries in the world. Thinking from another point of view, about 95% in the US cannot use computers as efficiently as you can.
Where does it lead us?
You can do a lot on computers, but everyone cannot.
Deciding on behalf of the users is simply preventing them from using your design.
If your designed solution cannot be used by people who are categorized in level 1 of the proficiency matrix, you are serving only one-third of the population. Here are a few things to remember when designing for people at level 1:

Ensure that little or no navigation is needed to access information
Only a few steps and minimal operators are required
Keep the criteria explicit
Limited need to switch between information sources
Provide shortcuts, transformations, and helpers
Keep the information uniform

You are not the user.
Different biases, and how to avoid them
Acknowledging the fact that translation of a requirement coming from a specific industry is a task in itself. The clients would sometime have a vague idea about how the application will help them grow their business or the industry it is going to support without a clue about what the actual flow or interaction of the said solution will be. It becomes the duty of the practitioner to educate and guide the clients about how their users will navigate from point A to point B.
Sometimes, this consolidation of user journeys with the client-end stakeholders, based on the client requirements for the solution, takes multiple interactions and iterations and is often misjudged as user research.
Consolidating the requirement with the client and getting them onboarded with the ABCs of how a software works (i.e., why they have to support a recover password feature, why they cannot charge the user without their consent, or why an admin should not be able to see the passwords from the backend) is not the same as understanding the end-user from a specific domain who is targeted for the solution in question.
Contrary to the scenario mentioned above, clients sometimes come for UX consultation with all the knowledge available to them from their solution domain and UX design from endless nights spent over online publications.
You are presented with PDFs full of paper sketches, sample design styles, and exotic interaction design concepts they wish to incorporate somewhere in the application. The request here is to deliver a product so cool that it will be the next big thing and become an overnight success, catapulting them on the ways of Mark, Jeff, or Bill (See, no last name necessary).
In this case, it feels tempting for the design teams to churn out the best of the style guides and design systems to sway the next Steve. And why not?
This time, you finally got the opportunity to work with a client who understands what A11Y means or what NNG stands for or who has meticulously prepared the subscription plans for all the user types going to use their application or (let's be honest) already has the wireframes.
In both the above-mentioned scenarios, ignoring the end users remains the common factor.
In the process of educating the client, the UX practitioner unwittingly explains the design decisions to someone who belongs to the industry. In the other, the Rockstar client explains the design and flow of the application to the designer with an air of assured confidence that all the choices made in the definitions are common for the targeted industry.
The marshlands of cognitive dissonance are ready to swallow both the projects.
These dissonances can be listed in dozens and may have their books in the process, but within the context of user-experience design, here are the four most common types of cognitive biases:

Framing bias
Confirmation bias
False-consensus bias
Friendliness bias

For designers and UX practitioners, it is easy to fall prey to these biases. Once you are attached to any information, our brain processes it for understanding. Co-relating any piece of information is how we sort and store information in our brains, and this information is processed for knowledge-based implementation based on the need.
Here is a closer look at these biases and how we need to deal with them in practice.
Framing bias
In both scenarios, the UX practitioner or designer has become the subject of framing ideas. In most UX design solutions, there are no single right or wrong answers, and by being subjected to framing, you are likely to favor the context in which the ideation part of the project is explained, either by you or the client.
A counterargument to the above observation can be presented as there can be no testing with the end users without a hypothesis. However. even in presenting hypotheses, there should be satisfactory pieces of evidence presented from the devil's advocate.
To avoid the traps of framing sans context, Kathryn Whitenton, in her 2016 article 'Decision Frames: How Cognitive Biases Affect UX Practitioners', recommends a three-pronged approach:

Resist the urge to make a snap judgment
Gather more context before deciding
Experiment with different frames 

Take your time to decide on the solution, be assured and learn more about the intention or purpose of the solution requested, and finally, see if there is any scope for alternatives to the solution chosen.
Confirmation bias
Noble prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman, who was honored for his work on the psychology of judgment and decision-making as behavioral economics, said in an interview with Drake Baer in 2017 that confirmation bias exists "when you have an interpretation, and you adopt it, and then, top-down, you force everything to fit that interpretation."
We all have our preconceived notions about the greatness of our favorite players, musicians, actors, politicians, race, religion, sexual orientations, and even clothing choices of strangers at the bus stop.
When we come across a client or a project where the requirement or details provided for the solution are unclear, the 'homework protocol' in our heads tries to put a recognizable shape to the solution. We rely on our previously gathered information and try to make sense of what is being asked for this time around.
In the first example of the client where you had to handhold them in the process of shaping their product, the practitioner risks falling into the trap of confirmation bias. Since the requirements are not clear, the shape of the product has to be conceived by the pre-existing point of reference in the practitioner's mind.
In the second case of a self-assured client, the admiration of their pre-preparedness, which would have cost you weeks, if not months, of discovery exercises, may hinder the scope of any doubts on the views presented by the client.
The bias of confirmation can grow to the levels where presented facts are discarded in favor of what is known to the individual who is making the decision. The most common sight of confirmation bias on public internet can be seen in the form of closed surveys on Twitter.
The confirmation bias can be avoided by asking the right questions, with scope for further discussions. Quantitative surveys with diverse groups and demographics are one of the go-to solutions. A large sample size allows the result to not be influenced by one group's views on the subject.
As is the case with democratic elections, there are always going to be opposing voices questioning the validity of these election results. It becomes a UX practitioner's job to keep the sanctity of the gathered data and ensure that the right outcome is implemented in the product.
False-consensus bias
Everyone has a bit of history and a background full of different circumstances that they faced while growing up. These life lessons give each one of us a unique perspective of life. While deciding on a design or an idea, these perspectives or filters influence the decision.
When a decision is made, it puts the decision-maker in a place where they may assume that majority of the people will agree with the decision they have made.
In April 1976, Stanford University's Journal of experimental social psychology published a paper by Lee Ross, David Greene, and Pamela House, titled: 'The "False Consensus Effect": An Egocentric Bias in Social Perception and Attribution Processes'.
The study begins with, "Evidence from four studies demonstrates that social observers tend to perceive a 'false consensus'", concerning the relative commonness of their responses.
In one of the studies, a group of 104 students was asked to wear a sandwich signboard to promote a local restaurant across campus for 30 minutes They were free to accept or reject this request.

62.2% of the students who agreed to this request thought that everyone will do the same
67% of the students who refused to wear the sign were certain that no one else would agree to this outlandish request

Most decision-makers in both scenarios were confident that what they decided was the consensus.
As a UX practitioner, the most common way of walking into this bias is forming survey questions or hypotheses for user journeys.
There is a simple way of avoiding the False-consensus bias, which is writing down and avoiding anything that starts with phrases like, 'why would anyone...' or 'everyone knows that...' or 'in this day and age...'.
When discussing or brainstorming a project, ensure that there is someone designated to note down any and every assumption from the conversation. These assumptions can be placed at the heart of the theory presented and must later be validated by user testing.
In a globalized world, while products are targeted for an audience base that may spread across continents, this bias can pretty much nip the products in their buds. Doing user research with a variety of methods with an audience that comes from diverse backgrounds and following rules to avoid framing and confirmation biases are the only ways to get ahead of the curve here.
Friendliness bias
If we go by the knowledge of biases discussed in this chapter so far, it becomes apparent that user testing as a practice has all the answers one seeks for avoiding all the biases.
Does this always hold?
Maybe not.
Since childhood, we've been taught that there are always right or wrong answers, and we've been taught to be polite and considerate of others' feelings.
When someone shows you something they created, for which they may have spent a lot of time and effort, our first instincts are to say something nice on the onset. This remains the case when a user testing session is conducted. In a user testing session, the following is expected from the participant:

Not feel threatened on their knowledge or understanding of the system tested
Speak truthfully about what they feel
Be expressive and explicit about their likes and dislikes

To expect that level of directness in responses, we should be testing with Vulcans.
When meeting and greeting our participant, behaviors of facilitators should not, in any way, be a factor that may cause skewed responses. The participant may react in a way to agree to what is being presented or may choose to disagree with everything asked of them, depending upon the degree to which they like the facilitator.
The principle of least effort, as proposed by Italian philosopher Guillaume Ferrero in 1894 and also known as Zipf's law after linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who wrote "Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort: An Introduction to Human Ecology", first published in 1949, postulates that animals, people, and even well-designed machines will naturally choose the path of least resistance or "effort".
To put this in context, it is often observed that the participants in a user testing session or study tend to agree to anything the facilitator puts in front of them. This behavior to get over with the given assignment with least or no resistance leads to tainted results.
Whatever the cause, friendliness bias can damage a well-intended effort and study in a way that can have severe consequences over the product.
To be cautious is the key.

First and foremost, ensure that multiple methods of research and data collection are in place
Removing oneself from the picture or limiting face-to-face interactions can help
Using someone from outside the team to perform facilitator duties where they can mention no previous association with the project to the participant can also help
In a quantitative survey, ask to the point and direct questions; avoid survey fatigue where participants start clicking on options at random

Being doubtful about the proposed solution should be a part of the job description for any UX practitioner. Choosing the correct method of user testing, leveraging on the outcome, ensuring iterations on new knowledge, and always keeping a blank slate help.
Assumptions
As a rule of thumb, some sort of logo or icon of the branding is present on the websites. And when asked why you have not placed a link called 'Home' in your primary navigation, the usual answer is that they can get back to the home page by clicking on the icon or logo of the brand.
There are two major assumptions in the statements above:

There is no evidence backing the rule of thumb for the said logo or branding icon.
It was assumed that everyone knows that if they click on the logo at the top, they will be redirected to the home page.

Is this how you make design decisions?
Is this how you navigate on web-based applications and websites?
I was surprised to see a close friend of mine who works in a different trade than me, using double-click on web pages when we first started visiting cyber-cafes over weekends for fun. It was over 20 years ago. Then, I observed this behavior several times in many others, most recently in early 2020.
For almost every one of them, it was the force of habit since a majority of the computer interaction they had involved using a mouse to navigate on local computers to browse and open files. The rest was done by minimal mouse interactions to either manage accounting documents or edit spreadsheets or for desktop publishing.
When introduced to the internet, they instinctively double-clicked on the hyperlinks, like they did to open local documents.
Have you ever designed an interaction where a user has to double-click for a web-based interaction?

Did you propose it, or was it recommended by one of the clients or managers?
What was the rationale behind this interaction?
Was there any tutorial or guide prepared to teach the user about this method of interaction?
Was it user-tested?

An assumption is part of an argument that we take for granted without any supporting evidence. It depends on our faith in its truthfulness.
Assumptions differ from biases. A bias is leans toward a specific option from the presented few. The assumption is being certain that the chosen option is the truth because our gut tells us so.
Like our responses to various subjects and situations in life, there are many common assumptions with user experience design practices. These assumptions are formed over time with our own experiences, culture, education, and beliefs.
In UX, there are certain assumptions that we must validate with user research. Just call the panel already if any discussion related to project requirement includes the following assumptions.
Modern-day assumptions
A few years ago, a consulting agency recommended the state government of Madhya Pradesh, India, to employ a mobile app to monitor attendance of teachers at schools located in remote rural regions of the state.
Once the teacher reaches their school, the link to mark their attendance is enabled automatically, based on the geo-fencing marked for the school. This way, the government can keep an eye on absconding teachers.
The assumptions, as you may notice, were all over the place:

That each teacher owned a smartphone
Each smartphone that the teachers owned had geo-location sensors
All teachers had a subscription to mobile internet
Each school's co-ordinates were accurate for geo-fencing
And each school had a working network coverage for mobile broadband internet

We are still not talking about skills, operation capacity, handicap, carrier charges, storage on phone, or privacy concerns for the owners of mobile devices.
The application for e-attendance monitoring of teachers was launched with a lot of fanfare. It soon resulted in something that no government officials want to be associated with at all, let alone be the cause of it: a mass protest, boycott, and a legal court case.
Just because you have it, assuming that everyone is at the same level of access to technology as you do is one of the prime traps that needs careful evaluation when putting the requirement definitions forward.
Convenient generalizations
That home button discussion mentioned earlier is an example of this case.
In discussions with a colleague when talking about accessibility, the issue of font sizing for websites came along. She argued that browsers can allow zooming in on text and images, and the same is supplemented by pinch-and-zoom on trackpads and touch screens. So, we do not need to add this functionality in our designs but just need to define relative font sizing in CSS.
Another colleague joined in the discussion with a factoid that he read in an article that quoted a study where a significant number of users did not understand the meaning of the widget icon used on numerous websites for font resizing.
Assumptions like these can be laid to rest by going the route of demographic definitions for the user groups and testing against the target personas.
Just because you know it doesn't mean everyone else does too.
Expecting people to understand
The principle of affordance in UX design needs to be argued more often when designing interactions. Hover actions, which are common for people with cursor-based devices, become obsolete when the website or application is accessed on a touch device.
I was part of a team where we had to deliver UX for a Silicon Valley-based tech conglomerate. The catch in the exercise was that the cloud-based platform services product that we were working on already came with certain interaction design definitions that we had to follow.
A sample in the case is, while presented with a table, a user can:

Hover over a table row to discover a slider tray with icons for various operations that changed based on the table
A single-click interaction to inline edit certain values in the row that cannot be edited otherwise
A double-click interaction to open the details of the row data

While the original guide, presented half a decade earlier by a San Francisco based niche studio, only had a minimal viable product (MVP) in mind, style mattered more than substance.
Now, after years of development and numerous screens in multiple modules later, the mammoth application requires a major effort in time and budget to fix all the UX issues that have infested the entire application.
Many rounds of user testing on the existing user experience have consolidated the evidence that majority of the platform users prefer accessing the application on their tablet devices. They preferred the web version on their large touchscreen devices as on-the-go is the priority for them since the mobile app does not support all the features.
Fixing issues with redesigning
A redesign never assures improvement in product quality from the one before. Throughout history, we have many examples of such efforts that faced massive backlashes and had to be reverted to their original state.
A quick Google search will take you straight to the hall of infamy that includes Pepsi, Gap, Xerox, Burberry, Kraft, JCPenney, Mastercard, and numerous others.
The following image shows a redesign fail by Mastercard:



Figure 1.2: A failed attempt by Mastercard at rebranding where the company had to go back to its logo's original design. 
Coca-Cola had to add the word 'classic' in all their future production because of a failed experiment in 1882 with the recipe where they tried to change the taste for the first time in 99 years.
More than just logo change, companies like Tropicana lost more than $50 million in 2009, before returning to the old and trusted brand positioning (refer to Figure 1.3).
The following figure shows the Tropicana re-rebranding:



Figure 1.3: There-and-back-again
In digital experiences, a redesign is commonly referred to as an update in the style guide of the end products, with the latest trends and platform standards for native mobile apps. In a rush to update the fonts from Helvetica to San Francisco or a Google's Material Design guideline implementation with REACT on the web application front-end, how many times do we ask the questions about what was right in the existing product? What made the product come this far?
Test the existing product with users to learn more about what works, what does not work, what brings delight to users, and what is the scale of redesign we are looking at here.
Addressing assumptions
There are four parts of the process to consolidate knowledge and conclude the study:

We ask questions about things we do not know
We assume about things we think we know
Putting questions and assumptions together, we have a hypothesis to test
After testing, we are left with facts, which is what we know

Testing assumptions with practices recommended to avoid biases is the only path leading to risk management and truly putting the user in the center for user-centered design.
Get out of the building concept
The father of modern entrepreneurship and lean startup movement, Steve Blake narrates a humbling tale from his early days in a marketing career. It was from one of the early system-planning meetings for the supercomputers company Ardent.
"Engineering was discussing how sophisticated the graphics portion of our computer should be, debating cost and time-to-market tradeoffs of arcane details such as double-buffering, 24 versus 32-bits of color, alpha channels, etc."
As he was participating in discussions with the teams for quite some time and felt proud of being able to understand all the technical and engineering discussions, he was confident enough to present his opinion in the meeting.
"I think our customers will want 24-bits of double-buffered graphics."
The CEO, who was heading this meeting, with the full capacity of his team present, first confirmed with Steve that he heard him correctly, and then he lashed out.
"You don't know a damn thing about what these customers need! You've never talked to anyone in this market, you don't know who they are, you don't know what they need, and you have no right to speak in any of these planning meetings."
Further insults followed, which made Steve confident in believing that he was fired.
As he got up from his chair and was about to open the door to get out of there, the CEO said, "I want you out of the building talking to customers; find out who they are, how they work, and what we need to do to sell them lots of these new computers."
In the age of mobile internet, there are over 700 apps launched each day on Google and Apple platforms. For any entrepreneur, it is easier than ever to launch their application with the help of ready-to-assemble platforms and offshore development agencies.
With a low barrier to entry comes higher competition. The only differentiator in the success and failure of these startups that Steve recommends is whether the culture of the organization is set for user success.
His lessons:

An intelligent opinion is still a guess
The dumbest person with a fact trumps anyone with an opinion
There are no facts inside the building, so get the heck outside

If you do not know your customers, who are you solving for?
Defining user experience
The primary goal for good user experience is to provide the exact solution that the user is looking for in a simple, effective, and direct manner.
User experience (UX) is not just the user interface (UI) or the exploration of design ideas with wireframes and prototypes.
According to Don Norman and Jakob Nielson, "User experience encompasses all aspects of the user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products."
It starts with demographic identification, a study of behavioral patterns - existing and responsive to your proposed solutions, and any historically available data.
Jacob Nielson has often emphasized that some data is always better than no data.
Looking at the competition and their best practices, studies, and response from their users will give you excellent insights to set business goals and expectations.
Now, looking at this behavior data, with competitor analysis, heuristic analysis of the existing solutions, and combining it with any qualitative and quantitative research data, will give us clear sets of parameters to define our user personas.
Once we have these personas at hand, the next steps are to learn about their hopes, dreams, questions, and fears for the solution we are offering to provide.
Evidence-based design practices save a lot of time and energy in justifying design decisions during lengthy client or management calls. Validated data for your design will always lead you to a product that ensures optimal user experience and meets the expectations.
Bridging the gaps from the point of demographic identification for an idea to wireframes for user testing is a long path. The consolidation of requirements and structuring design documentation may feel like crawling progress with iterative and incremental updates in gathered information.
However, the rewards at the end of the journey are worth the effort.
Start with the user and work backward
One of the questions that most UX practitioners may get asked is, what about the business objectives? What if they wish to introduce a product that will be a path-breaking, disruptive solution that users have no idea of in the cultural sense of expectations?
In large-scale enterprises, UX teams are often merely a means to get front-end element recommendations in place before SAP or SharePoint developers can take over deliveries. The downgrading of UX teams' value in corporate culture is forced by feature release pressures, stakeholders' opinions, budgeting constraints, or just lack of understanding.
There is no difference in the attitudes of many startup entrepreneurs either. MVP specifications just needed to be handed over to developers. The client has spent many nights crafting the wireframes and is certain that their solution is the vision of the future.
What drives this apathy toward UX, even with countless examples presented?
In my many years of working with UX practitioners across the US, Europe, and India, along with the expectations from engineers who have to wait till a solution is recommended, one thing became clear.
It was that designing optimal UX for any requested solution takes time, structure, and resources. UX teams may get a winning process in place with the best resources money can buy. It is the time that is given to complete the process and put all the resources to work that becomes Achilles heels for any UX team.
The solution to one of the most common problems may come from Amazon.
They call it 'working backward'.
The process starts with a team workshop to write a press release about the product or service they are going to release in the future on a set date.
The press release outlines how this new product or feature has become successful and is loved by users and critics alike. Specific quotes from stakeholders and user reviews from various blogs and platforms are included in this document.
The press release talks about the solutions presented to the users and contributions made toward user success and happiness.
On close inspection, here are a few benefits of this strategy:

Timelines for the product or feature release are accounted for
Demographic definitions are clear at the onset
The final solution's goals and objectives are defined for the user
Business objectives are included in the definitions
It allows all the stakeholders to course-correct the overall business objectives and strategy
If the press release is not exciting enough, maybe the business need to rethink their objectives
The discovery phase of the design exercise gets a head start, propelling them toward solving and achieving a common objective

Conclusion
If your designs are not simple enough, you run the risk of alienating almost 70% to 90% of your users. Biases can break the entire discovery phase of any design exercise. We must ensure that multiple methods of research were employed in collecting data. An intelligent opinion is still a guess; assumptions of any kind can only lead to damaging the final product.
Getting out of the building and talking to users is the only certain way to know what solutions will help the users and make your products successful. Envisioning how the users and stakeholders would respond to the feature from a business point of view is a good place to start. And finally, you need remember that you're not the user.
In the following chapters, we will talk about how to identify users for your products. Before that, it is essential to recall what we learned so far.










CHAPTER 2
Watching How People Behave




Introduction
Observing the users interact with a variety of interfaces is an art. Often, this turns into a fascinating hobby for some. The practice of studying user behavior, needs, and motivations using various methodologies is called user research.
Empathy is the ability to feel the experience and emotions of others. It goes beyond sympathy, which is caring and understanding for the suffering of others. Empathy is essential for UX to be crafted by empathizing with user needs.
Tim Brown, IDEO's CEO of Innovation and design, said, "Empathy is at the heart of design, without understanding what others see, feel and experience, the design is a pointless task."
As far back as the 1980s, Apple started talking about the fact that it's the job of the designer to do their best to predict the response of the user, but it is the job of the user to do the exact opposite. In other words, the behavior of the end-users can be quite the opposite of what you hope.
Validating your ideas and designs among real-world users, you will find out whether they are going to behave the way you hope and whether your design is going to work for them.

User research helps us understand users' characteristics and behavior
It informs us about their aims and aspirations
It aids us in producing designs that impact users' lives
Helps us evaluate the impact of designs on the user 

User research is at the crux of the 'Discovery' of any user experience design project.
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

Expectations from user research
The 5 elements of user research
The user research process
Methods of observing user behavior
Talking to the users

Objectives
Many people feel an urge of resistance when proposed with the idea of investing in user research for a project so close to their heart. Getting a green light on a UX research study depends on the budget, deadlines pressure, engineering commitments, or simply the amount of time already spent by the client or product owner with the idea itself. This chapter will teach you when and how to conduct user research. You will take a deeper dive into the quantitative and qualitative methods of user research and learn how to implement them.
The objective of this chapter is to explore the possibility of cutting down the time and best practices for running research for any project, and learning how to make a convincing case for user research while doing so.
Expectations from user research
When we start a design project for a client or a business, the foremost information we gather from the stakeholders is about their business, their goals, what their target market is, and what 'the business' wants out of the solution we are about to provide.
For an end-user to use your product or service, there must be a particular demand for the solution it provides. For any product to succeed, it must fulfill user needs with proper context of use, and it must resolve their problems with any existing solution they may be using, in a trustworthy and friendly manner.
Sometimes, user research also reveals the core user base from the entire group of probable or possible users for our product or service.
User needs
Research tells us about what is essential to the users. We try to learn about their unfulfilled needs and possible hopes for a solution. The solution may not have to be the next version of Android or iOS; it can be as simple as a camera photo filter app with funny lenses to get a few giggles from your kids.
Context
Context is the king of UX. We have often seen in comedy movies and TV shows when a computer becomes the nemesis of the protagonist while they wish to get out of a sticky situation in a nick-of-time. It gives you an idea of the where, why, and when of app usage. Ask yourself this, how many times would you book international flight tickets from your phone on a crowded bus? And then ask this, how many people do it? What are the distractors or interruptions they may face while doing so?
Pain points
Have you ever seen someone hold a phone in one hand and clench the other fist while they growl in frustration as if someone has just placed an out-of-order sign on an elevator they were about to take to the 30th floor - for maintenance, during business hours? If we know the pain points, the workflow can be optimized. The building manager could have scheduled the maintenance over the weekend or after hours.
Perception
Each new user may have a certain level of pre-conceived reputation and expectations from their recently downloaded application about the solution they will be getting out of it. Flourishing of the solution would require the application to match those expectations so that there are no miscommunications.
Language and nomenclature
Trade and business domains, and sometimes whole countries, come with their own set of terminologies and labeling of similar activities, for example, sign in, log in, punch in, clock in, check-in. If the product is to be a success, it helps knowing when to call those delicious baked goods cookies or biscuits.
Norms
Research helps us understand which parts of the workflow or actions our prospective users think of as standard or go-to actions. You may have often seen that image from a campus where paved ways are marked as UI and a small well-trodden path in the dirt, which reduces the distance between two points and is marked as UX.



Figure 2.1: A popular image depicting how design and user experience are two different paths to reach the same user goal.
The 5 elements of user research
User research, like any other field of study, must follow the scientific methods set for any verifiable research. It has to be planned and documented each step of the way, and data has to be meticulously kept from getting tainted.
User research is an iterative, cyclical process in which user observation and interviewing techniques help us identify a problem space for which solutions are proposed.
As a template, the core execution of any user research exercise can be divided into five elements:

Goal

What are our goals for this research?
What are we expecting to find?
What are we going to achieve?
Research questions

What specific questions should we ask?
What information will we gather by asking those questions?
Methods

What specific research methods should we use to get our answers?
Participants

What are the user profiles we are interested in?
Why were the profiles chosen, and what makes them the best possible target for the solution?
Protocol

How do we want to conduct the research?
How are we going to document the research?
How will we process the data gathered from it?

As a fun activity, think about planning a surprise party for your nephew's 12th birthday, which should go down as the coolest ever among his school friends. Can you imagine running through the research process with tools provided in the five elements?
User research process
Breaking down the elements discussed in the previous section, we can discuss the recipe for user research for any given project.
What to research
A research hypothesis is a specific, clear, and testable statement about the possible outcome of a research study. Product owners or stakeholders will form a hypothesis for a project, which will be verified through research.
Research methodologies will be identified based on the hypothesis. After the actual research process, the hypothesis will either be confirmed or considered incorrect.
Define the research hypothesis
A user research project always starts with a list of self-contained hypotheses that is backed by business objectives, pain points of the users, and goals that the business thinks should be met by their solution.
If we take the example of that birthday party, a hypothesis could be as simple as:

Most young people aged 11-13 like to eat pizza
Most young people aged 11-13 would prefer to go to a party in a restaurant than at someone's house
Most parents would prefer that birthday parties where their children are invited are held over weekends

Note that your hypotheses should be generic, inclusive to target segment(s), and should influence any final decisions made about the last service or product directly or indirectly.
User segmentation
We create user segments based on specific, common characteristics of groups of users. It would be best if you listed down all the possible groups of people who may be using or impacted by your solution. For that party in our example, it has to be:

Young people aged 11-13 who go to school with your nephew or are on friendly terms with him
This segment can include people of diverse genders, hobbies, interests, and heritage
Parents aged 30-50, who may have to make travel arrangements, keep an eye on food allergies for their kids, and manage their occupation during the same time as the party

User segmentation is a broader overview of the target demographic with mixed behavioral patterns and shared goals for the outcome from business.
User personas
When you have the user segments defined, you can identify unique characters with the most common characteristics clubbed in one. Any UX research project can have multiple personas if they are unique in their base characteristics and represent user segments that must be represented while the solution is presented.
User personas are fictional characters created for user research, where each persona represents a unique user segment. In the case of our little research project, the friends of the nephew are the primary personas and parents are secondary. However, the nephew has to be represented in a persona to be able to tell a story from a business standpoint.



Figure 2.2: Sample persona of 12-year old Harry Woodford
User journey mapping
Once we have personas defined, we learn about their hopes, fears, questions, and pain points while trying to get to the solution. Each persona will tell you what path they will take in an ideal world to complete the task at hand. The fears of a parent may be linked to a possible peanut allergy their child may have, or one of the guests is hoping to be able to eat more than two slices of pizza. The parent's goal may be to keep a close eye on their child the whole time, and the kid with a love of pizza needs to ensure that they remain seated close to the server.
User journeys can be mapped based on providing optimal paths for each of the personas and must address their goals. Each path should be planned optimally with minimal steps and assurances to the stakeholders about their present status in the journey.
In the research stages, we will ask users about what they feel should be the optimal path to achieve these goals.
At this stage where discovery is not yet complete, the journey definitions are in draft stages and mainly address the business goals. Once we put our hypotheses to test, validations gathered from the collected data will help us reiterate these journey maps.
How to research
In the first chapter, we talked about various biases and factors that can taint research data, resulting in inaccurate outcomes. We also talked about how to remedy this: by ensuring that multiple research methods are applied with diverse targeted demographics.
Decide on research methodology
Armed with hypotheses, a checklist of ideal personas for our research project, and questions that need answers, we need to figure out how we will get these answers. Choosing a research method depends upon the data we need to solve the problem. We need to choose a research method that gives us the easiest path to reliable data.
Recruitment
The recruitment of participants is based on a research screener. A screener contains parameters taken from the targeted persona. The screener can be based on a combination of age, education, occupation, skill set, gender, or any identifiable characteristics.
Research methods
Research methods are chosen based on our hypothesis. They could be one or a combination of many methods suitable for our project.
In the example where we plan a legendary birthday party, the method of choice can be 'personal interviews', as it is the most used, direct, and effective method of user research.
We will talk about other methods of research in the next section of this chapter.
Questionnaire design
The researcher prepares a script for a personal interview of the participants. The script starts with formal introductions to set a sense of familiarity. The participant is then informed about the purpose of the study and told that it is the system under the test; they are not being judged for their opinions or skills by any means.
The questions in the script must be to-the-point and open-ended, and they should mostly lead to another or a follow-up scenario. The questions should be based on how the participant would feel or what their actions will be in the given scenarios.
Finally, there is a direct question to close or summarize the conversation about their views on the overall topic and a formal note of thanks to let them know that the interview is over.
Plan logistics
An interview should be planned well in advance. Additionally, ensure to check with participants in advance about the confirmation of their attendance. Most of the time, these interviews are scheduled back-to-back. The place of the interview should be comfortable and minimally distractive. It could be as formal as a meeting room at your workplace or as casual as a coffee shop. Keep in mind that reservations may be needed at certain places.
If your interview requires the use of any computer or digital hardware, check the equipment well in advance with proper connectivity, power, and software updates.
Research execution
Once your participants walk into the interview room, give them a minute to settle down. Ask for a drink or if they need a minute before you start. The researcher must be friendly, but with caution to ensure that over-friendliness does not set in the conversation. The bias may cause the participant to answer inaccurately to please the new friend, i.e., the interviewer.
The researcher should, ideally, refrain from conveying disagreements or heavy emotions toward responses from the participant. This may unsettle the participant and may cause them to close up or respond to their momentary emotions.
It is recommended to plan various methods of documentation for any research exercise. As a facilitator, it may get a bit difficult and distracting to talk and take notes at the same time. Ideally, it will help if you record the conversation or have a colleague to play the role of an observer.
If you are planning to record audio or video for reference at later stages, you might like to get a signature from the participant on a form of consent.
In the end, it is considered polite to incentivize the participant for their time and responses to the research.
Research analysis and documentation
Finally, in the last stages of the discovery phase, the researcher has to go through all the data that was collected through various methods during the research process. The data now has to be analyzed, quantified, referenced, and compiled in a report.
Going through the recordings, notes, and feedbacks after the process of data collection is complete is the lengthiest part of the process.
The final report will tell us whether our hypotheses were true or false. The report includes the entire process that was followed and recommendations from the researcher based on the data gathered for the next phase.
Methods for observing user behavior
Every great product or service starts with good user research. User research methods can be classified into two prime categories: qualitative research and quaquantitative research.
Qualitative research
As evident from their respective names, in qualitative research, the focus remains on a small sample of users. We get data about user behavior and attitudes by observing them directly using personal interviews, field studies, and focus groups. In this process, we can ask follow-up questions, such as why and how to fix a problem.
Qualitative research gives quality output based on natural conversation and observations with a handful of users. These methods let us ask questions as well as observe users.
Quantitative research
In quantitative research methods, the data is gathered by a large sample of users with indirect methods. We get data about user behaviors and attitudes by measuring them without direct contact and techniques, such as surveys or an analytic tool. Quantitative methods help us get answers to questions, starting with how many and how much.
Quantitative research gives us a lot of data that we can quantify. Output can be in percentages or actual numbers as it is based on many user responses. The drawback of this method is that we cannot ask questions to users to probe their responses.
Key user research methodologies
There are many user research methods that can be applied to observe user behavior. Here are a few choice methods that should get you through the clutter and get to the actionable insights.
Contextual enquiry/ Field studies - Qualitative, semi-structured
In this method, research is conducted by watching and listening to users in the natural environment use a product or service. These interviews are generally less formal, with observation techniques used instead of conducting a formal interview.
Personal interview - Qualitative, structured
A researcher meets with participants one-on-one to discuss in-depth what the participant thinks about the topic in question. These are personal 30-60 mins in-depth interviews with the users, which help understand their needs, pain points, attitudes, beliefs, desires, etc. Personal interviews are generally conducted in a studio/lab setup where the interviewer can gain insights about the user.
Focus group discussion - Quantitative, semi-structured
A focus group is a moderated discussion between 3-7 participants (depending on the study) on a topic, with verbal and written feedback. Focus groups help understand group dynamics, behavior, needs, and pain points.
Online surveys - Quantitative, structured
An online survey is a method to gather quantitative data when considering a large sample or when there are various user segments to target. Online surveys help quickly collect a large amount of data and then use the findings to conduct qualitative research.
We can do surveys in two ways:

Intercept survey: A survey that is triggered while using a site or application.
Email surveys: A survey in which participants are recruited from an email message.

Talking to the users
Being a good listener is the first quality of an exemplary user researcher, but knowing what to ask makes or breaks the whole process. At the beginning of the research process, the interviewer writes a script for introductions, making it easy to conduct multiple interviews. The introduction text helps outline the scope and tell the context to the user.
Keeping a script helps the collected data be linear and makes it easy to track specific discussion points or answers.
After the initial introductions, the researcher asks some opening questions that are generic and loosely connected to the topic at hand. This will help break the ice between the interviewer and the user before starting the actual interview.
The interview consists of three types of questions. These questions are categorized as need-based, task-based, and value-based.
Need-based questions
Need-based questions help us identify users' needs, wants and desires.

How often do you buy groceries?
Why do you go to a bank branch?

Task-based questions
Task-based questions help us get insights into how participants execute a specific task.

What is the current process that they follow, and what is their journey?
How do you budget to buy groceries?
How do you generally plan and make a grocery buying trip?
How do you currently make utility bill payments?

Value-based questions
To better understand the drives and motivation of the user, the researcher asks value-based questions.

What constitutes value for the user?
What will delight a user?
What frustrates you most about buying groceries?
Would you want your bank to become your financial advisor as well?
Which is the most valuable service that your bank provides you with?

Every personal interview or online survey will have different types of questions. The way a question is asked determines what kind of response will be received from a user.
Open-ended questions give qualitative feedback; they allow users to provide longer answers or describe something in detail. Closed questions may be helpful for gathering quantitative feedback as they do not have explanatory answers and may only have answers like yes, no, or maybe.
Conclusion
A consistent pattern or format of research must be defined and followed throughout the research process to get validated results.
User research is not a one-time occurrence or one deliverable. It is a process that starts with defining a problem we think our potential users have and for which we will be designing a product.
In the upcoming chapters, we will learn more about how the information collected from various user research methods can be applied to actual project execution.










CHAPTER 3
Fixing Issues - The Why and The How




Introduction
Like any other domain, user experience research comes with its own set of hurdles and problems encountered by the practitioner. In this chapter, we will talk about the most common issues faced by a researcher and how to handle those situations.
These challenges can come from various avenues, such as management oversight, client apathy, budget limitations, timeline pressures, and tainted data.
If we are to put these issues in wider categories, they can be clubbed in two prime categories: organizational based issues and practice-based issues. The first challenge for any user experience research practice comes from the organizational culture and management's understanding of its value.
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

Organizational challenges
ROI of UX - Finding the seat at the table
Differentiating businesses - Enterprise, SMEs, and Start-ups 
Biases in data interpretation

Organizational challenges
When we look at any issue relating to user experience design in any application we are using or evaluating, it is more likely a person issue than a UX issue. Often, the beliefs of what the management considers to be true about their users cause confirmation bias. Leading this bias to engineering, marketing, and sales stakeholders, the organization-wide decision toward a problem becomes more of a compromise among managers than what users wanted.
Here, a UX designer's job changes roles with UX evangelism, which includes stakeholder education and advocating on behalf of the users. Becoming the voice of the only seat vacant at the stakeholders table is the biggest challenge a UX person will face, without worrying about pleasing the client or manager.
This chapter aims to explore and learn how to deal with the organization-based challenges that might come in the way of customer success.
ROI of UX - Finding the seat at the table
In the simplest of the forms, the return of investment of UX can be calculated with a simple formula that is a metric used to gauge the efficiency of an investment, i.e., money spent on implementing UX in our case.
The formula used is:
ROI = Profit from an investment / investment cost
ROI is displayed as a percentage.
For instance, imagine that you invested $10,000 in implementing the user centered design process for an e commerce mobile app, and the new UX increases your sales by $10,500; the return on investment will be:
ROI = {(10,500 - 10,000)/10,000}* 100 = 5%.
Knowing the ROI of UX and being able to present it to key stakeholders makes a strong case in front of investors to implement UX and invest in it.



Figure 3.1: Representative image of IBM's statement; "Every dollar invested in ease of use returns $10 to $100."
For example, if a UX manager presents a projected ROI of UX activities to the CEO of a product company, the CEO will be more likely to consider investing in UX.
In her article, '50 Stats That Prove the Value of Customer Experience', published in September 2019 in the Forbes magazine, author and keynote speaker Blake Morgan has wonderfully compiled a single list of well researched insights to define ROI and the value of UX.
Two of these 50 statistics that got me interested are as follows:

Companies that provide an emotional connection with customers outperform the sales growth of their competitors by 85%.
87% of customers who say they had a great experience will make another purchase from the company, compared to 18% of customers who had a very poor experience.

These numbers speak for themselves. Anything over 20% in the opposite direction should be enough to call for a board meeting - then why do UX practitioners find it hard to find an ear to whisper these end-of-day numbers in?
If only there was some way to present these findings to the key stakeholders or decision makers. The problem can be placed with the mindsets of leadership in individual organizations.
It is no intention of the author to lay blame to any individual department or prejudicially blame all the organizational leaderships for putting UX at the end of the rope. Remember, UX is an organizational responsibility.



Figure 3.2: Graphs showing the effect of investing in UX on time and money: (i) Decrease in time taken on a project/product and, (ii) Increase in money (returns) due to increased product purchases.
When we are calculating return on investment on any user experience design project, it always consists of business schools, like revenue increase saving in costs and other key performance indicators. The hard numbers generated from any research can be presented to find a buyer in opportunity with the top management and decision makers of the organization, but this is not entirely true.
This may sound a bit absurd, but return on investment may not just be about money. ROI can be measured more in terms of demonstrating that the design improves the customer experience and has a positive impact on the business goals. In no sense can the ROI be calculated about UX with 100% accuracy.
As Kate Morgan summarizes in her September 6, 2020, article on NN group website titled 'three myths about calculating the ROI of UX', "in most cases, these are not meant to be (and really can't be) sophisticated financial forecasts." She further adds, "the best these are estimations of how much value the company is getting (monetary or otherwise) as a result of the investment."
We should take her summation with best intentions, which states, "treat ROI as estimation, not prediction."
Differentiating businesses - Enterprise, SMEs, and Start-ups
Organizations differ from each other in the way they function and execute their user experience design plans. This differentiation becomes apparent when you are dealing with an enterprise, a business-to-business organization, or a business-to-customer organization.
At a startup, a POC or proof-of-concept development is needed before the business can transform into a seed-funded unicorn. Mostly, a minimally viable product or MVC gets these entrepreneurs a chance to showcase and sell their ventures to big-pocketed conglomerates.
Things for UX can go two ways here. Either the UX takes the center stage with all bells and whistles, or it is completely shoved under the carpet till the money is found.
For an enterprise, where resources might not be the prim facia challenge, the attitude toward prioritizing UX is often overshadowed by investing in revenue-generating or cost-saving features. The stakeholders or decision makers need to be sure about their actions before making a call that might impact the delivery roadmap.
For applications that are built for internal usage for employees, any complaints about possible difficulties for users are brushed off with onboarding training exercises. This does not solve the problem as that will still exist and even grow as new modules or data is added in the mix.
For mid-size organizations or SMEs, the importance of user research and practices to enable an immersive UX is increasing. The pitch for small to medium organizations should start from the top. Often, these medium-sized business relay on a single decision maker. Finding the right ear becomes the biggest challenge.
Biases in data interpretation
We have discussed different bias types and how to avoid them in the earlier chapters of this book. The bias related to the interpretation of data presented to various stakeholders was not mentioned there as it does not have anything to do with how a practitioner understands it. When various stakeholders look at a similar data set, the focus is always on the core-competencies from their departments.
Looking at similar sets of data and finding gaps that are obvious for other departments is easy, but adjusting one behavior to accommodate the other is not always welcome.
We can address this situation by breaking down the data in individual chunks, which translates the findings from various stakeholder point-of-views. Concluding the data presentation with overall impact on the organization and how to get to a projected future, where we want to be in the end.
Finally, a list of recommendations should be presented and debated with clearly marked responsibilities and to-do items for each stakeholder or department.
Conclusion
The white paper published by User Testing.com in 2019 titled 'Proving the ROI of UX research' concludes their findings with this simple observation.
"It's not hard to convince your stakeholders of the importance of UX research. Most companies already admit they're planning to conduct more research. What will set you apart from your competition, however, is making UX research a regular part of your process and your budget."
The above observation is a direct indicator of the fact that many organizations are now educated on the matter of UX, and the leadership is showing a positive intent toward the practices of user research. The white paper further adds that," A successful UX research initiative begins with cross-departmental communication and alignment to goals. Once you've woven user research as a staple of your regular process and budget, you'll need the right tools and resources to conduct your research".
Finding the best combination of tools to collaborate, communicate, and research will provide your organization with an ecosystem that is tailored to your organization. This practice will lead to sustainable and scalable DesignOps process establishment for dependable user experience delivery.










CHAPTER 4
Hearing What Users Say




Introduction
At the time of delivering a product, synchronizing with the audience's needs plays a significant role. No matter how efficiently the team has worked, what counts is that the outcome should match the customer's demand. Keeping an eye on the development of a product is essential; designers should completely understand the customer's needs.
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

Requirement
Research
Milestones and checkpoints
Analytics

Objectives
The right questions, authentic research, and analytic studies, along with a proper set of priorities, identifying product opportunities, and setting checkpoints and milestones, will help ensure that you're building the right product for the audience.
This chapter aims to explore how we can translate the observed data from users that we collected by various methods.
Requirements
For a successful product, a designer should know all the requirements of the customer. Asking questions helps a lot in identifying all the dimensions of the product. It's human nature to opt for an easy path to reach a goal, but don't rush. Just make a proper plan, list the requirements, identify all the dimensions of the conditions, and start designing as per your users' choice.
The audience's interest can vary according to their point of interest, age, gender, and profession. Designers must take care of customers' needs and audience choices as well. It could be resolved by intelligent and innovative design. This is only possible if you know all the basic as well as final requirements. So, ask more questions, avoid dead-end questions, and note down every detail; this is your first step toward making the right product for your audience.
Research
"Research is to see what everybody else has seen and to think what nobody else has thought" - Albert Szent.
A good researcher analyzes all the aspects and gives a thought to all possible outcomes and risks. The more you research, the closer you are to finding the right results. A researcher should always focus on the choice and needs of the target audience. Observing user behavior and attitude and how they usually perform specific tasks helps steer designing in the right direction. Researching about the users and their needs and requirements allows us to better understand them and their problems. One should check the competitors and market to develop the right product according to market trends and industrial needs. Even users' previous interactions with a similar product can help understand their choices, nature, motivation, and pain points. Gaining a consolidated understanding of your audience brings you closer to a fruitful deliverable.
Milestones and checkpoints
"A stitch in time saves nine."
Checking your work at regular intervals, dividing the work into parts, and regularly showcasing the deliverables to the customer or audience helps fix minor issues at the right time. In a broader sense, it allows one to stay aligned with their goals and achieve an audience-oriented outcome.
The definition of milestone is "A milestone is a specific point within a project's life cycle used to measure the progress toward the ultimate goal."
Setting specific milestones helps stay on the right track. While achieving a milestone, we get feedback from the audience, which helps a lot in identifying the accuracy of the outcome. Setting checkpoints and milestones fuels focus and brings the team on the same page. Simultaneously, reviewing your product progress at regular intervals prevents major faults from surfacing in the product. So, set milestones, stay focused, and keep growing in the right direction.
Analytics
Analyzing and evaluating plays a crucial role here. Working should be based on feedback and past performances. It helps know the exact requirements and gives ideas about how we can improve our product. In simple words, analyzing the data, performances, and records shows us the direction to better outcomes. Facts and figures add points to your work. They help explore all the possible results and choose our favorable designing criteria. They also aid risk management and help explore new perspectives to our design.
Priorities
Set priorities and work accordingly. It is important to solve roadblocks, but deciding which problem to solve first to get a fruitful outcome is more important. Balancing risk value and cost is the main motto of setting priorities. Sometimes, designers must attend to a big task later because a small but high-priority task must be attended to first. Therefore, especially in designing, priorities must be decided carefully because small changes can affect the overall project goal and cause it to deviate from its purpose.
Priorities help you keep working linearly, and this working process helps achieve project goals according to the audience. Priorities can vary according to the focused audience. The audience behavior matters a lot. In other words, we can say that setting the right priorities will lead you to build the right product for the audience.
Opportunity
The audience might like slight variations or additional features in your design. As designers, we must take care of solutions as well as time and cost. Many solutions are available in the market, so before switching to any result-oriented path, check the extent to which these changes are affecting the outcome.
Study the available opportunities well and concentrate on the available solutions. We should look forward to new opportunities that will present themselves with changes. Simultaneously, stay focused on the needs of the audience to get a prolific product.
Users and clients
User is the only right key to analyze your product. If they are using the product efficiently without any help or issues, it is a sign that "your product is perfect, keep going on the same path." No one can scrutinize a product, as well as clients and users do. Feedback on small deliverables helps a lot in getting ideas about the direction of the product. Noting down every review helps build the right product for the audience. Try to strike a balance between the product goals and technical necessities based on client feedback.
Conclusion
A team often completes its product on time with all the efforts, but the final product doesn't match the users' needs. It is imperative to check the direction of the ongoing design so that it can match the product goal.
We must ensure a clear path of communication that is documented, scheduled, and transparent to all the stakeholders. This exercise helps avoid miscommunication between the client and the designer. Make your views and opinions clear, ask to avoid confusion, and assure that there is no ignorance towards the audience's requirements and goals. Keep these points in mind to ensure that you're building the right product for the audience.










CHAPTER 5
Calculating the Many and the Much




Introduction
User research is the study of user behavior, needs, and motivation using various research methodologies. It is an interactive, cyclical process in which user observation and interviewing techniques help us identify a problem space for which suitable solutions are crafted and proposed in the best interest of the users.
"Empathy is at the heart of design, without understanding what others see, feel and experience, design is a pointless task." - Tim Brown, CEO, IDEO
User research is an efficient way to learn as much as possible about the people who are finally going to use your product or services. It helps you understand what they need, why they need it, how they behave around the product, what is important to them, what causes them inconvenience, and what solutions they prefer.
Such in-depth insights into the users' world helps in developing a good understanding of them. This understanding ultimately reflects in the quality of the product, enhancing its usability and offering meaningful experiences to the users.
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

Qualitative research
Quantitative research

Objectives
User research involves a wide range of methodologies used to gather valuable information about users. The research methodologies are broadly categorized into qualitative and quantitative methods based on the areas of investigation we focus on in the research.
Qualitative research
Qualitative research methods answer the what, why, and how of users interaction with a design. They allow us to probe the problem: Why is a user-facing the problem, and how can we fix it?
It is a direct method of investigation where a UX researcher interacts with users (in moderated studies) one on one or personally evaluates their responses. The accuracy of the results obtained solely depends on the researcher's skills, experience, and knowledge.
Qualitative methods investigate users subjectively to uncover usability issues in the design. They highlight users' behaviors, attitudes, motivation, and thought processes by observing them as they interact with the interface.
Such research methods are used in the formative evaluation of a product during its designing or redesigning phase. It keeps the designers informed about the critical usability aspects they need to consider while designing.
Qualitative research methods are preferred as a quick way of engaging with the users to ensure that you are designing a product that solves their problems. It is an affordable and feasible exercise, ideally needing 5-8 participants to give reliable results.
Contextual inquiry or ethnographic studies
In contextual inquiry, also known as participant observation or field study, researchers watch actual or potential users interact with the product in a natural setup, such as their home or workplace. It is a simple and efficient way to figure out users' behavior and attitudes toward a product and their difficulties while interacting with it.
This exercise also helps us understand the significance and role of a product in people's lives. It is suitable for a contextual inquiry during the early stages of design ideation to help establish a deep-rooted understanding of users' actions and surroundings.
User interviews
User interviews are one-on-one interaction sessions between researchers and users. Interviewing users is an extensive exercise where researchers ask users questions about their experience with a design or a product. Users get to express and communicate their likes and dislikes about a product and what they would like to be changed.
These sessions provide valuable in-depth knowledge about the usability of a product and help us understand users' viewpoints. After finishing a design or responsive prototype, it is best to carry out user interviews to gain the most information from users' feedback.
User interviews can be conducted independently to gain an understanding of user personas, journey maps, or contextual inquiries, or they can be coupled with usability tests to investigate users right after they participate in the tests.
Focus groups
A focus group represents the target audience of your product. A moderator facilitates this exercise with a group of 3-12 potential users to discuss the key aspects of your products or service. The group is encouraged to have a transparent conversation about the critical usability aspects of the design and how they can be improved.
It offers diverse yet influential perspectives from group members, enabling researchers to better understand the user base. Hosting focus groups proves particularly useful during the initial stages of discovery and design.
Qualitative usability testing
Usability testing refers to observing users perform a specific set of tasks on the product in question. Usability tests can be moderated as well as unmoderated. In moderated tests, users interact with the product trying to complete the assigned tasks in the presence of a moderator or researcher.
The moderators are trained UX specialists with thorough product knowledge. Their responsibilities include administering the test, guiding users, resolving their queries, recording their comments and behaviors, and discussing their feedback with them in real-time.
On the contrary, unmoderated tests do not require a moderator, and the users are interacting with the product on their own. Usability tests are classically held in a formal setting like a UX lab or an office, but they can also be conducted remotely with an online tool.
UX experts prefer conducting usability tests at the early design stages to test a concept or a prototype.
Quantitative research
Quantitative research is an indirect way of evaluating the performance and usability of a design. Unlike qualitative methods, the data collected from usability tests is mathematically interpreted to gain insights from users to calculate the many and the much. Thus, quantitative research revolves around numbers to assess the strengths and shortcomings of a design.
Quantitative studies provide a tangible basis for which features of the design have succeeded and the ones for which they have not. Such studies test different design elements based on predefined usability metrics such as task completion rate, error count, time on task, and satisfaction rating. This adds statistical significance to the research process, making the findings reliable.
In contrast to qualitative studies, quant studies are more expensive as they are strictly controlled. These methods require a test population of around 30 people to gain essential and reliable data from the survey. It is a summative form of assessment carried out at the end of the designing phase to evaluate its overall usability.
Analytics
Analytics data, such as website usage data or customer support data, reveals essential information about the users, such as their likability or problems with the design. We can track user behavior and attitude by capturing and analyzing data like the time spent on a page, most bought products, time taken in the checkout process, frequency of visit, bounce rate, the conversion rate, and so on.
Along with the site usage data, we get valuable information about users, such as their age, gender, demographics, language, device, and browser. This information can prove vital in identifying and understanding the authentic user base for your product and can guide you in the right direction with designing.
Surveys and questionnaires
Surveys and questionnaires are used to gather data on user satisfaction and product rating. You can ask straight, neutral, and easy questions via online surveys to know your users well. Rolling out surveys from time to time keeps you updated about users' preferences, behaviors, and needs.
A/B testing
A/B testing or multivariate testing is a way to weigh two design versions against each other. In this research method, users choose between two slightly different variations of the same design. Users' choices help us decide which design option is doing better than the other and why. 



Figure 5.1: Two variants of the same UI design of the Houseparty app, with version (A) having vertical friends' suggestion list, and option (B) having showing the suggestions in a horizontal slider list. 
It highlights the importance of correctly choosing the essential UI elements, such as buttons, texts, colors, and banners. For instance, through A/B testing, you can test whether users find "Add to cart" more intuitive or "Buy now". A/B testing substantially evaluates two variants of a design and points to the more usable and likable one.
Card sorting 
Card sorting is a fun technique of ensuring that your information architecture is in line with how users think. In this method, participants are given many cards with labels or words related to the product written on them. Participants are then asked to sort these cards under different categories (which can be pre-provided or made) as per their understanding.
It helps in structuring and organizing the menus and sub-menus within a website effectively. Card sorting is an affordable and valuable technique that can be carried out efficiently offline and online.



Figure 5.2: Grouping similar content together to label it later into specific categories
Quantitative usability testing - Benchmarking
Benchmarking is testing the usability of a product on a predetermined set of measures. In quantitative usability testing, users are assigned tasks to perform on the design or prototype.
The data collected is along the lines of predetermined metrics like time on task, retention rate, task completion rate, etc. to help statistically evaluate a design. Benchmarking allows a continuous evaluation of a design and tracks its progress over time.
Tree testing
Tree testing, also known as reverse card sorting, is a way to assess the accuracy of the information architecture of your design and validate the results of card sorting. In this method, users are made to find options within the main categories based on their understanding of it. 




Figure 5.3: Tree testing: A tree testing chart for travelling by bus.
The efficiency of the information architecture is tested based on the findability of the items and how intuitive the design's information flow is. Tree testing is an efficient and affordable method to test the information structure of your product, which is a crucial contributor to providing a good user experience.
Eye-tracking
Eye-tracking or heatmaps capture the gazing patterns of the users on an interface. It reveals important information about users' interests and likability by analyzing which design features attract their attention or what features they miss on the interface.
Collecting gaze pattern data helps understand the path a human eye follows on an interface while searching for information and shows the hotspots that attract their attention.
The eye-tracking heatmaps provide valuable information about users' viewing behaviors and how long some parts of the design hold their attention. This helps in placing important design elements and information in their line of sight.
Conclusion
Both qualitative and quantitative user research methods are complementary to each other. We can get the best user insights only by using a mixed bag of research methods for our product. Knowing what users want and why (qualitative) and substantiating what difference our solution is making (quantitative) are the two essential objectives of user research.
To make a user-centric design that serves as a solution to people's problems, we must delve deep into their worlds to understand how they perceive and do things. User research is immensely instrumental in fostering a meaningful relationship between you and your users. It makes them feel seen, heard, and valued through the products you make and the experiences you create, to make their lives better.










CHAPTER 6
Power of Affinity Diagrams




Introduction
Affinity is the grouping of a similar or common experience and a diagram in a simplified manner of showing the structure of something. Hence, affinity diagrams organize the ideas, suggestions, opinions, observations, insights, and pain points derived from user research. They can include information like data, facts, customer interviews/survey findings, user insights, and design issues.
This technique was developed by Japanese anthropologist Jiro Kawakita in the 1960s and is, therefore, referred to as the KJ method. Affinity diagramming is sometimes also known as affinity mapping, snowballing, or collaborative sorting.
Structure
We will cover the following topics in this chapter:

The need of affinity diagrams
The utility of affinity diagrams
Ways to create an affinity diagram
Best practices

Objectives
The need for finding a common voice in application and services that are driven by multiple stakeholders becomes a challenge for UX practitioners. It is not just about the investors or business managers, but the challenge of covering the case for each type of end users leads to a lot of heartache.
It is not always a glorious path to come out of a situation where the best possible solution is meant to be a compromise. In other words, you cannot please the world.
That being considered, we can always stay true to the one who does not have a direct voice in the shouting match: the users.
Methods that apply for creating an affinity diagram give a sense of connect to all the parties involved with ownership and inclusion. In technical terms, mapping a user journey and happy paths for customers, with visibility across the cross-functional teams, helps stakeholders reach a consensus about the final decisions for the product or service.
The need for affinity diagrams
According to a report on customer experience from the digital agency Econsultancy, 87%-88% of the companies who outperformed acknowledged the importance of customer mapping in being able to deliver a user-centric solution.
UX teams use affinity diagrams in brainstorming sessions when there is a lot of information or ideas to choose from. It is important to structure the information gathered by making simple user observations through casual conversations, user interviews, surveys, or other research methodologies.
The three key scenarios where affinity diagrams come in handy are as follows:

To note observations or ideas from a user research study
To systematize ideas that surface in design ideation meetings
To marshal ideas about UX strategy and vision

Anyone who has ever written a book report, prepared for an essay, or had to present research finding will testify to the fact that there is always a point to just collect the ideas and resources before starting to sort them in order.
When you have everyone's ideas collected and documented, the job ahead becomes a lot easier.
The utility of affinity diagrams
User research is a process where the information we collect is very subjective and nuanced. So, it becomes necessary to have a technique that helps us collect and categorize this richly textured information to gain as much clarity or insight from it as possible. Affinity diagramming is used for the same purpose.
We map user inputs and put them in place to establish a correlation between the user points/observations.
An affinity diagram is a great tool for sorting and interpretation. It helps you synthesize the designs and solutions from the information you have gathered. The process is completely user-driven, and no predetermined notions interject the decision-making process for a solution.
It summarizes the main findings of the user research exercise and brings all the information in one place. It is a user research digest.
They give UX practitioners clarity about users' needs, preferences, motivations, and behavior. This method is particularly useful in qualitative user research as it requires thematic analysis. Here, the research findings are analyzed by establishing connections between observations and finding patterns and themes using that information.
Therefore, affinity diagrams summarize the qualitative research into a single actionable visual. This is contrary to quantitative research, which is expressed in numbers, data and counts. It helps in product development and trend identification.
Ways to create an affinity diagram
The biggest challenge is getting all the stakeholders in the same room. Once you do that, the job is half done.
Often, executives wish to express their opinions from the luxury of their own corner offices and may get a bit sidetracked from the point of discussion while confronted with contradicting ideas. Here is a carefully planned approach to creating an effective affinity diagram:
Step 1: Begin with asking everyone in the team to write their findings from user research on separate sticky notes. Stick all the notes on a big wall in no order. The purpose of this step is to have all the information in one place.
Don't just make note of the information that the user is telling you, also observe their behavior and note that. Use specific colors to note the information for each session so that it is easier to sort it later.
Step 2: Start sorting the notes into categories. Start with making rough categories and then refine them as you move along. People should collaborate in this process. Also, ensure that design, research, management, and development teams participate in deciding the categories. It helps in extracting better insights from user research.
Step 3: Analyze the categories. See if any new groups or categories emerge, revealing something important. This information will help you design solutions that work for your users. Through this, you will address user needs and solve the problems they might be facing. Participants can also vote for the best ideas using sticker dots.
Step 4: Document the categories and information properly and store it digitally. It is not possible to collect the sticky notes in the long run. Once you have documented the results of affinity mapping and stored them safely, you can share them with the stakeholders anytime it's needed.
Best practices
It is important to observe and note user behavior during interviews, such as body language, facial expressions while completing the given tasks, frequently used words or phrases while answering, sentiments, and suggestions about the products.
It is good to involve key stakeholders in the affinity mapping process so that they are a part of the product ideation and development process right from the beginning. This approach aids in the designing process and helps in building consensus and becoming sensitive to usability issues.
Having the key stakeholders involved should not monopolize the process. All participants' opinions and inputs should be given equal importance.
Online options for affinity diagramming/affinity diagram template: A free-to-use affinity diagram template is available on InVision. Additionally, you can use Lucid chart to create an affinity map online. Miro is also a great tool to collaborate remotely and make affinity diagrams with your team members.
Timing for affinity diagramming: It is better to complete the affinity diagramming process in a set timeline. Generally, 1.5 to 2 hours is considered sufficient for this practice. You can refer to the following diagram explaining the step-wise timeline for the complete process of affinity mapping.



Figure 6.1: Best practices for affinity diagramming
Conclusion
Every experienced analyst - business or UX - won't be able to emphasize enough that every hour spent over preparation for any UX project will save days' if not weeks' worth of efforts while in closing stages of the project.
Getting people to talk to each other, and to you, about their vision of the product or service is critical. An afterthought can spell doom for any project.
Going back to Japanese anthropologist Jiro Kawakita's reasons for developing this method can shed further light on the importance for this subject. Although there is not much knowledge on the Japanese culture, when writing down plans for any business or venture, the Japanese vision always looks for a long-term horizon of 10-15 years. A recent meeting with one of the senior directors at NTT Data explained that the smallest duration they had to execute was a multi-tiered 5-year plan.
Now, imagine pushing your billion-dollar corporation without keeping everyone in sync and speaking the same language of growth.










CHAPTER 7
Summarizing Research into Maps




Introduction
Mapping is a technique of visually representing a concept or understanding the users and their interaction with the product. User experience maps enable us to summarize and depict our research findings and insights effectively.
UX maps are artifacts that we can share with our team and with the stakeholders to gain a thorough understanding of our users. They serve as a reference or single source of truth throughout the product development process, creating a conceptual model and helping identify the key aspects our design should address.
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

Ecosystems mapping
Empathy mapping
Customer journey mapping
Scenario mapping
Experience mapping
Service blueprint

Objectives
A picture speaks a thousand words - with this adage, it always helps to present the research findings in easily understandable data visuals. Busy executives may not have the time to comprehend the minute details of research findings. Plus, you may only get 15 minutes of the hour to present your findings in the weekly sync or daily stand up.
These maps also consolidate the deliverable listings and help in making the project progress with the backing of evidence gathered through the research process. These maps are key to a well-documented UX project, case studies, and portfolio pieces.
With a pinch of salt, we'd like to remind you that UX documentation styles and patterns practices may differ from organizations or teams. The point of these maps is always to convey the message across. The objective of this chapter is to equip you with the knowledge to be able to use different kinds of UX maps, according to your project's requirements, to create a solution serving your users.
Ecosystems mapping
Ecosystem maps are created to understand the role and interrelationship between different ecosystem elements that the product will be a part of. It highlights the critical interactions between all the people, products, and services within the problem space.
This practice helps make sense of the role and influence of each contributing factor. This understanding, in turn, enables us to design our product accordingly and make it a seamless part of the ecosystem.
According to Dave Jones, a seasoned UX Designer, "A UX ecosystem is a set of interdependent relationships that emerge between components within an information environment."
Ecosystem mapping helps us in giving the big picture of our product's environment.
Key benefits of ecosystem mapping are as follows:

It helps identify key areas and pain points in the user journey.
It enables us to uncover usability issues that users could not point toward during the research sessions.
it provides a consolidated understanding of the product ecosystem and crucial elements.
it lays a conceptual foundation to help build user scenarios, user stories, and personas.

Here is an ecosystem map for an application that helps users plan events.



Figure 7.1: An ecosystem map for event-planning applications
Empathy mapping
Creating empathy maps helps understand users' mindset and fathom their needs through their thoughts and actions. Empathizing with your target users is the key to making a user-centric product.
As per the definition by the Nielsen Norman Group, an empathy map is a tool used to articulate what we know about a particular type of user. It externalizes user knowledge to create a shared understanding and aid in decision-making.
We can understand each user type intended to use our product and design accordingly through empathy maps. It is necessary to make 1:1 empathy maps, i.e., a separate map for each user type or persona. An empathy map is categorized into four quadrants: Says, Thinks, Feels, and Does. Consider making empathy maps at the initial design ideation stages when you summarize your user research findings.
You can gain a better understanding of empathy maps from the example shown below. This is an empathy map of Jamie, who is on a quest to buy a TV.



Figure 7.2: An empathy map of Jamie, who is on a quest to buy a TV
Customer journey mapping
A user or customer journey map illustrates the entire timeline of specific user interaction with your product or service. It highlights the crucial touch points regarding the actions and emotions that a user goes through to accomplish a task. User journey maps help understand the needs and pain points of the users.
As explained by the Nielsen Norman group, user journey mapping starts by compiling a series of user goals and actions into a timeline skeleton. Next, the structure is fleshed out with user thoughts and emotions to create a narrative. Finally, that narrative is condensed into a visualization used to communicate insights that will inform design processes.
Customer journey maps are created for specific services or product goals. They are chronological and follow a 1:1 mapping approach, i.e., one map for each user persona. It is best to divide a journey map broadly into four swim lanes or rows: phase/stage, actions, thoughts/emotions, and mindsets. Journey maps can be created at any stage of designing a product experience as they help form a shared understanding of the product and keep everyone on the same page.



Figure 7.3: A customer journey map template for Eric, who wishes to buy a new car
Scenario mapping
A scenario represents a series of actions or events that a user goes through to accomplish a task in the form of a story. Scenarios are created for specific personas and tasks relevant to those personas. Scenario mapping helps us understand and represent the critical tasks a user will perform while interacting with the product. A scenario will always be required for each task.
Scenarios are created by considering a situation where a user representing a specific persona will perform a task. In the example given below, Debbie is a user planning to go on a business trip. She wishes to book a hotel room through your website. A scenario will cover all the key aspects of Debbie's attempt to accomplish the task from start to end.



Figure 7.4: An example of scenario map where the user Debbie wishes to book an affordable hotel room; the map traces and captures all the crucial points of her hotel booking experience
Experience mapping
As the Nielsen Norman Group defines it, an experience map visualizes an end-to-end experience that a "generic" person goes through to accomplish a goal. This experience is agnostic of a specific business or product. It's used for understanding general human behavior (as opposed to a customer journey map, which is more precise and focused on a particular business).
Therefore, an experience map depicts the journey of a person around an event or an experience in their life. They help us understand how our potential users accomplish tasks or deal with certain situations without the help of our product. It gives us a window into the problems they face throughout their journey. We can identify potential usability issues and design a solution catering to our users with this preliminary understanding.
It is advisable to create an experience map before creating customer journey maps for specific user types. This map helps us gain a general understanding of human behavior and users' experience with your product.
Experience maps are not 1:1 maps as they depict a product's user base. They follow a chronological order of events and are ideally divided into four swim lanes or rows: phases/stages, actions, thoughts, and mindset/emotions. Given below is an experience map of a woman through her phase of pregnancy. It outlines all the critical aspects of her experience through this phase. This map will be a goldmine of information for someone who is planning to design a maternity app, product, or service.



Figure 7.5: An example of experience map capturing the activities and experience of a pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy
Service blueprint
A service blueprint is a detailed representation of a user's interaction with different components of a product's environment. Such blueprints are mainly used in visually representations showing a complex system involving numerous service offerings with multiple junctures and touch points. They capture the overall user experience of a service.
As the Nielsen Norman Group defines it, a service blueprint visualizes the relationships between different service components â people, props (physical or digital evidence), and processes directly tied to touch points in a specific customer journey.
Service blueprints are all-encompassing maps of the service around a product, involving its customers, employees, consultants, suppliers, support team, management, etc. It plays a vital role in understanding, devising changes, and, in turn, improving the service.



Figure 7.6: Example of a service blueprint for an appliance retailer
Conclusion
Visualization helps us perceive things better. Mapping is a way of tangibly representing/illustrating user behavior, environment, preferences, emotions, etc., something that is more substantial than imaginary. Documenting a user journey or simply using words to explain user needs is not enough to paint a mental picture for everyone to understand the user the same way. UX mapping brings everyone on the same page in terms of project understanding, approach, objectives, and goals.
Mapping aids our overall understanding of a user's relationship with the product. It is a way of materializing/substantializing our research findings, ideas, concepts, and solutions for a development or design. It acts as a single source of truth that you can always refer to and stay on the right track for your design solution.










CHAPTER 8
Prioritizing Use Cases




Introduction
You may have heard it many times that a good mobile application does one thing perfectly. In other words, they stick to their core use case while considering rest of the feature add-ons as good to have functionalities.
This chapter looks at how to ensure that you're building the right product for the audience. It also looks at how to prioritize based on meeting users' goals rather than build endless features.
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

Motorways and highways
Democratic decision-making
Engineering vs. Design thinking
Infectious edge-cases

Objectives
More than deciding what the right use case for design or development could be for your minimal viable product or MVP - to get it settled for an elevator pitch that could lead to seed funding by a venture capitalist - it important to get everyone in agreement to what qualifies as an MVP or proof-of-concept.
The pathways leading to the customer or user success to any application or platform depend upon the agreements about what exactly makes the product what it is going to be. For a soda company, the priority should be the formula of their proposed drink. Packaging or the design of their promotional campaigns can always be decided later.
Motorways and highways
When the modern-day public road's infrastructure was put in place, it was slightly higher than the regular unpaved roads. This new infrastructure was then referred to as highway. With the invention or arrival of motorways, the status of highways changed and upgraded to controlled access roads that were suitable for commuting or traveling from one specific point to another.
Translating this information into UX design, you will conclude that every user journey map can be completed by adding accelerators and providing tasks close for a specific set of users.
For example, suppose you are in the process of buying a specific product at an e-commerce platform. In that case, you might want to read all the reviews and feedback, compare the products with other offerings, and add the item to your cart before checking out and paying for the product. However, there could be scenarios where you are sure about the product you will buy and immediately click on the buy now button and pay to get the product delivered to your doorstep.
Now, compare this with two different user sets. One is a 21-year-old college-going young man who is sure about purchasing a new dumbbell for his exercise sessions. In this case, he might look at the offering on the home page with specific discounts advertised along with the label. This would encourage him to buy the product directly and pay for it right there.



Consider the same situation for an old lady of 65 years of age trying to buy a fancy vacuum cleaner for her household usage. She would like to be sure about what she's going to buy. She might also have mulled over the decision of spending money on this essential household item online, instead of a simple car ride that could take her to the nearest shopping mall. A shopping mall for her could be a familiar environment where she can get assistance from a salesperson in making a purchase decision.
At the end, you are still selling the product to your end-customer, but they are following two completely different paths to reach their goal. Here, the knowledge of the two different scenarios taken up by the two users is enabled by adding accelerators and putting the user journey right in the middle of the use case.
Whatever the use cases, we must consider the end goal of the business or the website and see if there are any other ways of completing the tasks expected to be completed by the users.
Democratic decision-making
Apple marched to a $2 trillion market cap on Aug 19th, 2020, making it the most valuable technology company in the world. It's among the top brands in the world that have nailed the customer experience. It's scarce to find people not loving their Mac or iPhone. How did they manage to achieve this level of customer satisfaction and loyalty? In the early years, the story was different altogether. It wasn't a cakewalk for Apple to take off.
Apple's iconic founder, Steve Jobs, wasn't always "democratic"; you can find countless resources online that would report Jobs' erratic and inconsistent behavior. The company's products only began to thrive after Jobs let go of the autocratic leadership style, started trusting his people, and instilled a participatory culture. A part of Apple products' remarkable success can be attributed to this culture, which embraces diverse opinions and considers each project team member's vote for product decisions.
The company has practiced this culture ever since (even more under the leadership of Tim Cook) and has continued to register wins after wins.
Democratic decision-making is when a group of people take decisions by voting, and not just an individual is not responsible for everything. In this scenario, no one individual is accountable for the decision; instead, all team members express their views on the topic at hand. The majority wins, and the decision is made. This practice can help a product immensely, provided your team can avoid Groupthink, political campaigning, etc. Different people bring different opinions, and by considering various people's views, you give your product a better chance to "cover all bases" and avoid running into a mess, lest multiple scenarios weren't considered.
Suppose there are two or multiple ways to solve a problem, all approaches with own set of benefits and shortcomings. In this case, how do you decide what's best for the product? Vote - it's as simple as that. This way, the onus to make the correct decision doesn't fall on one person. Taking democratic decisions serves two essential purposes at once: it makes team members feel valued as their opinions are being considered and heard, and the leader of the pack can lose the stress that comes with making important decisions.
Pros of democratic decisions
UX is an organizational responsibility. No single department or manager can claim full responsibility or face fall for bad UX offered by their services. Including everyone in the process to make decisions that might impact every aspect of the product is a wise choice.
Transparent process
The common problem in organizations these days is the dissatisfaction of people due to the decision-making process having little to no transparency. Nobody likes to have little to no say in decisions that affect them and, worst of all, not even knowing what decision was made and the rationale behind it. When you force decisions on people, you get complaints like:

"Why in the world did we include this rather good-to-have feature in the MVP? It makes no sense to me".
"How am I supposed to adjust now? This was never planned".
"I should at least have been consulted for this. This caught me by surprise".

You surely don't want people to come up to you with such complaints. When you vote for essential product decisions, you invariably instill an air of confidence into the group responsible for making the decision. Everyone knows what the issues were, what was chosen and why, and what happened when.
The product you're building can benefit a lot when the people of your team understand and respect the value of the decisions made. This also prevents people from criticizing the decision that was taken as the choice was made through a transparent process.
Perceived as fair
This is plain and simple. As a leader or an organization, you want your people to feel valued for their opinions. Remember the time we played hide-and-seek with our friends. How did we decide who's going to be the seeker for the game? You probably chose the youngest person to go first, or you chose to convict the seeker via an elimination word game. The point is that the players "collectively decided" how the seeker would be chosen, as involving everyone in the decision-making procedure is considered fair. While we may have gone well past that age, the ideas are still the same.
Democratic decision-making instills fairness into the process and helps bring everyone on the same page. When you adopt a culture where everybody has a say (with provided psychological safety), you make a unanimous decision that's received by people better. Nobody contests the sanctity of the decision.
Power of different opinions
"Holy cow! We never considered that", "I never saw this bug ever. This is out of the blue", "Perhaps, we could have involved Mr. X in this", or "This is not my fault. He did it".
You probably have heard some version of these statements when things are messed up in a product. This is where leveraging upon individual expertise and life experiences come in handy. No individual knows it all, and that's the reason we usually have project teams. When you don't involve people actively in the projects by considering their perspectives and just give them directions on how to work, you miss out on important opinions that could have prevented you from committing blunders.
We're not saying you'll build an excellent product by considering different feedback, but with an open eye for feedback received from the people involved, you can prevent a lot of errors than you'd have otherwise made. This helps you make better decisions and tradeoffs for your products.



Avoiding group think
Almost all the pros that we've discussed can only be materialized in a setting provided the group responsible for making the decision isn't biased by the phenomenon known as groupthink. Groupthink is when individuals are more concerned about being in unity and sync with each other's opinions, i.e., conforming to the group's thought process rather than objectively evaluating the discussion at hand. The group forgoes the critical reasoning skill required to make well-thought-out decisions.
Ways to avoid groupthink
There are simple ways to avoid making a UX design decision by breaking out of one of the visible bias from the group or team responsible for the task.

Building a diverse team: One way to avoid groupthink is to have different personalities in your team and foster chemistry and comfortability among those individuals. Strong leaders are deft at doing this. Once you're able to achieve this, you'd naturally invite different opinions, even conflicting ones occasionally.
Explicitly calling it out: When you're walking into a meeting or brainstorming session where you want as much unfiltered input as possible, you can communicate to the participants at the start that it is okay to have conflicting opinions to one another. This way, you set the tone for the session, which helps bring about a healthy and fruitful discussion, which allows the product teams to have a wide array of ideas and opinions to fast track effective decision-making process.

Engineering vs. Design thinking
Just the way the digital revolution made technology more accessible, design thinking can revolutionize user experience.
Design thinking is a human-centric process of designing the product and its experience. While engineering is a technology-centric process of designing and developing digital products.
Engineering is problem-oriented and focuses on the technical feasibility of a product. On the contrary, design thinking is user-oriented, taking into consideration user needs and likability. They are different approaches to product design and development, where user experience changes significantly depending on which route you choose.
What is the need to compare engineering with design thinking, you ask? It is a meaningful discussion to have, as the power of design thinking is becoming increasingly evident across the digital space today.
Design-led companies are carving niches, driving economies, and scaling to new heights as compared to engineering-led companies.
The impact of collaborative design thinking
Design thinking is thinking humanly. It springs from observing the simple human psyche and designing a user experience for a product to make it a natural part of people's lives.
Top players like Apple and Ford have mastered the art of design thinking. They incorporate their understanding of user needs and preferences into every feature and product they make. They focus on making their product a symbol of status and higher living standards rather than only striving for technological excellence.
Human-centric thinking refers to perceiving and comprehending the basic needs and behaviors of a human being.
A UX designer should think about how a day in the life of their target user pans out. What are their needs? What are the pain points? And then finally, the million-dollar question, how can we make it easy or better for them?
Compelling testaments
Let's take examples of a few trailblazers and see how a design thinking approach proved to be a game changer for them.
Apple
What makes Apple stay at the top of the game even after taking some seemingly eerie decisions, like removing the headphone jack or charging adapters in their latest releases? It is because their brilliant product strategies are originating solely from design thinking.
"Everybody there is thinking about UX and design, not just the designers. And that's what makes everything about the product so much better, much more than any individual designer or design team." Mark Kawano, a former Senior Designer at Apple.
They know their customers too well; they have established trust and are aware of the user expectations they must match. This gives Apple the confidence to remove the headphone jack and roll out Air Pods, which their users have widely accepted. Steve Jobs' vision and a fresh UX approach made Apple an undisputed leader in industrial design.
Airbnb
Another UX pioneer is the vacation rental company Airbnb. What's better than finding a home away from home, right? Airbnb realized the importance of offering the comforts of a home on vacation.
Not only this, they are also loaded with customization options and resources to make your holidays as delightful as possible.
"Design is taken very seriously here. It's on the same level as product management or marketing. A lot of our design work is very typographic, and we think a lot about colors and language and white space." said Alex Schleifer, VP of Design at Airbnb.
He added, "We always ask, can we show this to anyone and have them understand and use it? It's a little bit of art and a little bit of science."
With a brilliant UX design, they make their customers happy. Design thinking has allowed them to create a global presence, letting people become a part of their services by renting homes. Their human-centric approach to design made Airbnb an experience rather than a service.
Netflix 
Now, we will come to our favorite leisure companion: Netflix. The power of Netflix is that it can throw us into a mood where we find ourselves resting on a couch with a tub of popcorn, having the privilege to choose a movie to watch. This is the beauty and brilliance of their UX design and product strategy.
The secret to Netflix's success is having a design-oriented mindset. They understood the shortcomings of the traditional entertainment industry and realized the need for a better user experience.
It empathized with its target users and gave them a single streaming platform with a simple and intuitive UI, countless movies and shows, personalized suggestions, and a seamless experience.
"Netflix understands that when consuming media, you are at the mercy of one of the most important rules of interface design: Don't make me think," Justin Ramedia, Designer.
Coupling engineering and design thinking for better UX
Apple, Netflix, and Airbnb are design pioneers primarily because they are riding the design thinking wave from the early stages of inception. However, tech giants like Microsoft were a little late to the party.
Microsoft learned the importance of design thinking the hard way after the failure of Windows 8. It was promoted as a user-centric product designed by the best engineers. It crashed because Microsoft followed an inside-out paradigm where the engineers assumed that they knew what customers wanted and made a product based on their beliefs.



They redeemed themselves later with the launch of Windows 10, which was conceptualized and designed by UX experts and engineers together. This explains the significance of a balanced approach where a company can combine user understanding with the best tools and technologies to offer convenient and practical products.
Appreciating design thinking more does not take away from the fact that the best user experience is always a result of good design and engineering.
We should harness the collective power of these two contrasting mindsets to achieve an exceptional user experience, just like how Apple's Siri is a remarkable example of cutting-edge technology meeting intelligent UX design.
Infectious edge-cases
We only expect exemplary user behavior in the early ideation and conceptualization stages and consider the best possible scenarios. Well, that's a problematic approach to designing as there are many probable situations where the user might choose to act differently. These unexpected situations are known as edge cases.
An edge case is a point in the user journey where the user faces an issue moving further. These are undesirable scenarios that hinder smooth navigation, denting the user's spirit.
They are like speed bumps in an otherwise smooth path, causing discomfort to the traveler. Edge cases being rare can sometimes be obvious or abstruse, depending on the design and product. However, it is an essential aspect of design to consider for a zero-defect product.
Dealing with edge cases
Dealing efficiently with edge cases is all about foresight to detect a potential issue that a user might face and fix it or provide a solution. The goal is to ensure that your design is always ready with a solution.
Here are a few commonly encountered edge cases for mobile apps and web solutions. We have also added our two cents on how you can deal with the mentioned issues.
Fill the empty states
When we are new to a website or app, we often come across some pages that have nothing to show. These are called 'Empty states,' where the screen shows information but is empty now. 
For instance, if a user has not yet bought any funds on Groww, it would show a relevant illustration with a text informing them about the current state instead of keeping the screen blank. It also gives an 'Add funds to cart' option on the screen as a subtle call to action.



Figure 8.1: A filled empty state using a graphic, text and a relevant CTA on an investment platform Groww [Source: Groww (Website)]
It is wise to prompt users to take the next step once they have landed in an empty state. Consider this screen from the Groww app where a user is given options to import the existing funds or invest in new mutual funds if they are a beginner. Make your empty states guide users around.




Figure 8.2: Addressing an empty state using an appropriate illustration, text and guiding users with CTAs through the app. [Source: Groww (App)]
Facilitate onboarding
Another mood spoiler is downloading an app and not being able to find your way around it.
Your design can address this issue by incorporating proper onboarding steps and information. With the help of easy steps, subtle prompts, and simple instructions, a user can be introduced to the features and functionalities of your app or website.
Look at CRED's onboarding information screens guiding users through the app. This is an easy way of educating users about your product.



Figure 8.3: CRED's onboarding screens helping new users get started with the app easily [Source: CRED Onboarding UI]
Another good example is Duolingo's, which helps users set up their learning profile with a few easy steps.



Figure 8.4: Onboarding screens of the language learning app Duolingo [Source: Duolingo Onboarding UI]
Address error states
To err is human, and it is what makes for the most common edge cases. It is natural for users to enter an incorrect username, a very long password, or wrong card details or pin code. In such situations, the design should elegantly but clearly inform its users about what went wrong and how to correct it.



Figure 8.5: Netflix addressing error states by notifying and guiding users correctly. [Source: Netflix]
Netflix shows a clear error message on their landing page upon entering the email address incorrectly.
You should ensure that your design addresses the error states through clear error messages with a solution, proper positioning of the message, and the use of attractive colors to draw the user's attention in time.
Zero results found
The search may not return any results if you are allowing free search on your platform. Well, that's another classic edge case that designers easily miss.
In such cases, instead of leaving a user stranded on the search page, the website should suggest other options, promote products related to the search, give contact information, and display a sim message. The example of Airbnb and Amazon is a testament to the same.




Figure 8.6: Airbnb's website addressing the zero results page with appropriate text and offering other options [Source: Airbnb]



Figure 8.7: Suggesting alternate options to buy if what users' search for is not available [Source: Amazon]
Upscaling and adaptability
UX specialists and designers often fail to consider certain possibilities in terms of the usability of a product and tumble upon edge cases. A website can be loaded on different browsers at varying speeds.
Alternatively, the website might end up gaining popularity, increased traffic, expanding user base, or start being used internationally across borders.
This can serve as a source of numerous usability issues. Hence, it is better to plan and design keeping these futuristic scenarios in mind. This is achieved by making your design consistent, adaptable, and easily scalable.
Fix delayed loading
Even a minor inconvenience can be considered as an edge case, like delayed loading of a website. It is still the biggest pet peeve for most of us. Preventing this from happening can enhance your product's user experience manifold.
One good way to fix this edge case and cater to the users while your web page loads is to use a skeleton screen. This is beautifully done by LinkedIn; they use skeleton screens to give users the impression that a screen is partially loaded and will appear in no time.



Figure 8.8: Using a skeleton screen that gives an impression of faster loading while users wait for the web page to load [Source: LinkedIn] 
How identifying edge cases proves helpful in UX
Spotting and fixing an edge case after the design is ready, in the development phase, or after the product goes live costs time and money. It is better to either prevent edge cases from happening or be ready with solutions beforehand to avoid any inconvenient iterations needed later.
Identifying edge cases prevents users from reaching dead ends in the design. Planning for edge cases is a preemptive measure taken against any future usability scenario falling out of the general scope, where users might not behave as anticipated.
Even fixing seemingly minor issues improves the overall usability and experience of the product. Users are left satisfied by design, which attends to every need or addresses any roadblock they face across the product. This level of attention to detail makes them want to keep using the site or app in the long run.
Therefore, however small or big, edge cases are an essential part of the UX and design process. As is rightly said, small things can make a big difference.
Conclusion
No matter which situation presents itself as an edge case, the design should always provide users with a solution. The whole point behind identifying and addressing edge cases is to offer a wholesome user experience of the product.
When we vouch for a democratic process, we aren't in favor of diluting the power that the leader possesses over the group. The opposite: when done correctly, the leaders can feel more empowered and help them identify their blind spots as they're not making critical decisions in a silo.










CHAPTER 9
Product Thinking: Designing Value by Fixing the Problem First




Introduction
Before we begin to understand the concept of 'Product Thinking,' let's first think about the word 'Product.' By definition, a product is a thing or service resulting from an action or process. In the context of user experience and designing, a product is a digital service or solution resulting from extensive research, ideation, design, and development.
Product thinking is an approach to identifying the problem first and designing a product that serves as a solution. This approach allows us to bridge the gap between what users want and what we offer.
To find the correct answer, it is important to be aware of the real problem or issue. As Ash Maurya, author of a series of books on Lean Stack has rightly said, "Love your problem, not the solution."
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

The importance of fixing the problem first
The product thinking approach
Problem-first design
Establishing credibility

Objectives
We all know an entrepreneur or a design manager who understands the usage of the product they are designing. The problem arises when they do not understand the problem that it solves. Many times, the co-relation is hard to make.
In a news article on the BBC website, it was reported that despite blocking social media platforms from children's phones or computers, they were being subjected to cyberbullying. Communication is bound to happen, regardless of the number of net nannies installed on devices.
Kids figured out Google's office suite - Docs, Sheets, and Slides which are prominent collaborative and essential tools for schoolwork these days, can also be used as a personal chat platform. One could simply create a file and invite all the friends or classmates to join in for a TÃªte-Ã -tÃªte.
The importance of fixing the problem first
It is crucial to view your product as a solution to users' problems. Your product or design is not merely an aesthetically pleasing interface loaded with exciting features. The sole purpose behind designing a digital product should be solving a problem for the users.
Your design ideas should be a projection of your commitment to give a solution to a problem. To achieve this, it is essential to be able to identify the problem first. When you successfully identify a problem, you design a product of value addressing users' needs.
Product thinking, or the problem-first approach, helps us learn about users and discover issues they are unaware of. Problem-solving fuels innovation and has the potential to make people's lives better with user-centric solutions.
The product thinking approach
We can apply product thinking in many exciting ways. Before we dive into specific methods, it is always good to have clear answers to a few questions, such as:

What is the problem we need to solve? - The problem
Who faces these problems? - Target audience
What can we do to solve the problem? - Design and features
How are we going to do it? - Strategy
Why are we doing it? - Vision and purpose 

The five Ws and one H
An effective way to get to the actual problem is using five Ws and one H. This refers to finding out What, Who, Why, Where, When, and How of a situation. It helps us approach a problem from different directions and think of an inclusive solution.



Figure 9.1: The questions to be asked under the five Ws and one H in order to create a user-centric solution Given by a UX/UI designer, Naren Katakam
The Mom Test
This is a brilliant tactic to make your users tell the truth in user interviews and surveys. Users often avoid being too honest about themselves or their needs, preventing us from identifying the real problem. A fascinating antidote to this is 'The moms' test' by Rob Fitzpatrick.
"Everyone is innocently lying to you all the time, for a wide variety of reasons and the person who lies to you most is your mother, "says Rob, because "she loves you and doesn't want to hurt your feelings."



Figure 9.2: Mom's test revealing the difference between what customers say and what they actually mean
To make the users pass a mom's test and speak up the truth, the style of asking questions needs to change. For instance, if you want to know how frequently a user goes to the gym, with a blunt question like "How often do you go to the gym?", they are most likely to hide the truth. We should be asking, "When was the last time you went to the gym?". Such little maneuvers help discover the real challenges faced by users or their attitude toward them.
Jobs-to-be-done
Another fool proof way of discovering or identifying real problems faced by users is to identify the tasks to be completed. That means we need to think about what job or charge the user is trying to achieve. What solution would best help them do that job? Are such solutions already available?




Figure 9.3: The key aspects of job-to-be-done
The milkshake theory
This can be better explained with the famous 'Milkshake theory' given by Clayton Christensen. With an example of a milkshake store, he explained the importance of asking the right questions in the quest to get to the crux of a problem. This helps understand the role of a product or service in the user's life.



Figure 9.4: Clayton Christensen explains the importance of asking the right questions about the job of a product with the help of the milkshake theory. The theory explains why people like to buy milkshakes by uncovering what it does and the purpose it fulfills. Studies found out that a majority of the customers were working professionals who bought a milkshake on their way to work as it is fills them up for a couple of hours and is thick enough to not spill in a moving car.
Problem-first design
The great Albert Einstein said, "If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions." 
The more time we invest in figuring out a problem, the closer we are to finding a natural solution for users. As a result, products that come out of this process are meant to succeed and be accepted by users because they serve a real purpose in their lives.
So, it is essential for everyone involved in the product lifecycle to always have an answer to, "Is the product helping them get through their day or do things smoothly?"
Often, a product fails to deliver the desired user experience and service because it is not addressing the right problem.
Being able to zero in on the problem and address it through your product can get tricky at times. Ideally, user needs are identified by asking what they need by conducting user research, surveys, interviews, and so on.
Sometimes, even users are unaware of the problem or fail to articulate it well, creating a gap in understanding. This makes it even more challenging to unearth the real problem or need. In this case, it becomes crucial for researchers to keep their eyes and mind open to observe users' behaviors and habits and note their cognitive psychology.
It has the potential to reveal behavioral patterns and lead us to an essential usability issue. This opens many avenues for researchers and designers to curate solutions that make people's lives easy.
Nearly 75% of people choose a brand, an app, or a company based on its design. In the digital world, designing plays a vital role in building trust and reliability. Users make judgments about a brand, whether big or small, new or old, by how it promotes itself and establishes credibility. Your brand should come across as trustworthy to users in the first impression itself. It allows long-term relationships with the customer, resulting in a loyal user base.




Establishing credibility
The design and user experience it offers are the keys to introducing your standards and qualities from the first impression and expanding it beyond the surface detail. A good UX design helps you present your brand or company in a more practical, user-friendly manner. Additionally, it enables you to invest your time, money, and resources in an effective way, adding credibility and authenticity to your product.
The following are the points that lead to earning credibility for your product:

Enticing appearance
Transparency
Customers' needs should be the soul of the design
No false information and no false button
More user-friendly, more credible
Be authentic with the data used
Highlight professional partnerships and certifications
Involve basic information upfront
Give special space to reviews and testimonials
Functionality

Enticing appearance
Color combination, design, the font used, and graphics together make an impression on the user. The enticing appearance of your page makes the user connect and spend more time on your page, creating a bond and building trust between you and the user. Always consider appearance as a significant factor in the design, and remember that whatever looks good grabs attention.
It's human nature to get attracted to pretty things easily, so a good UX designer will always design so that users can quickly be drawn and connected. The design should convey all the product dimensions effectively and convey trust and reliability to users.
Transparency
Reading between the lines is not appreciated when it comes to gaining trust. The user always wants clear terms, pricing, offering properties, and conditions. Transparency fosters trust. All the necessary information, testimonials, references, and links should follow the principle of transparency to make the page genuine and effective. This transparency between you and the users paves the way to a well-trusted relationship.
Customers' needs should be the soul of the design
Many a time, excess information, graphics, and data derail you from the core concept of the project. Always stick to the needs of the customers. Keep the customer's journey as the foundation of the product. Everything should connect with your design. Highlight their strength, work culture, previous works, etc., according to the needs; this will help establish credibility.
No false information and no false button
Adding false information is a significant trust breaker. The designer often uses false buttons to make the design look good, but it backfires as it affects users' trust. Always keep your design in a necessary and easy-to-understand format. False buttons waste users' time and distract them. Users will develop a general distrust toward the whole design, resulting in a dent in the brand's credibility.
More user-friendly, more credible
If a page is easy to access and contains sufficient information, a user willingly engages with it. The easy availability of valuable data does an excellent job of building trust. Users should not get roadblocks in using and navigating through your website. Users should be able to operate and get all the necessary information without any operational issues. So, be comprehensive, accurate, simple, and transparent. User-friendly design builds strong credibility directly.
Be authentic with the data used
Use accurate and fit-for-purpose data. While using a photo or video, always make necessary inquiries about its authenticity because this leads to copyright issues. Try to use actual data for the page. While designing for a brand/an app/a company, using a real image or video of the product creates an impression of trust. Suppose we had developed an online shopping app and used a false picture of the product; when the customer receives the product, it is different from the image shown. The customer will have a vital trust issue and give negative feedback, and a wrong impression will be added to the brand.
Highlight professional partnerships and certifications
Professional partnerships and certifications showcase your relationship and efforts toward your client and brand loyalty. Even this will validate product and service expertise. We can also say that this will help you lay a strong foundation. We get attracted to products that have done more work in the same field. Certification from various areas and subjects will showcase your knowledge and style of work. Make a special page to showcase your working skills that build a strong impression.
Involve basic information upfront
Essential information, like address, phone numbers, additional fees, charges, and terms, contributes significantly toward building trust. No one likes to deal with someone who is not showing basic but essential details of the product. Hidden surprises are not welcome in the case of professional deals. Always put forth minor detailing of the product and offer; this will boost credibility.
Give special space to reviews and testimonials
Deals on digital platforms greatly depend on reviews and testimonials. We can easily trust the one with more positive feedback. Sharing testimonials of previous work will help users get introduced to your working style and accuracy. Most users, i.e., around 98%, choose a brand or an app based on testimonials and reviews. So, showcase testimonials of your previous work and review your present job to gain the trust of future clients or potential customers quickly.
Functionality
Tried and tested is trusted sooner. Friendly navigation, interactive functionality, easy accessibility, and clickable features make a design more trustable. High-quality standards are needed to examine functionality. Triggered animation, gesture control, and subtle features must work properly. Functionality is directly proportional to credibility.
User satisfaction is the key to product credibility
Now, think of purchasing something online, and your favorite shopping website/app will automatically pop up in your mind. Let's point out the small but effective features of the app/website that make it your all-time favorite:

The graphics and fonts used are attractive.
It gives an actual image of the products; most of the products you have received from this website/app are the same as shown in the photos.
It has proper certification of authenticity.
It has clear terms and conditions, no hidden charges or terms.
It is user-friendly, and you can easily search for the product you want.
It has good customer service with no questions asked or ambiguous return policies.
It has a sound review system in place.
It functions properly and has proper filters to help you sift through information.
It has low cost, affordable products and covers most designs in the trend with all options for material.

It would have been difficult for you to trust the brand the first time you ordered something from it, but all the features we discussed above made it your favorite. This is how product credibility plays an essential role in user experience and brand stability. Trust takes time to build, but once a brand gains users' trust, it lasts for years.
It's difficult to build trust in the digital world, but small efforts and proper feedback help. Honesty is always appreciated in the case of UX and UI designing. Additionally, a genuine, comprehensive, attractive yet straightforward product that covers all the necessary details with zero false information, authentic videos and photos, good reviews, and testimonials that cover all user needs will attract users and develop a strong foundation of credibility.
Conclusion
Your products should address specific user issues. If the user needs a solution for X problem, don't make a product for Y and expect them to like it. To make the right product, you need to identify the right problem first.
This is when you unleash the real power of problem-first designing. A user-centric design will naturally solve a problem or fulfill a need when you know what users want.
A product can have many features, but they are all in service of the user. Even if your product is loaded with all sorts of features, it is useless if it is not helping the user in the most basic ways. Therefore, a golden mantra to follow is that the design should solve a problem. So, fill the gap between what your product has to offer and what users need.
We will leave you with a few words from the user-centric design visionary, Steve Jobs, "You've got to start with the customer experience and work backward to the technology. You can't start with the technology and try to figure out where I can sell it." 










CHAPTER 10
The Design Workflow: How Perfect Doesn't Always Equal Pretty




Introduction
A design should be an uninterrupted flow of logic from one point to another. Designing is about placing visual/textual elements on the interface and seeing how well they interact with each other and the user in the digital space. A successful design communicates effortlessly with its users.
The whole point of defining an ideal workflow is to optimize the design process to meet business objectives and user preferences without compromising design standards.
An optimized and well-thought-out design process will help a company save money and time. When a proper design workflow is not followed, designers must bear the weight of extra work on their shoulders to make iterations at the final stages of the design.
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

An ideal design workflow
The five-stage of a perfect design workflow

Objectives
One of the most common answers in UX that you hear from a practitioner is "it depends." This applies to the ideal workflow of a design department. The objective here is to suggest what the perfect workflow for your team could be. It always depends upon the project approach, the client's budget vision, and the skillset at disposal.
An ideal design workflow
Following an ideal design, the workflow might feel like taking the longer route instead of only sketching wireframes and crafting a final design. The reason being, this process lets you approach a design from all sides, covering all its essential aspects. We start from understanding the users, their problems, the client's vision, and the project goal to deliver an all-encompassing design.
Listed here are the advantages of an ideal design workflow:

It makes designing an inclusive process, keeping designers, UX specialists, and engineers onboard.
The final design addresses user issues and offers solutions.
Thinking and rethinking design ideas become simple as changes can be easily made before a design is finalized.
Allowing the design to be observed from many angles ensures the best user experience at the end.

The five stages of an ideal design workflow
We bring you five stages constituting an ideal design workflow to help you reach a satisfactory design solution. However, these should be considered best practices rather than rules for designing as there are no bounds to creative expression. A well-defined workflow helps you manage your time and resources efficiently to create excellent digital products.
Stage 1: Comprehend
The process begins with understanding the target user, i.e., the people that the design will serve. By analyzing user research findings, users' problems, needs, behavior, and preferences can be best understood; this is through the helpful information that we get from user interviews, focus groups, and surveys.
Having gained the users' perspective, it's now time to create flows, journeys, and logical pathways that a user would most likely follow in a design. Creating user flows helps understand the different ways in which a user can approach a task. This would help enhance the design and make it more user-centric. Similarly, creating user journey maps, personas, user stories, and information architecture will reveal user interaction patterns and cognitive biases.
Stage 2: Ideate
There are (almost) no bad ideas. Unless crazy ideas are thrown on the table, you might miss the opportunity to replace the experiences from the last decade. Conducting ideation workshops and exercises gets everyone involved in the process of design. Sometimes, we learn about the new possibilities that most of us weren't even considering.
Sketching and wireframing
Finding ourselves in a user's shoes, we start with sketching our design ideas on paper or a whiteboard. These sketches are to be kept simple, without much detailing. It is always good to work in teams in the ideation phase and allow everyone in the room to approach the problem with their unique design solution.



Figure 10.1: A representative image of paper sketching.
Sketching gives us a direction to work in and ideas to build upon. With a design foundation laid, the next step of ideation is to create wireframes.
Wireframes are the basic low-fidelity prototypes that help you get an idea of how the design will look. A wireframe is a simple lines and boxes representation of the design showing the arrangement of different design elements on an interface. Wireframes are crucial to an efficient design workflow as they allow designers to enter a simulation and experience how the design would play out ultimately. Designers can then experience a design and detect usability or feasibility issues that might serve as roadblocks later. This is an ideal stage to introduce any change, big or small, in your design as not much is at stake yet.




Figure 10.2: The standard way of creating wireframes
You can use tools like Figma, Sketch, or Axure for wireframing. Keep in mind that wireframes should be a plain representation of the design, so avoid adding any fancy or colorful elements to them.
Stage 3: Design
It is a surprise how some designers jump directly to design before ensuring that some form of rough wireframe is available at hand. We should never underestimate the power of a head start point on paper before commencing work on the digital versions.
Tools come and go.
If we are true to the end goal of delivery, Photoshop, Fireworks, Sketch, Figma, Marvel, XD, or any other tool - is just a tool. This reminds me of an old T.S. Eliot quote that goes something like, and I am paraphrasing here, "You can hang your hat on any hanger. The important thing is your hat. Not the hanger."
Hi-Fi prototypes, user testing
The high-fidelity prototype is a result of learnings and feedback gathered from the Lo-Fi prototype, i.e., wireframes. Hi-Fi prototypes are closest to the actual design, with all the visual elements of design, i.e., buttons, icons, motifs, color palette, typography, grids, and so on. 



Figure 10.3: Hi-Fi prototype. (Courtesy: Pramiti R Khan)
Such design mockups reveal how intuitive and usable the actual user interface would be. These prototypes are shown to the clients and other stakeholders as a representation of the final customer-facing design. You can also take it a notch higher by creating high-fidelity interactive prototypes, bringing to life a set of crucial interactions on the screen. Figma is a great tool to create both static and interactive Hi-Fi mockups.
One final stage before implementation of the design is user testing of the Hi-Fi mockup. InVision is an excellent platform to make your prototype interactive and conduct user testing. This exercise enables real-life users to interact with the design with a fresh pair of eyes. They uncover critical design and usability issues in this process, and the feedback is used to improve the design further. User testing can be conducted on tools like Loop11, UsabilityHub, and UserTesting.com.




Figure 10.4: Example of a user testing task on Loop 11



Figure 10.5: Projects dashboard on Loop11 user testing platform
Stage 4: Implement
Once our design is user tested and ready to go, we need to prepare the developers handoff document. This is an important exercise as here, we lead into the design system and benchmark deliveries.
Final UI Design, Dev Handoff
Now is the time to get approval on your prototypes and have a finalized, finished, and polished design ready for development. Tools preferred for this are Illustrator, Adobe XD, Photoshop, Figma, or Sketch.



Figure 10.6: Final UI design of the dashboard of DecApp
The developer handoff of the final design is the most crucial stage in the workflow to maintain design integrity. Most often than not, the essence of a design is lost in translation from designers to developers. Therefore, it is essential to communicate the vision and concept of the design to the developers.



Figure 10.7: Zeplin - A tool used to ensure smooth developer handoff
We can achieve this by transferring the final designs through tools like Zeplin, which unveils and presents technical information like hex codes, CSS, etc. to help developers. Developers can also stay aligned with the design foundation by referring to the design system, which is the single source of truth. Axure is also a great tool to assist in a hassle-free developer handoff.
Stage 5: Improve
As responsible UX professionals, our job does not end at delivery. A sustainable success benchmark identification exercise is required.
Test, update, improve
A design's journey starts with its users and ends with them. Users' views of and opinions on the final and launched design are critical to the continuous evolution of the design process. Understanding how the final product has made the users feel allows us to reflect on our design process thoroughly.



Figure 10.8: Animated depiction of post-launch analysis [Source: Hotjar]
Here are a few reasons to do post-launch analysis:

How did users respond to the design?
Was it successful in solving their problems?
Did it offer them a fulfilling experience overall?
In what ways did our design succeed or lack?
How can we improve our process and the design?
What are the key takeaways for us about our design approach and methodologies?

Once we cover these grounds post launch, an ROI matrix can be presented to all the stakeholders, with the announcement of success or failure of the exercise and future recommendations.
Conclusion
With everything that we learned here about an ideal design workflow, it is still essential to know what works best for you. This process is not carved in stone and can be tweaked as per your project requirements.
The only thing to keep in mind while following any design process is designing for users and streamlining the design process to save time and money. It is all about finding the right balance between users' needs, business objectives, and technical feasibility. Follow the path that suits you and your product the best, but remember that good things take time, so avoid shortcuts.










CHAPTER 11
Validate Your Design With Usability Test




Introduction
Design validation is a process of weighing the pros and cons of your design. It seldom happens that designers consider their design validated just by the approval and appreciation from the stakeholders. Validation is much more than this; it evaluates whether your design has failed or lived up to users' expectations.
A design is indeed validated when it manages to solve usability issues and leave its users satisfied. Here, we will learn the art of making sure that your design is serving its users right. In the coming section, we will cover a few commonly used methods for design validation. Learn about them and pick the ones that work the best for you. Do keep in mind that these methods work best in combination, so the more, the merrier.
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

Methods of design validation
Best practices for design validation

Objectives
The difference between art and design is that design always tries to solve a quantifiable problem, whereas art is the expression of the artist's creativity. If your design is not solving the purpose of your intended target audience, then it is simply your expression of how a solution should be.
To get the solution right, it must be tested, just like a vaccine. The overall impact of the solution must be documented and modified until the right balance is achieved in the final solution. This chapter will focus on how a design validation exercise can be performed quickly and effectively. It will help you learn different qualitative as well as quantitative methods of validating your design.
Methods of design validation
Methods to validate or evaluate your design are broadly classified under two categories: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative methods derive valuable user insights from numbers, trends, statistics, percentages, metrics, and such.
On the other hand, qualitative methods of validation focus more on the emotional journey of the user, that is, analyzing user behavior, reactions, thoughts, and comments while interacting with the design. As shown in the chart below (refer to figure 11.1), there are many exciting methods to evaluate a design quantitatively and qualitatively.




Figure 11.1: Quantitative and qualitative design validation methods
Out of a wide range of validation methods, a few important ones are elaborated here.
Ten usability heuristics
Jakob Neilson's ten usability principles will help you immensely in validating your design for the good or bad. It offers 10 essential rules of thumb, which reveal a lot about its usability and utility when applied to a design. 
The 10 Neilson's heuristics are as follows:

Visibility of the system status
Match between system and the real world
User control and freedom
Consistency and standards
Error prevention
Recognition rather than recall
Flexibility and efficiency of use
Aesthetic and minimalistic design
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Help and documentation

To learn more about usability heuristics and how to apply them to your design, head to 10 Usability Heuristics by NN/g.
User Testing
As we know, the best way to validate your design is to have it used by the target users, the ones who will end up using it. User testing serves this purpose just right. It is an exercise conducted with a selected number of users where they are asked to perform a set of tasks and interact with the design.
Usability tests allow us to examine users' recorded responses and closely observe their reactions and body language as they interact with the design. This helps us analyze how comfortable users are with the design and if it helps them make their lives any better. If not, it will help us understand what can be done to make it better.
Usability testing is the most relied upon method to determine the strengths and shortcomings of the design. It also helps uncover minor but essential usability issues that could otherwise go undetected.
A/B Testing
A/B testing is a quantitative user experience research and analysis method. It is carried out by taking two variants or alternatives of the same design or specific parts of a design and assigning each version randomly to users. Any deviation in the user's response will directly reflect the changes made in the alternate design, i.e., design option B. A/B testing is also known as split testing. It is an extensive exercise that requires time as the data collected from the A/B testing is analyzed for key business metrics for the design. It ultimately helps us determine which version of the design performs best and is preferred by users.
Benchmarking
Benchmarking in UX is the process of assessing a design or product's user experience against a significant standard through a predefined set of metrics or benchmarks. We can weigh our design against a competitor or an industry average to see where it stands and what needs improvement.
Benchmarks are usually metrics set to quantitatively evaluate a design's performance, such as user engagement, time on a task, rate of task completion, abandonment rate, etc. Therefore, benchmarking is a handy way to objectively evaluate a design and track its evolution. We have discussed the process of benchmarking elaborately and thoroughly in a separate and dedicated chapter.
Heatmaps and Eye-tracking
Obtaining heatmaps from tracking eye behavior or gaze pattern on a design proves highly beneficial in assessing the interface's findability or discoverability of crucial design elements. This, in turn, sheds light on the overall usability of the design and the experience it offers to its users.
Below is a heatmap of the user gaze pattern of Barnes & Noble's website. It shows what areas attract a user's attention and how easily they can find essential information or buttons on the design. In the given example, note that the red areas are the ones that get the most attention, yellow and orange get lesser, and the purple regions the least.
Heatmap and eye tracking



Figure 11.2: Heatmap of Barns & Noble website revealing users' gaze pattern and hotspots.
Heatmaps and eye-tracking are ideally qualitative methods of design validation. Still, technically, the process involves aggregating user data like the number and duration of eye fixation across the interface.
Best practices for design validation
Having gone through the most applied design validation methods, it is vital to keep a few things in mind to ensure that you evaluate your design in the best way possible. Here are a few pointers to help you stay on the right track.
Test your design with the right users
Always select your target test audience wisely. It should be the users who are eventually going to use the product for their needs. User testing done with the appropriate set of users makes a big difference.
Provide a suitable environment
Making users feel as close as possible to the actual environment where they will use the design is a crucial aspect. User behavior is affected by their surroundings, so this is a point worth considering to improve design evaluation.
Avoid priming
Priming refers to the preconditioning of users' psyche before they participate in any validation activity. Things like how you frame your questions and how you introduce or guide them through the validation process make a difference. If you say, "We would like to watch how to interact so we can validate the design.", it might give the user the impression that you only want them to validate the design and not suggest changes.
Conclusion
We are calling it design evaluation instead of design validation because validation seems like a one-way road. There is no room for two-way traffic where users are doing as directed and detecting issues and suggesting essential changes in the design.
The validation process should be taken more as a design evaluation exercise, where we are looking for both its strengths and shortcomings. Additionally, this comprehensive feedback is considered the gold standard when it comes from the users themselves. It helps us know what they like, what they are struggling with, and how we can make the design better. This is the crux of design validation.
Developing a deeper understanding of a design is equally important, along with focusing on and fixing its technical aspects. In the next chapter, we will talk about the six crucial aspects to make a wholesome user-centric design.










CHAPTER 12
Six Aspects of Good User-Centered Design




Introduction
Kim Vicente, a researcher, teacher, and author best known for his two books: The Human Factor and Cognitive Work Analysis, said, "design should begin by identifying a human or societal need--a problem worth solving--and then fulfill that need by tailoring technology to the specific, relevant human factors."
Stakeholders are often concerned with numbers and equate a product's success with the profit it garners. Therefore, the significance of a good design is seldom overlooked while measuring the success of a product. If we think about it, a product's success reflects its likability, usability, and quality of service. All these factors revolve around users, i.e., a product or service is meant to do well in the market if the users accept it.
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

Significance of a good design
The six aspects of good design
Value
Usability
Credibility
Desirability
Accessibility
Findability

Objective
A good and appealing design is not just about how it looks and feels; it is beyond aesthetics. A good design is one that addresses six important aspects: value, usability, credibility, desirability, accessibility, and findability. This chapter offers an insight into the meaning of these six crucial aspects and how we can incorporate these into the process of designing valuable designs and experiences for our products.
Significance of a good design
Whether you are selling a physical product like car, apparel, or electronics or offering a service like insurance, entertainment, banking, or education, your digital presence matters. The quickest way for people to know about your product or service in this digitized world is through the internet. This defines the way you communicate with people through the web as very important.
How you portray your brand and product through an interface is instrumental in making people perceive your service in a particular light. This is where the design takes center stage and becomes an essential aspect. Design is your chance to make the first long-lasting impression on users and garner a loyal user base for your product.
The six aspects of good design
For products to make an everlasting impact on your users, they must demonstrate value, usability, credibility, desirability, accessibility, and findability in their digital interface. The design offers a window into the experience that your product or service is going to give its users. The design engages them and provides a clear idea about your product.
By virtue of these six crucial aspects, a design becomes a seamless part of people's lives.
Value
Create products that add maximum value to the customer to save you time and money. Your product should solve a user's problem and serve a purpose. If you are helping people get through the day with minimum effort, your product or service is on its way to become a valuable part of their lives.
For instance, let's take Microsoft's products. Be it Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, every product helps us be more productive and efficient in our lives. Or Google, can you imagine a day without using any Google product? No, right? It enables you to search for information, send emails, set reminders, keep notes, save files on the cloud, know a location, create a document, sheet, or presentation, and much more.
Such products and their user-centric designs add value to our lives by helping us perform important routine activities without any inconvenience, leaving us satisfied.
Usability
Develop strong empathy for the user; it will help create usable software. Solve their problems by understanding their needs, environment, and limitations while using a product, service, or system.
"Usability is about human behavior. It recognizes that humans are lazy, get emotional, are not interested in putting a lot of effort into, say, getting a credit card and generally prefer things that are easy to do vs. those that are hard to do."
â David McQuillan, ex-Swiss banker and founder of Suffer-fest cycling workout resources
The interface should be uncluttered and easy to understand, provide relevant information and context, and instruct and guide users to perform their tasks. The purpose of a functional user-centric design is to enable users to accomplish their objectives on an interface with minimum effort and inconvenience. The product should be designed to offer all the necessary information, answer their questions, and give them a sense of control and choice.
A design is considered standard for usability when it offers proper navigation, visual clarity, familiarity, consistency, flexibility and efficiency, error prevention, and feedback. Making software usable ensures that the users can achieve their goals effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily.
Credibility
Create credible software for the user to improve sales conversions and make users stay loyal to your products. People use what they trust, and credibility is an essential aspect of a good user-centric design. In today's time, when a majority of the exchange of information and services happens over the web, it is crucial to ascertain the credibility of your offerings. Your software should instill a feeling of legitimacy and trust in its users to earn a loyal user base.
According to Stanford's Web Credibility Project, research was conducted to identify the factors affecting people's credibility on digital products or services. Nearly half the people (46.1%) assessed the credibility of a website based on the overall visual appeal and aesthetics of its design. They found that websites with appealing design elements such as layout, typography, iconography, color scheme, and font size are easy to believe and trust.
Along with the visual aspects of a design, other vital details such as the authenticity of the information and resources also reinforce the credibility of a product or a service. Based on extensive research, Stanford has defined 10 guidelines for web credibility, as listed here:

Make the accuracy of the information on your site easy to verify.
Demonstrate that there is a real organization behind your site.
Highlight the expertise in your organization in the content and services you provide.
Show that honest and trustworthy people are backing this business.
Make it easy for people to contact you, show tangibility.
Design your site so that it looks professional (or is appropriate for your purpose).
Make your site easy to use -- and valuable.
Update your site's content often (with a blog or new products may be).
Use restraint with any promotional content (e.g., ads, offers).
Avoid errors of all types, no matter how small they seem.

Take a detailed look at the web credibility guidelines and how to apply them to your design from this link.
Desirability
Desirability might come across as a superficial aspect of a design, in contrast to usability and value. We usually focus on making the software as usable as possible to serve the users best. In this process of creating user-centric designs that are there to solve user problems, we forget about making them desirable. This makes us think, is solving a problem enough, or should we work on making our products more desirable, appealing, and exciting? Desirability is what draws people toward your services.
Factors such as brand image, presence, identity, and the value proposition of the services and products they offer play a vital role. Users desire a product or service that signals toward a higher socioeconomic standard (e.g., Apple, BMW), offers unique functionality, or simply gives them pleasure of use. Therefore, it is vital to think beyond utility and usability and craft exceptional experiences offering joy and fulfillment to people.
Accessibility
By virtue of accessibility, a design becomes more desirable, credible, valuable, and usable. The concept of accessibility is rooted in thoughtfulness, inclusivity, and acceptance. Making your designs more accessible means incorporating features and functionalities for people with a range of limited abilities while interacting with a product. More than 10% of the population bears some or the other kind of disability, which challenges them in performing day-to-day tasks.
"Accessible design is good design", says Steve Ballmer," it benefits people who don't have disabilities as well as people who do. Accessibility is all about removing barriers and providing the benefits of technology for everyone."
Making a product accessible requires identifying the possible functional and situational limitations that users can experience. Functional limitations include speech, auditory, physical, visual, neurological, and cognitive disabilities. Color blindness, for instance, is a commonly occurring disability preventing people from comprehending color-coded information. Such people have no way of differentiating between a hyperlink highlighted in blue and straightforward text. To remove this barrier, such highlighted links are also underlined to make color blind people easily differentiate between a link and static text.
Designs can be made accessible for people with disabilities and those without them by addressing situational limitations. A situational limit is often detailed depending on the external environment and factors. For instance, using an app while driving, running, in bright sunlight, in a dark place, in a loud place (when one cannot hear clearly), in a quiet place (where one cannot make noise), when your hands are occupied, when you're wearing gloves, or in case of an emergency. Accessibility is a crucial aspect in creating a user-centric, user-friendly design.
Findability
In my opinion, findability comes before accessibility or usability. It is a simple fact that if you can't find something, you can't use it. Deploy interfaces that are findable, and this will cut your organizational support costs.
We can take care of findability while designing interfaces as it is instrumental in customer satisfaction. A design must be easy to navigate and have locatable features and objects of significance. Users should effortlessly and intuitively find what they are looking for on an interface. The design should also guide the users and help them navigate its different parts without any roadblocks or confusion.
We can enhance the findability of a design by introducing familiar visual cues such as cross icon, back button, home icon, menu bars, and search bar/icon on the interface. It can also be done by strategically and carefully placing important information where users expect to find it, such as details and price of a product, available dates for booking, etc. Interfaces where people can easily understand what to do, where to go, and where to find stuff give them a sense of control and are meant to be liked.
Conclusion
Following these aspects of a good design will enrich the overall experience of your product both in terms of appeal and value. We can enrich the product by adding value to a design that serves a purpose, make it usable, credible, desirable, accessible and findable for everyone who uses it.
In the next chapter, we will talk about the power of collaboration and enhancing your product with working in cross-functional teams.










CHAPTER 13
Collaborating With Multi-Disciplinary Teams




Introduction
A cross-functional team constitutes people from different areas of expertise, collaborating to accomplish a shared goal. The concept of cross-functional teams stems from the Agile methodology for software development.
There is a gamut of disciplines involved in the design, development, and UX process. Every role, be it a UX researcher/ architect/ writer, designer, engineer, marketing specialist, quality analyst, product manager, or business analyst, makes a significant contribution to the final product. This is the sole purpose of having cross-functional teams, i.e., to exchange ideas and work cohesively.
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

The need of cross-functional collaboration for better UX
Fixing the problem with cross-functional teams
Benefits of a cross-functional team in UX
Challenges of the cross-functional approach

Objective
This chapter will explore the possibilities of learning from the stakeholders and delivering a wholesome solution to end users. We will try to understand how a UX professional must engage with teams with various degrees of understanding about UX.
While dealing with cross-functional teams and professionals working in them, we get insights into how a user who might be sanitized or over-exposed to the solution may feel. This chapter will help you work efficiently in cross-functional teams to ensure a better outcome.
The need of cross-functional collaboration for better UX
Products failing to meet users' expectations is a linear process of product design and development instead of a collaborative one. The work is passed on from one team to another, and each team is working in silos to accomplish their tasks. The greater vision is lost somewhere in the middle, between deadlines and delivery.
According to a survey report by Accenture, companies that adopted cross-functional collaboration resulted in four times revenue gains, 13 times more profitability, and better growth in future.
What usually happens in today's fast-paced, supply-demand world is that everyone wants to deliver the best in the least amount of time. A designer is driven to give an appealing and functional UI; a marketing specialist intends to market the product and show the gains, and a product manager aims to meet the deadlines as effectively as possible.
This way, the company sees it as a project rather than a product adding value to people's lives. This completely sidelines users' needs and issues, which should ideally be the only driving force.
Fixing the problem with cross-functional teams
Instead of working independently with distinct motives, a team can deliver the best product through collaboration. Every team member gives their expert inputs, and the product is optimal in all respects. According to a software development company head, "When a diverse set of people come together, a problem is approached in all possible ways, and we can uncover unique perspectives."



Figure 13.1: A chart representing how professionals from different disciplines can come together to work on a product as a cross-functional team.
Building a cross-functional work environment ensures efficient use of the company resources and time, expediting the process. It makes members from every discipline be seen, heard, and valued as everyone gets a seat on the table.
This approach develops a mindset of acceptance and respect for all the team members' skillsets and ideas. One understands the contribution each department makes in creating a good product. It creates an ecosystem within an organization where diverse viewpoints and ideas can co-exist.
Benefits of a cross-functional team in UX
The user experience is refined through cross-functional collaboration as different perspectives are added to curating the product. The pluses and minuses for each discipline are analyzed better as people in different roles learn to empathize with others and the users.
For instance, a product's design can be perfect, but it might face issues in the development or quality assurance stage. A cross-functional approach helps an organization power through such roadblocks by collaborating across functional boundaries.
Some significant benefits of cross-functional teams in UX are explained below:

Improved communication and shared goals: An interdisciplinary team can communicate their ideas and problems with each other better. This ensures efficient problem-solving.
Additionally, through collaboration, the team gains a broader perspective by sharing knowledge and learning from each other. It fosters understanding and alignment of the team to work on a shared goal.
Frictionless execution: Cross-functional teams experience a smooth execution phase through easy handovers, issue detection, and resolution. Each team member is equally invested in every stage of the product development life cycle. They don't need extensive handover procedures from one team to another. They can easily detect issues related to any discipline, and the problems can be quickly fixed as the situation is communicated in the unit properly.
Optimal outcomes: Efficient communication and plan execution gives a good end-product with a satisfactory customer experience. It results from teamwork where everyone puts in their efforts, skills, and ideas to create an innovative solution serving user needs.

Challenges of the cross-functional approach
Having talked about the cross-functional team approach, you must also know that it is bound to have challenges as it involves complexities of human interaction. If a team successfully wades through these, nothing can stop their organization from reaching new heights.
A few notes to keep in mind while adopting a cross-functional collaboration approach are as follows:

Make sure everyone in the team shares a common goal and follows the same plan. If teammates with different roles and responsibilities prioritize their tasks over others, they will disrupt the team's sync and pace.
Everyone should share ideas openly in the team and leave their egos at the door as their ideas might or might not be chosen. Only the ideas best suited for the product are chosen. It is essential to develop consensus and transparency within the team.
It is crucial to have a team leader to ensure discipline and order. A leader helps keep everyone on the team on track. They should ensure balanced and healthy communication between team members.

Functioning in cross-functional teams becomes easier once these issues are addressed and ironed out effectively.
Conclusion
The cross-functional approach proves effective on both the full-cycle development of a product and just the UX part of it. As we know, UX research and documentation lays the foundation for the product and sets the tone for the experience it will offer to its users.
Having a cross-functional team ensures that everyone understands what the user wants and collectively solves their problems through the product. The exact purpose should drive right from the user researcher to the marketing specialist.
In cross-functional teams, everyone should be passionate about achieving an outcome and be fueled by the desire to deliver the best user experience.
In the next chapter, we will explore the concept, methods and significance of benchmarking in UX.










CHAPTER 14
Benchmarking and Continuous Deployment




Introduction
The Nielsen Norman Group defines UX benchmarking as evaluating a product or service's user experience by using metrics to gauge its relative performance against a meaningful standard.
The practice of benchmarking helps us track the progress of our design over time and evaluate it against a competitor or an established industry standard. It is also known as longitudinal benchmarking.
In simpler words, benchmarking is a way of setting the bar for ourselves and seeing if our design meets those standards at a given point in time. It is an ongoing process as we can keep improving our design by raising the bar.
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

Benchmark UX
Frequency of benchmarking design
The value of benchmarking and continuous deployment

Objective
This chapter aims to give you a peek into how benchmarking helps create the user experience for any product or solution. Many critics in the industry are against the cookie-cutter approach to benchmarking solutions.
Contrary to thee opinion pieces that you might come across on various UX article websites, this chapter will try to put a positive spin to the entire process and the objective of benchmarking. It will guide you through the process of benchmarking and teach you how to define UX metrics, select research methodology, establish a baseline, and redesign, test, and improve your product.
Benchmarking in UX
Benchmarking your design or product is a structured approach with a well-defined process. You can compare your design or product against an earlier version, a competitor, an industry standard, or a stakeholder-determined goal during benchmarking.
You can compare your design against the following things.
An earlier version of the product or service
Example: In 2020, the average time to purchase on your website was 58 seconds. After the redesign, the average time to make a purchase is 42 seconds.
A competitor
Example: On your website or app, the success rate for application completion is 88%, while your competitors are at 62%.
An industry standard
Example: The average ease-of-use rating for booking a room at your hotel's website is 6.4/8, whereas the average rating of the top 6 hotels (industry standard) is 7.5/8.
A stakeholder-determined goal
Example: Our eight-week retention rate is 10%, but we are aiming for 15%.
We can conduct benchmarking using various quantitative assessment methods, such as usability testing, surveys, user interviews, or user data analysis. You can use any of these research methods to collect the benchmarking metrics.
Defining UX metrics
A crucial aspect of benchmarking is to define the metrics on which we will measure a design's UX. Metrics are quantifiable measures or data points to indicate if a design has passed or failed the users' test. Metrics can be the number of clicks on a product, time on a task, time on a reading piece, number of users recommending your app, the number of users who buy the subscription, etc. It gives you numbers to work with and relatively assess the performance of your design.
It is also necessary to cherry-pick a set of features from your design to apply these metrics. For instance, if we were to benchmark Amazon's website, we would select features such as the home page, search, the wish list, the product page, and checkout. We will then apply our defined metrics like time on task, conversion rate, success rate, error count, etc., on each selected design feature.
Google's HEART framework is a helpful reference to define and set metrics for your benchmarking exercise. You can select a set of metrics as per your product or design, e.g., happiness or engagement.
HEART is an abbreviation of, Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, and Task effectiveness and efficiency:

Happiness: Measure of users' attitude or perception; example metrics: satisfaction rating, ease-of-use rating, and net promoter score.
Engagement: Level of user involvement; example metrics: average time on task, feature usage, and conversion rate.
Adoption: Initial uptake of a product, service, or feature; example metrics: new accounts/visitors, sales, and conversion rate.
Retention: How existing users return and remain active in the product or service; example metrics: returning users, churn rate, and renewal rate.
Task effectiveness and efficiency: Efficiency, effectiveness, and errors; example metrics: error count, success rate, and time on task.

Selecting a method and target audience
The next step is to select a research methodology to conduct benchmarking and the appropriate users for it. This decision should depend on the time, cost, and skill set you are willing to invest in the practice.
Three quantitative methods are considered best for UX benchmarking exercise; they are listed as follows:

Usability testing is where users interact with the design and perform assigned tasks. User researchers collect the metrics data and analyze user performance quantitatively.
Analysis of user-related data, such as website-usage data or customer-support data, gives valuable insights into UX.
Surveys or user interviews help collect data on user satisfaction, recommendation rate, promoter score, and so on.

Another thing of significance is to pick the right people to conduct these tests. Your test audience should represent the niche that your product or design is made to serve. Additionally, ensure that you keep the questions or testing parameters the same throughout the iterations. If you keep changing your measures with each round of benchmarking, it will fail to yield desired and accurate results.
Here are two instances of selecting the task, metrics, and methodology to benchmark a product:
Instance 1 - E-commerce website
Task or feature to test: Purchasing with one-click purchasing 
Benchmarking metrics: Sales, adoption, net promoter score
Methodology: Analytics, survey
Instance 2 - Mobile-banking website 
Task or feature to test: Updating contact information
Benchmarking metrics: Completion rate, errors on a page, number of calls for support on the task
Methodology: Analytics, internal-customer support data



Figure 14.1: The difference in bounce rates of two versions of a mobile app. The statistics show a lesser bounce rate of 7% as the user progress through the first version and a greater bounce rate, i.e., 23.5%, in the second version of the same app.
Establishing a baseline
Establishing a baseline is setting a starting point for your design to compare against. In your first round of benchmarking, collect the data on the decided metrics using the chosen methods. For instance, if you wish to benchmark your hotel's website, you can begin testing parameters such as booking rate, browsing rate, net promoter code, and so on.
You can either compare your outcomes with your competitors, an industry-standard, or a stakeholders' requirement. Having a baseline gives you an initial idea of how well your product is doing as per the set standards.
Suppose you do not have the resources and time to conduct a comparative study or a stakeholder benchmark with your competitors. In that case, you can refer to reliable industry standards for various business domains on Measuring UX.
Redesigning your product 
The results obtained from the first round of benchmarking study will reveal essential insights into the strengths and shortcomings of your design. Based on the information you collect, identify the areas that need work and plan to implement those changes. It is important to interpret your findings accurately before making any design-related decision.
Redesign your product, improving upon the aspects that will enhance the UX as per the benchmarking findings.
Evaluating the redesigned product
To gauge whether the changes you have made in the design make any real difference, we need to put it through another round of benchmarking. Evaluating the redesigned product on the same parameters or metrics gives us a relative before and after picture. With the help of this, we can ensure or conclude that the changes we have made play a vital role in the product's overall experience. Such benchmarking iterations are crucial to the continuous evolution of your product.
Tracking progress through KPIs
The power of benchmarking is that it highlights the importance of UX in the company's overall growth. It is essential to link the benchmarking findings to business KPIs and demonstrate their value and contribution. The best way to keep an eye on the progress of your design in terms of UX is through KPIs. If the product is successfully delivering a satisfactory experience, it is meant to reflect on the business.
For instance, say you can reduce the time taken on a critical task by 60% by making a design change. You can demonstrate the direct impact of this change on cost savings or revenue gains by calculating the ROI. 



Figure 14.2: Tracking progress through KPIs in terms of revenue, user satisfaction and sales.
You can prove that a design change can save the company money by calculating the cost savings. This gives stakeholders the confidence to put in the time and money required to polish a design and enhance the experience it offers.
(Time on task) x (Hourly pay) x (Number of employees) = Cost savings
Frequency of benchmarking a design
A design is never complete. It is a continuous process. Benchmarking is like taking snapshots of the process at regular intervals to reflect upon how we are doing and how far we have come.
The frequency of benchmarking varies from project to project or company to company. It depends on how frequently you introduce changes in your design.



Figure 14.3: The appropriate time to conduct a benchmarking analysis is after the end of one design cycle (i.e., the evaluation phase) and before the beginning of another cycle (i.e., the defining phase). Courtesy: NN Group
Depending on your design lifecycle, timeline, and budget, you can carry out benchmarking every month, every 6 months, every year, or once every 2 years.
The value of benchmarking and continuous deployment
Benchmarking is a quantitative assessment method that helps convert subjective user feedback into objective goals. Qualitative methods might succeed in uncovering crucial user insights, but it becomes challenging to translate this information into business objectives.
Suppose a user suggests a change in your design in a survey. You take it under consideration and make that change. Now, is there any way to tangibly show the effect of making that change instead of just making the user a tad bit happier?
We take quantifiable parameters to evaluate our design and prove the difference a design change can make through benchmarking. Benchmarking fuels continuous improvement and evolution of the design. It allows us to identify issues, implement changes, and assess our design again for its performance.
User experience is incredibly crucial, but it is not the sole factor in making your service or product win people's hearts. A dominating presence results from a perfect interplay of product quality and the commitment to offer a meaningful user experience.
Every piece of the puzzle, i.e., your product, vision, intentions, and service, should fit to make an everlasting positive impression on your customers. Benchmarking is a practice to ensure that you are always on the right track when it comes to the design and experience of your product.
Conclusion
Benchmarking is a precious practice to tangibly track the overall progress of our design. It helps us reflect on our design process and choices. It becomes more effective when it enables us to translate our findings into concrete business gains.
Benchmarking is an extremely useful practice as it helps determine if the system is meeting UX product goals. It allows us to set a baseline or reference point for future design comparisons and discover areas for future product improvement. We can obtain a holistic view of product performance through summative evaluation and demonstrate the return on investment for UX.
This brings us to the end of our exploration of the world of UX. In the chapter to follow, we summarize your learnings so far to consolidate your understanding of UX.










CHAPTER 15
Final Considerations




Introduction
As all good things come to a closure, so must this book. To simplify the processes, the focus of this book was on people who are either starting their design career or moving in from other domains of design to UX. In this final chapter of the book, we will take a look at how minor tweaks and observations could help you define your own process method for UX design.
Structure
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

Nothing is set in stone
Shortcuts are fine - with caution
Selling UX within the organization
End goal should be user success

Objective
The objective of this chapter is to help you understand the importance of the factors that impact the process of UX design across organizations and projects. Many processes and methods might not align with the understanding and situation of the project, but that should not discourage a practitioner from finding a way around it.
Nothing is set in stone
When we talked about ideal workflows, it was mentioned that ideal is a subjective word. The key answer in UX has always been - and will remain - 'it depends'.
The process you chalk out before heading out for a project might differ from your most recent 6D adventure where you had all the freedom of leveraging every single paid UX tool and resource out there.
Sometimes, research isn't even an option. Not because the money is not there, but because time crunch and pressure of go-to-market execution from stakeholders doesn't allow it. Finding means to get some data - any secondary research references could come in handy in such circumstances.
Retrofitting each project with its own set of UX execution plan is a must. Define what works with a given set of parameters and instructions from the client, organization, product manager, or stakeholders.
Shortcuts are fine - with caution
Jacob Nielson has said, 'some data is better than no data', but it does not mean that it is okay to get the research done with your friends and family or within the organization. It means that if you can scratch the surface and get some traction, that should be leveraged.
If there is minimal budget, ask for analytics access to look for historical user behavior. Look at the mobile app and play store reviews. Looking at the pitfalls of competitors is one way of figuring out clean paths.
When you are presented with your first full-scale UX project, it will take a lot longer than you have calculated.
Hence, do a dummy project while you can, but with real research. See if you can solve a social problem with digital touchpoints. Design as if you have all the funding in the world, and track the hours you are putting in.
This exercise becomes the benchmark of how your future project estimations will be calculated. See if you can identify any patterns from the projects to come.
When you do your second project, you know what could go wrong. You will be ready to deal with newer versions of UX process challenges. In due time, a lot can be processed on the go. Collecting and processing information will help you reduce time with practice.
Winging a persona from the get-go is the worst way of UX execution.
As a 2021 LinkedIn viral post pointed out, both Ozzy Osbourne and Prince Charles share amazing persona traits. They both are born in 1948, male, married twice, British, live in a castle, famous public figures, and so on, but do they fit the same persona?
Looking at the above-mentioned data is the key. Understanding the challenges and problem areas of personas is what differentiates them.
Selling UX within the organization
This is the era of experiences. People pay for experiences. Luxury, Power, VR, AR, Services - SAAS / On-Demand.
Economy has led users to demand niche experiences. From booking holidays to buying cars, companies are selling features rather than specs, i.e., the experiences that you will have.
From individuals learning how machines behaved, we are teaching machines to learn how to behave like/with humans. Machine learning is one of the new tech frontiers.
Experience design is a multi-billion-dollar industry. Designing for transparency in the post-truth era has its own set of challenges. Now, you must design for inclusiveness, acknowledgements, and micro user-communities. Being specific is the mantra. The mass generalization or production era has ended.
In the past 15 years, 52% Fortune 500 companies vanished, simply because adoption is the key, and delivering high experiences to customers is only way ahead. Clients do not ask for server security, as it is assumed that we know how. They do not ask for encryption; they think it is given. They ask for high-quality user experiences.
Software companies must deliver more than just feature compliance from SoWs. Top UX now acts as a medium to get people discover and use the features that developers and engineers have spent hours to perfect. The UX is not about the feature but the overall experience of the brand and product the business is offering
Finding the seat at the table is now easier than ever. Understanding the importance and responsibility of this power is the path ahead for any UX practitioner who wants to move ahead in their career.
End goal should be user success
Users are the key stakeholders who can make or break your app or service offering. The only stakeholders who do not have a say - until invited - during the development process of the said product or service, are the users.
Our job as UX practitioners is being vocal on behalf of the absent users. User advocacy is a key part of UX design, which leads to customer success. However, on many occasions, UX practitioners seem to forgo their duty and rights of representing the user to avoid confrontation with the managers and to avoid paying stakeholders.
Conclusion
I started my career in design as a web designer. That designation became obsolete with the advent of mobile and multi-viewports-based design. UI designer replaced the old designation, and once the awareness about reducing the cognitive load of the user became commonplace, user experience became the way ahead.
As we know that history repeats itself, learning from the patterns, we must consider the end of UX designer. The profession of UX design is a recent one, but the end is near. The responsibilities may be modified, and names might get further complicated on the lines of product architect or immersive experience designer.
The only constant from the days of a lonely web designer is that user advocacy is still part of the job. Process, evidence, and empathy are key. You are merely the advocates of your users.
You're not the user.
