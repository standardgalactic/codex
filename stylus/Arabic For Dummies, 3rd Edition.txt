Introduction

Arabic, the official language of more than 27 countries, is the mother tongue of more than 420 million people. It's spoken throughout the Middle East, from Morocco to Iraq. Additionally, because Arabic is the language of the Koran and Islam, more than 1.3 billion people across the world understand it.
Due to recent geopolitical events, Arabic has catapulted to the top of the list of important world languages. Even in countries where Arabic isn't the official language, people are scrambling to master this important and vital global language.
For people in North America and Europe, at first glance Arabic seems like a difficult language to master; after all, it isn't a Romance language and doesn't use the Latin alphabet. However, like any other language, Arabic is governed by a set of rules, and when you master these rules, you're able to speak Arabic like a native speaker!
Arabic For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is designed to identify and explain the rules that govern the Arabic language in the easiest and most interactive way possible. I organize each chapter in a straightforward and coherent manner and present the material in an interactive and engaging way.


About This Book
Unlike most books on the Arabic language, I have written Arabic For Dummies, 3rd Edition, in a way that gives you the most accurate and in-depth information available to help you develop and improve your conversational skills. The book is modular in nature, which means every chapter is organized in such a way that you don't have to read the whole book in order to understand the topic that's discussed. Feel free to jump to chapters and sections to suit your specific needs. Also, I explain every grammatical and linguistic point in plain English so that you can incorporate the concept immediately. I take great care to explain every concept clearly and succinctly.
To provide the best foundation and the widest usage for students of Arabic, Arabic For Dummies, 3rd Edition, focuses on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the most widely used form of Arabic in the world. Arabic basically has three different types: 

Koranic Arabic: This is the Arabic used to write the Koran, the holy book for Muslims. This form of Arabic is very rigid and hasn't changed much since the Koran was written approximately 1,500 years ago. Koranic Arabic is widely used in religious circles for prayer, discussions of Islamic issues, and serious deliberations. Its usage is limited primarily to a strict religious context. It's the equivalent of Biblical English.

The regional dialects: They're the most informal type of Arabic. They tend to fall into four geographical categories: 

North African dialect (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya)
Egyptian dialect (Egypt)
Gulf Arabic (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates)
Levantine dialect (parts of Syria, Palestine, and Jordan)

Even though the words are pronounced differently and some of the everyday expressions differ dramatically from region to region, speakers from different regions can understand each other. The common denominator for the regional dialects is that they're all based on MSA.
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): This is the most widely used and understood form of Arabic in the world. MSA is the language that Arabic anchors use to present the news, and professionals use to discuss business and technical issues.

Throughout the book, each new Arabic word appears in Arabic script and boldface, followed by the transliteration system used by the Library of Congress, which is how you properly pronounce it (with the stressed syllables italicized), and its English equivalent in parentheses.
Because this is a language book, I include some sections to help you master the linguistic concepts with greater ease. Here's a description of the specialty sections you find in each chapter: 

Talkin' the Talk dialogues: Here's where you get to see Arabic in action. These common Arabic dialogues show you how to use important vocabulary words and terms you should be aware of.
Words to Know blackboards: An important part of mastering a new language is becoming familiar with important words and phrases. Key terms that I recommend you memorize are included in these sections, which present the transcription of the Arabic word in Arabic script, the transliteration (the pronunciation; stressed syllables are underlined), and the translation.
Fun & Games activities: The aim of Arabic For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is to help you master the Arabic language in an interactive and engaging way. With that in mind, each chapter ends with a Fun & Games section that lets you review the key concept covered in the chapter in a fun but effective way.



Foolish Assumptions
In writing Arabic For Dummies, 3rd Edition, I made the following assumptions about you: 

You've had very little exposure (or none at all) to the Arabic language. Or maybe you've been exposed to Arabic but are interested in brushing up on your language skills.
You're interested in mastering Arabic for either personal or professional reasons.
You want to be able to speak a few words and phrases so that you can communicate basic information in Arabic.
You're not looking for a dry book on Arabic grammar; you want to discover Arabic in a fun and engaging manner.
You're looking for a practical course that will have you speaking basic Arabic in no time!



Icons Used in This Book
In order to help you get in and get out of this book easily and efficiently, I use icons (little pictures) that identify important pieces of information by category. The following icons appear in this book:
 When you see this icon, make sure you read carefully. It points to information that will directly improve your Arabic language skills.
 I use this icon to bring to your attention information that you definitely want to keep in mind when studying and practicing Arabic.
 Discovering a new language can be a wonderful experience. However, there are always potential pitfalls to avoid, whether grammatical, linguistic, or cultural. This icon points out important notions about Arabic that may trip you up.
 Grammar is the glue that binds a language together. Even though this isn't a grammar book, it does include important grammar lessons you need to be aware of. This icon is attached to major grammar points that will help you master the Arabic language.
 This icon points out nonverbal methods of communication common in Arabic-speaking countries and among Arabic speakers. I use this icon to fill the gap between language and culture so that you know the cultural contexts in which you can use newly discovered words and phrases.

Taking Stock of What's Familiar
If English is your primary language, part of grasping a new لغة (lu.ghah) (language) is creating connections between the كلمات (ka.li.māt) (words) of the language, in this case Arabic and English. You may be surprised to hear that quite a few English words trace their origins to Arabic. For example, did you know that "magazine," "candy," and "coffee" are actually Arabic words? Table 1-1 lists some familiar English words with Arabic origins.

As you can see from the table, Arabic has had a major influence on the English language. Some English words such as "admiral" and "arsenal" have an indirect Arabic origin, whereas others, such as "coffee" and "cotton," are exact matches. The influence runs the other way, too, especially when it comes to relatively contemporary terms. For example, the word تلفزيون (ti.li.fiz.yōn) (television) comes straight from the word "television." As is often the case with languages, Arabic and English tend to influence each other, which is what makes studying them so much fun.


Discovering the Arabic Alphabet
Unlike English and other Romance languages, you write and read Arabic from right to left. Like English, Arabic has both vowels and consonants, but the main vowels in Arabic aren't actual letters. Rather, Arabic vowels are symbols that you place on top of or below consonants to create certain sounds. As for consonants, Arabic has 28 different consonants, and each one is represented by a letter. In order to vocalize these letters, you place a vowel above or below the particular consonant. For example, when you put a فتحة (fat.ḥah), a vowel representing the "ah" sound, above the consonant representing the letter "b," you get the sound "bah" as in "ball." When you take the same consonant and use a كسرة (kas.rah), which represents the short "i" sound, you get the sound "bih" as in "big."
To help you get a better grasp of the different letters in the alphabet, I explain vowels and consonants in the following sections.

All about vowels
Arabic has three main vowels. Luckily, they're very simple to pronounce because they're similar to English vowels. However, you need to realize that Arabic also has vowel derivatives that are as important as the main vowels. These vowel derivatives fall into three categories: double vowels, long vowels, and diphthongs. In this section, I walk you through all the different vowels, vowel derivatives, and vowel combinations.

Main vowels
The three main Arabic vowels are 

فتحة (fat.ḥah): The first main vowel in Arabic is called a فتحة (fat.ḥah). A فتحة is the equivalent of the short "a" in "apple." Occasionally, a فتحة also sounds like the short "e" in "bet" or "set." Much like the other vowels, the way you pronounce a فتحة depends on what consonants come before or after it. In Arabic script, the فتحة is written as a small horizontal line above a consonant. In English transcription, which I use in this book, it's simply represented by the letter "a," as in the words كلب (kalb) (dog) and ولد (wa.lad) (boy).
ضمة (ḍam.mah): The second main Arabic vowel is the ضمة (ḍam.mah). This vowel sounds like the "uh" in "foot" or "book." In Arabic script, it's written like a tiny backward "e" above a particular consonant. In English transcription, it's represented by the letter "u," as in فندق (fun.duq) (hotel) or سحب (su.ḥub) (clouds).
كسرة (kas.rah): The third main vowel in Arabic is the كسرة (kas.rah), which sounds like the long "e" in "feet" or "treat." This vowel is written the same way as a فتحة — as a small horizontal line — except that it goes underneath the consonant. In English transcription, it's written as an "i," as in بنت (bint) (girl) or إسلام (is.lām) (Islam).



Double vowels
One type of vowel derivative is the double vowel, which is known in Arabic as تنوين (tan.wīn). The process of تنوين is a fairly simple one; basically, you take a main vowel and place the same vowel right next to it, thus creating two vowels, or a double vowel. The sound that the double vowel makes depends on the main vowel that's doubled. Here are all possible combinations of double vowels: 

Double fat.ḥah: تنوين with فتحة creates the "an" sound, as in أهلاً وسهلاً (ah.lan wa.sah.lan) (Hi).
Double ḍam.mah: تنوين with ضمة creates the "un" sound. For example, كرةٌ (ku.ra.tun) (ball) contains a double ضمة.
Double kas.rah: تنوين with كسرة makes the "in" sound, as in صفحةٍ (ṣaf.ḥa.tin) (page).



Long vowels
Long vowels are derivatives that elongate the main vowels. Arabic is a very poetic and musical language, so a musical metaphor is appropriate. Think of the difference between long vowels and short (main) vowels in terms of a musical beat, and you should be able to differentiate between them much easier. If a main vowel lasts for one beat, then its long vowel equivalent lasts for two beats. Whereas you create double vowels by writing two main vowels next to each other, you create long vowels by adding a letter to one of the main vowels. Each main vowel has a corresponding consonant that elongates it. Here are a few examples to help you get your head around this long vowel process: 

To create a long vowel form of a فتحة, you attach an ألف (a.lif) to the consonant that the فتحة is associated with. In English transcription, the long فتحة form is written as "ā," such as in كتاب (ki.tāb) (book) or باب (bāb) (door). The "ā" means that you hold the vowel sound for two beats as opposed to one.
The long vowel form of ضمة is obtained by attaching a واو (wāw) to the consonant with the ضمة. This addition elongates the vowel "uh" into a more pronounced "ū," such as in نور (nūr) (light) or غول (ghūl) (ghoul). Make sure you hold the "ū" vowel for two beats and not one.
To create a long vowel form of a كسرة, you attach a ياء (yā') to the consonant with the كسرة. Just as the ألف elongates فتح and the واو elongates the ضمة, the ياء elongates the كسرة. Some examples include the "ī" in words like كبير (ka.bīr) (big) and صغير (ṣa.ghīr) (small).

Table 1-2 shows the Arabic characters for the long vowels.

Diphthongs in Arabic are a special category of vowels because, in essence, they're monosyllabic sounds that begin with one vowel and "glide" into another vowel. A common example in English is the sound at the end of the word "toy." Fortunately, Arabic has only two diphthong sounds used to distinguish between the ياء (yā') and the واو (wāw) forms of long vowels. In a nutshell, diphthongs in Arabic are used to elongate a vowel, which helps differentiate between certain words.
 When you come across either of these two letters, one of the first questions to ask yourself is: "Is this a long vowel or a diphthong?" Making this determination is easy: When either the ياء or the واو is a diphthong, you see a سكون (su.kūn) above the consonant. A سكون is similar to the main vowels in that it's a little symbol (a small circle) that you place above the consonant. However, unlike the vowels, you don't vocalize the سكون — it's almost like a silent vowel. So when a واو or ياء has a سكون over it, you know that the sound is a diphthong. Here are some examples: 

واو diphthongs: يوم (yawm) (day); نوم (nawm) (sleep); صوت (ṣawt) (noise)
ياء diphthongs: بيت (bayt) (house); عين ('ayn) (eye); ليل (layl) (night)




All about consonants
Arabic uses 28 different consonants, and each consonant is represented by a different letter. Because the Arabic alphabet is written in cursive, most of the letters connect with each other. For this reason, every single letter that represents a consonant actually can be written four different ways depending on its position in a word — whether it's in the initial, medial, or final positions, or whether it stands alone. In English transcription of the Arabic script, all letters are case-sensitive.
The good news: Most of the consonants in Arabic have English equivalents. However, a few Arabic consonants are quite foreign to nonnative speakers. Table 1-3 shows all 28 Arabic consonants, how they're written in Arabic, how they're transcribed in English, and how they sound. This table can help you pronounce the letters so that you sound like a native speaker.

To sound as fluent as possible, memorize as many of the letters as you can and try to associate each letter with the Arabic words in which it appears. The trick to getting the pronunciation of some of these more exotic Arabic sounds is repetition, repetition, and even more repetition! That old saying, "Practice makes perfect" certainly applies to Arabic.



Speaking Arabic like a Native
In this section, I share a couple of tricks to help you focus on pronunciation of difficult letters that, if you can master, are sure to make you sound like a native speaker. Here are some difficult letters and some related words you should familiarize yourself with: 

أحمر :ح (aḥ.mar) (red); حسن (ḥa.san) (a man's name); حوار (ḥi.wār) (conversation); حزين (ḥa.zīn) (sad)
عجيب :ع ('a.jīb) (amazing); عزيمة ('a.zī.mah) (determination); عريض ('a.rīḍ) (wide)
قف :ق (qif) (stop); قرد (qird) (monkey); قوس (qaws) (bow)
غضبان :غ (ghaḍ.bān) (angry); غرفة (ghur.fah) (room); غداً (gha.dan) (tomorrow)

 The difference between native Arabic speakers and nonnatives is enunciation. If you can enunciate your letters clearly — particularly the more difficult ones — you'll sound like you're fluent. Practice these words over and over until you feel comfortable repeating them really quickly and very distinctly. With practice, you can sound more like a native and less like someone who's just trying to pick up the language. Plus, memorizing these words not only helps with your pronunciation but also helps build your vocabulary.










Chapter 2
Taking a Closer Look at the Arabic Alphabet

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Understanding abjad
 Deciphering the transliteration
 Getting more comfortable with the Arabic script

As you start studying Arabic and increasing your knowledge of vocabulary words, the obvious difference between Arabic and English is noticeable. It's the script. Unlike English and many of the western European languages that use Romanized letters (think a, b, c, d, and so on), Arabic uses script. To someone who doesn't have any understanding of the language, Arabic may look like a secret code of squiggles, lines, and dots.
Because you're reading this book and are making an effort to improve your Arabic-speaking skills, you know that they're actually individual letters that make the words and sentences of the poetic Arabic language.
Chapter 1 introduces the Arabic alphabet to you, what each of the 28 letters looks like, and how they correspond to the English letters. This chapter examines the alphabet a tad closer. I explain what abjad is, which is the specific writing system used in this book. I explain the Library of Congress transliteration system, so you can figure out how to pronounce the Arabic script. I also delve into the script more closely and provide you several Arabic words as examples that start with the different Arabic letters. When you finish this chapter, you should have a stronger knowledge of the Arabic alphabet and the script.


Getting a Grasp on أبجد
The term أبجد (ab.jad) refers to a specific writing system whereby the letters are used exclusively to denote the consonants while the vowels are excluded from the writing system entirely. Abjad is the writing system used in this book, and it's also the writing system used throughout the Arabic world. For instance, most newspapers you pick up in the Middle East use the abjad writing system, whereby the consonants are included but not the vowels. Even if you're watching Arabic TV, the Arabic subtitles are in abjad.
Does abjad help Arabic speakers or does it offer more difficulty? The fact of the matter is abjad is the most common writing system used in Arabic. There's unfortunately no way around this conventional system, so it's up to you, a student of Arabic, to fully dedicate yourself to become a good user of abjad.


Figuring Out the Transcription
This book uses the Library of Congress transcription system, which is a widely used and approved transcription and transliteration system. Officially known as the ALA-LC Romanization Scheme, this system was jointly developed and approved by the American Library Association (ALA) and the Library of Congress (LC).

THE ORIGINS OF ABJAD
The term abjad actually gets its origin from the pronunciation of the first letters in the Arabic alphabet: ا, ب, ج, د. The Phoenicians were the first to use an abjad writing system prominently, and it has been used in Semitic languages ever since its first use around 1000 B.C. In addition to Arabic, abjad's ancestral use was applied in such languages as Aramaic, Greek, and Hebrew. This writing form is rich with history, especially considering that it gets its origins from the Phoenicians, who sought to simplify an earlier writing system that was common at the time: Egyptian hieroglyphs. When you're looking at the Arabic script and abjad, don't forget that you're looking at a complex and elegant writing system that dates back to man's first recorded attempt at creating a uniform writing system that everyone can access.
Both the Library of Congress and the American Library Association have a vested interest in having an accurate and widely recognized transcription system for their users. The Library of Congress houses many foreign language texts that need to be archived, shelved, circulated, and used as references by thousands if not millions of users. The transcription essentially allows English speakers access to millions of texts without actually learning the original language script.
In the transliteration in this book, you see letters in the transliteration text that are italicized. The italicized portion of the text should be emphasized during pronunciation; in other words, you have to stress this syllable when speaking the word.
Another common symbol that you see is a small horizontal line over certain vowels, such as the vowel a or the vowel i. In this case, you have to extend the pronunciation of the vowel so that it's longer than the other vowels. Here's an example of a word where you would extend the pronunciation: mī.lād (birth). In this case, you have to extend both the vowel i and the vowel a.
Finally, whenever you come across an apostrophe, that means you have to make the 'ayn sound. The transliteration system is straightforward, and you can pick it up very quickly with a little practice.
The Library of Congress system uses Arabic script for the following languages: Arabic, Kurdish, Farsi Persian, Urdu, and even Pashto. As such, the script that I use in this book can also be applied to several different languages as well. In addition to Arabic, the Library of Congress also uses Romanization for Cyrillic languages such as Russian and Serbian, Hebrew, and even Classical Greek languages and dialects.
Because this system is so widespread and covers a wide range of languages, you can rest assured that you're getting exposed to the most widely accepted transliteration scheme out there. In mastering this system, you can easily apply it to other languages as well.


Getting Better Acquainted with the Script
You may be surprised to find out that the Arabic script isn't used exclusively for the Arabic language. Rather, the Arabic script is used to depict other important world languages, such as Urdu and Farsi.
Urdu is the official language of Pakistan and is also widely used in parts of India. In total, there are approximately 100 million Urdu speakers worldwide. Farsi, on the other hand, is the official language of Iran, but it's also widely spoken in Iraq, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and even Tajikistan — more than 110 million people speak Farsi worldwide. So when you unlock the Arabic script, you get access to other key world languages.
Many folks are daunted by the Arabic script because the letters seem unfamiliar. A common phrase I often hear from students is that the script isn't relatable to the traditional Roman script used in English and other Romance languages. However, Arabic and Roman scripts share a common history. In many parts of Spain, the Arabic script was used alongside Roman script for centuries. In fact, Arabic script is the second most widely used in the world right after Latin.
 Another key difference is that Arabic is written from right to left, which is challenging at first. However, with a little patience and practice you can get used to it very quickly and won't even realize that you're reading from right to left! In Chapter 1, I include a word that is associated with each consonant in Arabic. In this section, I expand on that discussion so you can familiarize yourself with the script. Table 2-1 can help you to develop a faster understanding of the script, the words, and their usage in a sentence.

Chapter 3
Tackling Basic Arabic Grammar

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Playing around with nouns and adjectives
 Getting specific with definite and indefinite articles
 Forming simple sentences
 Getting to know Arabic verbs

Grammar is the foundation of any language. It's the glue that binds all the different elements of language together and allows us to communicate using a defined set of rules. Because grammar is so important, this chapter gives you an overview of the major grammatical concepts in the Arabic language, from the basic parts of speech (nouns, adjectives, articles, and verbs) to instructions on how to build both simple and descriptive sentences using common regular and irregular verbs. In addition, I introduce prepositions, demonstratives, and other parts of speech that will help you create phrases and sentences and, in general, express yourself in Arabic.
 As you work through different chapters and sections of Arabic For Dummies, 3rd Edition, if you're ever unsure of how to proceed with a sentence formation, simply flip back to this chapter and review the grammar details that apply to your question. You'll be all set!


Introducing Nouns, Adjectives, and Articles
Nouns and adjectives are two of the most essential elements in any language. Nouns in Arabic, much like in English and other Romance languages, are the parts of speech used to name a person, place, thing, quality, or action. Adjectives, on the other hand, are the parts of speech that modify nouns. Although nouns and adjectives go hand in hand, the best way to understand how they work in Arabic is to address each one separately.

Getting a grip on nouns
In Arabic, every noun has a masculine, feminine, singular, and plural form. Table 3-1 lists some common Arabic أسماء (as.mā') (nouns). You'll notice that I've listed both singular and plural forms of some nouns as well as masculine (M) and feminine (F) forms of others.

Identifying adjectives
In Arabic, an نعت (na't) (adjective) must be in agreement with the noun it modifies in both gender and plurality. Table 3-2 presents some common adjectives in both the feminine and masculine forms.

Notice that the masculine forms of the adjectives in Table 3-2 are manipulated slightly to achieve the feminine adjective forms; essentially, all you do is add the suffix -a to the masculine adjective to obtain its feminine form. This rule applies to all regular adjective forms.
 However, in addition to the regular adjective forms, another category of adjectives exists in which the masculine and feminine forms are completely different from each other. This is the irregular adjective form.
Fortunately, all irregular adjectives fall in the same category: colors; and every color is an irregular adjective. Put simply, ألوان (al.wān) (colors) in Arabic are all irregular adjectives because the masculine color form is radically different than its feminine version. Table 3-3 lists the most common irregular adjectives.

Every لون (lawn) (color) in Table 3-3 (as well as the colors I didn't have space to list) must agree in gender with the noun it describes.
 One of the biggest differences between adjective and noun interactions in the English and Arabic languages is that nouns in Arabic come before the adjectives. In English, nouns always come after their adjectives.


Discovering definite and indefinite articles
A common trait that nouns and adjectives share in the Arabic language is that both can be modified using definite article prefixes. To refresh your memory, an article is a part of speech that you use to indicate nouns or adjectives and specify their applications. In English, there are two types of articles: indefinite and definite articles. The indefinite articles in English are "a" and "an," such as in "a book" or "an umbrella." The definite article is the word "the," as in "the book" or "the umbrella."
Unlike English, Arabic has no outright indefinite article; instead, the indefinite article in Arabic is always implied. For example, when you say كتاب (ki.tāb) (book), you mean both "book" and "a book." Similarly, مدرسة (mad.ra.sah) (school) means both "school" and "a school." However, Arabic does employ a definite article, which is the prefix you attach to either the noun or the adjective you want to define.

The rule
 The definite article in Arabic is the prefix الـ "al-". When you want to define a noun or adjective, you simply attach this prefix to the word. For example, "the book" is الكتاب, and "the school" is المدرسة.


The inevitable exceptions
 In the examples الكتاب and المدرسة, the prefix الـ "al-" retains its original form. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Sometimes, the "l" in the prefix الـ "al-" drops off and is replaced by a letter similar to the first letter of the word being definite. For example, the word نور (nūr) means "light" in Arabic. If you want to say "the light," you may assume that you simply attach the prefix الـ "al-" and get النور. However, that's not quite right. Instead, the appropriate way of saying "the light" in Arabic is النور (an.nūr), where you replace the "l" in الـ "al-" with the first letter of the definite word, which in this case is "n." Another example of this definite article exception is the word صباح (ṣa.bāḥ) (morning). When you define it, the resulting word is الصباح (aṣ.ṣa.bāḥ) (the morning) and not (al.ṣa.bāḥ).
So how do you know whether to use الـ "al-" or another definite article prefix format? The answer is actually quite simple and has something to do with a really cool concept. Every single letter in Arabic falls into one of two categories: sun letters and moon letters. Put simply, every word that begins with a moon letter gets the prefix al-, and every word that begins with a sun letter gets the prefix a- followed by its sun letter. Table 3-4 lists all the sun letters. Every other letter in Arabic is automatically a moon letter.

Understanding the interaction between nouns and adjectives
Nouns and adjectives go hand in hand. In this section, I show you how you can manipulate nouns and adjectives to create little phrases. Recall that unlike in the English language, nouns in Arabic always come before the adjective.
You can create three types of phrases by manipulating nouns and adjectives. This section examines the ways you can pair up nouns and adjectives to create definite and indefinite phrases. (Later in the chapter, I show you how to create a complete sentence by simply using a noun and an adjective.)

Indefinite phrases
One of the most important things to remember about nouns and adjectives in Arabic is that they can be both definite and indefinite using the definite article prefix الـ "al-". Hence, to create an indefinite phrase, all you do is take an indefinite noun and add to it an indefinite adjective. For example, to say "a big book" or "big book," you add the adjective كبير (ka.bīr) (big) to the noun كتاب (ki.tāb) (book). So the phrase كتاب كبير means "a big book" in Arabic. Here are some other examples of indefinite phrases featuring indefinite nouns and adjectives: 

ولد طويل (wa.lad ṭa.wīl) (a tall boy)
بنت جميلة (bint ja.mī.lah) (a pretty girl)
رجل قوي (ra.jul qa.wī) (a strong man)
امرأة لطيفة (im.ra.'ah la.ṭī.fah) (a nice woman)
مدرسة صغيرة (mad.ra.sah ṣa.ghī.rah) (a small school)
طاولة حمراء (ṭā.wi.lah ḥam.rā') (a red table)

Notice that the adjectives agree with their corresponding nouns in gender. For example, you say بنت جميلة and not بنت جميل.
Adding more descriptive words to the noun is very simple: Because adjectives follow the noun in Arabic, you just add an extra adjective and you're done! But don't forget to add the conjunction و (wa) (and) between the adjectives. Check out some examples: 

ولد طويل وكبير (wa.lad ṭa.wīl wa.ka.bīr) (a tall and big boy)
بنت طويلة وجميلة (bint ṭa.wī.lah wa.ja.mī.lah) (a tall and pretty girl)
رجل قوي وسريع (ra.jul qa.wī wa.sa.rī') (a strong and fast man)
امرأة لطيفة وقوية (im.ra.'ah la.ṭī.fah wa.qa.wiy.yah) (a nice and strong woman)
مدرسة صغيرة وبيضاء (mad.ra.sah ṣa.ghī.rah wa.bay.ḍā') (a small and white school)
طاولة حمراء وقصيرة (ṭā.wi.lah ḥam.rā' wa.qa.ṣī.rah) (a red and short table)



Definite phrases
The biggest difference between creating an indefinite phrase and a definite phrase is the use of the definite article prefix الـ "al-." Both noun and adjective must be definite using the definite article prefix. For example, to say "the big book," you say الكتاب الكبير. Here are some examples of definite phrases: 

الولد الطويل (al.wa.lad aṭ.ṭa.wīl) (the tall boy)
البنت الجميلة (al.bint al.ja.mī.lah) (the pretty girl)
الرجل القوي (ar.ra.jul al.qa.wī) (the strong man)
الامرأة اللطيفة (al.im.ra.'ah al.la.ṭī.fah) (the nice woman)
المدرسة الصغيرة (al.mad.ra.sah aṣ.ṣa.ghī.rah) (the small school)
الطاولة الحمراء (aṭ.ṭā.wi.lah' al.ḥam.rā') (the red table)

Using similar patterns, you can create a definite phrase using multiple adjectives. Just like in indefinite phrases, make sure you use the conjunction و (wa) in between adjectives: 

الولد الطويل والكبير (al.wa.lad aṭ.ṭa.wīl wal.ka.bīr) (the tall and big boy)
البنت الطويلة والجميلة (al.bint aṭ.ṭa.wī.lah wal.ja.mī.lah) (the tall and pretty girl)
الرجل القوي والسريع (ar.ra.jul al.qa.wī was.sa.rī') (the strong and fast man)
المرأة اللطيفة والقوية (al.mar.'ah al.la.ṭī.fah wal.qa.wiy.yah) (the nice and strong woman)
المدرسة الصغيرة والبيضاء (al.mad.ra.sah aṣ.ṣa.ghī.rah wal.bay.ḍā') (the small and white school)
الطاولة الحمراء والقصيرة (aṭ.ṭā.wi.lah al.ḥam.rā' wal.qa.ṣī.rah) (the red and short table)





Creating Simple, Verb-Free Sentences
You can form sentences in two ways in Arabic: You can manipulate definite and indefinite nouns and adjectives, or you can pull together nouns, adjectives, and verbs. In Arabic, you can actually create a complete sentence with a subject and a predicate without actually using a verb! This concept may seem a little strange at first, but this section helps you quickly see the logic and reasoning behind such a structure.

To be or not to be: Sentences without verbs
Before you can construct verb-free sentences, you need to know that there is actually no "to be" verb in the Arabic language. The verb "is/are" as a proper verb simply doesn't exist. That's not to say that you can't create an "is/are" sentence in Arabic — you can. "Is/are" sentences are created without the use of an actual verb. In other words, you create "to be" sentences by manipulating indefinite and definite nouns and adjectives, similar to what I cover in the section "Understanding the interaction between nouns and adjectives" earlier in this chapter.
When you put an indefinite noun with an indefinite adjective, you create an indefinite phrase. Similarly, when you add a definite adjective to a definite noun, you end up with a definite phrase. So what happens when you combine a definite noun with an indefinite adjective? This combination — definite noun and indefinite adjective — produces an "is/are" sentence similar to what you get when you use the verb "to be" in English.
For example, take the definite noun الكتاب (the book) and add to it the indefinite adjective كبير (big). The resulting phrase is الكتاب كبير, which means "The book is big." Here are some more examples to illustrate the construction of "is/are" sentences: 

الولد مريض (al.wa.lad ma.rīḍ) (The boy is sick.)
البنت صغيرة (al.bint ṣa.ghī.rah) (The girl is young.)
السيارة خضراء (as.say.yā.rah khaḍ.rā') (The car is green.)
الطالبة ذكية (aṭ.ṭā.li.bah dha.kiy.yah) (The student is smart.) (F)
المدرّس قصير (al.mu.dar.ris qa.ṣīr) (The teacher is short.) (M)
الأستاذ طويل (al.'us.tādh ṭa.wīl) (The professor is tall.) (M)

If you want to use additional adjectives in these verb-free sentences, you simply add the conjunction wa. Here are some examples of "is/are" sentences with multiple adjectives: 

الولد مريض وضعيف (al.wa.lad ma.rīḍ wa.ḍa.'īf) (The boy is sick and weak.)
البنت صحيحة وقوية (al.bint ṣa.ḥī.ḥah wa.qa.wiy.yah) (The girl is healthy and strong.)
السيارة خضراء وسريعة (as.say.yā.rah khaḍ.rā' wa.sa.rī.'ah) (The car is green and fast.)
الطالبة ذكية ولطيفة (aṭ.ṭā.li.bah dha.kiy.yah wa.la.ṭī.fah) (The student is smart and nice.) (F)
المدرّس قصير وذكي (al.mu.dar.ris qa.ṣīr wa.dha.kī) (The teacher is short and smart.) (M)
الكتاب طويل وصعب (al.ki.tāb ṭa.wīl wa.ṣa'b) (The book is long and difficult.) (M)

This construct is fairly flexible, and if you change the nature of one of the adjectives, you radically alter the meaning of the جملة (jum.lah) (sentence). For instance, the examples all show a definite noun with two indefinite adjectives. What happens when you mix things up and add an indefinite noun to an indefinite adjective and a definite adjective?
Consider the example البنت صحيحة وقوية (The girl is healthy and strong). Keep البنت as a definite noun but change the indefinite adjective صحيحة into its definite version, الصحيحة; also, drop the و, and keep قوية as an indefinite adjective. The resulting phrase is البنت الصحيحة قوية, which means "The healthy girl is strong."
You can grasp what's going on here by dividing the terms into clauses: The first phrase is the definite noun/definite adjective combination البنت الصحيحة (the healthy girl); the second phrase is the indefinite adjective قوية (strong). Combining these phrases is the same as combining a definite noun with an indefinite adjective — the result is an "is/are" sentence. Here are more examples to help clear up any confusion you may have regarding this concept: 

الولد المريض ضعيف (al.wa.lad al.ma.rīḍ ḍa.'īf) (The sick boy is weak.)
السيارة الخضراء سريعة (as.say.yā.rah al.khaḍ.rā' sa.rī.'ah) (The green car is fast.)
الطالبة الذكية لطيفة (aṭ.ṭā.li.bah adh.dha.kiy.yah la.ṭī.fah) (The smart student is nice.) (F)
المدرّس القصير ذكي (al.mu.dar.ris al.qa.ṣīr dha.kī) (The short teacher is smart.) (M)
الكتاب الطويل صعب (al.ki.tāb aṭ.ṭa.wīl ṣa'b) (The long book is difficult.) (M)

Notice that a simple change in the definite article changes the meaning of the phrase or sentence. For example, when the noun is definite and both adjectives are indefinite, you create an "is" sentence, as in "The boy is big." On the other hand, when both noun and adjective are definite, the adjective affects the noun directly, and you get "the big boy."


Building sentences with common prepositions
In grammatical terms, حروف الجرّ (ḥu.rūf al.jarr) (prepositions) are words or small phrases that indicate a relationship between substantive and other types of words, such as adjectives, verbs, nouns, or other substantives. In both English and Arabic, prepositions are parts of speech that are essential in the formation of sentences. You can add them to "is/are" sentences to give them more specificity. Table 3-6 lists the most common prepositions you're likely to use in Arabic.

You can use these prepositions to construct clauses and phrases using both indefinite and definite nouns and adjectives. Here are some examples: 

البنت أمام المدرسة (al.bint a.mām al.mad.ra.sah) (The girl is in front of the school.)
الطاولة في الغرفة (aṭ.ṭā.wi.lah fī al.ghur.fah) (The table is in the room.)
الأستاذة في الجامعة (al.'us.tā.dhah fī al.jā.mi.'ah) (The professor is at the university.) (F)
المطعم بجانب الفندق (al.maṭ.'am bi.jā.nib al.fun.duq) (The restaurant is next to the hotel.)
الرجل من أمريكا (ar.ra.jul min am.rī.kā) (The man is from America.)
المدينة قريبة من الشاطئ (al.ma.dī.nah qa.rī.bah min ash.shā.ṭi') (The city is close to the beach.)
السيارة البيضاء وراء المنزل (as.say.yā.rah al.bay.ḍā' wa.rā' al.man.zil) (The white car is behind the house.)
الولد اللطيف مع المدرّس (al.wa.lad al.la.ṭīf ma' al.mu.dar.ris) (The nice boy is with the teacher.)

In addition, you can use multiple adjectives with both the subject and object nouns: 

الامرأة الجميلة في السيارة السريعة (al.im.ra.'ah al.ja.mī.lah fī as.say.yā.rah as.sa.rī.'ah) (The beautiful woman is in the fast car.)
المدرّسة الذكية أمام المدرسة البيضاء (al.mu.dar.ri.sah adh.dha.kiy.yah a.mām al.mad.ra.sah al.bay.ḍā') (The smart teacher is in front of the white school.) (F)
الكرسي الصغير وراء الطاولة الكبيرة (al.kur.sī aṣ.ṣa.ghīr wa.rā' aṭ.ṭā.wi.lah al.ka.bī.rah) (The small chair is behind the big table.)



Using demonstratives and forming sentences
A demonstrative is the part of speech that you use to indicate or specify a noun that you're referring to. Common demonstratives in English are the words "this" and "that." In English, demonstratives are gender-neutral, meaning that they can refer to nouns that are both feminine and masculine. In Arabic, however, some demonstratives are gender-neutral whereas others are gender-specific.
 How do you know whether a demonstrative is gender-neutral or gender-specific? Here's the short answer: If a demonstrative refers to a number of objects (such as "those" or "these"), it's gender-neutral and may be used for both masculine and feminine objects. If, on the other hand, you're using a singular demonstrative ("this" or "that"), it must be in agreement with the gender of the object being singled out.
Following are demonstratives in the singular format: 

هذا (hā.dhā) (this) (M)
هذه (hā.dhi.hi) (this) (F)
ذلك (dhā.li.ka) (that) (M)
تلك (til.ka) (that) (F)

Here are the plural demonstratives, which are gender-neutral: 

هؤلاء (hā.'u.lā.'i) (these)
أولئك (u.lā.'i.ka) (those)

You can combine demonstratives with both definite and indefinite nouns and adjectives. For example, to say "this boy," add the definite noun الولد (boy) to the demonstrative هذا (this; M); because demonstratives always come before the nouns they identify, the resulting phrase is هذا الولد. Here are more examples of this construct: 

هذه البنت (hā.dhi.hi al.bint) (this girl)
أولئك البنات (u.lā.'i.ka al.ba.nāt) (those girls)
هؤلاء الأولاد (hā.'u.lā.'i al.'aw.lād) (these boys)
تلك الأستاذة (til.ka al.'us.tā.dhah) (that professor) (F)
ذلك الكتاب (dhā.li.ka al.ki.tāb) (that book)

When you use a demonstrative, which is, in essence, a definite article, the meaning of the phrase changes depending on whether the object is definite or indefinite. When a demonstrative is followed by a defined noun, you get a definite phrase, as in the examples in the preceding list. However, when you attach an indefinite noun to a demonstrative, the result is an "is/are" sentence. For instance, if you add the demonstrative هذا to the indefinite subject noun ولد, you get هذا ولد (hā.dhā wa.lad) (This is a boy). Using the examples from the preceding list, I show you what happens when you drop the definite article from the subject noun in a demonstrative clause: 

هذه بنت (hā.dhi.hi bint) (This is a girl.)
أولئك بنات (u.lā.'i.ka ba.nāt) (Those are girls.)
هؤلاء أولاد (hā.'u.lā.'i aw.lād) (These are boys.)
تلك أستاذة (til.ka us.tā.dha) (That is a professor.) (F)
ذلك كتاب (dhā.li.ka ki.tāb) (That is a book.)

When you combine a demonstrative clause with a definite subject noun and an indefinite adjective, the resulting phrase is a more descriptive "is/are" sentence: 

هذه البنت جميلة (hā.dhi.hi al.bint ja.mī.lah) (This girl is pretty.)
أولئك البنات طويلات (u.lā.'i.ka al.ba.nāt ṭa.wī.lāt) (Those girls are tall.)
تلك المدرسة كبيرة (til.ka al.mad.ra.sah ka.bī.rah) (That school is big.)

Conversely, when you combine a demonstrative clause with a definite subject noun and a definite adjective, you get a regular demonstrative phrase: 

هذا الرجل الطويل (hā.dhā ar.ra.jul aṭ.ṭa.wīl) (that tall man)
ذلك الكتاب العجيب (dhā.li.ka al.ki.tāb al.'a.jīb) (that amazing book)
تلك المدينة الصغيرة (til.ka al.ma.dī.nah aṣ.ṣa.ghī.rah) (that small city)



Forming "to be" sentences using personal pronouns
Every language has personal pronouns, the parts of speech that stand in for people, places, things, or ideas. Arabic is no different, except that personal pronouns in Arabic are a lot more comprehensive and specific than personal pronoun structures in other languages, such as English. Table 3-7 presents all the major personal pronouns in the Arabic language.

 In the translation and conjugation tables in this section and throughout Arabic For Dummies, 3rd Edition, in addition to singular and plural denotations, you see a form labeled dual. This number form, which describes a pair or two of an item, doesn't exist in English.
In addition to the personal pronouns common in English and other languages, Arabic makes a gender distinction with "you" in the singular and masculine forms. Furthermore, Arabic includes special pronouns reserved for describing two items (no more, no less). So all in all, personal pronouns in Arabic may describe one thing, two things, and three or more things.
The personal pronoun always comes before the predicate noun that it designates, and it also creates an "is/are" sentence. For instance, when you say هي بنت (hi.ya bint), you mean "She is a girl." Similarly, هو ولد (hu.wa wa.lad) means "He is a boy." The meaning changes slightly when the subject noun is definite. For example, هي البنت means "She is the girl," and هو الولد means "He is the boy." Here are some more examples to familiarize you with this concept: 

أنا رجل (a.nā ra.jul) (I am a man.)
أنا الرجل (a.nā ar.ra.jul) (I am the man.)
هم أولاد (hum aw.lād) (They are boys.)
امرأة (hi.ya al.mar.'ah) (She is the woman.)
أنتَ كبير (an.ta ka.bīr) (You are big.) (MS)
أنتِ جميلة (an.ti ja.mī.lah) (You are beautiful.) (FS)
أنتم سعداء (an.tum su.'a.dā') (You are happy.) (MP)
أنتِ بنت جميلة(an.ti bint ja.mī.lah) (You are a pretty girl.)
أنتَ الولد الكبير (an.ta al.wa.lad al.ka.bīr) (You are the big boy.)
هنّ النساء اللطيفات (hun.na an.ni.sā' al.la.ṭī.fāt) (They are the nice women.)
هنّ نساء لطيفات (hun.na ni.sā' la.ṭī.fāt) (They are nice women.)
هو رجل قوي (hu.wa ra.jul qa.wī) (He is a strong man.)
هو الرجل القوي (hu.wa ar.ra.jul al.qa.wī) (He is the strong man.)



Creating negative "to be" sentences
Although Arabic doesn't have a "to be" regular verb to create "I am" or "you are" phrases, it does have a verb you use to say "I am not" or "you are not." This special irregular verb ليس (lay.sa) creates negative "to be" sentences. The following table shows ليس conjugated using all the personal pronouns.

"To be" in the past tense
The Arabic verb for "was/were" (in other words, "to be" in the past tense) is كان (kā.na) (was/were). Similar to the negative form of "to be," the past form is an irregular verb form conjugated using all the personal pronouns.

Working with Verbs
You'll be very pleased to know that verb tenses in Arabic, when compared to other languages, are fairly straightforward. Basically, you only need to be concerned with two proper verb forms: the past and the present. A future verb tense exists, but it's a derivative of the present tense that you achieve by attaching a prefix to the present tense of the verb.
In this section, I tell you everything you need to know about أفعال (af.'āl) (verbs) in Arabic. I examine the past tense followed by the present and future tenses, and then I show you irregular verb forms for all three tenses.

Digging up the past tense
The structural form of the past tense is one of the easiest grammatical structures in the Arabic language. Basically, every regular verb that is conjugated in the past tense follows a very strict pattern. First, you refer to all regular verbs in the past tense using the هو (hu.wa) (he) personal pronoun. Second, the overwhelming majority of verbs in this form in the past tense have three consonants that are accompanied by the same vowel: the فتحة (fat.ḥah). The فتحة creates the "ah" sound.
For example, the verb "wrote" in the past tense is كتب (ka.ta.ba); its three consonants are "k," "t," and "b." Here are some common verbs you may use while speaking Arabic: 

أكل (a.ka.la) (ate)
فعل (fa.'a.la) (did)
ذهب (dha.ha.ba) (went)
قرأ (qa.ra.'a) (read)

The following table shows the verb كتب (ka.ta.ba) (wrote) conjugated using all the personal pronouns. Note that the first part of the verb remains constant; only its suffix changes depending on the personal pronoun used.

Compare the conjugations of درس and كتب and you probably see a clear pattern emerge: Every personal pronoun has a corresponding suffix used to conjugate and identify the verb form in its specific tense. Table 3-8 outlines these specific suffixes.

Anytime you come across a regular verb you want to conjugate in the past tense, use these verb suffixes with the corresponding personal pronouns.
At this stage, you should know that not all regular verbs in the past tense have three consonants. Some regular verbs have more than three consonants, such as: 

تفرّج (ta.far.ra.ja) (watched)
تكلّم (ta.kal.la.ma) (talked)

Even though these verbs have more than three consonants, they're still considered regular verbs. To conjugate them, you keep the first part of the word constant and only change the last consonant of the word using the corresponding suffixes to match the personal pronouns. To get a better sense of this conversion, take a look at the verb تكلّم (talked) conjugated in the past tense. Notice that the first part of the word stays the same; only the ending changes.

When you know how to conjugate verbs in the past tense, your sentence-building options are endless. Here are some simple sentences that combine nouns, adjectives, and verbs in the past tense: 

الولد ذهب إلى المدرسة (al.wa.lad dha.ha.ba i.lá al.mad.ra.sah) (The boy went to school.)
البنت تكلّمت في الصف (al.bint ta.kal.la.mat fī aṣ.ṣaff) (The girl talked in the classroom.)
أكلنا طعاماً لذيذاً (a.kal.nā ṭa.'ā.man la.dhī.dhan) (We ate delicious food.)
ذهب الرجل إلى الجامعة بالسيارة (dha.ha.ba ar.ra.jul i.lá al.jā.mi.'ah bis.say.yā.rah) (The man went to the school by car.)



Examining the present tense
Conjugating verbs in the past tense is relatively straightforward, but conjugating verbs in the present tense is a bit trickier. Instead of changing only the ending of the verb, you must also alter its beginning. In other words, you need to be familiar not only with the suffix but also the prefix that corresponds to each personal pronoun.
To illustrate the difference between past and present tense, the verb كتب (wrote) is conjugated as يكتب (yak.tub) (to write), whereas the verb درس (studied) is يدرس (yad.ru.su) (to study).
Here's the verb "to write" conjugated using all the personal pronouns. Notice how both the suffixes and prefixes change in the present tense.

Aside from prefixes and suffixes, another major difference between the past and present tenses in Arabic is that every verb in the present tense has a dominant vowel that's unique and distinctive. For example, the dominant vowel in يكتب is a ضمة (ḍam.mah) ("u" sound). However, in the verb يفعل (yaf.'al) (to do), the dominant vowel is the فتحة (fat.ḥah) ("a" sound). This means that when you conjugate the verb يفعل using the personal pronoun أنا, you say أنا أفعَل (a.nā af.'a.lu) and not أنا أفعُل (a.nā af.'u.lu). For complete coverage of Arabic vowels ضمة, فتحة, كسرة(ḍam.mah, fat.ḥah, and kas.rah), check out Chapter 1.
The dominant vowel is always the middle vowel. Unfortunately, there's no hard rule you can use to determine which dominant vowel is associated with each verb. The best way to identify the dominant vowel is to look up the verb in the قاموس (qā.mūs) (dictionary).
In this list, I divide up some of the most common Arabic verbs according to their dominant vowels: 

ضمة (ḍam.mah) 
يكتب (yak.tub) (to write)
يدرس (yad.rus) (to study)
يأكل (ya'.kul) (to eat)
يسكن (yas.kun) (to live)

فتحة (fat.ḥah) 
يفعل (yaf.'al) (to do)
يقرأ (yaq.ra') (to read)
يذهب (yadh.hab) (to go)
يفتح (yaf.taḥ) (to open)

كسرة (kas.rah) 
يرجع (yar.ji ') (to return)
يعرف (ya'.rif) (to know)


 When you conjugate a verb in the present tense, you must do two things: 

Identify the dominant vowel that will be used to conjugate the verb using all personal pronouns.
Isolate the prefix and suffix that correspond to the appropriate personal pronouns.



Peeking into the future tense
Although Arabic grammar has a future tense, you'll be glad to know that the tense has no outright verb structure. Rather, you achieve the future tense by adding the prefix sa- to the existing present tense form of the verb. For example, يكتب means "to write." Add the prefix sa- to يكتب and you get سيكتب (sa.yak.tub) (he will write).
To illustrate the future tense, here's the verb يكتب (yak.tu.bu) conjugated in the future tense.

Examining irregular verb forms
Arabic uses both regular and irregular verbs. Regular verbs have a specific pattern and follow a specific set of rules, but irregular verbs do not. Because these irregular forms include some of the most common verbs in the language (such as "to buy," "to sell," and "to give"), you should examine them separately. This section looks at some of the most common irregular verbs in the Arabic language.
The verb "to sell" is conjugated as باع (bā.'a) (sold) in the past tense. In the conjugation that follows, notice that unlike regular verbs, باع has only two consonants (the ب bā' and the ع'ayn).

Chapter 4
Getting Started with Basic Expressions

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Handling pleasantries
 Using common introductions
 Referring to countries and nationalities
 Talking about the weather

In Arabic culture, you can't underestimate the importance of greetings. First impressions in the Middle East are crucial, and knowing both the verbal and nonverbal nuances of greeting people is one of the most important aspects of mastering Arabic.
In this chapter, I show you how to greet people in Arabic, how to respond to basic greetings, and how to interact with native Arabic speakers. You find out when it's appropriate to use formal and informal terms, how to make small talk, and how to introduce yourself. !حظاً سعيداً (ḥaẓ.ẓan sa.'ī.dan) (Good luck!)
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Greeting People Appropriately
In Arabic, you have to choose between formal and informal ways of greeting people. The greeting you use depends on whom you're addressing: If you're greeting someone you don't know for the very first time, you must use the more formal greetings. On the other hand, if you're greeting an old family friend or a colleague you know well, feel free to use the more informal forms of greeting. If you're not sure which form to use, you're better off going formal. I cover both types of greetings as well as some other handy pleasantries in this section.

Saying hello
The formal way of greeting someone in Arabic is السلام عليكم (as.sa.lā.mu 'a.lay.kum). Even though it translates into English as "hello," it literally means "May peace be upon you." Arabic is a very poetic language, so you're going to have to get used to the fact that a lot of the phrases used in everyday life are very descriptive.
Using السلام عليكم is appropriate when 

You're greeting a potential business partner.
You're at a formal event, dinner, or gala.
You're meeting someone for the first time.

 The most common reply is وعليكم السلام (wa.'a.lay.kum as.sa.lām) (and upon you peace).
The phrase أهلاً وسهلاً (ah.lan wa.sah.lan) is a very informal way of greeting a person or group of people. Translated into English, it resembles the more informal "hi" as opposed to "hello." When someone says أهلاً وسهلاً, you should also reply أهلاً وسهلاً. In some cases, when someone greets you in his home, he may use this phrase. Here are other instances where you may run into this common expression.
Using the informal أهلا وسهلاً is appropriate when 

You're greeting an old friend.
You're greeting a family member.
You're greeting someone at an informal gathering, such as a family lunch.

Although وسهلاً is one of the friendliest and most informal greetings in Arabic, you can actually greet someone you know very well, such as a close friend or family member, by simply saying أهلاً. Because it's the most informal way of greeting someone in Arabic, make sure that you use أهلاً only with people you're very comfortable with; otherwise, you may appear disrespectful even if you're trying to be friendly! (Nonverbal signs may also convey disrespect; see the later sidebar "Sending the right nonverbal message.")
 Kinship, family relations, and tribal connections are extraordinarily important to people from the Middle East. In the early period of Islam when traders and nomads roamed the Arabian Peninsula, they identified themselves as members of one nation — the أهل الإسلام (ahl al.is.lām) (kinship of Islam). They greeted each other by identifying themselves as part of the أهل (ahl) (kin) by saying أهلاً. This is how the phrase أهلاً وسهلاً originated, although today it's simply a friendly way of greeting people.


Bidding goodbye
Saying goodbye in Arabic is a little more straightforward than greeting someone, because even though there are different ways of saying goodbye, they aren't divided into formal or informal options. Here are the most common ways of saying goodbye in Arabic: 

مع السلامة (ma.'a as.sa.lā.mah) (go with peace, or goodbye)
إلى اللقاء (i.lá al.li.qā') (until next time)
إلى الغد (i.lá al.ghad) (see you tomorrow)



Asking how someone is
After you greet someone, the next part of an Arabic greeting is asking how the person is doing.
 The most common way of asking someone how he's doing is كيف الحال؟ (kay.fa al.ḥāl). When you break down the phrase, you discover that حال means "state of" and كيف means "how." (The prefix الـ [al-] attached to حال is a definite article, so الحال means "the state of health.") Therefore, the phrase كيف الحال؟ literally means "How is the health?" but for all intents and purposes, you can translate it into English as "How are you?"
كيف الحال is a gender-neutral phrase for asking people how they're doing, but you should also be aware of gender-defined greeting terms, which are derivatives of the phrase: 

When addressing a man, use كيف حالكَ (kay.fa ḥā.lu.ka).
When addressing a woman, use كيف حالكِ (kay.fa ḥā.lu.ki).

 Another variation of كيف الحال is كيف حالك؟ (kay.fa ḥā.lak) (How is your health?). You can use either greeting, but كيف الحال is preferred when you're meeting someone for the first time because it's a bit more personal and informal.


Responding that you're doing well
When someone asks you how you're doing, if you're doing just fine, the typical response is الحمد لله (al.ḥam.du lil.lāh) (I'm doing well), although it literally translates to "Praise to God." Typically, after you say الحمد لله, you follow up by saying شكراً (shuk.ran) (thank you). As you expose yourself to more and more Arabic phrases and terms, you'll notice that the reference to Allah is widespread. Many everyday phrases still contain religious references. That's why a phrase as mundane as "I'm doing well" takes on religious overtones.
 A greeting wouldn't be complete if both sides didn't address each other. So after you say I'm doing well, you need to ask the other person how he or she is doing: 

If you're speaking with a man, you say وأنتَ كيف الحال؟ (wa.'an.ta, kay.fa al.ḥāl) (And you, how are you?).
If you're speaking with a woman, you say وأنتِ كيف الحال؟ (wa.'an.ti, kay.fa al.ḥāl) (And you, how are you?).

SENDING THE RIGHT NONVERBAL MESSAGE
Although familiarizing yourself with the language is the first step to interacting with people from the Middle East, you also need to understand some of the nonverbal signs that can be as meaningful as words in communicating with native speakers. For example, when shaking someone's hand, be sure to avoid pressing the person's palm with too much force. In the United States, a firm and strong handshake is encouraged in order to display a healthy dose of confidence. In most Arab countries, however, a forceful handshake is viewed as an openly hostile act. The reasoning is that you use force against people whom you don't consider friends, so a forceful handshake indicates that you don't consider that person a friend. Therefore, the most acceptable way to shake hands in the Arab world is to present a friendly, not-too-firm grip.



Making Introductions
Carrying on a conversation with someone you haven't exchanged names with is awkward, to say the least. But you can easily remedy this awkwardness when you know a few key phrases. This section explains how to ask people for their names and how to share your name using the possessive form, which may be one of the easiest grammar lessons and linguistic concepts you'll encounter in Arabic.

Asking "What's your name?"
After you go through the basic greeting procedure, which I cover in the preceding section, you're ready to ask people their names. This task is relatively easy given that you only need to know two words: اسم (ism) (name) and ما (mā) (what). If you're addressing a man, you ask ما اسمكَ؟ (mā is.mu.ka) (What's your name?). When addressing a woman, you ask ما اسمكِ؟ (mā is.mu.ki).
 If you say ما اسمك (mā is.muk) without using the suffixes -a or -i at the end of اسمك, you're actually using a gender-neutral form, which is perfectly acceptable. You can address both men and women by saying ما اسمك؟ (mā is.muk) (What's your name?).


Responding with the possessive "My name is ..."
The possessive form is one of Arabic's easiest grammatical lessons: All you do is add the suffix ي (-ī) (pronounced ee) to the noun, and — voilà! — you have the possessive form of the noun. For example, to say "my name," you add ي to اسم and get اسمي (is.mī) (my name). So to say "My name is Amine," all you say is اسمي أمين ('is.mī a.mīn). It's that simple!


Saying "It's a pleasure to meet you!"
When someone introduces himself or herself, a polite response is تشرفنا (ta.shar.raf.nā) (It's a pleasure to meet you). تشرفنا is a formal response, whereas أهلاً وسهلاً (ah.lan wa.sah.lan) (Welcome!) is much more informal.
شرف (sha.raf) is the Arabic term for "honor," which means that تشرفنا literally translates to "We're honored." In English, it's the equivalent of "It's a pleasure to meet you."
 أهلاً وسهلاً is a phrase with a dual role: When used at the beginning of a dialogue, it means "hi" (see the section "Saying hello" earlier in this chapter for further explanation). When used right after an introduction, you're informally saying "Nice to meet you."

Talking about Countries and Nationalities
With the growing internationalism of the modern world, when you meet someone for the first time, you may want to know what country he or she is from. Fortunately for English speakers, the names of countries in Arabic are very similar to their names in English. Even more good news is the fact that the terms for nationalities are derivatives of the country names.

Asking "Where are you from?"
If you're speaking with a man and want to ask him where he's from, you use the phrase من أين أنتَ؟ (min ay.na an.ta) (Where are you from?). Similarly, if you want to ask a woman "Where are you from?" you say من أين أنتِ؟ (min ay.na an.ti).
If you want to ask if a man is from a certain place — for example, America — you say هل أنتَ من أمريكا؟ (hal an.ta min am.rī.kā) (Are you from America?) (M). If you're speaking with a woman, you simply replace أنتَ ('an.ta) with أنتِ (an.ti).


Saying "I am from ..."
To say "I am from ...," you use the preposition من (min) (from) and the personal pronoun أنا ('a.nā) (I/me). Therefore, "I'm from America" is أنا من أمريكا (a.nā min am.rī.kā).
To help you both understand responses to the question "Where are you from?" (see the preceding section) and give your own response to such questions, Table 4-1 lists the names of various countries and corresponding nationalities in Arabic.

Shooting the Breeze: Talking about the Weather
If you want to chitchat with a friend or stranger, talking about the الطقس (aṭ.ṭaqs) (weather) is a pretty safe topic. In conversations about the weather, you're likely to use some of the following words: 

الشمس (ash.shams) (sun)
المطر (al.ma.ṭar) (rain)
رعد (ra'd) (thunder)
برق (barq) (lightning)
حرارة (ḥa.rā.rah) (temperature)
درجة (da.ra.jah) (degree)
بارد (bā.rid) (cold)
حار (ḥār) (hot)
رطوبة (ru.ṭū.bah) (humidity)
ريح (rīḥ) (wind)
عاصفة ('ā.ṣi.fah) (storm)
ثلج (thalj) (snow)
قوس قزح (qaws qu.zaḥ) (rainbow)

 If you want to express the temperature, as in "It's x degrees," you must use the following construct: (insert number) درجة الحرارة. So, درجة الحرارة 35 means "It's 35 degrees."
Because the weather is a quasi-universal topic that interests almost everyone, here are some expressions you can use to start talking about the weather: 

هل ستمطر اليوم؟ (hal sa.tum.ṭir al.yawm) (Is it going to rain today?)
يوم حار، أليس كذلك؟ (yawm ḥār, a.lay.sa ka.dhā.lik) (Hot day, isn't it?)
.أصبح الجو باردا فجأة (aṣ.ba.ḥa al.jaww bā.ri.dan faj.'a.tan) (It's gotten cold all of a sudden.)
هل سيبقى الطقس هكذا؟ (hal sa.yab.qá al.jaww hā.ka.dhā) (Will the weather remain like this?)

 Temperatures in the majority of the Middle Eastern countries are stated in Celsius and not Fahrenheit. If you hear someone say that درجة الحرارة 25 (da.ra.jah al.ḥa.rā.rah 25) (It's 25 degrees), don't worry that you're going to freeze! The person actually means that it's almost 80 degrees Fahrenheit. To convert degrees from Celsius to Fahrenheit, use the following formula: 
(Celsius 1.8) + 32 = Degrees Fahrenheit

Talkin' the Talk
Alexandra and Hassan are talking about the weather. 




Hassan:

كيف الطقس في نيو يورك؟
kayf aṭ.ṭaqs fī New York?
How's the weather in New York?



Alexandra:

Hassan:

Alexandra:

.سيكون مشمس طوال الأسبوع

HURRAY, IT'S RAINING!
One of the happiest times of the year for people of the Middle East is when the rain comes. After all, these hot desert countries get very little rainfall. You'll almost never hear anyone complaining about rain in Arabic — there are no equivalent expressions for "rain, rain, go away." Actually, the opposite is true! There's a song that farmers, students, and children sing when the rain starts falling: 
اشتتتتتتتت/اولاد الحرت: صب صب صب/الأولاد في قبي (ah.she.ta.ta.ta.ta.ta / aw.lād al.ḥah.ra.ta; ṣa.bi, ṣa.bi, ṣa.bi / al.aw.lād fī qu.bi) (Oh rain, rain, rain, rain, rain / Children of the plowman; Pour, pour, pour / The children are in the hood of my jellaba).
A jil.lā.ba is a long, flowing garment worn by farmers in the Middle East. It has a big hood in which the farmer puts objects. Of course, children can't fit in the hood of the jil.lā.ba, but the hood is big enough that it symbolizes protection against the rain. This is a happy song that expresses people's joy when it rains!

Chapter 5
Getting Your Numbers, Dates, and Measurements Straight

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Discovering the Arabic number system
 Sorting out words for days and months
 Figuring out the right measurements

Being able to communicate effectively in any new language you're studying is essential. Although knowing terms related to the workplace and the home is important, equally important is knowing practical terms, such as numbers and measurements. In this chapter, I identify all the practical terms so that you can communicate clearly and effectively. I first start out by showing you the Arabic number system, which is similar to but slightly different from the number system you're used to in English. I then show you other key terms so that you're able to discuss time of the year (days, weeks, and months). And I finally show you critical terms relating to measurements.
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Talking Numbers
Knowing how to express numbers in Arabic is a basic language lesson. You're bound to encounter Arabic numbers in all sorts of settings, including conversation. For example, when you're talking with someone about the weather, you need to know your numbers in order to reference the temperature or understand a reference the other person may make. In this section, I introduce you to the Arabic أرقام (ar.qām) (numbers). The singular form of أرقام is رقم (ra.qam) (number).
 Arabic numbers are part of one of the earliest traditions of number notation. Even though the Western world's number system is sometimes referred to as "Arabic numerals," actual Arabic numbers are written differently than the ones used in the West. One of the most important aspects of Arabic numbers to keep in mind is that you read them from left to right. That's right! Even though you read and write Arabic from right to left, you read and write Arabic numbers from left to right! Table 5-1 lays out the Arabic numbers from 0 to 10.

Numbers are important not only for discussing the weather but also for telling time, asking about prices, and conducting everyday business. Table 5-2 contains the numbers from 11 to 20.

18 ١٨ eighteen



تسعة عشر

عشرون

 You obtain the numbers from 11 to 19 by combining a derivative form of the number عشرة (‎10) — specifically عشر (tenth) — with a derivative form of the singular number. In the case of the numbers from 13 to 19, all you do is add the suffix -ta to the regular number and add the derivative form عشر. After you're familiar with this pattern, remembering these numbers is much easier.
Table 5-3 shows the numbers in increments of 10 from 20 to 100.

100 ١٠٠ one hundred




 In English, you add the suffix -ty to get thirty, forty, and so on. In Arabic, the suffix ون (-ūn) plays that role, as in أربعون (‎40) or خمسون (‎50).


Referring to Days and Months
When you're engaged in conversation, you may find that you need to refer to certain days of the week or months. Fortunately the days of the أسبوع (us.bū') (week) are number derivatives — that is, they're derived from Arabic numbers. So recognizing the roots of the words for days of the week is key: 

الأحد (al.'a.ḥad) (Sunday)
الاثنين (al.ith.nayn) (Monday)
الثلاثاء (ath.thu.lā.thā') (Tuesday)
الأربعاء (al.'ar.ba.'ā') (Wednesday)
الخميس (al.kha.mīs) (Thursday)
الجمعة (al.jum.'ah) (Friday)
السبت (as.sabt) (Saturday)

Notice that Sunday is derived from the number 1, Monday from 2, Tuesday from 3, Wednesday from 4, and Thursday from 5. In the Islamic calendar, Sunday is the first day, Monday the second day, and so on.
 Friday gets its name from جمع, which means to gather; it's the day when Muslims gather around the mosque and pray.
Arabs use two different types of calendars predominantly to note the passage of time. 

The Gregorian calendar is basically the same calendar as the one used throughout the Western world.
The Islamic calendar, sometimes also known as the lunar calendar, is partly based on the lunar cycle and has radically different names for the months than its Western counterpart.

Tables 5-4 and 5-5 show the أشهر (ash.hur) (months) in the Gregorian and Islamic calendars, because they're the most widely used calendars.

The Arabic names of the Gregorian months are similar to the names in English. However, the names of the Islamic calendar are quite different.
Because the Islamic calendar is partly based on the lunar cycle, the months don't overlap with the Gregorian calendar, making it difficult to match the months with the Gregorian ones. For example, the month of Ramadan will fall on different Gregorian calendar months each year because the Islamic calendar is based on lunar movements. So don't be surprised if Ramadan is in June one year and then May the following year; it's totally normal since it is based on lunar movements.
Chatting about the months without mentioning the فصول (fu.ṣūl) (seasons) would be difficult: 

صيف (ṣayf) (summer)
خريف (kha.rīf) (fall)
شتاء (shi.tā') (winter)
ربيع (ra.bī') (spring)



Size Matters: Measuring in Arabic
Measurements are a critical component of any language, and this includes Arabic. If you're going to communicate effectively, you need these tools to be able to get your point across. In this section, I show you some key terms regarding measurements that you'll likely come across: 

حجم (ḥajm) (size)
سنتيمتر (san.tī.mitr) (centimeter)
متر (mitr) (meter)
كيلومتر (kī.lū.mitr) (kilometer)
وزن (wazn) (weight)
غرام (ghi.rām) (gram)
كيلوغرام (kī.lū.ghrām) (kilogram)
مليغرام (mil.lī.ghrām) (milligram)

Chapter 6
At the Office and Around the House

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Interacting with co-workers
 Using the imperative verb form
 Relaxing in your home

If you're like most people living in the modern world, the two places where you spend the most time probably are your منزل (man.zil) (house) and your مكتب (mak.tab) (office). Like many people who are employed by big companies, small businesses, government agencies, or private ventures, you divide your وقت (waqt) (time) between العمل (al.'a.mal) (work) and الحياة الأسرية (al.ḥa.yāh al. 'u.sa.riy.yah) (family life). Achieving التوازن (at.ta.wā.zun) (balance) between the two is extremely crucial for your happiness, your efficiency at the workplace, and your effectiveness in your home. In this chapter, I cover all the good "work" words you should know and introduce you to all aspects of life at the office and around the house to help you balance life between these two worlds.
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Managing the Office Environment
The office is an essential part of modern life. In most Arabic-speaking and Muslim countries, العمال (al.'um.māl) (workers) work from الإثنين (al.'ith.nayn) (Monday) until الجمعة (al.jum.'ah) (Friday). Most workers follow a standard الساعة التاسعة إلى الساعة الخامسة (as.sā.'ah at.tā.si.'ah i.lá as.sā.'ah al.khā.mi.sah) (9 to 5) schedule for workdays.
 Although most مكاتب (ma.kā.tib) (offices) around the world give their workers time for غداء (gha.dā') (lunch), the duration depends on the employer and the country. For example, in the United States, it's not uncommon for an عامل ('ā.mil) (worker) to eat lunch while sitting at his مكتب (mak.tab) (desk). On the other hand, in most Middle Eastern countries, a worker gets two hours and is encouraged to eat his lunch at his home with his أسرة (us.rah) (family).
Here are some key words and terms to help you navigate the workplace: 

عمل ('a.mal) (work/job)
مهنة (mih.nah) (profession)
شركة (sha.ri.kah) (company)
شركة كبيرة (sha.ri.kah ka.bī.rah) (large company)
شركة صغيرة (sha.ri.kah ṣa.ghī.rah) (small company)
مصنع (maṣ.na') (factory)
زبون (za.būn) (client)
زبائن (za.bā.'in) (clients)

You can choose from many different kinds of شركات (sha.ri.kāt) (companies) to work for, including a بنك (bank) (bank), a شركة محاسبة (sha.ri.kat mu.ḥā.sa.bah) (accounting firm), or a محاماة (mu.ḥā.māh) (law firm). You also have many choices when it comes to مهن (mi.han) (professions). Here are some popular professions: 

مصرفي (maṣ.ra.fī) (banker) (M)
مصرفية (maṣ.ra.fiy.yah) (banker) (F)
رجل أعمال (ra.jul a'.māl) (businessman)
سيدة أعمال (say.yi.dat a'.māl) (businesswoman)
محاميc (mu.ḥā.mī) (lawyer) (M)
محامية (mu.ḥā.mīy.yah) (lawyer) (F)
شرطي (shur.ṭī) (police officer)
رجل إطفاء (ra.jul iṭ.fā') (firefighter)

Most companies have a lot of workers with different responsibilities, and most workers find themselves in various إدارات (i.dā.rāt) (divisions/groups/departments) within the company. Here are some of the common departments you may find in a company: 

إدارة المحاسبة (i.dā.rat al.mu.ḥā.sa.bah) (accounting department)
إدارة التسويق (i.dā.rat at.tas.wīq) (marketing department)
إدارة القانون (i.dā.rat al.qā.nūn) (legal department)
إدارة العاملين (i.dā.rat al.'ā.mi.līn) (human resources department)
ادارة العملاء (i.dā.rat al.'u.ma.lā') (customer service department)


Interacting with your colleagues
Unless you're in an office that doesn't require you to interact with people face to face, you need to be able to get along with your زملاء (zu.ma.lā') (colleagues). This section reveals the terms that can help you get along with everyone at the office so that you can be as productive and efficient as possible.
Before you build good working relationships with your co-workers, you should know the right words for classifying them: 

زميل (za.mīl) (colleague) (MS)
زميلة (za.mī.lah) (colleague) (FS)
مدير (mu.dīr) (director) (MS)
مديرة (mu.dī.rah) (director) (FS)
مدراء (mu.da.rā') (directors) (MP)
مديرات (mu.dī.rāt) (directors) (FP)
رئيس (ra.'īs) (president) (MS)
رئيسة (ra.'ī.sah) (president) (FS)
رؤساء (ru.'a.sā') (presidents) (MP)
رئيسات (ra.'ī.sāt) (presidents) (FP)

Whether you like it or not, your زملاء المكتب (zu.ma.lā' al.mak.tab) (office colleagues) have a big influence over your time at the office; therefore, getting along with your colleagues is crucial. You can address people you work with in a number of different ways, such as based on rank, age, or gender. These categorizations may seem discriminatory in an American sense, but these terms actually carry the utmost respect for the person being referenced: 

Use سيدي (say.yi.dī) (sir) to address the director or someone with a higher rank than you.
Use سيدتي (say.yi.da.tī) (madam) to address the director or president.
Use صديقي (ṣa.dī.qī) (friend) to address a male colleague.
Use صديقتي (ṣa.dī.qa.tī) (friend) to address a female colleague.
Use الأخ (al.'akh) (brother) to address a male colleague.
Use الأخت (al.'ukht) (sister) to address a female colleague.

 In Arabic culture, it's okay to address co-workers or people close to you as brother or sister even though they may not be related to you. Here are some phrases to help you interact cordially and politely with your colleagues: 

هل تريد مساعدة؟ (hal tu.rīd mu.sā.'a.dah) (Do you need help?) (M)
هل تريدين مساعدة؟ (hal tu.rī.dīn mu.sā.'a.dah) (Do you need help?) (F)
هل يمكن ان اساعدك؟ (hal yum.kin an u.sā.'i.dak) (May I help you?) (M)
هل يمكن ان اساعدك؟ (hal yum.kin an u.sā.'i.dik) (May I help you?) (F)
سأذهب إلى المطعم. هل تريد شيئاً؟ (sa.'adh.hab i.lá al.maṭ.'am. hal tu.rīd shay.'an) (I'm going to the cafeteria. Do you want anything?) (M)
سأذهب إلى المطعم. هل تريدين شيئاً؟ (sa.'adh.hab i.lā al.maṭ.'am. hal tu.rī.dīn shay.'an) (I'm going to the cafeteria. Do you want anything?) (F)
.عندنا اجتماع بعد 5 دقائق ('in.da.nā ij.ti.mā' ba'.da khams da.qā.'iq) (We have a meeting in five minutes.)
هل وصلك بريدي الإكتروني؟ (hal wa.ṣa.lak ba.rī.dī al.'i.lik.ti.rū.nī) (Did you get my email?)
هل عندك قلم؟ (hal 'in.dak qa.lam) (Do you have a pen?) (M)
هل عندك قلم؟ (hal 'in.dik qa.lam) (Do you have a pen?) (F)

Giving orders
 The imperative verb form, also known as the command form, is used to give orders or directions. It's an important verb to know in the workplace because that's where you're usually told what to do and where you tell others what to do. The imperative structure is fairly straightforward. This section shares some quick tips to allow you to master the imperative form.
First, because the imperative is a command form, you can use it only with second-person pronouns such as أنت (an.ta) (you) (M) and أنتِ (an.ti) (you) (F). You can't use the imperative with third-person pronouns such as هو (hu.wa) (he) because you can't give an order to someone who isn't present. The following is a list of the personal pronouns to use with the imperative: 

أنت (an.ta) (you) (MS)
أنتِ (an.ti) (you) (FS)
أنتم (an.tum) (you) (MP)
أنتنّ (an.tun.na) (you) (FP)
أنتما (an.tu.mā) (you) (dual)

Second, the imperative form is nothing but a derived form of the regular verb in the الماضي (al.mā.ḍī) (the past) and المضارع (al.mu.ḍā.ri') (the present) tenses. The following is a list of the most common imperative verbs: 

اكتب (uk.tub) (write)
اقرأ (iq.ra') (read)
انظر (un.ẓur) (look)
اعد (a.'id) (repeat)
قل (qul) (say)
كل (kul) (eat)
تكلّم (ta.kal.lam) (talk)
قف (qif) (stop)
تحرّك (ta.ḥar.rak) (move)

One of the more important verb command forms is the verb كتب (ka.ta.ba) (to write). Table 6-1 shows the imperative (command form) of this verb.

Supplying your office
In order to function properly and efficiently at the office, you need a number of different work-related items. Here are some common supplies you can expect to find at the office: 

كرسي (kur.sī) (chair)
مكتب (mak.tab) (desk)
الكمبيوتر (al.kum.bi.yū.tar) (computer)
هاتف (hā.tif) (telephone)
فاكس (fāks) (fax machine)
طابعة (ṭā.bi.'ah) (printer)

Besides آلات (ā.lāt) (machines) and heavy furniture, you also need smaller tools to help you get by at the office: 

قلم جاف (qa.lam jāf) (pen)
قلم رصاص (qa.lam ra.ṣāṣ) (pencil)
ممحاة (mim.ḥāh) (eraser)
كتاب (ki.tāb) (book)
دفتر (daf.tar) (notebook)
أوراق (aw.rāq) (papers)
مشبك أوراق (mash.bak aw.rāq) (paper clip)
صمغ (ṣamgh) (glue)
شريط لاصق (sha.rīṭ lā.ṣiq) (tape)

If you can't find a notebook or glue, ask a colleague if you can borrow the item. Here's how you ask a colleague a question, depending on whether you're speaking to a man or a woman: 

هل عندك دفتر؟ (hal 'in.dik daf.tar) (Do you have a notebook?) (F)
هل عندك صمغ؟ (hal 'in.dak ṣamgh) (Do you have glue?) (M)
هل عندك شريط لاصق؟ (hal 'in.dak sha.rīṭ lā.ṣiq) (Do you have tape?) (M)
هل عنده قلم؟ (hal 'in.da.hu qa.lam) (Does he have a pen?)

 The construct "to have" in Arabic isn't a verb (see the preceding list of examples); rather, it's a combination of possessive suffix constructions added to the word عند ('ind) (have), which is the best word in the language to denote possession. However, for all intents and purposes, you may use this construct — عند followed by a possessive suffix — in the same way as you would a regular verb. Check out this prepositional phrase using all personal pronoun suffixes:

Life at Home
If you're like most people, you spend a lot of time at your منزل (man.zil) (house). The house is a bit different than the بيت (bayt) (home) because a house can be any old house, whereas the home is the space where you feel most comfortable. In many cultures, a house is a family's or individual's most prized possession or asset. Due to the centrality of the home and house in everyday life, knowing how to talk about them in depth can be very useful. In this section, I tell you all the right words and terms to help you talk about your house.
As you know, a house consists of غرف (ghu.raf) (rooms). The singular form is غرفة (ghur.fah) (room) in Arabic. This list can help you become familiar with the major types of rooms in a house: 

غرفة الجلوس (ghur.fat al.ju.lūs) (sitting room)
غرفة المعيشة (ghur.fat al.ma.'ī.shah) (living room)
غرفة الطعام (ghur.fat aṭ.ṭa.'ām) (dining room)
غرفة النوم (ghur.fat an.nawm) (bedroom)
حمّام (ḥam.mām) (bathroom)
غرفة الغسل (ghur.fat al.ghasl) (washing/laundry room)
مطبخ (maṭ.bakh) (kitchen)

In addition to rooms, a house may also have a مرأب لإيواء السيارات (mar.'ab li'ī.wā' as.say.yā.rāt) (garage) where you can park your سيارة (say.yā.rah) (car) as well as a حديقة (ḥa.dī.qah) (garden) where you can play or just relax. Some منازل (ma.nā.zil) (houses) even have a بركة سباحة (bir.kat si.bā.ḥa) (swimming pool).
Each room in the house usually contains different items. For example, you can expect to find a سرير (sa.rīr) (bed) in a bedroom. Here are some items you can expect to find in the bathroom: 

مرحاض (mir.ḥāḍ) (toilet)
دش (dush) (shower)
مغسل (magh.sal) (sink)
فرشاة الأسنان (fur.shāt al.'as.nān) (toothbrush)
شامبو (sham.bū) (shampoo)
صابون (ṣā.būn) (soap)
مرآة (mir.'āh) (mirror)

You can expect to find the following items in the kitchen: 

تنور (tan.nūr) (oven)
ثلاجة (thal.lā.jah) (refrigerator)
شوك (shu.wak) (forks)
ملاعق (ma.lā.'iq) (spoons)
سكاكين (sa.kā.kīn) (knives)
أكواب (ak.wāb) (cups)
أطباق (aṭ.bāq) (dishes)


FAMILY LIFE IN A MIDDLE EASTERN HOME
In most Arabic-speaking and Islamic countries, the بيت (bayt) (home) plays a very central role in family life. Unlike in Western countries, the أسرة (us.rah) (family) structure in the home generally consists of more than the parents and children (the typical immediate family); it extends to other members of the family, such as grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins. Therefore, a home in most Middle Eastern countries houses not only parents and their children, but also grandparents, grandchildren, cousins, and other family members.
In countries such as Saudi Arabia, منازل (ma.nā.zil) (houses) are built to accommodate up to 10 or 15 family members and sometimes more. Like houses in the United States, Europe, and other parts of the world, the Middle Eastern home revolves around the غرفة المعيشة (ghur.fat al.ma.'ī.shah) (living room). Physically and architecturally, the living room is the central part of the house; it's usually surrounded by the مطبخ (maṭ.bakh) (kitchen) and the غرفة الجلوس (ghur.fat al.ju.lūs) (sitting room) and غرفة الطعام (ghur.fat aṭ.ṭa.'ām) (dining room).
During the عيد ('īd) (holiday), the home becomes a place where family members come and celebrate the festivities together. The living room retains its centrality during these festivities, although other parts of the home become more significant, such as the dining room.

Chapter 7
Getting to Know You: Making Small Talk

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Asking simple questions
 Chatting about your family
 Talking about jobs
 Keeping in touch with the phone and email

With Arabic speakers, محادثة قصيرة (mu.ḥā.da.thah qa.ṣī.rah) (small talk) plays an important role during interactions. Sometimes you need to engage in small talk when you meet people for the first time. You may know their اسم (ism) (name), but you want to find out more about them, such as where they're from and what they do. Small talk allows you to find out more about the person you're interacting with as well as lets you tell a little bit about yourself. Small talk may also take place between people who know each other but prefer to make small talk in order to avoid awkward silence! Whatever the case, the ability to engage in small talk is important.
You need to be aware of a number of rules when you make small talk in Arabic. This chapter explains how to make small talk in Arabic, including how to ask simple questions to find out more about the person or people you're talking to. I discuss how to talk about your أسرة (us.rah) (family) and your مهنة (mih.nah) (job).
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Asking Key Questions
One of the best ways to start a conversation is to ask a سؤال (su.'āl) (question). To get you started, here are some key question words in Arabic: 

من؟ (man) (who)
أين؟ (ay.na) (where)
متى؟ (ma.tá) (when)
ما؟ (mā) (what)
ماذا؟ (mā.dhā) (what) (used with verbs)
لماذا؟ (li.mā.dhā) (why)
كيف؟ (kay.fa) (how)
كم؟ (kam) (how many or how much)

You may use these question words to ask more elaborate and detailed questions. Here are some examples: 

ما اسمكَ؟ (mā is.mu.ka?) (What's your name?) (MS)
ما اسمكِ؟ (mā is.mu.ki?) (What's your name?) (FS)
ما هي مهنتكَ؟ (mā hi.ya mih.na.tu.ka?) (What do you do?; Literally: What is your job?) (MS)
ما هي مهنتكِ؟ (mā hi.ya mih.na.tu.ki?) (What do you do?; Literally: What is your job?) (FS)
ماذا تفعل؟ (mā.dhā taf.'al?) (What are you doing?) (MS)
ماذا تفعلين؟ (mā.dhā taf.'a.līn?) (What are you doing?) (FS)
من أين أنتَ؟ (min ay.na an.ta?) (Where are you from?) (MS)
من أين أنتِ؟ (min ay.na an.ti?) (Where are you from?) (FS)
ماذا يكتب؟ (mā.dhā yak.tub?) (What is he writing?)
هل تحبَ القراءة؟ (hal tu.ḥib al.qi.rā.'ah?) (Do you like to read?) (MS)
هل تحبّين القراءة؟ (hal tu.ḥib.bī.na al.qi.rā.'ah?) (Do you like to read?) (FS)
هل هذا كتابك؟ (hal hā.dhā ki.tā.bu.ka?) (Is this your book?) (MS)
هل هذا كتابك؟ (hal hā.dhā ki.tā.bu.ki?) (Is this your book?) (FS)
أين محطة القطار؟ (ay.na ma.ḥaṭ.ṭat al.qi.ṭār?) (Where is the train station?)
متى تذهب إلى المطار؟ (ma.tá tadh.ha.bu i.lá al.ma.ṭār?) (When is she going to the airport?)
أين أفضل مطعم؟ (ay.na af.ḍal maṭ.'am?) (Where is the best restaurant?)
لماذا تذهب إلى السوق؟ (li.mā.dhā tadh.hab i.lā as.sūq?) (Why are you going to the market?) (MS)

 Notice that some of the preceding questions refer to either masculine or feminine subjects. When you ask a question in Arabic, you choose the gender of the subject by modifying the gender suffix of the noun in question. For example, كتاب (ki.tāb) means "book," but كتابكَ (ki.tā.bu.ka) means "your book" (M), and كتابكِ (ki.tā.bu.ki) means "your book" (F). So if you want to ask a man for his book, you use كتابكَ.

Talking about Yourself and Your Family
When you meet someone for the first time, you want to get to know a little more about him or her. One of the best ways to get acquainted with the person you're talking to is by finding out more about his or her أسرة (us.rah) (the family). The family is one of the best topics of conversation because it generates a lot of interest and endless conversation. Table 7-1 lists some important family members who may come up in casual conversation.

 THE ROLE OF FAMILY IN ARAB CULTURE
The أسرة (us.rah) (family) plays a very important role in Arab life, society, and culture, and the Arab family structure is very different than the Western family unit. The notion of the family is much more comprehensive and reinforced in the Arab world and the Middle East than the United States or other Western countries. The family unit most prevalent in the West is the nuclear family — generally comprised of two parents and their children — but the family in the Arab world is an extended, close-knit family network made up of parents, children, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.
It's not uncommon to find an Arab household in which children live not only with their parents but also with their aunts and uncles, cousins, and grandparents. In Arab culture, the idea of the immediate family extends to second- and even third-degree cousins! In addition, lineage is important, and the terms for family relatives are specifically designed to differentiate between cousins from the mother's side ابن الخال (ibn al.khāl) and cousins from the father's side ابن العمّ (ibn al.'amm). Thus, if you're talking to someone from the Arab world about his or her family, you can be sure that you'll have a lot to talk about!

Making Small Talk on the Job
You can generally find out a lot about a person based on his or her مهنة (mih.nah) (job). A lot of people identify themselves with their occupations, so being able to make small talk about jobs is essential.
 Professions in Arabic always have a gender distinction. If you want to ask someone about his or her profession, you have two options: 

ما مهنتكَ؟ (mā mih.na.tu.ka) (What is your job?; Literally: What do you do?) (M)
ما مهنتكِ؟ (mā mih.na.tu.ki) (What is your job?; Literally: What do you do?) (F)
أينت تعمل؟ (ay.na ta'.mal) (Where do you work?) (M)
أين تعملين؟ (ay.na ta'.ma.līn) (Where do you work?) (F)

Table 7-2 gives the masculine forms of professions. You'll be pleased to know that converting the masculine forms of professions into the feminine forms involves simply adding a تاء مربوطة to the end of the masculine profession. For example, to say "translator" in the feminine, you add a تاء مربوطة to مترجم to get مترجمة (mu.tar.ji.mah) (translator) (F).

Staying in Touch by Phone and Email
One of the fun things about meeting new people is staying in touch with them so as to have future encounters that are enjoyable, pleasant, and enriching. Therefore, being able to initiate and provide contact information in order to remain in touch with friends, both old and new, is important. In this section, I give you the basics to help you stay in touch with people. Staying in touch is also an important tool in helping improve your Arabic — the more Arabic speakers you interact with, the faster your Arabic will improve. 

ما هي أفضل طريقة للبقاء على الاتصال؟ (mā hi.ya af-ḍal ṭa-rī-qah lil-ba.qā' 'a.lá al.it.ti.ṣāl?) (What's the best way to stay in touch?)
ما هو رقم هاتفك؟ (mā hu.wa raqm hā.ti.fak) (What's your telephone number?)
هل لديك رقم هاتف جوّال؟ (hal la.day.ka ra.qam hā.tif ja.wāl?) (Do you have a mobile phone number?)
ما هو البريد الإلكتروني الخاص بك؟ (mā hu.wa al.ba.rīd al.'i.lik.trū.nī al.khāṣ bik) (What's your email address?)

These questions can help you stay in touch with new people whom you meet. Another popular tool that's now helpful for people to stay in touch is فيسبوك (fīs.būk) (Facebook). A lot of people in the Arab world are increasingly becoming regular Facebook users, which will help you even more when interacting with new friends. Check Chapter 9 for specific information for how to carry on a phone conversation and what to include in an email.

Chapter 8
Asking Directions and Finding Your Way

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Asking and answering "where" questions
 Clarifying directions
 Exploring ordinal numbers

Being able to ask for — and understand — اتجاهات (it.ti.jā.hāt) (directions) is an important skill. In order to interact with others and get assistance, you need to know how to ask questions that can help you get where you want to be. And you also need to understand the directions that are being given to you. In this chapter, I tell you how to get relevant information to help you find what you're looking for.
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Focusing on the "Where"
In order to ask for and give directions, you need to be able to answer and ask "where" questions. In this section, I tell you how to do just that.

Asking "where" questions
The best way to get directions-related information is to ask أين (ay.na) (where) questions. Luckily, the structure of a where question is relatively straightforward: You use أين followed by the subject. For example: 

أين الفندق؟ (ay.na al.fun.duq) (Where is the hotel?)
أين الهاتف؟ (ay.na al.hā.tif) (Where is the phone?)
أين الحمّام؟ (ay.na al.ḥam.mām) (Where is the bathroom?)

 Be sure to define the subject following أين. As I explain in Chapter 3, you define a subject by adding the definite article prefix ال (al) (the) to the subject noun. For example, فندق means "hotel," and الفندق means "the hotel." So if you're asking where the hotel is located, you say, أين الفندق (Where is the hotel?) and not أين فندق, which translates to Where is a hotel?
"Where" questions are useful for more than just asking for directions. You may also apply the where question format to human subjects, such as friends or family. For instance: 

أين مريم؟ (ay.na mar.yī.am) (Where is Miriam?)
أين الأطفال؟ (ay.na al.'aṭ.fāl) (Where are the children?)
أين أمي؟ (ay.na um.mī) (Where is my mom?)

 You don't need to use the definite article ال when referring to a noun that's already defined. For instance, in one of the preceding examples, مريم doesn't require the definite article prefix ال because she's a specific person. So make sure that you don't go around adding the prefix ال to every subject after أين because sometimes there's no question about what subject you're referring to.


Answering "where" questions
Answering where questions isn't always as clear-cut as asking a where question. You can answer a where question in a number of different ways, ranging from the simple to the convoluted. In order to answer where questions, you have to understand the structure of the where question response, which usually follows this format: subject, preposition, object.
Take a look at some common where questions and their corresponding replies: 


أين المستشفى؟ (ay.na al.mus.tash.fá) (Where is the hospital?)
.المستشفى في المدينة (al.mus.tash.fá fī al.ma.dī.nah) (The hospital is in the city.)

أين المطعم؟ (ay.na al.maṭ.'am) (Where is the restaurant?)
.المطعم قريب من الفندق (al.maṭ.'am qa.rīb min al.fun.duq) (The restaurant is close to the hotel.)
أين الكتاب؟ (ay.na al.ki.tāb) (Where is the book?)
.الكتاب تحت الطاولة (al.ki.tāb taḥt aṭ.ṭā.wi.lah) (The book is under the table.)

 Notice that in these examples, you use a preposition to establish a connection between the subject (in this case, what or whom you're looking for) and the object (the location of the desired subject). In order to establish the desired relationship, you need to be familiar with some of these common prepositions: 

على ('a.lá) (on)
في (fī) (in)
إلى (i.lá) (to)
قريب من (qa.rīb min) (close to)
بعيد عن (ba.'īd 'an) (far from)
بجانب (bi.jā.nib) (next to)
فوق (fawq) (on top of)
تحت (taḥt) (underneath/below)
أمام (a.mām) (in front of)
وراء (wa.rā.'a) (behind)
على يمين ('a.lá ya.mīn) (to the right of)
على يسار ('a.lá ya.sār) (to the left of)

 You must define the subject in the أين interrogatory sentence (see "Asking 'where' questions" earlier in the chapter for details); similarly, you must also define the subject in the reply to a where question. In addition, you should define the object in the response statement as well, either by using the definite article prefix ال or by including a predefined object.



Getting Direction about Directions
Understanding the format of the where question and reply structures is an important first step in having a firm grasp on how to ask for directions. These sections help you so you can ask and respond to direction questions.

Asking for directions
Of course, you can't just go up to a person and bluntly ask him or her, أين الفندق (Where is the hotel?). That wouldn't be very polite. The proper etiquette for approaching someone and asking for directions is to first say السلام عليكم (as.sa.lā.mu 'a.lay.kum) (hello) or أهلاً وسهلاً (ah.lan wa.sah.lan) (hi) and then ask if he or she would permit you to ask a question. For example, you begin the exchange by saying, عفواً. هل يمكن أن أسألك؟ ('af.wan hal yum.kin an as.'a.lak su.'ā.lan?) (Excuse me. May I ask you a question?).
After the person agrees to take your question, you may proceed to ask for directions. (For more information on greetings and introductions, see Chapter 4.)

Could you repeat that?
Sometimes, when you ask for directions, the person who tries to help you starts talking too fast and you can't quite understand what he is saying. Other times, you may be in a loud area, such as near a downtown traffic jam, and you can't make out what the other person is saying. In either case, you have to ask the person who's giving you directions to speak more slowly or to repeat what he has just said. These phrases can help you cope with these situations: 

عفواً ('af.wan) (Excuse me/Pardon me)
لم أفهم (lam af.ham) (I didn't understand)
تكلّم ببطء من فضلك (ta.kal.lam bi.buṭ' min faḍ.lik) (Speak slowly please)
. اعد من فضلك (a.'id min faḍ.lik) (Repeat please)

Using command forms
When you ask someone for directions, the person directs you to a specific location. Essentially, she tells you where to go, which qualifies as a command form. The command form is uniform, which means it applies to all second-person pronouns. However, the command form is gender-defined, which means that you use different commands for men and women. Here are some common command forms: 





Masculine Command

Feminine Command

Discovering Ordinal Numbers
Ordinal numbers are used to order things in a first-second-third kind of format. Unlike cardinal numbers, which are mostly used for counting, you use ordinals when giving directions. For example, you would tell someone to "turn right on the second street" and not "turn right on two street." Hear the difference?
 Ordinal numbers in Arabic are gender-defined, so you need to be familiar with both the masculine and feminine ordinal forms, which I present in Table 8-1.

 If you want to tell a friend that your house is "the fifth house," you say, المنزل الخامس (al.man.zil al.khā.mis). Note that you use the masculine ordinal form خامس because منزل is a masculine noun subject. To say that you're taking the "eighth bus," you would say, الحافلة الثامنة (al.ḥā.fi.lah ath.thā.mi.nah). The ordinal الثامنة is feminine because الحافلة is a feminine noun subject.
So if you want to tell your friend to "turn left on the second street," you say,طف إلى اليسار في الشارع الثاني (ṭuff i.lá al.ya.sār fī ash.shā.ri' ath.thā.nī). Because الشارع (ash.shā.ri') (street) is a masculine subject, the corresponding ordinal ثاني (second) should also be masculine.

Chapter 9
Taking Care of Business and Telecommunicating

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Beginning a phone conversation
 Making plans over the phone
 Leaving a phone message
 Sending and receiving emails

Personally, I really enjoy talking on the هاتف (hā.tif) (phone). It's a great way to catch up with friends, make social arrangements, and plan other aspects of your life with ease. With just a phone, you can get in touch with anyone in the world and talk about anything you like — from sports to social events and schoolwork to office gossip!
A few decades ago you may have been limited as to where you could hold a مكالمة هاتفية (mu.kā.la.mah hā.ti.fiy.yah) (phone conversation). Today, with the ubiquity of cellphones and other portable phone units, you can literally take your conversation anywhere! This flexibility makes knowing how to hold a phone conversation in Arabic even more important. In this chapter, I explain how to properly begin and end a phone conversation, how to make plans over the phone, and how to leave a proper phone message in Arabic. With all that information, you can be confident that you're carrying on a proper phone conversation like a native speaker!
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Making a Call: Phone Basics
Before you can chat on the phone with your friends like a native speaker, you need to be familiar with the following basic terminology: 

هاتف عام (hā.tif 'ām) (public phone)
هاتف جوال (ḥā.tif jaw.wāl) (cellphone)
رقم الهاتف (raqm al.hā.tif) (phone number)
بطاقة الهاتف (bi.ṭā.qat al.hā.tif) (phone card)
مكالمة هاتفية (mu.kā.la.mah hā.ti.fiy.yah) (phone conversation)

The following sections explain how to start talking on the phone and how to ask for someone in Arabic.

Beginning a phone conversation
You can begin a phone conversation in a number of ways. The most common, whether you're the caller or the person answering the phone, is to simply say ألو (a.lū) (hello). Hello is one of the most common phrases in the Arabic language and is used consistently throughout in conversation.
 Stating your name right after the person on the phone says hello is proper etiquette, particularly if you don't know that person. If you're the caller, you may say أنا (a.nā) (I am) followed by your name. Alternatively, you may say هذا (M)/هذه (F) (hā.dhā/hā.dhi.hi) (this is) followed by your name. A familiar phrase you can also use after you say hello is السلام عليكم (as.sa.lā.mu 'a.lay.kum) (hello) or أهلاً و سهلاً (ah.lan wa.sah.lan) (hi). Flip to Chapter 3 for more on greetings and making small talk.

Talkin' the Talk
Kamal calls his friend Rita at home.




Kamal:

.ألو

kayf al.ḥāl?
How are you doing?



Kamal:

.الحمد لله، شكراً
al.ḥam.du lil.lāh, shuk.ran.
I'm doing well, thank you.








Asking to speak to someone
Sometimes, a person other than the one you want to talk to answers the phone. A common phrase to help you ask for the person you called to speak with is هل (اسم) هنا؟ (hal [name] hu.nā), which means "Is (name) here?"
Alternatively, you can also use the personal pronouns هو (hu.wa) (if the person you're looking for is a man) or هي (hi.ya) (in the case of a woman) instead of using the person's name.

Talkin' the Talk
Kamal calls his friend Rita at home. Rita's mom, Souad, answers the phone, and Kamal asks to speak with Rita.

Planning while on the Phone
The phone is useful not only for staying in touch with friends and family, but also for making ارتباطات اجتماعية (ir.ti.bā.ṭāt ij.ti.mā.'iy.yah) (social arrangements) as well as ارتباطات العمل (ir.ti.bā.ṭāt al.'a.mal) (business arrangements). This section covers the specific terminology you need for each of these situations.

Making social plans
If you're talking with a friend, you're free to be a bit more informal than if you were calling a business. Some common words to help you make social arrangements with your friends are the following: 

!هيا بنا (hay.yā bi.nā) (Let's!)
مطعم (maṭ.'am) (restaurant)
قاعة سينما (qā.'at si.ni.mā) (movie theater)
متحف (mat.ḥaf) (museum)
وقت فراغ (waqt fa.rāgh) (free time)

Making business appointments
Arranging personal get-togethers with friends or family is always fun, but at times you have to conduct business over the phone, whether you're setting up a موعد (maw.'id) (appointment) with the dentist or arranging a business اجتماع (ij.ti.mā') (meeting) with a client. Interacting with businesses in Arabic requires specific terminology.

Talkin' the Talk

Leaving a Message
Sometimes you just run out of luck and can't get ahold of the person you're trying to reach. You're forced to leave a رسالة (ri.sā.lah) (message) either on a voice mailbox or with a person. These sections explain how to do so and the important related vocabulary.

Dealing with voice mail
When you leave a voice-mail message, you want to make sure to include the following: 

Your اسم (ism) (name)
The وقت المكالمة (waqt al.mu.kā.la.mah) (time of the call)
Your رقم الهاتف (raqm al.hā.tif) (phone number or callback number)
The أحسن وقت للمكالمة (aḥ.san waqt lil.mu.kā.la.mah) (best times you're available to talk)

For example, Salma tries to reach Karim by phone but gets this recording instead: 

أهلاً, أنا كريم. أنا لست هنا ولكن إذا تركت اسمك ورقمك سأكلمك في أسرع وقت
(ah.lan, a.nā ka.rīm. a.nā las.tu hu.nā wa.lāk.in i.dhā ta.rak.ta is.muk wa.raq.muk sa.'u.kal.li.muk fī 'as.ra' waqt)
(Hi, this is Karim. I'm not in right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you as soon as possible.)

Salma's voice-mail message sounds something like this: 

أهلاً وسهلاً كريم. أنا سلمى. الساعة الواحدة والنصف يوم الخميس. اتصل بي من فضلك عند سماعك هذه الرسالة في أي وقت بعد الساعة الخامسة. رقمي صفر واحد اثنين ثلاثة. شكراً.
(ah.lan wa.sah.lan ka.rīm. a.nā sal.má. as.sā.'ah al.wā.ḥi.dah wan.niṣf yawm al.kha.mīs. it.ta.ṣil bī min faḍ.lik 'in.da sa.mā.'ik hā.dhi.hi ar.ri.sā.lah fī ayy waqt ba'd as.sā.'ah al.khā.mi.sah. raq.mī ṣifr wā.ḥid ith.nayn tha.lā.thah. shuk.ran.)
(Hi, Karim. This is Salma. It's 1:30 in the afternoon on Thursday. Please give me a call back when you get this message any time after 5 o'clock. My number is 0123. Thanks!)



Leaving a message with a person
If you have to leave a message directly with a person, make sure you include your name and ask the person who picks up the phone to pass along word that you called.

Talkin' the Talk
Kamal calls his friend Rita at home. Rita isn't home, and Souad, her mom, answers the phone. Kamal leaves a message for Rita with her mother.




Souad:

.ألو
a.lū.
Hello.



Kamal:

.ألو. أنا كمال
a.lū. a.nā ka.māl.
Hello. This is Kamal.



Souad:

.أهلاً كمال
ah.lan ka.māl.
Hi, Kamal.



Kamal:

هل ريتا في البيت؟
hal rī.ta fī al.bayt?
Is Rita home?



Souad:

.لا. ذهبت إلى الدكان
lā. dha.ha.bat i.lá ad.duk.kān.
No. She went to the store.



Kamal:

متى سترجع؟
ma.tá sa.tar.ji'?
When will she be back?



Souad:

.سترجع بعد ساعة
sa.tar.ji' ba'.da sā.'ah.
She will be back in an hour.



Kamal:

هل يمكن أن تخبريها بمكالمتي؟
hal yum.kin an tukh.bi.rī.hā bi.mu.kā.la.ma.tī?
Is it possible for you to tell her that I called?



Souad:

!طبعاً
ṭa.ba.'an!
Of course!



Kamal:

.شكراً! مع السلامة
shuk.ran! ma.'a as.sa.lā.mah.
Thank you! Good-bye.



Souad:

.مع السلامة
ma.'a as.sa.lā.mah.
Good-bye.

 Most phones in Arabic-speaking countries use the familiar Arabic numerals (see Chapter 5). Thank goodness you won't have to struggle to identify the Arabic numbers on the keypad while dialing a number!



Sending and Getting Emails
Increasingly, the phone is being complemented, and in some cases even replaced, by email messaging. In this section, I show you some key terms to allow you to compose, send, and receive emails. 

إنشاء (in.sha') (compose)
البريد الوارد (al.ba.rīd al.wā.rid) (inbox)
علبة الصادر ('ul.bat aṣ.ṣā.dir) (outbox)
مسودة (mis.wad.da) (draft)
من (min) (from)
إلى (i.lá) (to)
موضوع (maw.ḍū') (subject)

These sections give you some helpful advice for sending emails in Arabic and in English to an Arabic-speaking individual. I also discuss some etiquette to ensure that you don't offend anyone.

Sending an email in Arabic
When you're sending out an email message in Arabic, you always want to start off with the basic term السلام عليكم, the most common greeting that I introduce in Chapter 1. Here are other common expressions to use: 

أشكركم على الرسالة (ash.ku.ru.kum 'a.lá ar.ri.sā.lah) (Thank you for the message)
مع أطيب التحيات (ma.'ah aṭ.yab at.ta.ḥiy.yāt) (With best regards)

If you're sending an email message to a friend or colleague, I encourage you to use these two expressions to begin and end your message to express that you know the individual.


Sending an email in English
When you're sending an email to a native Arabic-speaking person, feel free to use the same expressions that you would use in composing the email to an English-speaking person. If the individual or individuals you're sending the email understand English, then it's completely valid to use everyday English expressions. If you need to compose an email in Arabic, please see the sections immediately preceding this one.


Following proper etiquette
As a general rule, don't use any language in an Arabic email that you wouldn't use in an English email. Make sure to begin and end the message with the terms I provide earlier in this section, and keep your message to the point. Arabic culture is now getting more and more accustomed to communicating via email, and in a few years, email will be even more prevalent than it is today.
Sometimes you may want to look up terms while you're typing the email. One tool that I find helpful that provides an etiquette-friendly interface is Google Translate. If you're looking for a term or a phrase while typing your email, visit translate.google.com and click on English-to-Arabic or Arabic-to-English, depending on what your target language for the email will be.
FUN&GAMES


Here are some questions commonly asked on the phone. Match the questions with the appropriate answers.
أسئلة (as.'i.lah) (questions)

متى سترجع؟ (When will she be back?)
هل عندك وقت فراغ؟ (Do you have free time?)
هل هو هنا؟ (Is he here?)
كيف الحال؟ (How are you doing?)
ما اسمك؟ (What's your name?)

الأجوبة (al.aj.wi.bah) (answers)

.نعم. دقيقة من فضلك
.لا. أنا مشغول
.اسمي سعاد
.الحمد لله، شكراً
.سترجع بعد ساعة

The answers are in Appendix C.
 













Chapter 10
This Is Delicious! Eating In and Dining Out

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Covering breakfast, lunch, and dinner
 Finding your way around the kitchen
 Eating at home
 Dining at a restaurant

You can explore a new culture with طعام (ṭa.'ām) (food). You can find out a lot about a people by exploring what they eat, how they eat it, and how they prepare it. Like in many other cultures, food plays a central role in Arabic culture. In this chapter, you can expand your vocabulary with the Arabic words for some popular meals and foods, and you find out how to place an order at a restaurant and how to interact appropriately with your server.
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Consuming Food: All about Mealtime
The three basic وجبات (wa.ja.bāt) (meals) in Arabic are as follows: 

فطور الصباح (fu.ṭūr aṣ.ṣa.bāḥ) (breakfast)
غداء (gha.dā' ) (lunch)
عشاء ('a.shā' ) (dinner)

Sometimes when you're feeling a little جائع (jā.'i') (hungry) but aren't ready for a full-course meal, you may want a small وجبة خفيفة (waj.bah kha.fī.fah) (snack) instead. These sections take a closer look at these different meals.

Starting the day off with breakfast
I'm sure you've heard it before, but breakfast is the most important meal of the day. When you start your day on a full stomach, you feel better and accomplish more. In the mornings, I like to start my day with a cup of قهوة (qah.wah) (coffee). I usually like to drink it كحلة (kaḥ.lah) (black), but sometimes I add a little حليب (ḥa.līb) (milk) and some سكر (suk.kar) (sugar) to give it a bit of flavor. Some days, I prefer to drink شاي (shāy) (tea) instead of coffee. My favorite accompaniments for my coffee or tea are حلويات (ḥa.la.wiy.yāt) (pastries).
Here are some other things you can expect in a regular breakfast: 

عسل ('a.sal) (honey)
قهوة بالحليب (qah.wah bil.ḥa.līb) (coffee with milk)
قهوة بالسكر (qah.wah bis.suk.kar) (coffee with sugar)
قهوة بالحليب والسكر (qah.wah bil.ḥa.līb was.suk.kar) (coffee with milk and sugar)
شاي بالعسل (shāy bil.'a.sal) (tea with honey)
خبز محمر (khubz mu.ḥam.mar) (toasted bread)
خبز بالزبدة (khubz biz.zub.dah) (bread with butter)
خبز بالزبدة والعسل (khubz biz.zub.dah wal.'a.sal) (bread with butter and honey)
شفنج (shi.fanj) (donuts)
حبوب الفطور (ḥu.būb al.fu.ṭūr) (breakfast cereal)
بيض (bayḍ) (eggs)

Having الفطور في المنزل (al.fu.ṭūr fī al.man.zil) (breakfast at home) is a nice, relaxing way to start the day.

Talkin' the Talk
Fatima prepares breakfast for her daughter Nadia at home before sending her off to school.




Fatima:

هل تقيدين عصيراً هذا الصباح؟
hal tu.rī.dīn 'a.ṣī.ran hā.dhā aṣ.ṣa.bāḥ?

Nadia:

What kind of juice do you want: orange juice, apple juice, or carrot juice?



Nadia:

.أريد عصير برتقال
u.rīd 'a.ṣīr bur.tu.qāl.

Fatima:

Excellent! It's great for your health. And do you want cereal as well?



Nadia:

.نعم ومعها حليب كثير
na.'am wa.ma.'a.hā ḥā.līb ka.thīr.
Yes, and with lots of milk.



Fatima:

.وها هو الخبز بالزبدة

And here's some bread with butter.



Nadia:

.شكراً. سأذهب إلى المدرسة الآن

Thank you. I'm going to go to school now.



Fatima:

.لحظة. نسيت الموزة

If you're on the go, stopping by a قهوة (qah.wah) (coffee shop) in the صباح (ṣa.bāḥ) (morning) is a good alternative to getting your breakfast at home. (Note: The word قهوة denotes both the beverage as well as the coffee shop. Remember this distinction so that you don't get confused unnecessarily!)

Talkin' the Talk
Laura stops by the local coffee shop in the morning to order breakfast from Ahmed. 




Laura:

.صباح الخير يا أحمد
ṣa.bāḥ al.khayr yā aḥ.mad.
Good morning, Ahmed.

Having a piece of فاكهة (fā.ki.hah) (fruit) such as a برتقالة (bur.tu.qā.lah) (an orange) or تفاحة (tuf.fā.ḥah) (an apple) is a healthy addition to your meal. Because فواكه (fa.wā.kih) (fruits) play an important role in any healthy meal, here are some of the more common fruits: 

توت (tūt) (blackberry)
بطيخ (baṭ.ṭīkh) (cantaloupe)
ليمون هندي (lay.mūn hin.dī) (grapefruit)
عنب ('i.nab) (grapes)
ليمون (lay.mūn) (lemon)
ليمون مالح (lay.mūn mā.liḥ) (lime)
العنبج (al.'an.baj) (mango)
خوخ (khawkh) (peach)
إجاص (i.jāṣ) (pear)



Eating lunch
Eating your breakfast keeps you شبعان (shab.'ān) (satisfied) for a few hours — time to get some work done and remain productive. Later, though, you're bound to get جائع (jā.'i') (hungry) again. Perhaps a piece of fruit can keep you going until it's time for lunch.
 Lunch is a very important meal. In most Middle Eastern countries, workers don't sit in their cubicles and eat their lunch. Rather, most offices close and employees get two hours or more for lunch.
Unlike breakfast, the food during lunch is quite different. Here are some of the common foods you can expect during lunch: 

لحم (laḥm) (meat)
لحم البقر (laḥm al.ba.qar) (beef)
لحم الغنم (laḥm al.gha.nam) (lamb)
لحم العجل (laḥm al.'ijl) (veal)
سمك (sa.mak) (fish)
دجاج (da.jāj) (chicken)
أرز (a.ruz) (rice)

Sometimes, your lunch may consist of a simple ساندويش (sān.da.wīsh) (sandwich). Other times, you may prefer a nice, healthy سلطة (sa.la.ṭah) (salad). I'm convinced that خضر (khu.ḍar) (vegetables) make or break the salad. Here are some vegetables to help you make your salad لذيذة (la.dhī.dhah) (delicious): 

خرشوف (khar.shūf ) (artichokes)
هليون (hil.yūn) (asparagus)
أفوكادو (a.fū.kā.dū) (avocado)
قرنبيط (qar.na.bīṭ) (broccoli)
قنبيط (qun.bīṭ) (cauliflower)
ذرة (dhu.rah) (corn)
خيار (khi.yār) (cucumber)
فول ( fūl ) ( fava beans)
خس (khass) (lettuce)
فقاع (fu.qā' ) (mushrooms)
بصل (ba.ṣal) (onions)
بازلاء (bā.zil.lā' ) (peas)
بطاطا (ba.ṭā.ṭā) (potatoes)
سبانخ (sa.bā.nikh) (spinach)
طماطم (ṭa.mā.ṭim) (tomatoes)

In order to make a sandwich even more delicious, add some of the following توابل (ta.wā.bil) (condiments): 

صلصة طماطم (ṣal.sat ṭa.mā.ṭim) (ketchup)
خردل (khar.dal) (mustard)
مايونيز (mā.yū.nīz) (mayonnaise)
مخللات (mu.khal.la.lāt) (pickles)

Supping at dinner
Dinner is an important meal in the course of the day. In most Arab countries, many people usually eat dinner very late, around 9 p.m. or even 10 p.m. Because people eat more at breakfast and lunch, and due to the traditionally late hour of dinner, most people in the Arab world have light meals for dinner.
A typical dinner usually consists of some sort of سمك (sa.mak) (fish), دجاج (da.jāj) (chicken), or other kind of لحم (laḥm) (meat).



Enjoying a Meal at Home
Grabbing a quick bite on the go is often convenient if you have a busy schedule, but there's nothing like a home-cooked meal. This section covers the key terms to help you prepare and set the table for a وجبة لذيذة في المنزل (waj.bah la.dhī.dhah fī al.man.zil) (a delicious home-cooked meal)!
Here are some common items you might find in your مطبخ (maṭ.bakh) (kitchen): 

فرن (furn) (oven)
ثلاجة (thal.lā.jah) (refrigerator)
مغسلة (magh.sa.lah) (sink)
خزانات (khaz.zā.nāt) (cupboards)
ملح (malḥ) (salt)
فلفل ( ful.ful) (pepper)
زيت الزيتون (zayt az.zay.tūn) (olive oil)

When you're done الطبخ (aṭ.ṭabkh) (cooking) داخل (dā.khil) (inside) the kitchen, you're ready to step into the غرفة الطعام (ghur.fat aṭ.ṭa.'ām) (dining room) and set up the food on top of the مائدة (mā.'i.dah) (dining table). Here are some items you may find on your dining table: 

صحون (ṣu.ḥūn) (plates)
أطباق (aṭ.bāq) (dishes)
أكواب (ak.wāb) (glasses/cups)
شوك (shu.wak) (forks)
ملاعق (ma.lā.'iq) (spoons)
سكاكين (sa.kā.kīn) (knives)
مناديل (ma.nā.dīl) (napkins)



Dining Out
Going to a nice مطعم (maṭ.'am) (restaurant) is one of my favorite things to do. I enjoy interacting with the نادل (nā.dil) (waiter) and the نادلة (nā.di.lah) (waitress), and I like taking my time picking and choosing from the قائمة الطعام (qā.'i.mat aṭ.ṭa.'ām) (menu). In this section, you find out how to make your trip to the restaurant as enjoyable as possible, from interacting with the waiter to displaying proper dining etiquette and choosing the best food from the menu.
 The dining experience in most restaurants in the Middle East, as well as in Middle Eastern restaurants all over the world, is truly an enchanting and magical experience. The décor is usually very ornate and sumptuous, with oriental patterns and vivid colors adorning the rooms. The waitstaff usually wears traditional جلابة (jal.lā.bah), which are long, flowing garments that are pleasing to the eye, and the food is very exotic, spicy, and delicious. When you go to a Middle Eastern restaurant, allow at least a couple of hours for the dining experience — don't be surprised if you end up savoring a five- or even seven-course meal!

Perusing the menu
As in other restaurants, the menu in Middle Eastern restaurants is usually divided into three sections: 

مقبلات (mu.qab.bi.lāt) (appetizers)
طبق رئيسي (ṭa.baq ra.'ī.sī) (main dish/entrees)
تحلية (taḥ.li.yah) (dessert)


Appetizers
In the appetizers section of the menu, you find some طعام خفيف (ṭa.'ām.kha.fīf ) (light food) to help build your appetite. Here are some common appetizers: 

باذنجان (bā.dhin.jān) (eggplant)
ثوم محمر (thawm mu.ḥam.mar) (roasted garlic)
ورق عنب (wa.raq 'i.nab) (stuffed grape leaves)
عدس ('a.das) (lentils)
حريرة (ḥa.rī.ra) (Moroccan soup)
روبيان (rub.yān) (shrimp)
حساء (ḥi.sā') (soup)
كماة (ka.māh) (truffles)



Entrees
The main dishes or entrees section of a menu consists of dishes featuring chicken, various other لحم (laḥm) (meat), and fish. Fish is usually a very popular dish because it's tasty, healthy, and light. Most restaurants have a pretty extensive selection of fish, including: 

شبوط (shab.būṭ) (carp)
القد (al.qud) (cod)
اسقمري (is.qam.rī) (mackerel)
سلمون (sa.la.mūn) (salmon)
قرش (qirsh) (shark)
موسى (mū.sá) (sole)
العطروط (al.'aṭ.rūṭ) (trout)
تون (tūn) (tuna)



Desserts
Like a lot of people, my favorite part of a restaurant menu is, of course, the dessert section. The تحلية (taḥ.li.yah) (dessert) is a great way to wrap up a nice meal. I like dessert because there are a lot of حلويات (ḥa.la.wiy.yāt) (sweets) to choose from. Here are some popular desserts: 

كعك (ka'k) (cake)
كعك الشكلاطة (ka'k ash.shu.ku.lā.ṭah) (chocolate cake)
مثلجات (mu.tha.la.jāt) (ice cream)
جبن (jubn) (cheese)



Beverages
You may also notice a portion of the menu — or an entirely different menu — introducing different kinds of مشروبات (mash.rū.bāt) (drinks). The following are some beverages you may come across on the menu: 

ماء (mā') (water)
ماء غازي (mā' ghā.zī) (sparkling water)
عصير ليمون ('a.ṣīr lay.mūn) (lemonade)
نبيذ (khamr) (wine)
بيرة (bī.rah) (beer)
نبيذ (na.bīdh) (wine)
نبيذ أحمر (na.bīdh aḥ.mar) (red wine)
نبيذ ابيض (na.bīdh ab.yaḍ) (white wine)




Placing your order
After you peruse the menu, place your order with the waiter or waitress. Restaurant staff are usually highly trained individuals who know the ins and outs of the food that the restaurant serves, so don't be afraid of asking lots of أسئلة (as.'i.lah) (questions) about things on the menu that sound good to you.

Talkin' the Talk
Sam and Atika go to Restaurant Atlas for a romantic dinner for two. They place their drink orders with their waitress. 




Waitress:

Finishing your meal and paying the bill
When you finish your meal, you're ready to leave, but before you do, you need to take care of your حساب (ḥi.sāb) (bill). You may ask your waiter for the bill by saying الحساب من فضلك (al.ḥi.sāb min faḍ.lik) (the bill, please). Another option is to ask the server كم الكامل؟ (kam al.kā.mil) (What's the total?).
Like in the United States, tipping your server is customary in Arabic-speaking countries and Middle Eastern restaurants. The amount of the بقشيش (baq.shīsh) (tip) depends on the kind of service you received, but usually 15 percent to 20 percent is average.
FUN&GAMES


You need to go to the grocery store and get the following items. Write the Arabic words for the following five foods.

Chapter 11
Going Shopping

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Browsing inside the store
 Comparing items and costs
 Identifying clothing sizes and colors

Whether you're in a foreign country or at the local mall, shopping can be a lot of fun. Not only do you get to buy things to maintain your lifestyle, but you also can discover new items, purchase gifts, and buy things you hadn't even considered.
This chapter exposes you to the important words and terms that help you shop. Discover how to choose the right dress size, how to choose the best item from an electronics store, and even how to shop for nice jewelry. You also find out how to interact with sales staff so that you're sure to find and purchase the item that you want.
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Going to the Store
When you want to buy something, you head to the محل (ma.ḥal) (store). Depending on your shopping list, you can choose from different types of محلات (ma.ḥal.lāt) (stores). If you want to buy some خبز (khubz) (bread), then you want to head to the مخبز (makh.baz) (bakery). If you're trying to find a particular كتاب (ki.tāb) (book), then your destination is the مكتبة (mak.ta.bah) (bookstore/library). To buy ملابس (ma.lā.bis) (clothes), head to the محل ملابس (ma.ḥal ma.lā.bis) (clothing store). And if you want to buy a راديو (rād.yū) (radio) or تلفزيون (ti.li.fiz.yūn) (television), the محل إلكترونيات (ma.ḥal i.lik.trū.niy.yāt) (electronics store) is your best bet.
Here are some additional specialty stores you may need to visit: 

محل حلويات (ma.ḥal ḥa.la.wiy.yāt) (pastry shop)
محل سمك (ma.hal sa.mak) (fish store)
جواهري (ja.wā.hi.rī) (jeweler)

Not all stores sell only goods or products. Other types of stores provide services, such as haircuts and manicures. Here are some stores that are more service-oriented: 

وكالة أسفار (wi.kā.lat as.fār) (travel agency)
حلاق (ḥal.lāq) (barber)

If you need to shop for a variety of goods, then your destination is the مركز تسوق (mar.kaz. ta.saw.wuq) (mall). At the mall, you can find almost everything and anything you want. Or if you're not sure what to buy, going to the mall is a great idea because you have so many choices that you're bound to find something that you need or want to purchase.

Browsing the merchandise
If you're at the store and aren't quite sure what to purchase, then browsing and checking out the different items is a good idea. You don't have to buy anything, and that's what can be so much fun about window shopping. Feel free to look through a واجهة المحل (wā.ji.hat al.ma.ḥal) (store window) for any items that may attract your attention. While you're browsing, a بائع (bā.'i') (store clerk) (M) or a بائعة (bā.'i.'ah) (store clerk) (F) may ask: 

هل يمكن أن أساعدك؟ (hal yum.kin an u.sā.'i.dak?) (May I help you?) (M)
هل يمكن أن أساعدك؟ (hal yum.kin an u.sā.'i.dik?) (May I help you?) (F)
هل تريد شيئاً معيناً؟ (hal tu.rīd shay.'an mu.'ay.ya.nan?) (Are you looking for anything special?) (M)
هل تريدين شيئاً معيناً؟ (hal tu.rī.dīn shay.'an mu.'ay.ya.nan?) (Are you looking for anything special?) (F)

If you need مساعدة (mu.sā.'a.dah) (help/assistance), simply respond by saying نعم (na.'am) (yes). (For more on how to ask for and get help, skip to the section "Asking for a Particular Item," later in this chapter.) Otherwise, if you want to continue browsing, لا شكراً (lā shuk.ran) (no, thank you) should do the trick.


Getting around the store
If you visit a mall, you probably need some sort of help because department stores can be very big and very confusing. If you want اتجاهات (it.ti.jā.hāt) (directions), head to the مكتب المعلومات (mak.tab al.ma'.lū.māt) (information desk) to have your أسئلة (as.'i.lah) (questions) answered. Here are some common questions you may ask: 

هل يمكن أن تساعدني؟ (hal yum.kin an tu.sā.'i.da.nī?) (Is it possible for you to help me?)
أين الطابق الأول؟ (ay.na aṭ.ṭā.biq al.'aw.wal?) (Where is the first floor?)
أين المصعد؟ (ay.na al.miṣ.'ad?) (Where is the elevator?)
أين قسم الملابس؟ (ay.na qism al.ma.lā.bis?) (Where is the section for clothes?)
في أي طابق يوجد الجواهري؟ (fī ayy ṭa.biq yū.jad al.ja.wā.hi.rī?) (On which floor is the jeweler located?)
هل هناك مخبز في مركز التسوق؟ (hal hu.nā.ka makh.baz fi mar.kaz at.ta.saw.wuq?) (Is there a bakery in the mall?)


Talkin' the Talk

Getting to know the verb "to search"
 Shopping usually involves searching for particular items. In order to help with your بحث (baḥth) (search), you should be familiar with the verbs بحث (ba.ḥa.tha) (searched) and يبحث (yab.ḥath) (searching). Luckily, search is a regular verb, meaning that it has three consonants and is conjugated in the ماضي (mā.ḍī) (past) tense and مضارع (mu.ḍā.ri') (present) tense using the same patterns of prefixes and suffixes as most other regular verbs.
Here's the verb "to search" in the past tense:

Asking for a Particular Item
Oftentimes, you head to the store not to window shop or browse, but because you have a specific item in mind that you want to purchase. When you want to direct a clerk to a particular item, you're likely to need a demonstrative word, such as "that one" or "this" or "those over there." Demonstratives are the little words used to specify particular items. Arabic has a number of different demonstratives, depending on the number of items (singular or plural) and gender (in case of human nouns), as well as state (present or absent). Table 11-1 presents the common demonstratives in Arabic.


TABLE 11-1 Arabic Demonstratives





Arabic

Pronunciation

English





هذا

hā.dhā

this (MS)



هذه

hā.dhi.hi

this (FS)



ذلك

dhā.li.ka

that (MS)



تلك

til.ka

that (FS)



هؤلاء

hā.'u.lā.'i

these (gender neutral)



اولائك

u.lā.'i.ka

those (gender neutral)




Notice that the singular demonstratives (هذا, هذه, ذلك, تلك) are all gender-defined, meaning that you use a specific demonstrative corresponding to whether the object being referred to is masculine or feminine. On the other hand, the plural demonstratives, هؤلاء and أولئك, are gender-neutral, meaning that the gender of the object being pointed to doesn't matter.
 In a sentence, you always place the demonstrative word before the object being pointed to, which is often a noun. In addition, you must define the noun using the definite prefix pronoun al-. Here are some examples to illustrate the use of the definite prefix pronoun: 

هذا الولد (hā.dhā al.wa.lad) (this boy)
هذه البنت (hā.dhi.hi al.bint) (this girl)
ذلك الرجل (dhā.li.ka ar.ra.jul) (that man)
تلك امرأة (til.ka al.mar.'ah) (that woman)
هؤلاء البنات (ḥa.'u.lā.'i al.ba.nāt) (these girls)
أولئك النساء (u.lā.'i.ka an.ni.sā') (those women)

 It's important to not only follow the specific order of the demonstrative phrase (demonstrative word followed by the noun), but also to make sure you define the noun. If the noun isn't defined with the definite article prefix al-, the meaning of the demonstrative phrase changes dramatically. Arabic has no verb "to be" in the present tense, but because every language requires "is/are" sentences to function appropriately, you create "is/are" sentences in Arabic by manipulating these little definite articles. If you include a demonstrative followed by an undefined noun, you create a demonstrative "is/are" sentence. Using the examples from the earlier list, look at what happens to the demonstrative phrase when the definite article isn't included: 

.هذا ولد (hā.dhā wa.lad.) (This is a boy.)
.هذه بنت (hā.dhi.hi bint.) (This is a girl.)
.ذلك رجل (dhā.li.ka ra.jul.) (That is a man.)
.تلك مرأة (til.ka mar.'ah.) (That is a woman.)
.هؤلاء بنات (ḥā.'u.lā.'i ba.nāt.) (These are girls.)
.أولئك نساء (u.lā.'i.ka ni.sā'.) (Those are women.)

As you can see by comparing these two lists, one small prefix can radically alter the meaning of a sentence.

Talkin' the Talk

Comparing Merchandise
Have you ever been shopping and found yourself debating between two or more comparable items? Perhaps you have a general idea of what you want to buy — a television, for instance — but you aren't sure what year, make, or model you want. In these instances, being able to compare merchandise is important. In this section, you discover how to evaluate comparable (and incomparable) items based on a variety of important criteria, such as price, quality, and durability.
In order to be able to compare different items, you need to have an understanding of degrees of adjectives and superlatives. In English, degrees of adjectives have straightforward applicability. For example, in order to say that something is bigger than another thing, you simply add the suffix -er to the adjective; hence, "big" becomes "bigger." Furthermore, when you're comparing two or more items, you use comparatives, meaning you use both the degree of adjectives followed by the preposition "than." For instance, "the truck is bigger than the car." To say that something is the biggest, you only need to add the suffix -est to the adjective; so "big" becomes "biggest," as in "it's the biggest car." This form is called a superlative.
Fortunately, the structures of degrees of adjectives, comparatives, and superlatives in Arabic are fairly similar to those in English.

Comparing two or more items
Adjectives are the linguistic backbone that allow for comparisons between different items, products, or goods. Table 11-2 lists some of the most common adjectives followed by their comparative forms.

Place these adjectives in their appropriate context in the phrase or sentence — using these adjectives independently changes their meanings. Similar to the English language structure, the comparative form of adjectives always follows this pattern: 
noun + adjective comparative form + preposition من (min) (than) + second adjective
 It's essential that you include the preposition من right after every comparative adjective. In addition, all nouns being compared need to be defined by attaching to them the definite article prefix ال.
Here are some common examples of comparative sentences using the adjective forms: 

.البنت أكبر من الولد (al.bint ak.bar min al.wa.lad.) (The girl is bigger than the boy.)
.التلفزيون أغلى من المذياع (at.ti.li.fiz.yūn agh.lá min al.midh.yā'.) (The television is more expensive than the radio.)
. السيارة أسرع من الشاحنة (as.say.yā.rah as.ra' min ash.shā.ḥi.nah.) (The car is faster than the truck.)

When forming these types of sentences, you may add demonstratives to be even more specific. Here are examples of comparative sentences used in conjunction with demonstratives: 

. هذه البنت أكبر من ذلك الولد (hā.dhi.hi al.bint ak.bar min dhā.li.ka al.wa.lad.) (This girl is bigger than that boy.)
.هذه السيارات أسرع من تلك الحافلات (hā.dhi.hi as.say.yā.rāt as.ra' min til.ka al.ḥā.fi.lāt.) (These cars are faster than those buses.)
.تلك امرأة أجمل من ذلك الرجل (til.ka al.mar.'ah aj.mal min dhā.li.ka ar.ra.jul.) (That woman is prettier than that man.)
.هذا الولد أكبر من هؤلاء البنات (hā.dhā al.wa.lad ak.bar min hā.'u.lā.'i al.ba.nāt) (This boy is bigger than those girls.)

 Notice in the examples that the adjective comparative form remains constant whether the nouns being compared are a combination of singular/singular, singular/plural, or plural/plural. In other words, the adjective comparatives are gender-neutral: They remain the same regardless of both gender and number.


Picking out the best item
A superlative describes something that is of the highest order, degree, or quality. Some common superlatives in English are "best," "brightest," "fastest," "cleanest," "cheapest," and so on. Superlatives in Arabic are actually very straightforward and shouldn't be hard for you to understand if you have a good grasp of comparatives (see the preceding section).
Basically, a superlative in Arabic is nothing more than the comparative form of the adjective! The only difference is that comparatives include the preposition من (than) and superlatives don't include any preposition. For example, to tell someone, "This is the biggest house," you say هذا أكبر منزل (hā.dhā ak.bar man.zil).
 The biggest differences between superlatives and comparatives are 

The superlative adjective always comes before the noun, unless the adjective is definite.
When expressing a superlative, the noun is always indefinite.

Here are some common examples of superlative sentences: 

.هذه أجمل بنت (hā.dhi.hi aj.mal bint) (This is the prettiest girl.)
.ذلك أبعد دكان (dhā.li.ka ab.'ad duk.kān) (That is the farthest store.)

If you switch the order of the words to demonstrative + noun + superlative, be sure to define the noun. That's the only other way you can construct a superlative sentence. For example: 

.هذه البنت الأجمل (hā.dhi.hi al.bint al.aj.mal) (This girl is the prettiest.)
.ذلك الدكان الأبعد (dhā.li.ka ad.duk.kān al.ab.'ad) (That store is the farthest.)

More than a Few Words about Buying and Selling
 Perhaps the two most important verbs relating to shopping are يشتري (yash.ta.rī) (to buy) and يبيع (ya.bī') (to sell). Unlike other verbs in Arabic, these two critical verbs are irregular, which means they don't follow a particular pattern. Because these verbs are widely used and have their own patterns, you should be familiar with how to conjugate them.
Use the form باع (bā.'a) (sold) to conjugate "to sell" in the past tense:

Shopping for Clothes
For many people, one of the most essential items to shop for is ملابس (ma.lā.bis) (clothes). Whether you're in a foreign country or shopping at the local mall, chances are that clothes make it on your shopping list. Table 11-3 lists some basic articles of clothing and accessories you should know.

An important consideration when you're out shopping for clothing is مقاس (ma.qās) (size). The four standard clothes sizes are 

صغير (ṣa.ghīr) (small) (American size [Men's]: 34-36; American size [Women's]: 6-8)
وسط (wa.saṭ) (medium) (American size [Men's]: 38-40; American size [Women's]: 10-12)
كبير (ka.bīr) (large) (American size [Men's]: 42-44; American size [Women's]: 14-16)
كبير جداً (ka.bīr jid.dan) (extra large) (American size [Men's]: 46 and above; American size [Women's]: 18-20)

Another important consideration in clothes shopping is the لون (lawn) (color). Because ألوان (al.wān) (colors) are adjectives that describe nouns, a color always must agree with the noun in terms of gender. If you're describing a feminine noun, use the feminine form. When describing masculine nouns, use the masculine forms. How do you know whether a noun is feminine or masculine? In about 80 percent of the cases, feminine nouns end with a تاء مربوطة or the "ah" sound. For the rest, simply look up the word in the قاموس (qā.mūs) (dictionary) to determine its gender. The masculine and feminine forms of some common colors appear in Table 11-4.

 Keeping track of the time
 Experiencing the culture of a museum

 Touring religious sites

Part of the fun of mastering a new language is putting your growing language skills to good use; one of the best ways to do that is by exploring a مدينة (ma.dī.nah) (city). Whether you're visiting a city in your home country or traveling in a Middle Eastern city, this chapter introduces you to key words, phrases, and concepts to help you navigate any city — from entertainment spots to cultural venues — like a native Arabic speaker!
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Telling Time in Arabic
When you're exploring a city, you're guaranteed to have a difficult time catching buses to get around or buying tickets for specific events if you can't ask or tell the time. And telling وقت (waqt) (time) in Arabic is an entirely different proposition than telling time in English. In fact, you have to accept a fundamental difference right off the bat: Arabic doesn't use an a.m./p.m. convention to denote the time of day, nor does it use the 24-hour military clock (according to which, for example, 10 p.m. is written as 22:00). So how do you know which part of the day it is if you can't use the 24-hour system or the a.m./p.m. convention? It's actually very simple: You specify the time of day! So you say, for example, "It's ten o'clock in the morning," or "It's ten o'clock at night." Easy enough, don't you think? (For more on this issue, see the section "Specifying the time of day" later in this chapter.)
If you want to ask someone for the time, you ask the following question: كم الساعة؟ (kam as.sā.'ah) (What time is it?). If someone asks you this question, the appropriate response is الساعة (as.sā.'ah) (the time is) followed by the ordinal of the hour. So you would say, for instance, "It's the second hour" as opposed to saying "It's two o'clock." Because الساعة is a feminine noun, you use the feminine form of the ordinal numbers, which are listed in Table 12-1. (See Chapter 5 for more on numbers.)

 You need to use the definite prefix article al- with the ordinals because you're referring to a specific hour and not just any hour.
The following are some additional key words related to telling time in Arabic: 

ساعة (sā.'ah) (hour)
دقيقة (da.qī.qah) (minute)
ثانية (thā.nī.yah) (second)
بعد (ba'.da) (after)
قبل (qab.la) (before)
اليوم (al.yawm) (today)
الغد (al.ghad) (tomorrow)
البارحة (al.bā.ri.ḥah) (yesterday)
بعد غد (ba'.da ghad) (the day after tomorrow)
أول أمس (aw.wal ams) (the day before yesterday)


Specifying the time of day
Because Arabic uses neither the a.m./p.m. system nor the 24-hour military clock, when giving the time, you need to specify the time of day by actually saying what part of the day it is.
Here are the different times of day you're likely to use: 

الصباح (aṣ.ṣa.bāḥ) (morning, or sunrise to 11:59 a.m.)
الظهر (aẓ.ẓuhr) (noon, or 12 p.m.)
بعد الظهر (ba'.da aẓ.ẓuhr) (afternoon, or 12:01 p.m. to 4 p.m.)
العصر (al.'aṣr) (late afternoon, or 4:01 p.m. to sunset)
المساء (al.ma.sā') (evening, or sunset to two hours after sunset)
الليل (al.layl) (night, or sunset to two hours to sunrise)

For example, if the time is 2 p.m., then you attach بعد الظهر (ba'.da aẓ.ẓuhr) (after noon) to the proper ordinal. If sunset is at 6 p.m. and you want to say the time's 7 p.m., then you use المساء (al.ma.sā') (evening) and the ordinal because المساء applies to the two-hour period right after sunset; if sunset is at 6 p.m. and you want to say the time's 9 p.m., then you use الليل (al.layl) (night) and the ordinal because 9 p.m. falls outside the scope of the evening convention (see the preceding list).
The convention used to specify the part of the day is fairly straightforward: 
الساعة (as.sā.'ah) (the time) + ordinal number + في (fī) (in) + part of the day
So when someone asks you كم الساعة (kam as.sā.'ah) (what's the time), your literal reply in Arabic is "It's the ninth hour in the morning," for instance. The following are some examples to better illustrate responses to this question: 

.الساعة الواحدة بعد الظهر (as.sā.'ah al.wā.ḥi.dah ba'.da aẓ.ẓuhr) (It's one o'clock in the afternoon.)
.الساعة الخامسة عصراً (as.sā.'ah al.khā.mi.sah 'aṣ.ran) (It's five o'clock in the late afternoon.)
.الساعة الحادية عشرة صباحاً (as.sā.'ah al.ḥā.di.yat 'ash.rah ṣa.bā.ḥan) (It's eleven o'clock in the morning.)
.الساعة التاسعة ليلاً (as.sā.'ah at.tā.si.'ah lay.lan) (It's nine o'clock in [at] night.)
.الساعة الساعبة مساءً (as.sā.'ah as.sā.bi.'ah ma.sā.'an) (It's seven o'clock in the evening.)



Specifying minutes
When telling time in Arabic, you can specify minutes in two different ways: 

Noting the fractions of the hour, such as a half, a quarter, and a third
Actually spelling out the minutes

Because these methods have different conventions, this section examines each method separately.

Using fractions of the hour
When using the fraction method of telling minutes, use the following structure: 
الساعة (as.sā.'ah) (the time) + ordinal number + و (wa) (and) + fraction
So what you're in fact saying is "It's the second hour and a half," for example. In English transliteration, that's the equivalent of "It's half past two."
The main fractions you use are 

النصف (an.niṣf) (half)
الثلث (ath.thulth) (third)
الربع (ar.rub') (quarter)

The following examples show you how to use the fraction method to specify minutes when telling time: 

.الساعة الثانية والربع (as.sā.'ah ath.thā.ni.yah war.rub') (It's a quarter past two.)
.الساعة التاسعة والنصف (as.sā.'ah at.tā.si.'ah wan.niṣf) (It's half past nine.)
.الساعة الواحدة والثلث (as.sā.'ah al.wā.ḥi.dah wath.thulth) (It's twenty past one.)
.الساعة الخامسة والربع (as.sā.'ah al.khā.mi.sah war.rub') (It's quarter past five.)
.الساعة الحادية عشرة والنصف (as.sā.'ah al.ḥā.di.yat 'ash.rah wan.niṣf) (It's half past eleven.)

Using this system, you can cover ten past the hour, quarter past the hour, twenty past the hour, and half past the hour, which are the major fractions. But what if you want to say, "It's a quarter to ..." or "It's twenty till ..."? In those cases, you need to use the preposition إلا (i.lā), which means "to" or "till." If you think of the preposition wa as adding to the hour, then think of i.lā as subtracting from the hour.
 Because إلا subtracts from the hour, you must add one hour to whatever hour you're referring to. For example, if you want to say "It's 5:45," then you must say "It's quarter to six" and not "It's a quarter to five," which would be 4:45. Here are some examples that use إلا: 

.الساعة السادسة إلا ربع (as.sā.'ah as.sā.di.sah il.lā rub'.) (It's a quarter to six, or 5:45.)
.الساعة الواحدة إلا ثلث (as.sā.'ah al.wā.ḥi.dah il.lā thulth.) (It's twenty to one, or 12:40.)

If you want to express minutes as a fraction and specify which time of day (a.m. or p.m.), you simply add في (fī) (in) and the time of day. For example 
.الساعة الواحدة والنصف بعد الظهر (as.sā.'ah al.wā.ḥi.dah wan.niṣf ba'.da aẓ.ẓuhr.) (It's 1:30 in the afternoon.)
Here are other examples: 

.الساعة الثانية عشرة وربع ليلاً (as.sā.'ah ath.thā.ni.yat 'ash.rah war.rub' lay.lan.) (It's 12:15 at night, or 12:15 a.m.)
.الساعة السابعة والنصف مساءً (as.sā.'ah as.sā.bi.'ah wan.niṣf ma.sā.'an.) (It's 7:30 in the evening.)
.الساعة الثامنة والربع صباحاً (as.sā.'ah ath.thā.mi.nah war.rub' ṣa.bā.ḥan.) (It's 8:15 in the morning.)
.الساعة الخامسة إلا ربع عصراً (as.sā.'ah al.khā.mi.sah il.lā rub' 'aṣ.ran.) (It's quarter to five in the late afternoon, or 4:45 p.m.)

Spelling out minutes
When expressing time, you can specify the minutes by actually spelling them out. (Check out Chapter 5 for full coverage of cardinal numbers.) Use the following format: 
الساعة (as.sā.'ah) (the time) + ordinal/hours + و (wa) (and) + cardinal/minutes + دقيقة (da.qī.qah) (minutes)
So الساعة الخامسة وخمس دقائق (as.sā.'ah al.khā.mi.sah wa.khams da.qā.'iq.) means "It's 5:05." Here are some other examples: 

.الساعة الواحدة وعشرون دقيقة (as.sā.'ah al.wā.ḥi.dah wa.'ish.rūn da.qī.qah.) (It's 1:20.)
.الساعة الرابعة وثلاثون دقيقة (as.sā.'ah ar.rā.bi.'ah wa.tha.lā.thūn da.qī.qah 'aṣ.ran.) (It's 4:30 in the afternoon.)
.الساعة الثامنة وأربعون دقيقة صباحاً (as.sā.'ah ath.thā.mi.nah wa.'ar.ba.'ūn da.qī.qah ṣa.bā.ḥan.) (It's 8:45 in the morning.)

Visiting Museums
I love museums because I can learn so much about virtually any topic, from irrigation systems during the Roman Empire to the brush techniques of the Impressionist artists. The متحف (mat.ḥaf) (museum) plays a central role in the Arab city; Arab people have a deep sense of history and their role in it, and one way to preserve some of that history, in the form of great Arab and Islamic works of art and achievements, is in the museum.
 Here are some Middle Eastern museums worth visiting, in both the United States and the Middle East: 

The Dahesh Museum in New York, New York
The Arab-American Museum in Dearborn, Michigan
Baghdad Museum in Baghdad, Iraq


ARABIC SCHOLARS AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION
Many of the works of the ancient Greek masters, such as Aristotle and Plato, were preserved by Islamic scholars when Europe was plunged into the Dark Ages (from about the fifth through the tenth centuries). Islamic scholars throughout the Muslim world in Cordoba, Spain, and elsewhere translated gargantuan amounts of texts from Greek and Latin into Arabic. They extensively studied these texts and added a significant amount to the pool of knowledge. Thanks to the work of these Islamic scholars, much of the knowledge that serves as the basis of Western thought and civilization was preserved. In fact, while Europe was in the Dark Ages, Islam went through a revival and renaissance period not experienced anywhere else in the world.
A زيارة (zi.yā.rah) (visit) to a museum can be a wonderful experience as long as you follow a number of قواعد (qa.wā.'id) (rules). These rules ensure that your experience and the experiences of others at the museum are جميلة (ja.mī.lah) (pleasant).
The word ممنوع (mam.nū') means "prohibited," and the word ضروري (ḍa.rū.rī) means "required"; whenever you see the word ممنوع on a sign, it's usually accompanied by a picture of the item that's prohibited with a red line across it. Make sure to pay attention so that you don't get into trouble with the museum management!
When visiting a museum, you may see signs that say the following: 

.ممنوع التصوير (mam.nū' at.taṣ.wīr.) (Taking pictures is prohibited.)
.ممنوع الدخول (mam.nū' ad.du.khūl.) (Do Not Enter.)
.ممنوع التدخين (mam.nū' at.tad.khīn.) (Smoking is prohibited.)
.ممنوع الأكل (mam.nū' al.'akl.) (Food is prohibited.)

 Although most verbs in Arabic have three consonants — such as كتب (ka.ta.ba) (to write), جلس (ja.la.sa) (to sit), or درس (da.ra.sa) (to study) — زار (zā.ra), the verb form for "to visit," contains only two consonants. This difference makes زار an irregular verb.
If you want to visit a lot of different places around the مدينة (ma.dī.nah) (city), being able to conjugate the irregular verb زار in both the past and present tenses is particularly helpful. Because "to visit" is irregular, there's no specific form — like the one available for regular verbs in Chapter 2 — where a pattern is apparent.
For the past tense form of visited, use زار:

Going to the Movies
Going to see a فيلم (film) (movie) in a قاعة سينما (qa.'at si.ni.mā) (movie theater) is a very popular pastime for people in the Middle East. American action movies are a particularly favorite genre — don't be surprised if you walk into a movie theater in a Middle Eastern city and see Tom Cruise on the big screen! Most of the movies shown in these movie theaters are actually the original versions with ترجمة (tar.ja.mah) (subtitles) at the bottom of the screen. Here are some other popular movie genres: 

مغامرة (mu.ghā.ma.rah) (action/adventure)
كوميديا (kū.mīd.yā) (comedy)
دراما (drā.mā) (drama)
رعاة البقر (ru.'āt al.ba.qar) (western)
وثائقي (wa.thā.'i.qī) (documentary)
الرسوم المتحركة (ar.ru.sūm al.mu.ta.ḥar.ri.kah) (cartoon)

The verb most commonly associated with going to the movies is ذهب (dha.ha.ba) (to go). Using the conjugations that follow, you can say ذهبت إلى قاعة السينما (dha.hab.tu i.lá qā.'at as.si.ni.mā) (I went to the movie theater), or يذهب إلى قاعة السينما (yadh.hab i.lá qā.'at as.si.ni.mā) (He is going to the movies) and much more.

Touring Religious Sites
If you ever get a chance to go to the Middle East, I suggest you visit some of the beautiful religious sites that are spread across the land. If you're in a Middle Eastern or Arab city, be sure to check out a مسجد (mas.jid) (mosque). The largest مساجد (ma.sā.jid) (mosques) in the Muslim world are located in Mecca and Medina, Saudi Arabia, and in Casablanca, Morocco.

A few rules to keep in mind
When visiting a mosque, you must follow certain قواعد (qa.wā.'id) (rules): 

If you're Muslim, you're allowed to walk into any mosque you like; but before entering, you must remove your shoes and say the شهادة (sha.hā.dah) (religious prayer): لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله (lā i.lā.ha il.lā al.lāh mu.ḥam.ma.dan ra.sū.lu al.lāh) (There is no god but God and Muhammad is his Prophet.).
If you're non-Muslim, entry into a mosque is generally forbidden, especially during prayer time, whether you're in the Middle East, the United States, or anywhere else around the world. However, certain mosques, such as the mas.jid Hassan II (مسجد الحسن الثاني) in Casablanca, have designated wings that are open to both Muslims and non-Muslims. These wings are set aside more as exhibition rooms than as religious or prayer rooms, so you're allowed to enter them, but you still must remove your حذاء (ḥi.dhā') (shoes).

 The word mas.jid comes from the verb سجد (sa.ja.da), which means "to prostrate" or "to kneel." Another word for "mosque" is جامع (jā.mi'), which comes from the word جماعة (ja.mā.'ah) (a gathering). So the Arabic words for "mosque" are related to what one actually does in the mosque, which is to gather in a religious setting and pray.


The Hajj
One of the most popular events during the year for Muslims is the حج (ḥajj), which is the pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The Hajj, which generally lasts for five days, takes place once a year, and is actually one of the five pillars of Islam. Technically, attending the Hajj is mandatory for Muslims, but because the pilgrimage can be expensive, it's widely accepted that one can be a Muslim without actually having to attend the Hajj.
During the Hajj, حجاج (ḥuj.jāj) (pilgrims) must follow a number of rules. As soon as the pilgrims arrive in Mecca, they must shed all their worldly clothing and possessions and change into sandals and a simple إحرام (iḥ.rām), which basically consists of a white cloth wrapped around the body. Other than these two items, they aren't allowed to wear any watches, jewelry, or any other types of clothes. The logic behind wearing only the إحرام is that every pilgrim is equal before God, and because no difference exists between a king and a beggar during the Hajj, everyone must wear the same thing.
After they don the إحرام, the pilgrims begin a ritual known as the طواف (ṭa.wāf) (to turn), in which they walk around the كعبة (ka'.bah), a cubelike structure located in the middle of the المسجد الحرام (al.mas.jid al.ḥa.rām) (The Sacred Mosque of Mecca). According to the Quran and other religious texts, the Prophet Abraham built the كعبة for the purpose of worship. The pilgrims must circle the كعبة seven times in a counterclockwise manner. After completing the turns, the pilgrims walk to the hills of Safa and Marwah before walking to Medina, the city where the Prophet Muhammad is buried. From Medina they walk to the hill of Arafat, then to the tent city of Mina before returning to the holy site for a final pilgrimage.
Because the Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, a few million people make the journey to Saudi Arabia to participate in this pilgrimage every year, making it by far the largest religious pilgrimage in the world. In fact, it's not uncommon to have at least 5 million pilgrims in the city of Mecca during the Hajj. Once a Muslim has performed the Hajj, he or she receives a special status in society, complete with a title: A man who has completed the Hajj is called الحاج (al.ḥāj), and a woman who has done the Hajj is called al-Hajja الحاجة (al.ḥāj.jah).
 Saudi Arabian law prohibits non-Muslims from entering Mecca. If you're non-Muslim, you may be able to visit Saudi Arabia during this period, but you won't be permitted to visit the كعبة and some of the other religious sites related to the Hajj.

Enjoying Yourself: Recreation, Music, and the Outdoors

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Getting active

 Exploring the beach
 Playing musical instruments
 Chatting about hobbies

Language teachers may not want you to hear this, but if you want to practice a new language, move outside the classroom. Doing things you enjoy, such as playing sports, creating music, or playing card games, is one of the best ways to immerse yourself in your chosen language. In this chapter, I introduce new words and phrases to help you have fun in Arabic.
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Starting Out with the Doing Verb
One of the most frequently used verbs in the Arabic language is فعل (fa.'a.la) (did). In the ماضي (mā.ḍī) (past tense), use the فعل form; for the مضارع (mu.ḍā.ri') (present tense), use يفعل (yaf.'a.lu) (to do/doing). Use فعل to describe activities or رياضة (ri.yā.ḍah) (sport) you're taking part in.
Here's فعل conjugated in the past tense: 





Form

Pronunciation

English





أنا فعلتُ

a.nā fa.'al.tu

I did



أنتَ فعلتَ

an.ta fa.'al.ta

You did (MS)



أنتِ فعلتِ

an.ti fa.'al.ti

You did (FS)



هو فعل

hu.wa fa.'a.la

He did



هي فعلتْ

hi.ya fa.'a.lat

She did



نحن فعلنا

naḥ.nu fa.'al.nā

We did



أنتم فعلتم

an.tum fa.'al.tum

You did (MP)



أنتنّ فعلتنّ

an.tun.na fa.'al.tun.na

You did (FP)



هم فعلوا

hum fa.'al.lū

They did (MP)



هنّ فعلنّ

hun.na fa.'al.nā

They did (FP)



أنتما فعلتما

an.tu.mā fa.'al.tu.mā

You did (dual/ M/F)



هما فعلا

hu.mā fa.'a.lā

They did (dual/M)



هما فعلتا

hu.ma fa.'a.la.tā

They did (dual/F)




Here are a few examples of فعل in action: 

.الولد ذهب إلى المكتبة وعمل واجبه (al.wa.lad dha.ha.ba. i.lá al.mak.ta.bah wa.'a.mi.la. wā.ji.ba.hu.) (The boy went to the library and did his homework.)
.انجزت العمل على الطاولة (an.jaz.tu al.'a.mal 'a.lá aṭ.ṭā.wi.lah.) (I did the work on the table.)
.أنجزت التمرينات في المنزل (an.jaz.tu at.ta.mrī.nāt fī al.man.zil.) (I did the exercises at home.)

Then use the form يفعل to conjugate "to do" in the present tense:

هل تقومون بواجبات الغد؟ (hal ta.qū.mūn bi.wā.ji.bāt al.ghad?) (Are you doing the work for tomorrow?)



Sporting an Athletic Side
I don't know about you, but I love playing رياضة (ri.yā.ḍah), whether it's an individual sport, such as الغولف (al.gūlf) (golf) or a team sport like كرة القدم (ku.rat al.qa.dam) (soccer).
Soccer is one of the most popular sports among Arabic-speaking people; in the Middle East, it comes as close as any sport to being the "national" sport. One reason why soccer is so popular is because it's a رياضة مشاهدة (ri.yā.ḍat mu.shā.ha.dah) (spectator sport). In a typical مباراة (mu.bā.rāh) (game), one فريق (fa.rīq) (team) with 11 players plays with another team in a ملعب (mal.'ab) (stadium). Fans closely follow the نتيجة (na.tī.jah) (score), hoping that their team manages a فوز (fawz) (win). Not surprisingly, excited fans react to every خطأ (kha.ṭa') (foul), often disagreeing with the حكم (ḥa.kam) (referee).
If you find yourself enjoying soccer or a number of other team sports with a friend who speaks Arabic, the following terms may come in handy: 

ملابس رياضية (ma.lā.bis ri.yā.ḍiy.yah) (uniforms)
خسر (kha.si.ra) (lose)
كرة(ku.rah) (ball)
لاعب (lā.'ib) (player) (MS)
لاعبة (lā.'i.bah) (player) (FS)

Soccer is only one of the many sports popular with Arabic speakers and peoples of the Middle East. Here are some other favorite sports: 

سباحة (si.bā.ḥah) (swimming)
فروسية (fu.rū.siy.yah) (horseback riding)
الكرة الطائرة (al.ku.rah aṭ.ṭā.'i.rah) (volleyball)
كرة السلة (ku.rat as.sal.lah) (basketball)
التنس (at.ti.nis) (tennis)
ركوب الدراجات (ru.kūb ad.dar.rā.jāt) (cycling)
التزحلق (at.ta.zaḥ.luq) (skiing)
التزلج (at.ta.zal.luj) (ice skating)
جمباز (jum.bāz) (gymnastics)
سباق السيارات (si.bāq as.say.yā.rāt) (car racing)

One of the most common verbs used with sports and other recreational activities is لعب (la.'i.ba) (play). Because you commonly use this verb, knowing how to conjugate it in both past and present tense is a good idea.
Here's the verb "to play" in the past tense: 





Form

Pronunciation

English





أنا لعبتُ

a.nā la.'ib.tu

أنتَ لعبتَ

an.ta la.'ib.ta

هما لعبا

hu.mā la.'i.bā

They played (dual/M)



هما لعبتا

hu.mā la.'i.ba.tā

They played (dual/F)





Use the form يلعب (yal.'a.bu) to conjugate "to play" in the present tense:

أنتنّ تلعبنّ

an.tun.na tal.'ab.na

You are playing (FP)



هم يلعبون

hum yal.'a.būn

They are playing (MP)



هنّ يلعبنّ

hun.na yal.'ab.na

They are playing (FP)



أنتما تلعبان

an.tu.mā tal.'a.bān

You are playing (dual/M/F)



هما يلعبان

hu.mā yal.'a.bān

They are playing (dual/M)



هما تلعبان

hu.mā tal.'a.bān

They are playing (dual/F)




 The sentence structure for creating verbs is such that you use the verb لعب (la.'i.ba) or يلعب (yal.'ab) followed by the sport or activity you're playing. For example, you may say أنا ألعب كرة السلة (a.nā al.'ab ku.rat as.sal.lah) (I am playing basketball) or هي لعبتْ التنس (hi.ya la.'i.bat at.ti.nis) (She played tennis). As you can see from these examples, all you do is start with the personal pronoun and verb conjugation, attach the sport you're referring to, and there you go!
Another important phrase commonly used relating to sports and other fun activities is هيا بنا (hay.yā bi.nā) (Let's). You'll often hear friends telling each other "Let's" followed by the activity or location of the activity, such as هيا بنا إلى ملعب كرة القدم (hay.yā bi.nā i.lá mal.'ab ku.rat al.qa.dam.) (Let's go to the soccer field.).

Going to the Beach
One of my favorite places is the شاطئ (shā.ṭi') (beach); whether you go to the beach with your أصدقاء (aṣ.di.qā') (friends) or your أسرة (us.rah) (family), it's a really great place to have a fun time! You can do some سباحة (si.bā.ḥah) (swimming) in the محيط (mu.ḥīṭ) (ocean) or play around in the رمل (raml) (sand).

Talkin' the Talk

Playing Musical Instruments
I happen to agree with the saying that موسيقى (mū.sī.qá) (music) is a universal language. No matter where you come from or what languages you speak, music has more power to break down barriers and bring people closer together than perhaps any other activity. Popular آلات موسيقية (ā.lāt mū.sī.qiy.yah) (musical instruments) include the following: 

بيانو (bi.yā.nū) (piano)
قيثارة (qī.thā.rah) (guitar)
كمنجة (ka.man.jah) (violin)
طبل (ṭabl) (drums)
ناي (nāy) (flute)
بوق (būq) (trumpet)
ساكسفون (sāks.fūn) (saxophone)

In order to say that someone plays a particular instrument, use the present tense form of the verb. For example, يعزف على القيتارة (ya'.zif 'a.lá al.qī.thā.rah) means "He plays the guitar" or "He is playing the guitar" because the present tense describes both an ongoing and a habitual action.
 Middle Eastern music is one of the most popular types of music in the world. It's characterized by a special kind of string instrument called the عود ('ūd) that has six double strings and a round, hollow body. The عود is generally accompanied by a number of percussion instruments, such as the regular drum and the special طبلة (ṭab.lah) that keeps the beat and adds extra flavor to the serenading of the عود.
A particularly popular kind of Northern African music is راي (rāy), which originated in the early 1990s in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. راي uses a lot of traditional Arabic instruments, such as the عود and the طبلة but adds modern rock 'n' roll and jazz instruments, such as the electric guitar, the saxophone, and the trumpet. One of the most popular singers of راي music is شاب خالد (Sheb Khaled).


Talking about Hobbies
You may enjoy a number of types of hobbies. Do you consider قراءة (qi.rā.'ah) (reading) a هواية (hu.wā.yah) (hobby)? Perhaps you're creative and like رسم (rasm) (drawing) or فخار (fakh.khār) (pottery). Almost everyone has a hobby, and because a hobby, by definition, is an activity that a person is really passionate about, you can be sure that he or she will enjoy talking about it! Here are some activities that may be considered hobbies: 

ركوب الدراجات (ru.kūb ad.dar.rā.jāt) (bicycling)
ورق اللعب (wa.raq al.la.'ib) (cards)
الشطرنج (ash.sha.ṭa.ranj) (chess)
الرقص (ar.raqṣ) (dancing)
الطائرات الورقية (aṭ.ṭā.'i.rāt al.wa.ra.qiy.yah) (kite flying)
القراءة (al.qi.rā.'ah) (reading)
الحياكة (al.ḥi.yā.kah) (sewing)
الشعر (ash.shi'r) (poetry)
غناء (ghi.nā') (singing)

When you want to discuss hobbies and personal activities, use the verb لعب (la.'i.ba), which means "to play" (for conjugations, check out "Sporting an Athletic Side" earlier in this chapter). For example, you say لعبتُ كرة القدم (la.'ib.tu ku.rat al.qa.dam) (I played soccer). Here are some other example sentences that pair activities with لعب: 

. لعبتْ الشطرنج (la.'i.bat ash.sha.ṭa.ranj.) (She played chess.)
.لعبنا كرة السلة (la.'ib.nā ku.rat as.sal.lah.) (We played basketball.)
.لعبا ورق (la.'i.bā wa.raq al.la.'ib.) (They played cards.) (dual/MP/FP)

However, there are times when you're going to use the verb عمل ('a.mi.la). Generally speaking, you use this verb to discuss activities that are more work-related than hobbies. For instance, you say عملتُ الواجب ('a.mil.tu al.wā.jib) (I did the homework). As a rule, use the verb لعب when you're discussing hobbies, such as sports.

Talkin' the Talk
Yassin and Youssef, two freshmen students at Al-azhar University, find that they have a hobby in common. 





Yassin:

Picking the Right Time for Your Trip
A major part of travel planning is timing. When you have an idea of what you want to do or where you want to go, you need to consider the most appropriate time to take the trip. An obvious example is deciding to go skiing and making sure your mountain destination will have snow when you're there. However, things can get trickier if you're traveling to a Middle Eastern or Islamic country. During some months of the year, such as the holy month of Ramadan, traveling to these countries probably isn't a good idea because the time is sacred to Muslims.
 Look at the تقويم (taq.wīm) (calendar) and choose the شهر (shahr) (month) most suitable not only to your travel plans but also to the دولة (daw.lah) (country) you're visiting. Flip to Chapter 5 to see the months listed according to the Gregorian and Islamic calendar.
 For travel purposes, the Gregorian calendar convention is most widely used, so use it if you're making a reservation.
 After you narrow down the month in which you want to take your trip, you must specify the dates by using numbers. Arabic numbers fall into two categories: cardinals and ordinals. Cardinals are regular counting numbers, like "one," "two," or "three"; ordinals are the adjective forms of numbers, like "first," "second," and "third." Arabic ordinals differ from cardinals in that every ordinal number has both a masculine and feminine form. Because ordinals are treated as adjectives, they must be in gender agreement with their corresponding nouns.
When you specify a date, you say "December fifth" or "January eighth." Because month is a masculine noun (the terms for months are masculine), you must use masculine ordinals to identify specific dates. For example, you say الخامس من ديسمبر (al.khā.mis min dī.sam.bir) (the fifth of December) or الثامن من يناير (ath.thā.min min ya.nā.yir) (January eighth). In addition, because the ordinal acts as a modifying adjective, you must include the definite prefix الـ (al). For more on cardinals and ordinals, flip to Chapters 5 and 8.

Tackling Packing
Packing the right items for your trip is a crucial step toward enjoying your travel experience. First, you must gather the أمتعة (am.ti.'ah) (luggage) you need. Here are some possibilities: 

شنطة (shan.ṭah) (suitcase)
شنط (shu.naṭ) (suitcases)
محفظة (maḥ.fa.ẓah) (briefcase)
محافظ (ma.ḥā.fiẓ) (briefcases)
كيس (kīs) (bag)
أكياس (ak.yās) (bags)
كيس الحمّام (kīs al.ḥam.mām) (toiletry bag)
أكياس الحمّام (ak.yās al.ḥam.mām) (toiletry bags)

With your luggage selected, you can now choose what to put in it. Here are some essential items you should carry with you regardless of your destination: 

ملابس (ma.lā.bis) (clothes)
قمصان (qa.mīṣ) (shirt)
قميص (qum.ṣān) (shirts)
سروال (sir.wāl) (pants)
سروال قصير (sir.wāl qa.ṣīr) (shorts)
معطف (mi'.ṭaf) (coat)
جاكيت (jā.kīt) (jacket)
أحذية (aḥ.dhi.yah) (shoes)
صندل (ṣan.dal) (sandals)
أحزمة (aḥ.zi.mah) (belts)
جوارب (ja.wā.rib) (socks)
نظارات (naẓ.ẓā.rāt) (glasses)
نظارات الشمس (naẓ.ẓā.rāt ash.shams) (sunglasses)
قبعة (qub.ba.'ah) (hat)

In addition to clothing and accessories, you also need grooming items. Here are some toiletries you may pack for your trip: 

فرشات الأسنان (fur.shāt al.'as.nān) (toothbrush)
معجون الأسنان (ma'.jūn al.'as.nān) (toothpaste)
مشط (mishṭ) (comb)
غسول الشعر (gha.sūl ash.sha'r) (shampoo)
صابون (ṣā.būn) (soap)
مزيل العرق (mu.zīl al.'a.raq) (deodorant)
فوطة (fū.ṭah) (towel)
ماكنة الحلاقة (mā.ki.nat al.ḥi.lā.qah) (shaving razor)
معجون الحلاقة (ma'.jūn al.ḥi.lā.qah) (shaving cream)



Preparing Your Travel Documents
The logistics of travel can get pretty complicated, especially when you're traveling internationally. In recent years, travel restrictions have grown more stringent due to growing security concerns. In this section, you can find all the key terms you need to know in order to gather the appropriate وثائق السفر (wa.thā.'iq as.sa.far) (travel documents) to make your trip go as smoothly as possible.
Before you leave on a trip, you need to have at least one شخصية (bi.ṭā.qah shakh.ṣiy.yah) (personal identification card); to be safe, you should probably have two or more. In case you need further confirmation of your identity, carrying three forms of identification is ideal. Here are some بطاقات شخصية (bi.ṭā.qāt shakh.ṣiy.yah) (personal identification cards) you could carry with you: 

رخصة القيادة (rukh.ṣat al.qi.yā.dah) (driver's license)
بطاقة من الحكومة (bi.ṭā.qah min al.ḥu.kū.mah) (government-issued ID)
بطاقة من الجيش (bi.ṭā.qah min al.jaysh) (military-issued ID)
جواز السفر (jaw.wāz as.sa.far) (passport)
تصريح عمل (taṣ.rīḥ 'a.mal) (work permit)

 The word بطاقة (bi.ṭā.qah) literally means "card." However, its meaning may change, depending on the context of the phrase in which you use it. For instance, in the previous list of terms, the word, بطاقة means "license" as well as "permit."
In addition to personal identification documents, if you're traveling overseas, many countries require that you also have a تأشيرة (ta'.shī.rah) (visa) stamped on your passport. Every دولة (daw.lah) (country) has different procedures and requirements for obtaining تأشيرات (ta'.shī.rāt) (visas), so it's your responsibility to find out whether the country you're planning to visit requires a visa and, if so, how to go about obtaining one. The categories of visas include 

تأشيرة الطالب (ta'.shī.rat aṭ.ṭā.lib) (student visa)
تأشيرة العمل (ta'.shī.rat al.'a.mal) (work visa)
تأشيرة السائح (ta'.shī.rat as.sā.'iḥ) (tourist visa)
تأشيرة الأسرة (ta'.shī.rat al.'us.rah) (family visa)

In order to determine which نوع (naw') (type) of visa you need and how to go about getting one, you should contact the قنصلية (qun.ṣu.liy.yah) (consulate) of your سفارة (si.fā.rah) (embassy). If possible, arrange to speak with a موظف القنصلية (mu.waẓ.ẓaf al.qun.ṣu.liy.yah) (consular officer); he or she should be able to provide you with all the معلومات (ma'.lū.māt) (information) you need about visas.

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN EMBASSY AND A CONSULATE?
The consulate and the embassy are foreign government outposts located in a host or target country. For example, the United States has both embassies and consulates in many countries around the world. A consulate is generally located in a busy tourist destination, and its officials and employees take care of minor diplomatic tasks, such as issuing visas and sponsoring educational seminars. An embassy is usually located in a nation's capital and has a more policy-oriented approach. It's slightly less bureaucratic than a consulate, and it usually represents its country's official diplomatic stance in the host country.
A consulate is headed by a consul, the person in charge of issuing visas and promoting better relations with the people of a host country; in contrast, an embassy is run by an ambassador whose general responsibility is to make sure that diplomatic ties — on a government-to-government basis — remain strong and healthy.
If you're in a foreign country and need to ask a quick bureaucratic question (such as, "How can I extend my visa?"), you should head to the consulate. However, if something serious happens (you're put in jail, for instance), then contacting the embassy is more appropriate.
If you're an American citizen traveling abroad, to find answers to any questions you have regarding preparing your وثائق السفر (wa.thā.'iq as.sa.far) (travel documents) prior to your trip, visit the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs website at travel.state.gov.

Using a Travel Agency
Although you can turn to a number of different sources for information on organizing your trip, few can provide you with the degree of top-notch service and personal attention that a travel agent can provide.
A good travel agent can recommend the most suitable places for your trip and provide you with logistical information and assistance to make your trip a success. A travel agent can provide you with information concerning: 

فنادق (fa.nā.diq) (hotels)
وسائل المواصلات (wa.sā.'il al.mu.wā.ṣa.lāt) (modes of transportation)
طائرات (ṭa.'i.rāt) (airplanes)
سيارات (say.yā.rāt) (cars)
حافلات (ḥā.fi.lāt) (buses)
حجوزات (ḥu.jū.zāt) (reservations)
تنزيلات (tan.zī.lāt) (discounts)
تنزيلات المجموعات (tan.zī.lāt al.maj.mū.'āt) (group discounts)

For example, the travel agent can tell you about discounts that you're eligible for if you're traveling in a مجموعة (maj.mū.'ah) (group) or special rates you can obtain on transportation.
Many travel agents provide special rates and packages that include not only airfare but also hotel discounts. Here are some travel packages you should ask about: 

ليلة ويومان (lay.lah wa.yaw.mān) (one night and two days)
ليلتان وثلاثة أيام (lay.la.tān wa.tha.lā.thah ay.yām) (two nights and three days)
ست ليال وسبعة أيام (sit la.yāl wa.sab.'ah ay.yām) (six nights and seven days)

When reviewing information from your travel agent, keep a lookout for the following deals: 

.بالفندق (bil.fun.duq.) (Hotel is included.)
.بزيارة المدينة (bi.zi.yā.rat al.ma.dī.nah.) (Sightseeing around the city is included.)
.بالفطور والغداء (bil.fu.ṭūr wal.gha.dā'.) (Breakfast and lunch are included.)
.بالفندق والطيران (bil.fun.duq waṭ.ṭa.ya.rān.) (Hotel and airfare are included.)

Chapter 15
Dealing with Money in a Foreign Land

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Handling financial matters at the bank
 Understanding ATM commands
 Changing your currency

Money (المال) (al.māl) is an essential part of everyday life. Whether you're in a foreign country or at home, having access to money is necessary in order to do the things you need to do — buy food, buy clothes, pay rent, go to the movies, and so on. Because very few activities in this world are مجاناً (maj.jā.nan) (for free), in this chapter you discover the Arabic terminology you need to manage your financial life. Specifically, I tell you how to open and maintain a bank account, how to withdraw money from the bank as well as from an automated teller machine (ATM), and how to exchange currency in case you travel to different countries.
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Going to the Bank
The source of money is the مصرف (maṣ.raf) (bank); conveniently another word for "bank" in Arabic is البنك (al.bank) or simply بنك (bank). In this section, you become familiar with some of the items you find and transactions that take place at the bank. Here are some common terms associated with the bank: 

فلوس (fu.lūs) (cash/physical currency)
نقود (nu.qūd) (money/coins)
عملة ('um.lah) (coin)
أوراق مالية (aw.rāq mā.ly.yah) (money/banknotes)
بطاقة اعتماد (bi.ṭā.qat i'.ti.mād) (credit card)
بطاقات اعتماد (bi.ṭā.qāt i'.ti.mād) (credit cards)
بطاقة الاستلاف (bi.ṭā.qat al.'is.ti.lāf) (debit card)
شيك (shīk) (check)
شيكات (shī.kāt) (checks)
حساب مصرفي (ḥi.sāb maṣ.ra.fī) (bank account)


Opening a bank account
One of the most important things you may do in a bank is to open a حساب مصرفي (ḥi.sāb maṣ.ra.fī) (bank account). Depending on your current financial situation and your future economic needs, you may open different types of حسابات مصرفية (ḥi.sā.bāt maṣ.ra.fiy.yah) i.sā.bāt (bank accounts). Here are some of the types of accounts that you may inquire about: 

حساب مصرفي عادي (ḥi.sāb.maṣ.ra.fī 'ā.dī) (checking account)
حساب توفير (ḥi.sāb taw.fīr) (savings account)
حساب للتوفير والتقاعد (ḥi.sāb lil.taw.fīr wat.ta.qā.'ud) (retirement savings account)
حساب مصرفي للطلاب (ḥi.sāb maṣ.ra.fī liṭ.ṭul.lāb) (student checking account)

After you determine which type is right for you, you're ready to talk to the أمين المصرف (a.mīn al.maṣ.raf) (bank teller) (M) or the أمينة المصرف (a.mī.nat al.maṣ.raf) (bank teller) (F) to open your account. The teller may ask you to step into his or her مكتب (mak.tab) (office) in order to ensure your خصوصية (khu.ṣū.ṣiy.yah) (privacy), because فتح (fatḥ) (opening) an account needs to be done securely.

Talkin' the Talk
Said has recently moved to a new city to attend college. One of the first things he does as he's settling into his new hometown is go to the bank to open an account. Sarah, a bank teller, helps Said decide which bank account meets his needs. 




Sarah:

صباح الخير. كيف يمكن أن أساعدك اليوم؟
ṣa.bāḥ al.khayr. kay.fa yum.kin an u.sā.'i.dak al.yawm?
Good morning. How may I help you today?



Said:

ṣa.bāḥ an.nūr, u.rīd an af.taḥ ḥi.sā.ban maṣ.ra.fiy.yan.

Said:

Excellent, thank you.



Sarah:

What type of bank account would you like?



Said:

mā an.wā' al.ḥi.sā.bāt al.maṣ.ra.fiy.yah 'in.da.kum?
What types of bank accounts do you have?



Sarah:

'in.da.nā an.wā' mukh.ta.li.fah. 'in.da.nā ḥi.sāb maṣ.ra.fī 'ā.dī wa.ḥi.sāb maṣ.ra.fī lil.taw.fīr wa.ḥi.sāb maṣ.ra.fī liṭ.ṭul.lāb. hal an.ta ṭā.lib?
We have different types. We have regular checking accounts, savings accounts, and bank accounts for students. Are you a student?



Said:

.نعم, أنا طالب
na.'am, a.nā ṭā.lib.
Yes, I'm a student.



Sarah:

.أظن أن الحساب المصرفي للطلاب سيناسبك
a.ẓunn an.na al.ḥi.sāb al.maṣ.ra.fī liṭ.ṭul.lāb sa.yu.nā.si.buk.
I believe that the student checking account will suit you well.



Said:

mā al.farq bay.na al.ḥi.sāb al.maṣ.ra.fī al.'ā.dī wal.ḥi.sāb al.maṣ.ra.fī liṭ.ṭul.lāb?
What's the difference between a regular checking account and a student checking account?



Sarah:

إذا أردتَ أن تفتح حساباً مصرفياً عادياً يجب أن يكون عندك ألف درهم في الحساب. ولكن يمكن أن تفتح حساباً مصرفياً للطلاب بإيداع خمس .مائة درهم فقط
i.dhā a.rad.ta an taf.taḥ ḥi.sā.ban maṣ.ra.fiy.yan 'ā.di.yan ya.jib an ya.kūn 'in.dak alf dir.ham fī al.ḥi.sāb. wa.lā.kin yum.kin an taf.taḥ ḥi.sā.ban maṣ.ra.fiy.yan liṭ.ṭul.lāb bi.'ī.dā' khams mā.'at dir.ham fa.qaṭ.
If you want to open a regular checking account, you need a minimum deposit of one thousand dirhams. However, you may open a student checking account with only five hundred dirhams.



Said:

وهل هناك فرق آخر بينهما؟
wa.hal hu.nā.ka farq ā.khar bay.na.hu.mā?
And is there any other difference between the two?



Sarah:

نعم. الفرق الآخر هو أن الحساب المصرفي العادي له فائدة ثلاثة في المائة .ولكن الحساب المصرفي للطلاب له فائدة أربعة في المائة

Yes. The other difference is that the regular checking account yields three percent interest while the student checking account yields four percent interest.



Said:

.شكراً. أريد أن أفتح حساباً مصرفياً للطلاب
shuk.ran, u.rīd an af.taḥ ḥi.sā.ban maṣ.ra.fiy.yan liṭ.ṭul.lāb.
Thank you. I would like to open a student checking account.

Presenting your ID
After you decide which account is right for you, you need to take care of some initial paperwork. You must present a number of وثائق (wa.thā.'iq) (documents) and then answer a few أسئلة (as.'i.lah) (questions). Here are some of the documents you should have with you when you want to open an account: 

البطاقة الشخصية (al.bi.ṭā.qah ash.shakh.ṣiy.yah) (personal identification card)
رخصة القيادة (rukh.ṣat al.qi.yā.dah) (driver's license)
جواز السفر (jaw.wāz as.sa.far) (passport)
بطاقة تعريف الطالب (bi.ṭā.qat ta'.rīf aṭ.ṭā.lib) (student identification card)
بطاقة الأمن الاجتماعي (bi.ṭā.qat al.'amn al.'ij.ti.mā.'ī) (social security card)



Providing your contact info
After you establish your identity by presenting various personal identification cards, the bank teller will probably ask you for some more documents, so that he or she can process your application. For example, he may ask for your العنوان الحالي (al.'un.wān al.ḥā.lī) (current address) or your العنوان السابق (al.'un.wān as.sā.biq) (former address). Of course, in order to prove that you actually do live where you say you live, the teller may ask you for a رسالة (ri.sā.lah) (letter) addressed to you at your current address.


Filling out the forms
After you provide the documents that the teller requests, you usually receive an استمارة الطلب (is.ti.mā.rat aṭ.ṭa.lab) (application form) to fill out. Here are some items you're likely to find on this application form: 

الاسم الأول (al.'ism al.'aw.wal) (first name)
لقب العائلة (la.qab al.'ā.'i.lah) (last name/family name)
تاريخ الميلاد (tā.rīkh al.mī.lād) (date of birth)
مكان الميلاد (ma.kān al.mī.lād) (place of birth)
المهنة (al.mih.nah) (occupation)
مكان العمل (ma.kān al.'a.mal) (employer)
السيرة المهنية (as.sī.rah al.mi.ha.niy.yah) (work history)
نوع الحساب (naw' al.ḥi.sāb) (type of account)
رقم الهاتف (raqm al.hā.tif) (telephone number)

After you fill out the application form, the teller will ask for your إمضاء (im.ḍā') (signature) on the document. When you finish with all the paperwork and have successfully opened your bank account, you're ready to start using it!

Making deposits and withdrawals
After you open your account, the two most basic transactions you'll probably make are 

إيداع (ī.dā') (deposit)
سحب (saḥb) (withdrawal)

To make a deposit, you may deposit into your account by using a شيك (shīk) (check) or فلوس (fi.lūs) (cash). You may go to the bank teller to make the deposit or do it yourself at an ATM, if your bank allows that. Similarly, you may perform a withdrawal by either going to the teller or by using the ATM.



Using the ATM
In recent years, the number of ATMs located around the world has mushroomed, and in places like New York City, you can't walk half a block without spotting one. Whether you're in the United States, the Middle East, or other countries or regions of the world, there's a good chance that you'll use an ATM to withdraw money. This section covers the terminology you encounter at an ATM to help make this a smooth and efficient transaction.
Most ATMs accept all sorts of cards, whether they're issued by the same bank that operates the ATM terminal or not. However, some ATMs charge you a رسم (rasm) (fee). In addition, most ATMs accept both credit cards and debit cards.
Although most ATMs let you choose the language you want to conduct your transaction in, you should still be aware of ATM-related commands and phrases in Arabic: 

.أدخل البطاقة (ad.khil al.bi.ṭā.qah.) (Insert the card.)
.أدخل الرقم السري (ad.khil ar.ra.qam as.sir.rī.) (Enter the PIN/secret number.)
.سحب (saḥb) (cash withdrawal)
.أدخل المبلغ (ad.khil al.mab.lagh.) (Enter the amount.)
.تأكد من المبلغ (ta.'ak.kad min al.mab.lagh.) (Confirm the amount.)
.اسحب المبلغ (is.ḥab al.mab.lagh.) (Take the cash.)
هل تريد إيصالا؟ (hal tu.rīd ī.ṣā.lan?) (Do you want a receipt?)
.خذ الإيصال (khudh al.'ī.ṣāl.) (Take the receipt.)
.تحقق من الرصيد (ta.ḥaq.qaq min ar.ra.ṣīd.) (Check the balance.)
.حول الأموال (ḥaw.wil al.'am.wāl.) (Transfer the money.)
.اسحب البطاقة من فضلك (is.ḥab al.bi.ṭā.qah min faḍ.lik.) (Please remove the card.)



Exchanging Currency
If you're traveling to a foreign دولة (daw.lah) (country), you won't get very far if you don't have the right عملة ('um.lah) (currency). Of course, you can rely on الشيكات السياحية (ash.shī.kāt as.si.yā.ḥiy.yah) (traveler's checks), but you may find that carrying currency is more convenient. You can exchange currency at a number of different places. If you like to plan in advance, then stopping by the bank before your سفر (sa.far) (trip) is a good idea. Otherwise, you can go to a مكتب الصرف (mak.tab aṣ.ṣarf) (exchange desk) located at the مطار (ma.ṭār) (airport).
 You're likely to get better exchange rates in your home country at your local bank than at an airport in a foreign country. If you're visiting a foreign country and need to change money, then the best way for you to exchange currencies is to go to a reputable bank of international renown and make your transactions there.

Getting to know the currencies around the world
In order to exchange your money, you need to be familiar with the different types of currencies you're dealing with. The following lists feature some of the most common currencies grouped by specific regions around the world.
The following currencies are used in the Middle East: 

Algeria: الدينار الجزائري (ad.dī.nār al.ja.zā.'ir.ī) (Algerian dinar)
Bahrain: الدينار البحريني (ad.dī.nār al.baḥ.ray.nī) (Bahraini dinar)
Egypt: الجنيه المصري (al.ju.nayh al.miṣ.rī) (Egyptian pound)
Iraq: الدينار العراقي (ad.dī.nār al.'i.rā.qī) (Iraqi dinar)
Jordan: الدينار الأردني (ad.dī.nār al.'ur.du.nī) (Jordanian dinar)
Kuwait: الدينار الكويتي (ad.dī.nār al.ku.way.tī) (Kuwaiti dinar)
Lebanon: الليرة اللبنانية (al.lī.rah al.lub.nā.niy.yah) (Lebanese lira)
Libya: الدينار الليبي (ad.dī.nār al.lī.bī) (Libyan dinar)
Morocco: الدرهم المغربي (ad.dir.ham al.magh.ri.bī) (Moroccan dirham)
Oman: الريال العماني (ar.ri.yāl al.'u.mā.nī) (Omani riyal)
Qatar: الريال القطري (ar.ri.yāl al.qa.ṭa.rī) (Qatari riyal)
Saudi Arabia: الريال السعودي (ar.ri.yāl as.sa.'ū.dī) (Saudi riyal)

Yemen: الريال اليمني (ar.ri.yāl al.ya.ma.nī) (Yemeni riyal)

Canada: الدولار الكندي (ad.dū.lār al.ka.na.dī) (Canadian dollar)
Mexico: البيسو المكسيكي (al.bī.sū al.mik.sī.kī) (Mexican peso)
United States: الدولار الأمريكي (ad.dū.lār al.'am.rī.kī) (American dollar)

Only two currencies are used in Europe: 

European Union (EU): اليورو (al.yū.rū) (Euro)
United Kingdom: الجنيه الإسترليني (al.ju.nayh al.'is.tir.lī.nī) (British pound)

The following currencies are used in Asia and Australia: 

Australia: الدولار الأسترالي (ad.dū.lār al.'us.tu.rā.lī) (Australian dollar)
China: اليوان الصيني (al.yū.wān aṣ.ṣī.nī) (Chinese yuan)
Japan: الين الياباني (al.yin al.yā.bā.nī) (Japanese yen)
South Korea: الون الكوري (al.wun al.kū.rī) (Korean won)



Making exchanges
Knowing the names of the currencies is only the first step toward exchanging the currency you hold into the one you need. The following list of questions can help you facilitate this exchange at the bank: 

أين مكتب الصرف؟ (ay.na mak.tab aṣ.ṣarf?) (Where is the exchange desk?)
هل مكتب الصرف قريب من هنا؟ (hal mak.tab aṣ.ṣarf qa.rīb min hu.nā?) (Is the exchange desk close to here?)
متى يفتح مكتب الصرف؟ (ma.tá yaf.taḥ mak.tab aṣ.ṣarf?) (When does the exchange desk open?)
ما هي أسعار العملة اليوم؟ (mā hi.ya. as.'ār al.'um.lah al.yawm?) (What is today's exchange rate?)
هل سيكون سعرالعملة أحسن غداً؟ (hal sa.ya.kūn si'r al.'um.lah aḥ.san gha.dan?) (Will the exchange rate be better tomorrow?)
هل هناك رسوم لصرف العملة؟ (hal hu.nā.ka ru.sūm li.ṣarf al.'um.lah?) (Is there a fee for exchanging money?)
.أريد أن أحول دولارات إلى دراهم (u.rīd an u.ḥaw.wil dū.lā.rāt i.lá da.rā.him.) (I would like to exchange dollars into dirhams.)
كم من دينار لمائة دولار؟ (kam dī.nār li.mā.'at dū.lār?) (How many dinars for one hundred dollars?)

Here are some answers you may hear from the أمين مكتب الصرافة (a.mīn mak.tab aṣ.ṣi.rā.fah) (exchange desk representative): 

.مكتب الصرافة يفتح الساعة الثامنة صباحاً (mak.tab aṣ.ṣi.rā.fah yaf.taḥ as.sā.'ah ath.thā.mi.nah ṣa.bā.ḥan.) (The exchange desk opens at eight o'clock in the morning.)
.نعم، نحول دولارات إلى دراهم (na.'am nu.ḥaw.wil dū.lā.rāt i.lá da.rā.him.) (Yes, we exchange dollars into dirhams.)
.سعر العملة اليوم مثل سعر العملة أمس (si'r al.'um.lah al.yawm mithl si'r al.'um.lah ams.) (Today's exchange rate is the same as yesterday's exchange rate.)
.نحن نقبل دولارات فقط (naḥ.nu naq.bal du.lā.rāt fa.qaṭ.) (We only accept dollars.)
.نحن نقبل نقوداً فقط (naḥ.nu naq.bal nu.qū.dan fa.qaṭ.) (We only accept cash.)
.مائة دولار تساوي ألف ريال (mā.'at dū.lār tu.sā.wī alf ri.yāl.) (One hundred dollars equals one thousand riyals.)

.مكتب الصرافة داخل المصرف (mak.tab aṣ.ṣi.rā.fah dā.khil al.maṣ.raf.) (The exchange desk is inside the bank.)

Chapter 16
Getting Around: Planes, Trains, and Automobiles

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Taking to the skies
 Catching taxis, buses, and trains

When it comes to getting around the block, the city, or the world, you have a lot of different modes of نقل (naql) (transportation) to choose from. And making the right choice for you is extremely important, particularly if you're traveling in a foreign country. Modes of transportation differ from region to region and country to country, so being aware of subtle differences between the transportation methods you're used to and those you discover when you're traveling abroad is essential.
In this chapter, I tell you, in Arabic, not only how to use all major transportation methods but also how to navigate a Middle Eastern city using these modes of transport.
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Traveling by Plane
One of the most common methods of transportation is flying in a طائرة (ṭā.'i.rah) (airplane). The airplane is probably the best method of transportation to help you get to a distant location in the least amount of time. Chances are if you want to go to a different country, you'll take an airplane. The following sections focus on how to make your plane travels a bit smoother with helpful Arabic vocabulary.

Making reservations
The first step in air travel is making a حجز (ḥajz) (reservation) and buying a تذكرة السفر (tadh.ki.rat as.sa.far) (plane ticket). You may purchase your ticket the traditional way, by simply visiting your وكيل أسفار (wa.kīl as.fār) (travel agent). However, in this technological age, more and more people choose to bypass the travel agent in favor of online travel agents. Even though you get more personalized service from an in-person travel agent, you can probably get better deals by ordering your plane tickets online. If you're not sure where you want to go, the travel agent may be able to suggest destinations to suit your specific traveling needs. But if you know exactly where you want to go, using an online travel agent is probably more appropriate.
 One of the potential pitfalls of going through online travel agents — particularly if you use a specialized broker that focuses on specific global destinations, such as the Middle East — is making sure that the online site is reputable. In order to not get fooled, I recommend you use one of the more established online travel agents.

Talkin' the Talk
Sophia calls her travel agent, Ahmed, to make an airline reservation. 




Sophia:

.أهلاً وسهلاً أحمد. أنا صوفيا

Getting some legwork out of the verb "to travel"
 If there's one verb you need to be familiar with relating to travel, it's the verb سافر (sā.fa.ra), which conveniently means "to travel." Even though this verb has four consonants instead of the usual three, it's nevertheless considered to be a regular verb because the fourth consonant, the ألف (alif), is actually a consonant that acts as a long vowel elongating the سين (siin). (For more on regular verbs, flip to Chapter 2.) So سافر is conjugated in the past tense and the present tense the same way as most other regular verbs. Here is the verb سافر in the past tense form:

Registering at the airport
With a plane ticket, you're ready to head off to the مطار (ma.ṭār) (airport) and board the airplane. But before you actually get on the plane, you need to take care of a few logistical things. First, you must present your جواز السفر (jaw.wāz as.sa.far) (passport) and your ticket at the airport تسجيل (tas.jīl) (registration) desk, which is located in the صالة المطار (ṣā.lat al.ma.ṭār) (airport terminal). Second, you must also answer some أسئلة (as.'i.lah) (questions) about your trip and your أمتعة (am.ti.'ah) (luggage).
 Unlike in English and other Romance languages, the Arabic language contains two forms of plural: the plural form for two things and the plural form for three or more things. Arabic uses these two distinct plural forms to distinguish between a pair of things, and three or more things.

After you check your luggage and present your boarding pass and your passport to the airline attendant, be sure to follow all تعليمات (ta'.lī.māt) (instructions) very carefully. Stay in the صف (ṣaf) (line) with your fellow ركاب (ruk.kāb) (passengers), and follow any requests made by airport officials.
When you reach the بوابة (baw.wā.bah) (gate) and board the plane, present your boarding pass to the مضيف الطائرة (mu.ḍīf aṭ.ṭā.'i.rah) (flight attendant), who will point you to your مقعد (miq.'ad) (seat). The following terms are related to the plane and your flight: 

راكب (rā.kib) (passenger)
ركاب (ruk.kāb) (passengers)
مضيف (mu.ḍīf) (attendant) (M)
مضيفة (mu.ḍī.fah) (attendant) (F)
طيار (ṭay.yār) (pilot) (M)
طيارة (ṭay.yā.rah) (pilot) (F)
غرفة القيادة (ghur.fat al.qi.yā.dah) (cockpit)
حمام (ḥam.mām) (bathroom)
الحمام مشغول (al.ḥam.mām mash.ghūl) (bathroom occupied)
الدرجة الأولى (ad.da.ra.jah al.'ū.lá) (first class)
درجة رجال الأعمال (da.ra.jat ri.jāl al.'a'.māl) (business class)
الدرجة الاقتصادية (ad.da.ra.jah al.iq.ti.ṣā.diy.yah) (economy class)
سرعة (sur.'ah) (speed)
ارتفاع (ir.ti.fā') (altitude)
انطلاق (in.ṭi.lāq) (take off)
وصول (wu.ṣūl) (arrival)



A brief departure on the verb "to arrive"
 A helpful verb to know when you're traveling is وصل (wa.ṣa.la) (to arrive). (You can also use the verb وصل to express "to arrive," "to land," or "to come.") Even though وصل has three consonants and therefore should fall into the mold of regular verb forms, it's nevertheless classified as an irregular verb. It's irregular because it includes the consonant واو (wāw); verbs with واو are classified as irregular because their present forms are radically different from the regular present verb forms. As a result, whereas the past form of the verb "arrive" follows a regular pattern, the present doesn't.
Here's the verb وصل conjugated in the past tense:

Going through immigration and customs
When your plane lands and you arrive at your chosen destination, you have to deal with the هجرة (hij.rah) (immigration) and جمارك (ja.mā.rik) (customs) officials. In recent years, airports have established more stringent requirements on مسافرون (mu.sā.fi.rūn) (travelers), so be prepared to answer a number of questions regarding the details and purpose of your trip. Here are some common questions these officials may ask you: 

ما اسمك؟ (mā is.muk?) (What's your name?)
كم عمرك؟(kam 'um.rak?) (How old are you?)
أين تسكن؟ (ay.na tas.kun?) (Where do you live?)
ما هي مهنتك؟ (mā hi.ya mih.na.tuk?) (What do you do?)
ما مدة سفرك؟ (mā mud.dat sa.fa.rak?) (How long is your trip?)
ما هدف سفرك؟ (mā ha.daf sa.fa.rak?) (What's the purpose of your trip?)
أين ستسكن مدة السفر؟ (ay.na sa.tas.kun mud.dat as.sa.far?) (Where will you be staying during the trip?)
هل تسافر لوحدك؟ (hal tu.sā.fir li.waḥ.dak?) (Are you traveling alone?)

 Provide clear and accurate answers to these questions. Providing false statements to an official from immigration or customs is a serious offense, so make sure you're truthful throughout the questioning.
 If you're visiting a Muslim country, check with your travel agent or consular official about restrictions certain countries may have regarding bringing particular items into the country. For example, if you're traveling to Saudi Arabia, you can't bring alcohol with you into the country. If you're a woman, you may have to wear specific clothing, such as the حجاب (ḥi.jāb) (veil) in order to comply with local religious laws, which is the case at least for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for example. You want to be certain you are aware of all the rules and laws before you face someone from immigration or customs.

Getting through the immigration post puts you one step closer to leaving the airport and discovering the wonders of the exotic country you're visiting! After your interview with the immigration official, you may proceed to pick up your luggage. You may use the help of a حمال (ḥam.māl) (baggage handler/porter), or you may simply use a عربة ('a.ra.bah) (cart) to haul your own luggage.
Before you actually leave the airport, you must go through customs. Use the following phrases when speaking with customs officials: 

.لا شيء للإعلان (lā shay' lil.'i'.lān.) (Nothing to declare.)
.معي شيء للإعلان (ma.'ī shay' lil.'i'.lān.) (I have something to declare.)

 Check with your travel agent, consular officer, or embassy official to find out about any products or restrictions imposed by countries you're traveling to. You should know what's prohibited from entering or leaving a specific country because the consequences of not knowing may be quite high. In addition, certain countries have limits on the amount of cash you can bring in and take out. Knowing these currency restrictions is equally important.

Hailing a taxi
If you're in a large or medium-sized city and need to get from one location to another quickly and relatively inexpensively, then hailing a taxi is probably the best option for you. When hailing a cab in a foreign country, keep the following advice in mind: 

Make sure that the taxi you hail is fully licensed and authorized by the local agencies to operate as a taxi. A number of companies operate illegal taxis and take advantage of unsuspecting tourists — make sure you're not one of them! Usually, most legitimate taxi operators have licensing information on display somewhere inside the cab or even on the car's exterior.
Be aware that most taxis that run to and from the airport charge a flat rate. Inquire about the flat rate before you get into the taxi.
If you're in the city, make sure the taxi سائق (sā.'iq) (driver) turns on the عداد ('ad.dād) (meter). A common occurrence is that a driver forgets (either accidentally or intentionally) to turn on the meter and ends up charging you, the passenger, an exorbitant amount of money for a short ride.

In most Arab and Middle Eastern countries, tipping the driver isn't required. However, I'm sure the driver won't argue if you decide to give him a little tip!

Taking a bus
The حافلة (ḥā.fi.la) (bus) is a convenient mode of transportation whether you're traveling across town or across the country. If you're in a city and traveling within city limits, taking the bus is a good option because it usually costs less than a taxi. If you're traveling across the country, not only is taking a bus an economical option, but you also get to enjoy the beautiful scenery up close and personal!
Most حافلات (hā.fi.lāt) (buses) accept prepaid تذاكر (ta.dhā.kir) (tickets). If you frequently take the bus, refill your bus pass regularly. Otherwise, if you only take a bus occasionally, you'll be glad to know that most buses also accept فلوس (fi.lūs) (cash) as long as it's small bills. Here are some common terms you may need or encounter if you decide to take a bus: 

تذكرة الحافلة (tadh.ka.rat al.ḥā.fi.lah) (bus ticket)
محطة الحافلة (ma.ḥaṭ.ṭat al.ḥā.fi.lah) (bus station/bus stop)
سائق الحافلة (sā.'iq al.ḥā.fi.lah) (bus driver)
توقيت الحافلة (taw.qīt al.ḥā.fi.lah) (bus schedule)

 If you want to say "every" as in "every day" or "every hour," all you do is add the word كل (kul) (every) before the noun that describes the time you're referring to. For example: 

كل يوم (kul yawm) (every day)
كل ساعة (kul sā.'ah) (every hour)
كل نصف ساعة (kul niṣf sā.'ah) (every half-hour)
كل ربع ساعة(kul rub' sā.'ah) (every 15 minutes)

Boarding a train
The قطار (qi.ṭār) (train) is a popular alternative if you're looking for transportation that's convenient, fast, and affordable, and allows you to do a little sightseeing while you're on the go. When you board the train, be ready to provide your pass to the train attendant. Although boarding most trains doesn't require a بطاقة شخصية (bi.ṭā.qah shakh.ṣiy.yah) (personal ID card), you should be ready to present one if an attendant asks you for it.

Chapter 17
Finding a Place to Stay

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Hunting for accommodations
 Reserving your room
 Checking in and out

Picking the right فندق (fun.duq) (hotel) for you and your family or friends can sometimes make or break your رحلة (riḥ.lah) (trip). During a عطلة ('uṭ.lah) (vacation), the hotel is your home away from home — it's where you get up in the morning and sleep at night, and it can serve as a base for you to regroup before facing daily adventures. So choosing the hotel that's right for you is very important.
In this chapter, I show you the ins and outs of choosing the right hotel to meet your travel, budgetary, and personal needs. You find out how to inquire about specific aspects of the hotel (such as available amenities and proximity to the city center), how to make a room reservation and check into your room, how to interact with the hotel staff, and, last but not least, how to successfully check out of your hotel room! You find out everything you ever wanted to know about hotel life and more!
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Choosing the Right Accommodations
When choosing the right hotel, you need to consider a number of factors. First and foremost, you must figure out what kind of hotel you want to stay in. With so many options to choose from, how do you know which one is right for you? Here are some details to consider: 

أين (ay.na) (where)
ثمن (tha.man) (price)
غرفة (ghur.fah) (room)
مساحة الغرفة (mi.sā.ḥat al.ghur.fah) (room size)
نوع الغرفة (naw' al.ghur.fah) (room type)
خدمة الغرفة (khid.mat al.ghur.fah) (room service)
سكن (sa.kan) (accommodations)

Of course, you have many other factors to consider, but these are some of the more popular ones. Not only do you need to find the right hotel, one that perhaps includes such مرافق (ma.rā.fiq) (amenities) as a مسبح (mas.baḥ) (swimming pool) or a مطعم (maṭ.'am) (restaurant), but you also need to make sure you find the right room. After all, that's where you'll spend most of your private time.
An important factor to think about when finding a hotel is its مساحة (mi.sā.ḥah) (size). For example, if you're traveling alone, a غرفة لشخص واحد (ghur.fah li.shakhṣ wā.ḥid) (single room) is more appropriate than a غرفة لسخصين (ghur.fah li.shakh.ṣayn) (double room). When inquiring about a hotel, you may need to use the following terms: 

سرير (sa.rīr) (bed)
حمام (ḥam.mām) (toilet)
شرفة (shur.fah) (balcony)
تلفزيون (ti.li.fiz.yūn) (television)
طابق (ṭā.biq) (floor/level)

 To create a possessive noun in the English language, you usually use an apostrophe, such as "the girl's cat" or "the woman's house." It's the same in Arabic, except that you reverse the word order — you use an indefinite noun followed by a definite noun, as in مساحة الغرفة. الغرفة (a definite noun because it contains the definite article prefix al-) means "the room," and مساحة (an undefined noun) means "size." So when you read or hear مساحة الغرفة, you automatically know that the غرفة is the possessor acting on the مساحة (size) to express the "room's size" or, literally, "the size of the room."

Discussing minor room details
I don't know about you, but before I reserve a hotel room, I want to find out as much as possible about what's actually inside the room. Your friends, like mine, may call it obsessive-compulsive, but I want to know everything about the room, down to the last detail, such as the kind of bathroom, what channels the TV receives, and even the number of pillows I can expect to find on the bed!

Getting to know direct object pronouns
 Direct object pronouns ascribe possession to a particular individual or group of individuals, as in "his room," "her cat," or "their house." In Arabic, instead of using a separate possessive word such as "his," "her," or "their," you add a possessive direct object pronoun suffix to the noun to which you're ascribing possession.
For example, if you want to say "his room" in Arabic, you take the noun for "room" (غرفة) and add the direct object pronoun suffix corresponding to "his," which is the suffix ــه (hu). So "his room" in Arabic is غرفته (ghur.fa.tu.hu). Note that because غرفة is a feminine singular noun, it automatically ends in تاء مربوطة (tā' mar.bū.ṭah) — the silent "t" located at the end of every feminine singular noun — and you must also add a ضمة (ḍam.mah) — the "u" sound (u) — to the end of the word before placing the suffix ــه (hu). So instead of saying غرفه (ghur.fa.hu), you say غرفته.
If you want to say "her room," follow the same rule except that instead of adding the masculine possessive suffix ــه, you add the feminine possessive suffix ها. Hence, "her room" is غرفتها (ghur.fa.tu.hā). This rule applies to all singular possessive direct object pronouns, but you must pay close attention when using the possessive suffix in the plural form. For example, to say "their room," you must first determine the gender of "their" — whether it's masculine plural or feminine plural; the plural possessive suffix is gender-defined, meaning it changes based on the gender. "Their room" in the masculine is غرفتهم (ghur.fa.tu.hum) (هم [-hum] is the masculine plural possessive suffix). Alternatively, "their room" in the feminine is غرفتهنّ (ghur.fa.tu.hun.na) — (you add the feminine plural possessive suffix هنّ [-hun.na]).
Table 17-1 contains all direct object pronoun possessive suffixes, so feel free to turn to this table whenever you're looking to add a possessive suffix to a particular noun but aren't sure which possessive suffix to use.

Making a Reservation
After you identify the right hotel with the right accommodations and room, you're ready to make a حجز (ḥajz) (reservation). Before you do, though, you have a few considerations to make, such as the duration of your stay, the number and type of room you're reserving, the number of people staying, and the cost to stay at the hotel. This section explores all these elements in-depth so that you can be prepared to make a smooth reservation and secure the best accommodations for your trip!

Figuring out the price
Price is an important factor to think about before you make your reservation. Fortunately, there are many accommodations options to suit every ميزانية (mī.zā.niy.yah) (budget). If you can afford it, making a reservation in a فندق فاخر (fun.duq fā.khir) (luxury hotel) is nice. These five-star hotels tend to have all sorts of accommodations, and you're sure to get the star treatment from the hotel staff; a luxury hotel almost guarantees a great experience. If you're a طالب (ṭā.lib) (student) or someone with a limited budget, staying at a دار الطلبة (dār aṭ.ṭa.la.bah) (youth hostel) is a more affordable option. Hostels tend to have very basic accommodations, such as communal bathrooms and shared living space, but are fine if you're not planning to spend that much وقت (waqt) (time) in the hotel.
When making your reservation, be sure to inquire about any special تخفيضات (takh.fī.ḍāt) (discounts) that the hotel may offer. Here are some discounts you can ask about: 

تخفيضات المجموعات (takh.fī.ḍāt al.maj.mū.'āt) (group discounts)
تخفيضات الفصول (takh.fī.ḍāt al.fu.ṣūl) (seasonal discounts)

When you inquire about the ثمن, ask about any عروض خاصة ('u.rūḍ khāṣ.ṣah) (special travel packages) that the hotel may offer, such as local sightseeing expeditions. Many hotels now offer these kinds of packages in addition to basic room and board accommodations. If you don't ask, you may miss out on a good deal!

Indicating the length of your stay
Making sure you get the room you want when you need it is as important as sticking to your hotel budget. Securing a reservation can be difficult, particularly during the موسم الأعياد (maw.sim al.'a'.yād) (holiday season); therefore, it's advisable you make your reservation ahead of schedule so that you're assured to get the hotel you want during the مدة (mud.dah) (period) of your choosing.
 In order to say you're going to stay at the فندق "for a period of" so much time, use the following formula: لمدة (li.mud.dat) followed by the duration of your stay. For example, to say you're staying "for a period of a week," say لمدة أسبوع (li.mud.dat us.bū'). Here are some other examples: 

لمدة يوم (li.mud.dat yawm) (for a period of one day)
لمدة شهر (li.mud.dat shahr) (for a period of one month)
لمدة أسبوعين (li.mud.dat us.bū.'ayn) (for a period of two weeks)
لمدة خمسة أيام (li.mud.dat kham.sat ay.yām) (for a period of five days)
لمدة أسبوع ونصف (li.mud.dat us.bū' wa.niṣf) (for a period of one and a half weeks)

To say that you're staying from one date until another date, use the prepositions من (min) (from) and إلى (i.lá) (until). For example, if you're staying "from Monday until Thursday," you say من الاثنين إلى الخميس (min al.'ith.nayn i.lá al.kha.mīs). Here are some other examples: 

من الأربعاء إلى الأحد (min al.'ar.ba.'ā' i.lá al.'a.ḥad) (from Thursday until Sunday)
من عشرين يوليو إلى ثلاثين يوليو (min 'ish.rīn yul.yū i.lá tha.lā.thīn yul.yū) (from July 20 until July 30)
من أغسطس إلى سبتمبر (min u.ghus.ṭus i.lá sib.tam.bir) (from August until September)

 The verb for "to stay" is بقي (ba.qi.ya) in the past tense and يبقى (yab.qá) in the present tense. To put a فعل (fi'l) (verb) in the مستقبل (mus.taq.bal) (future), all you do is add the prefix sa- to the فعل in the present tense. For example, to communicate "I will stay for a period of one week," you say سأبقى لمدة أسبوع (sa.'ab.qá li.mud.dat us.bū').

Subjecting you to subjunctive verbs
 يريد (yu.rīd) is a special kind of verb — called subjunctive — that means "want to." Other verbs that fall into this category include يجب (ya.jib) (have to), يستطيع (yas.ta.ṭī') (able to), and يحبّ (yu.ḥibb) (like). Unlike other types of verbs, these four verbs fall into the main subjunctive category, which means that they're conjugated in only one tense.
For example, here is the verb يريد conjugated in the subjunctive form: 





Form

Pronunciation

English





أنا أريد

a.nā u.rīd

I want



أنتَ تريد

an.ta tu.rīd

You want (MS)



أنتِ تريدين

an.ti tu.rī.dīn

You want (FS)



هو يريد

hu.wa yu.rīd

He wants



هي تريد

hi.ya tu.rīd

نحن نريد

naḥ.nu nu.rīd

أنتم تريدون

an.tum tu.rī.dūn

You want (MP)



أنتنّ تريدنّ

an.tun.na tu.rīd.na

You want (FP)



هم يريدون

hum yu.rī.dūn

They want (MP)



هنّ يريدنّ

hun.na yu.rīd.na

They want (FP)



أنتما تريدان

an.tu.mā tu.rī.dān

You want (dual/M/F)



هما يريدان

hu.mā yu.rī.dān

They want (dual/M)



هما تريدان

hu.mā tu.rī.dān

They want (dual/F)




In English, when you use a subjunctive verb to describe an action, you always follow the verb with the preposition "to." For example, you say "I want to watch movies" or "I like to eat chocolate"; you would never say "I want watch movies" or "I like eat chocolate." Not only is it not proper English, but dropping the "to" doesn't really make that much sense. The same rule applies in Arabic: When you use a subjunctive verb to describe an action, you always add the preposition "to," which is pronounced (an) in Arabic.
To illustrate the subjunctive verbs in action, here are some examples: 

.أحب أن أذهب إلى المكتبة (u.ḥibb an adh.hab i.lá al.mak.ta.bah) (I like to go to the library.)
.أستطيع أن أعمل الواجب غدًا (as.ta.ṭī' an a'.mal al.wā.jib gha.dan) (I'm able to do the homework for tomorrow.)
. يجب أن تقرأ الكتاب (ya.jib an taq.ra' al.ki.tāb) (You must read the book.)

However, unlike in English where the auxiliary verb — the verb after the main verbs "have to," "like to," "able to," and "want to" — remains the same, the auxiliary verb in Arabic changes and becomes a subjunctive verb. For all intents and purposes, the subjunctive verb in this case is any verb that follows the preposition أن (an) after one of the four main verbs. So when you use one of the four main verbs followed by أن and an auxiliary verb, you must conjugate the auxiliary verb in the subjunctive form.
The subjunctive verb form is similar to the present verb tense, except that the verb endings are significantly different. For example, the present tense form of the verb كتب (ka.ta.ba) (wrote) is يكتب (yak.tu.bu) (write). The subjunctive form of يكتبُ is يكتبَ (yak.tu.ba), with the ضمة (ḍam.mah) changed to a فتحة (fat.ḥa). So if you wanted to say "I like to write," you would say أحب أن أكتبَ (u.ḥib.bu an ak.tu.ba) and not أحب أن أكتبُ ('u.ḥib.bu an ak.tu.bu).
To get a better sense of the subjunctive, here is the verb "to write" in the subjunctive form: 





Form

Pronunciation

English





أنا أكتب

a.nā ak.tu.ba

I write



أنتَ تكتب

an.ta tak.tu.ba

You write (MS)



أنتِ تكتبي

an.ti tak.tu.bī

You write (FS)



هو يكتب

hu.wa yak.tu.ba

He writes



هي تكتب

hi.ya tak.tu.ba

She writes



نحن نكتب

naḥ.nu nak.tu.ba

We write



أنتم تكتبوا

an.tum tak.tu.bū

You write (MP)



أنتنّ تكتبنّ

an.tun.na tak.tub.na

You write (FP)



هم يكتبوا

hum yak.tu.bū

They write (MP)



هنّ يكتبنّ

hun.na yak.tub.na

They write (FP)



أنتما تكتبا

an.tu.mā tak.tu.bā

You write (dual/M/F)



هما يكتبا

hu.mā yak.tu.bā

They write (dual/M)



هما تكتبا

hu.mā tak.tu.bā

They write (dual/F)





Notice that whereas most of the endings in the subjunctive form change, a few remain the same. These are the personal pronouns whose endings remain the same in both the subjunctive and the present tense environments — أنتن and هن. Also, although a majority of the endings change vowels, a few have endings that change completely: أنتِ, أنتم, هم, هما (M), and هما (F). In these endings, you actually drop the suffix. For example, أنتم تكتبون (an.tum tak.tu.bū.na) becomes أنتم تكتبوا (an.tum tak.tu.bū).
 Whenever you use an auxiliary verb, make sure you use the subjunctive form of that verb!



Checking In to the Hotel
When you arrive at your hotel after a long trip, probably the last thing on your mind is going through the formalities of checking in. You probably just want to go up to your room, jump into bed, and relax for a little while. To help relieve the annoyance of check-in time, this section covers all the necessary words and phrases to help you check in to your room as smoothly as possible.
If you already have a reservation, ask the موظف الاستقبال (mu.waẓ.ẓaf al.'is.tiq.bāl) (desk clerk) for more معلومات (ma'.lū.māt) (information) regarding your room. If you don't have a reservation, you can inquire about room متاحة (mu.tā.ḥah) (availability) at the front desk.
Here are some important terms you may need during check-in: 

مفتاح (mif.tāḥ) (key)
مفتاح الغرفة (mif.tāḥ al.ghur.fah) (room key)
أمتعة (am.ti.'ah) (luggage)
حقيبة (ḥa.qī.bah) (suitcase)
محفظة (maḥ.fa.ẓah) (briefcase)
طابق (ṭā.biq) (floor)
مصعد (miṣ.'ad) (elevator)
استقبال (is.tiq.bāl) (reception)

بواب (baw.wāb) (concierge) (M)
بوابة (baw.wā.bah) (concierge) (F)

When interacting with the hotel staff, the following key phrases are likely to come in handy: 

هل الفطور مع الغرفة؟ (hal al.fu.ṭūr ma.'a al.ghur.fah?) (Is breakfast with the room?)
متى يبدأ الفطور؟ (ma.tá yab.da' al.fu.ṭūr?) (When does breakfast begin?)
متى ينتهي الفطور؟ (ma.tá yan.ta.hī al.fu.ṭūr?) (When does breakfast end?)
هل هناك رسائل لي؟ (hal hu.nā.ka ra.sā.'il lī?) (Are there any messages for me?)

Checking Out of the Hotel
After your nice stay at the hotel, it's time for المغادرة (al.mu.ghā.da.rah) (checkout). Ask the front desk clerk for the exact checkout; most hotels have a specific checkout time, such as noon, and if you go over that time by only a few minutes, some hotels will charge you for a whole extra night! It's your responsibility to know the exact checkout time and to be out of your room by then.
Before you leave the hotel, make sure you get all your belongings from your room, and take care of the فاتورة (fā.tū.rah) (bill). Some common extra charges to watch out for include 

فاتورة الهاتف (fā.tū.rat al.hā.tif) (telephone bill)
فاتورة التلفزيون (fā.tū.rat at.ti.li.fiz.yūn) (TV pay-per-view bill)
فاتورة الطعام (fā.tū.rat aṭ.ṭa.'ām) (food bill)

When you pay the bill, get a وصل (waṣl) (receipt) in case you have a problem with the bill later on or can be reimbursed for your travel costs.

Chapter 18
Handling Emergencies

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Finding help when you need it
 Talking with a doctor
 Getting legal help

No one can deny the power of positive thinking. However, sometimes negative situations arise, and you must be able to rise to the occasion and help not only yourself but those around you if necessary. So even though remaining positive is always a good thing, you should also know how to handle negative situations if you find yourself faced with them.
Handling an emergency in your native tongue can be quite hard to begin with, given the adrenaline rush and possible feelings of panic, so dealing with a situation in a foreign language such as Arabic may seem daunting. But don't panic! In this chapter, I give you the right words, phrases, and procedures to help you overcome any emergency situation — whether medical, legal, or political — just like a native speaker.
 You can listen to all the Talkin' the Talk dialogues featured in this chapter. Go to www.dummies.com/go/arabicfd and click on the dialogue you want to hear.


Shouting Out for Help
When you're witnessing or experiencing an emergency such as a theft, a fire, or even someone having a heart attack, your first instinct is to start yelling and shouting. That's the right instinct. But you also need to be able to communicate coherently so that you can get مساعدة (mu.sā.'a.dah) (help). This section tells you which words to use to verbally express your sense of emergency in order to get the right kind of help.
Essentially, Arabic has three words that mean "help": مساعدة (mu.sā.'a.dah), معاونة (mu.'ā.wa.nah), and النجدة (an.naj.dah). People interchangeably use all of these words to ask for help in an emergency. You can attract help by shouting النجدة (an.naj.dah) once, but you attract more attention when you shout the words consecutively: 

!النجدة النجدة (an.naj.dah an.naj.dah!) (Help help!)
!معاونة معاونة (mu.'ā.wa.nah mu.'ā.wa.nah!) (Help help!)

You can use النجدة to call for help, but be aware that screaming it means that someone is in a severe, extremely dangerous, life-and-death situation. (If there were degrees to words for "help" — where level 3 is high, النجدة would be a level 5.)
Understanding this classification of "help" may be difficult because when you're in an emergency, you tend not to think about your situation on a scale of seriousness. Your reaction is usually, "I'm in trouble, and I need help now." The Arabic vocabulary for emergencies is structured in such a way as to differentiate between life-and-death emergencies and non-life-and-death situations.
 The basic rule for expressing that you need help is that if you're involved in a life-and-death situation, you should scream out النجدة. Think of النجدة as the code red of distress signals, only to be used if your life or the lives of others are in danger. For example, screaming النجدة isn't appropriate if you sprain your ankle while playing soccer. However, if you're witnessing or experiencing a drowning, a heart attack, or a suicide attempt, you should scream النجدة like this: 
!النجدة النجدة (an.naj.dah an.naj.dah!) (Help help!)
Here are some other important words and phrases to help you cope with an emergency: 

!ساعدوني (sā.'i.dū.nī!) (Help me!)
!شرطة (shur.ṭah!) (Police!)
!أحتاج طبيب (aḥ.tāj ṭa.bīb!) (I need a doctor!)
!لص (liṣ!) (Thief!)
!حريق (ḥa.rīq!) (Fire!)


A little help with the verb "to help"
 The word مساعدة (mu.sā.'a.dah) (assistance) is derived from the verb ساعد (sā.'ā.da), which means "to help." Although screaming مساعدة is an important first step to attract attention to an emergency, you also need to be able to coherently formulate a sentence in order to get the right kind of help. Use the form ساعد to conjugate the verb "to help" in the ماضي (mā.ḍī) (past tense) and يساعد(yu.sā.'id) to conjugate it in the مضارع (mu.ḍā.ri') (present tense). (Check out Chapter 2 for a quick reminder of the present and past tenses.)
Here's the verb "to help" conjugated in the past tense:

 Although Arabic has more than one word for "help," مساعدة is the most conjugated verb form. معاونة may also be conjugated using the form عاون in the past tense and يعاون in the present, but it's more of an archaic and arcane verb that isn't widely used in everyday Arabic. Because النجدة is more of a code word for distress, it doesn't have a verb equivalent form.


Lending a hand
Being in an emergency doesn't always mean that you're the one who needs help. You may be faced with a situation where you're actually the person who's in a position to offer help. In this case, you need to know words and phrases of an altogether different nature. The words and phrases in this section help you better respond to a situation in which you're the helper and not the one being helped.
 The first thing you do in such a situation is ask questions to assess the damage and determine what course of action to take: 

ماذا حدث؟ (mā.dhā ḥa.da.tha?) (What happened?)
هل كل شيء بخير؟ (hal kul shay' bi.khayr?) (Is everything alright?)
هل تريد مساعدة؟ (hal tu.rīd mu.sā.'a.dah?) (Do you need help?) (M)
ما نوع المساعدة التي تريد؟ (mā naw' al.mu.sā.'a.dah al.la.tī tu.rīd?) (What kind of help do you need?) (M)
هل تريد أن تذهب إلى المستشفى؟ (hal tu.rīd an tadh.hab i.lá al.mus.tash.fá?) (Do you want to go to the hospital?) (M)
هل تريد طبيب؟ (hal tu.rīd ṭa.bīb?) (Do you need a doctor?) (M)

If you're in a situation in which injuries are serious and the person appears to be disoriented, then you must take further steps, such as contacting police or other first responders.
If you're ever in a situation where you need to call the police, you may say the following on the phone: أحتاج مساعدة فوراً (aḥ.tāj mu.sā.'a.dah faw.ran) (I need help right away).

Talkin' the Talk
Lamia is walking down the street when, all of a sudden, the woman walking in front of her falls on the ground. Lamia approaches the woman to see how she can be of help. 




Lamia:

عفواً. هل كل شيء بخير؟
'af.wan, hal kul shay' bi.khayr?
Excuse me. Is everything alright?



Woman:

.نعم. كل شيء بخير
na.'am. kul shay' bi.khayr.
Yes. Everything is alright.



Lamia:

ماذا حدث؟
mā.dhā ḥa.dath.tha?
What happened?



Woman:

.لا شيء. وقعتُ
lā shay'. wa.qa'.tu.
Nothing. I fell.



Lamia:

هل تريدين مساعدة؟
hal tu.rī.dīn mu.sā.'a.dah?
Do you need help?



Woman:

.لا شكراً. كل شيء سيكون بخير
lā shuk.ran. kul shay' sa.ya.kūn bi.khayr.
No thank you. Everything will be alright.









Getting Medical Help
If you're like me, you may find that even though going to the doctor's office is necessary and important, it isn't always the most fun part of your day. But visiting the doctor is essential for each and every one of us. This section introduces you to important medical terms to help you interact effectively with medical staff.

Locating the appropriate doctor
In case of a medical urgency, your first stop should be the مستشفى (mus.tash.fá) (hospital) to see a طبيب (ṭa.bīb) (doctor). If you simply need a checkup, go see a طبيب عام (ṭa.bīb 'ām) (general doctor). If your needs are more specific, look for one of these specialist doctors: 

طبيب أسنان (ṭa.bīb as.nān) (dentist)
طبيب عيون (ṭa.bīb 'u.yūn) (ophthalmologist)
طبيب أقدام (ṭa.bīb aq.dām) (orthopedist)
طبيب أطفال (ṭa.bīb aṭ.fāl) (pediatrician)



Talking about your body
Locating the right doctor is only the first step toward getting treatment. In order to interact with the doctor, you need to be able to identify your different body parts in Arabic, explaining which parts hurt and which are fine. Table 18-1 lists all your major body parts.

Explaining your symptoms
The doctor can't provide you with the proper treatment unless you communicate the kind of pain you're experiencing. How مريض (ma.rīḍ) (sick) do you feel? Do you have a صداع (ṣu.dā') (headache)? Or perhaps a حرارة (ḥa.rā.rah) (fever)? Table 18-2 lists common symptoms.

a.lam aẓ.ẓahr

backache



حساسية

ḥa.sā.siy.ya

When you go to the doctor, he or she may ask you, ماذا يؤلمك؟ (mā.dhā yu'.li.muk) (What hurts you?). The most common way to respond to this question is to name the body part that hurts followed by يؤلمني (yu'.li.mu.nī) (hurts me). So when the doctor asks, "What hurts you?" you may say: 

.رأسي يؤلمني (ra'.sī yu'.li.mu.nī.) (My head hurts me.)
.أذناي تؤلمني (u.dhu.nāy.ya tu'.li.mu.nī.) (My ears hurt me.)
.صدري يؤلمني (ṣad.rī yu'.li.mu.nī.) (My chest hurts me.)
.ذراعي تؤلمني (dhi.rā.'ī tu'.li.mu.nī.) (My arm hurts me.)



Getting treatment
After the doctor analyzes your symptoms, he or she is able to offer you علاج ('i.lāj) (treatment). Following the doctor's orders is important for both getting and remaining سليم (sa.līm) (healthy), so pay attention. Here are treatment-related words you may encounter: 

دواء (da.wā') (medicine)
صيدلية (ṣay.da.liy.yah) (pharmacy)
عيادة ('i.yā.dah) (clinic)


Talkin' the Talk
Omar has been feeling nauseous all day long, so he decides to go see his doctor in the afternoon. 




Doctor:

ماذا يؤلمك؟
mā.dhā yu'.li.muk?
What hurts you?



Omar:

.رأسي يؤلمني
ra'.sī yu'.li.mu.nī.
My head hurts.



Doctor:

شيء آخر؟
shay' ā.khar?
Anything else?



Omar:

.نعم. عندي حرارة
na.'am. 'in.dī ḥa.rā.rah.
Yes. I have a fever.



Doctor:

.خذ هذا الأسبرين وستكون بخير
khudh hā.dhā al.as.bi.rīn wa.sa.ta.kūn bi.khayr.
Take this aspirin, and you will be alright.

Acquiring Legal Help
I hope you never need it, but you may have a run-in with the law and need the services of a محامي (mu.ḥā.mī) (lawyer). The lawyer has a good understanding of the قانون (qā.nūn) (law) and is in a position to help you if you're ever charged with committing a جريمة (ja.rī.mah) (crime).
 If you happen to be in a foreign country and need legal representation, the best route is to contact your country's قنصلية (qun.ṣu.liy.yah) (consulate) and ask to speak to the قنصل (qun.ṣul) (consul). Because consular officers have a very good understanding of the laws of their host countries, you may be better off getting help directly from them rather than finding your own lawyer. Especially if it looks like you have to go to محكمة (maḥ.ka.mah) (court) and face a قاضي (qā.ḍī) (judge), the help a consulate can provide is invaluable.
You may also want to call your country's سفارة (si.fā.rah) (embassy) if you're in a really serious situation. Even if you're unable to talk directly to the سفير (sa.fīr) (ambassador), your embassy staff may take the appropriate steps to provide you with assistance.

Chapter 19
Ten Ways to Pick Up Arabic Quickly

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Exploring Arabic media offerings online and in print
 Practicing on Arabic speakers
 Getting musical

Arabic is a language that needs to be constantly spoken, heard, and practiced. Even many native speakers try to read an Arabic newspaper every day or watch a نشرة إخبارية (nash.rah ikh.bā.riy.yah) (news broadcast) in order to maintain their level of fluency. So to get the best grasp of the language, you should try to immerse yourself in an environment where Arabic is the prevalent language. This chapter has recommendations on some key ways to help you not only pick up Arabic, but also maintain a good degree of understanding of the language after you're comfortable with it.


Watch Arabic Television
Since the late 1990s, the Arabic audiovisual landscape has experienced a seismic shift. With the advent of satellite TV across the Arab world and the Middle East, Arab TV stations have spread across the world. Besides the well-known satellite news outlets الجزيرة (al.ja.zī.rah) (The Peninsula) and العربية (al.'a.ra.biy.yah) (The Arabic), there are a number of other TV stations you can watch to help you fine-tune your accent and intonation. The news channels offer valuable exposure to spoken Modern Standard Arabic, which is the Arabic used in this book. Because this version's more formal than others, watching Arabic news channels will give you a better grasp of the grammatical rules — and your Arabic will be greatly improved as a result.
Another option for Arabic TV is MBC (Middle East Broadcast Corporation), which airs movies, soap operas, and talk shows that showcase some of the local spoken dialects such as Lebanese and Egyptian. If you're in the United States, you can order Arabic channels from your local cable provider or satellite TV operator; these channels have subtitles in English so you can follow along. Believe it or not, watching TV is one of the best ways to pick up a language. Personally, I didn't start speaking English until I was 10 years old, and one of the most effective tools that helped me grasp the language was watching sitcoms like The Simpsons.


Use the Dictionary
The قاموس (qā.mūs) (dictionary) contains a wealth of information about Arabic words, phrases, and expressions. Simply picking up the dictionary once a day and memorizing a single word can have a huge effect on your Arabic vocabulary. After you reach fluency in reading and writing Arabic, you'll realize that vowels aren't included in most of the Arabic texts you read, such as newspapers, books, and magazines. At first, trying to read without the vocalizations takes practice, but with the help of the dictionary, you should be able to overcome this hurdle.
 If reading the dictionary is simply too low-tech for your taste, go online and find a word-a-day generating program that sends you an email every morning with a new Arabic word that includes its pronunciation, meaning, etymology, and the context in which you use it. What a great way for you to build your vocabulary without actually opening the dictionary. Check out www.ectaco.com and arabicpod101.com.


Read Arabic Newspapers
The Arabic صحافة (ṣa.ḥā.fah) (press) is very vibrant and offers many different publications covering a wide array of perspectives. Newspapers across the Arab world cater to all sorts of viewpoints, from the ultra-liberal to the ultra-conservative. Reading Arabic newspapers is a good way to not only practice reading the language, but also become more familiar with the issues concerning the Arab world.
You can purchase Arabic newspapers at most major newsstands in major metropolitan areas, such as New York. Also, many Arabic newspapers now have online editions that you can access anytime, from anywhere. For more on Arabic newspapers and where to locate them, visit www.al-baab.com.


Surf the Internet
The Internet is one of the greatest inventions of all time — you have practically all the world's information at your fingertips! Plus, it's an amazing tool that can help you master Arabic quickly and efficiently. Simply visit any search engine — such as Google or Yahoo! — type the search word "Arabic," and start surfing. Or you can browse media websites, such as www.aljazeera.net. Most media sites have a Links section where you generally find a list of other websites that are similar in nature. Another wonderful resource is foreigncy.us, which includes vocabulary lists along with articles and video clips. Perusing these sites in Arabic should greatly improve your reading comprehension.


Streaming Services
The explosion of Arabic online content has been a boon to aspiring Arabic speakers the world over! As the Internet becomes more ubiquitous in our lives, so do the available choices to help us become better Arabic speakers. In recent years, streaming services online have proliferated, and they offer an excellent way for you to immerse yourself in the pleasures of Arabic speaking. Jump online and search for "Arabic streaming services," and a plethora of sites will pop up. One of my favorites, which I highly recommend, is the BBC Arabic streaming service. This is a terrific way for you to pick up new words and also stay up-to-date on current events in the Middle East and around the world!


Listen to Arabic Music
Arabic music is one of the liveliest, most melodic, and fun types of music in the world. Because Arabic music is so energetic and fun, you'll pick up new phrases and words without even realizing it! You can choose from a lot of popular Arabic musicians, including: 

الشاب خالد Sheb Khaled from Algeria, who plays راي (rai) music. Rai music is the equivalent of Arabic hip-hop. The singer freestyles over a musical beat or rhythm.
فريد الأطرش Farid al-Atrash, also written as Farid El-Atrache, was a master of the عود ('ūd). The عود is a musical instrument that's similar to the guitar, but unlike a regular guitar, it has a tear-dropped shape with six sets of double strings.
نجاة عتابو Najat Aatabou is a popular folk singer from Morocco.
نانسي عجرم No list of Arabic singers would be complete without Nancy Ajram, perhaps the most famous Arabic pop musician in the world.

Check out any of these artists online, or go to your local music store and browse through the Middle East section for even more possibilities.


Sing Arabic Songs
Singing an أغنية (ugh.niy.yah) (song) is a fun, interactive, and effective way to pick up Arabic. Arabic songs tend to be extremely melodic and soulful, so not only will you enjoy singing a song, but you'll also encounter new vocabulary and identify some of the intonations and beats that make Arabic such a unique language.


Make Arabic-Speaking Friends
Nothing can really substitute for having human contact and human interactions. Making friends who are native or fluent Arabic speakers and carrying on conversations with them in Arabic dramatically improves your speaking and comprehension skills. After all, your friends are in a position to correct you gently and help you use the right expressions, phrases, and sentences in the appropriate contexts. Part of the challenge of picking up a language, especially one like Arabic, lies in the fact that you need to put your language skills — especially vocabulary and expressions — in the right context. Speaking with friends is the best way to do that.


Watch Arabic Movies
Watching Arabic movies can be a lot more fun than watching TV because you aren't interrupted by commercials and you generally have subtitles to follow. Most local movie stores and libraries carry popular Arabic movies on DVD, so you're sure to find something that interests you. Just be sure to get a movie with English subtitles so that you can follow along! Popular streaming services such as Netflix also often carry a number of Arabic movies, complete with subtitles.
 A movie that's worth watching is the Arabic version of Lawrence of Arabia. Another classic movie is The Messenger الرسالة (ar.ri.sā.lah).


Eat at a Middle Eastern Restaurant
Almost every city in the world has at least one Middle Eastern مطعم (maṭ.'am) (restaurant), so find one in your area. Eating at a Middle Eastern restaurant provides you with a safe, fun, and engaging atmosphere in which to practice your language skills by interacting with the waitstaff in Arabic. Order drinks, food, and ask questions about the food preparation in Arabic, and you'll be amazed at how much you'll improve your Arabic reading and comprehension skills. And the restaurant staff are sure to be impressed with both your skill and interest in the language!










Chapter 20
Ten Favorite Arabic Expressions

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Welcoming someone with open arms
 Using religious expressions appropriately
 Sending your regards

Arabic uses a lot of very colorful expressions and words, which is to be expected because Arabic is a very poetic language. Arabic speakers speak Arabic with a burning passion because the words, phrases, and expressions are so descriptive and conjure up strong visual images.
Linguists have studied the language in order to figure out why Arabic tends to be much more flowery and descriptive than most languages. One theory explains this phenomenon by examining the structure of the language itself; unlike in English, adjectives in Arabic always come after the noun. This simple linguistic construct encourages speakers to use adjectives — some would argue they're the main ingredients of poetic sentences — which in turn creates very descriptive sentences. In English, because adjectives come before the noun, you're forced to use a limited number of adjectives before you have to get to the point, the noun.
Whatever the explanation, the passion with which speakers speak Arabic is sometimes hard to translate. However, if you familiarize yourself with some common expressions that make Arabic one of the most poetic languages in the world, you can come close to capturing that spirit! The expressions I cover in this chapter help you get acquainted with popular phrases in Arabic.


مرحباً بكم
(mar.ḥa.ban bi.kum) (Welcome to all of you!)
This term of welcoming is extremely popular with Arabic speakers. They usually say it with a lot of zest and enthusiasm while using animated hand gestures. It's not uncommon for someone to say مرحباً بكم and then proceed to hug you or give you a kiss on the cheek. This expression is a very affectionate form of greeting someone, such as an old friend, a very special guest, or a close family relative. But the relationship doesn't necessarily have to be a close one — if you're ever invited into a Middle Eastern home for a dinner or a lunch, don't be surprised if the host jovially shouts مرحباً بكم and gives you a great big bear hug.
The shortened form of مرحباً بكم is to simply say مرحباً, which literally means "welcome." You may also say مرحباً بكَ (mar.ḥa.ban bi.ka), which is the masculine singular form of مرحباً بكم. (So you use مرحباً بكَ when greeting a male friend and مرحباً بكِ [mar.ḥa.ban bi.ki] to greet a female friend because بكِ is the feminine singular form of بكم.) Finally, if you have a very close relationship with the person you're greeting, you may even use a variation of the following expression: مرحباً يا حبيبي (mar.ḥa.ban yā ḥa.bī.bī) (Welcome my darling [M]) or مرحباً يا حبيبتي (mar.ḥa.ban yā ḥa.bī.ba.tī) (Welcome my darling [F]).


!ممتاز
(mum.tāz) (Excellent!)
This expression is used much like "excellent" is used in English: It's a way to note that something is going very well. For instance, a teacher may tell her students ممتاز if they conjugate a difficult Arabic verb in the past tense, or a fan may yell ممتاز if his hometown team scores a goal against an opponent. ممتاز is used during joyous events or as a sign of encouragement. It's a very positive word that Arabic speakers like to use because it connotes a positive attitude. If you're having a conversation with a native speaker, it's very likely that he or she will use the word a lot for the duration of the conversation. You should do the same.


الحمد لله 
(al.ḥam.du lil.lāh) (Praise to God)
A number of expressions in the Arabic language make reference to God for a very simple reason: as a spoken language, Arabic evolved from the writings of the Quran — Islam's Holy Book — which was recorded soon after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. Muslims believe that the Quran is actually God's words transmitted by the Angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad.
According to Muslim tradition and belief, the Quran is literally God's message to His followers. Therefore, a lot of references to God come directly from the Quran. Although spoken Arabic evolved from a religious language based on the Quran toward one with a more secular and everyday usage, it nevertheless retained many of its references to God. Although they're based on a direct reference to God, many of these phrases are actually used quite casually nowadays.
الحمد لله, which has very wide usage, is a part of everyday Arabic. Arabic speakers say الحمد لله after performing almost any single task, including finishing a meal, drinking water, finishing a project at work, and running an errand. The expression's extensive application goes beyond completing tasks; for example, if someone asks you, كيف الحال (kayf al.ḥāl?) (How are you doing?) you may reply الحمد لله and mean "Praise to God; I'm doing well." Because of its versatility, it's customary to hear الحمد لله quite often when native speakers are talking to each other.


إن شاء الله
(in shā.'a al.lāh) (God willing)
If you've ever watched Arabic speakers on Arabic TV, you've probably heard them use the expression إن شاء الله. This expression, which literally means "If God wishes it" or "If God wills it," is very popular among Arabic speakers when discussing future events. It's almost a rule that whenever someone brings up an event that will take place in the future, the expression إن شاء الله follows soon after.
For example, when someone asks you how you think you're going to do on your next exam, you say أتمنى أن أنجح إن شاء الله (a.ta.man.ná an an.jaḥ in shā.'a al.lāh) (I hope I do well, if God wishes it). Or if someone asks you if your sister is going to start working soon, you say ستبدأ الاثنين إن شاء الله (sa.tab.da' al.'ith.nayn in shā.'a al.lāh) (She starts on Monday, if God wishes it). Politicians in particular like to use this expression when someone asks them when they're going to hold elections. They say وقت قريب إن شاء الله (waqt qa.rīb in shā.'a al.lāh) (Sometime soon, if God wishes it).


!مبروك
(mab.rūk!) (Congratulations!)
The root of the word مبروك is the noun بركة (ba.ra.kah), which means "blessing." مبروك is used at joyous occasions, such as the birth of a baby, a wedding, a graduation ceremony, or another festive event. Though its strict interpretation is "Blessing upon you," مبروك is just like saying "Congratulations." When you say مبروك, make sure you say it with a lot of energy and enthusiasm!


بإذن الله
(bi.'idhn il.lāh) (With God's permission)
This expression is meant to motivate and offer support and guidance, and although this expression contains a reference to God, it's actually a lot less common than expressions such as إن شاء الله or الحمد لله .بإذن الله is used only during very special occasions, such as when one is facing serious challenges or is having difficulty in life, marriage, work, or school. Whenever someone's facing hardship, you can commonly hear him or her say سأواجه هذه الصعوبة بإذن الله (sa.'u.wā.jih hā.dhi.hi aṣ.ṣu.'ū.bah bi.'idhn il.lāh) (I will face this difficulty, with God's permission). You can also use بإذن الله to encourage a friend who's having troubles. You may tell her كل شيء سيكون بخير بإذن الله (kul shay' sa.ya.kūn bi.khayr bi.'idhn il.lāh) (All will go well, with God's permission).


بالصحة
(biṣ.ṣaḥ.ḥah) (With health)
Even though this expression literally means "with health," people don't necessarily use it in a context of encouragement or support like بإذن الله (see the preceding section). Rather, بالصحة is an appropriate thing to say after someone has finished a difficult task and can relax and enjoy himself. For example, if a friend has wrapped up writing a book, closed a big deal, or ended a difficult case, you may say to him بالصحة, which signifies that your friend will be stronger as a result of accomplishing what he's accomplished and now can rest a bit.


تحيات
(ta.ḥiy.yāt) (Regards)
تحيات is a religious term that Muslims use when they're praying. After a Muslim finishes praying, he performs the تحيات by turning once to the right and once to the left, acknowledging the two angels that Muslims believe guard each person.
In addition to its religious affiliation, Arabic speakers commonly use تحيات to send their regards. For instance, a friend may say to you سلّم على أبيك (sal.lim 'a.lá a.bīk) (Say hello to your father for me). Similarly, to send your regards to a friend, you say تحيات.


مبلغ
(mu.bal.lagh) (To be delivered)
مبلغ is an expression that's similar to تحيات in that you use it to send regards. However, unlike تحيات ,مبلغ is a response; that is, you use it after someone sends his or her regards to someone you know. So if someone says to you, سلّم على أخيك (sal.lim 'a.lá 'a.khīk) (Say hello to your brother for me), you respond, مبلغ. Responding with this expression means that you acknowledge the message and thank the person for it on behalf of your sister. So make sure to only say مبلغ after someone sends his or her regards — not before!


تبارك الله
(ta.bā.rak al.lāh) (God be exalted)
This expression is the equivalent of "God bless you" in English; it's most commonly used among close friends or family members to congratulate each other on accomplishments, achievements, or other happy events. For instance, if a son or daughter receives a good grade on an exam, the parents say, تبارك الله. Another very popular use for this expression is to express warmth and joy toward kids.










Chapter 21
Ten Great Arabic Proverbs

IN THIS CHAPTER
 Illuminating the meaning of modesty
 Seeking knowledge
 Expressing the importance of teamwork

Even if you've read only a few chapters of this book, you've probably figured out that Arabic is a very poetic language. One aspect of the language that reinforces its poetic nature is the use of أمثال (am.thāl) (proverbs). Proverbs play an important role in the Arabic language. If you're having a conversation with an Arabic speaker or listening to Arabic speakers converse among themselves, don't be surprised to hear proverbs peppered throughout the conversation. This chapter introduces you to some of the more common and flowery proverbs of the Arabic language.


الأمثال نور الكلام
(al.'am.thāl nūr al.ka.lām.) (Proverbs are the light of speech.)
The role of proverbs in Arabic is so important that there's a proverb on the importance of proverbs!


اعمل خيراً وألقه في البحر
(i'.mal khay.ran wa.al.qi.hi fī al.baḥr.) (Do a good deed and cast it into the sea.)
Arab culture emphasizes humility and modesty. This proverb means that when you commit a charitable act, you shouldn't go around boasting about it; rather, you should "cast it into the sea" where no one can find out about it.


اطلبوا العلم من المهد إلى اللحد
(uṭ.lu.bū al.'ilm min al.mahd i.lá al.laḥd.) (Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave.)
العلم (al.'ilm) (knowledge) is an important virtue in Arabic culture. Arabs have produced some of the greatest legal, medical, and scientific minds in history, in no small part because Arabs like to instill in their children a lifelong desire to learn and continue learning every single day of one's existence.


يد واحدة لا تصفّق
(yadd wā.ḥi.dah lā tu.ṣaf.fiq.) (A hand by itself cannot clap.)
This proverb, which is common in the West but originates in Arab culture, underscores the importance of teamwork, cooperation, and collaboration.


الحرباء لا يغادر شجرته حتى يكون مؤكداً على شجرة أخرى
(al.ḥir.bā' lā yu.ghā.di.ru sha.ja.ra.tu.hu ḥat.tá ya.kū.na mu.'ak.ki.dan 'a.lá sha.ja.rah ukh.r.á) (The chameleon does not leave his tree until he is sure of another.)
This proverb stresses the importance of foresight, planning, and looking ahead. A chameleon that is mindful of predators won't change trees until it knows that it'll be safe in the next tree it goes to.


خطأ معروف أحسن من حقيقة غير معروفة
(kha.ṭa' ma'.rūf aḥ.san min ḥa.qī.qah ghayr ma'.rū.fah.) (A known mistake is better than an unknown truth.)
This metaphysical proverb has a deep meaning: It's better for you to identify and learn from a mistake than to not know a truth at all. In the debate of known versus unknown knowledge, this proverb indicates that knowing is better than not knowing, even if what you know is not an absolute truth.


السرّ مثل الحمامة: عندما يغادر يدي يطير
(as.sirr mithl al.ḥa.mā.mah: 'in.da.mā yu.ghā.dir ya.dī ya.ṭīr.) (A secret is like a dove: When it leaves my hand, it flies away.)
A secret is meant to be kept close to your chest — in other words, you shouldn't divulge a secret. As soon as you let out a secret, it flies away and spreads around. Just as a dove won't leave unless you release it, a secret won't become known unless you divulge it.


العقل للنظر والقلب للسمع
(al.'aql lin.na.ẓar wal.qalb lis.sa.ma'.) (The mind is for seeing, and the heart is for hearing.)
The mind is to be used for analytical purposes: observation and analysis. The heart, on the other hand, is for emotions; you should listen and feel with your heart.


كل يوم من حياتك صفحة من تاريخك
(kul yawm min ḥa.yā.tak ṣaf.ḥah min tā.rī.khak.) (Every day of your life is a page of your history.)
You only live one life, so you should enjoy every single day. At the end, each day's experiences are what make up your history.


اللي فاتك بليلة فاتك بحيلة
(il.lī fā.tak bi.lī.la fā.tak bi.ḥī.lah.) (He who surpasses [is older than] you by one night surpasses you by one idea.)
In Arabic culture and society, maturity and respect for elders is a highly regarded virtue. This proverb reinforces the idea that elders are respected, and their counsel is often sought.

Amine has been teaching Arabic and lecturing about relations between the United States and the Arab world in his spare time for more than 15 years and has offered classes and seminars for students at Middlebury College, the Council on Foreign Relations, and various schools across the United States. He runs and maintains the website www.al-baab.com (which means "gateway" in Arabic).
Amine published his first book, Arabic: A Complete Course (Random House), soon after graduating college in order to help an international audience understand Arabic language and culture. He has written Arabic For Dummies, 3rd Edition in order to reach an even wider audience with the aim of fostering better relations through education.

He is a registered investment advisor and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers. Amine is also the author of Investing in Commodities For Dummies (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).

Dedication
This book is dedicated to my greatest and most steadfast supporters — my family. To my mother for her infinite and unwavering support, and to my sister, Myriam, for her enthusiasm and passion — you are my greatest inspirations.
To my father and grandfather, may you rest in peace, thank you for instilling in me such a deep respect and awareness of my roots and culture. I am honored to be part of the Bouchentouf family.
And to my late grandmother, thanks for always believing in me.
