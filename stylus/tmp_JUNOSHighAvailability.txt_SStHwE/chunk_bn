As a final test, if possible, you should power down and then power up the
    router again, and leave it running for at least 48 hours. After this
    period, check the system logs and boards status.




Power Down the Router



To power down the router, first stop the backup RE:

lab@r1-re0> request routing-engine login other-routing-engine
lab@r1-re1> request system halt
After a few seconds, the backup RE will stop, and your Telnet session will fall
      back to the master RE. After this, stop the master RE:

lab@r1-re0> request system halt
Both REs are now halted. Turn the power off.





Power On the Router/Burn-In Test



Connect a console cable to RE 0
      (capturing any messages on file), and turn the power on. Check for any
      active alarms and the status of the router boards. Check the content of
      the messages log for any error with
      the show log messages
      command.
The router must be left powered on for one or two days.





Final Checks and Power Down



Be sure to check that the uptime for all the FPCs and SFMs is about the same. If it is not, this means one of
      the boards has restarted during the burn-in periodâ€”check in the logs for
      details. Here is sample output from an M10i router:

lab@r1-re0> show chassis fpc detail

  Uptime:                          1 days, 18 hours, 22 minutes, 54 seconds
In this example, FPC2 restarted
      one day and 18 hours ago; this indicates a possible problem. Check the
      system and chassisid logs around the time of the FPC
      reset; this should provide enough information to understand why the
      board restarted.














Appendix B. Configuration Audit



The next few pages provide an example of an audit configuration checklist. In any configuration audit, it
  is important to have the group responsible for the configuration functional
  area to do quality control against their portion of the template or the
  configuration scripts used to automate configuration. Once the baseline
  templates and scripts exist, each portion of the configuration can be
  compared against the template (in the case of predeployment auditing) or the
  baseline configuration (in the case of production equipment auditing). The
  audit itself can be conducted using manual checks of the equipment,
  configuration audits using JUNOScope, or a combination of both. As each
  portion of the configuration is audited, the auditor marks how the
  configuration has been made and audited.
