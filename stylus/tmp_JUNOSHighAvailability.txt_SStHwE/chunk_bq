        for restart.

Description
Define tracing operations that gracefully restart functionality in the
        router. To specify more than one tracing operation, include multiple
        flag statements.



Default
If you do not include this statement, no global tracing
        operations are performed.



Options




disable



(Optional) Disable the tracing operation. You can use this
              option to disable a single operation when you have defined a
              broad group of tracing operations, such as all.



file name



Name of the file to receive the output of the tracing
              operation. Enclose the name within quotation marks. All files
              are placed in the directory /var/log. (It's recommended that you
              place global routing protocol tracing output in the file
              routing-log.)



files number



(Optional) Maximum number of trace files. When a trace
              file named trace-file
              reaches its maximum size, it is renamed trace-file.0, then trace-file.1, and so on, until the
              maximum number of trace files is reached. Then the oldest trace
              file is overwritten. Range: 2-1,000 files. Default: two
              files.

Note
If you specify a maximum number of files, you also must
                specify a maximum file size with the size option.




flag flag



Tracing operation to perform. To specify more than one
              tracing operation, include multiple flag statements. The NSR
              tracing option is:




graceful-restart



Tracing operations for NSR.






size size



(Optional) Maximum size of each trace file, in KB, MB, or
              GB. When a trace file named trace-file reaches this size, it is
              renamed trace-file.0. When
              the trace-file again
              reaches its maximum size, trace-file.0 is renamed trace-file.1 and trace-file is renamed trace-file.0. This renaming scheme
              continues until the maximum number of trace files is reached.
              Then the oldest trace file is overwritten. Syntax: xk to specify KB, xm to specify MB, or xg to specify GB. Range: 10 KB through
              the maximum file size supported on your system. Default: 128 KB.




Note
If you specify a maximum file size, you also must specify a
          maximum number of trace files with the files option.
