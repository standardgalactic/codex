Description
Configure a VRRP IPv4 authentication key. You also must specify a
        VRRP authentication scheme by including the authentication-type statement. All routers
        in the VRRP group must use the same authentication scheme and
        password.



Option




key



Authentication password. For simple authentication, it can
              be one through eight characters long. For MD5 authentication, it
              can be 1 through 16 characters long. If you include spaces,
              enclose all characters in quotation marks (" ").

          vrrp-group group-id]





Description
Enable VRRP IPv4 authentication and specify the authentication scheme for
        the VRRP group. If you enable authentication, you must specify a
        password by including the authentication-key statement. All routers in
        the VRRP group must use the same authentication scheme and
        password.



Option




authentication



Authentication scheme:




simple



Use a simple password. The password is included in
                    the transmitted packet, making this method of
                    authentication relatively insecure.



md5



Use the MD5 algorithm to create an encoded checksum
                    of the packet. The encoded checksum is included in the
                    transmitted packet. The receiving routing platform uses
                    the authentication key to verify the packet, discarding it
                    if the digest does not match. This algorithm provides a
                    more secure authentication scheme.









Default
None (no authentication is performed).

Description
Specify the bandwidth threshold for VRRP logical interface

Bandwidth threshold for the tracked interface. When the
              bandwidth of the tracked interface drops below the specified
              value, the VRRP group uses the bandwidth threshold priority cost
              value. You can include up to five bandwidth threshold statements
              for each interface you track. Range: 1-10,000,000,000,000 bits

        becomes the master.



Option




priority



The value subtracted from the configured VRRP priority
              when the tracked interface or route is down, forcing a new

        the dynamic priority changes because of a tracking event, the priority
        hold timer begins. If another tracking event or manual configuration

[edit protocols vrrp]





Description
Define tracing operations for the VRRP process. To specify more
        than one tracing operation, include multiple flag statements. By
        default, VRRP logs the error, DCD configuration, and routing socket
        events in a file in the directory /var/log.



Default
If you do not include this statement, no VRRP-specific tracing
        operations are performed.



Options




filename filename



Name of the file to receive the output of the tracing
              operation. Enclose the name within quotation marks. All files
              are placed in the directory /var/log. By default, VRRP tracing
              output is placed in the file vrrpd.



files number



(Optional) Maximum number of trace files. When a trace
              file named trace-file
              reaches its maximum size, it is renamed trace-file.0, then trace-file.1, and so on, until the
              maximum number of trace files is reached. When the maximum
              number is reached, the oldest trace file is overwritten. Range:
              0-4,294,967,296 files. Default: three files.

Note
If you specify a maximum number of files, you also must
                specify a maximum file size with the size option.
