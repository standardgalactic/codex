flag flag



Tracing operation to perform. To specify more than one
              tracing operation, include multiple flag statements. These are
              the VRRP-specific tracing options:




all



All VRRP tracing operations.



database



Database changes.



general



General events.



interfaces



Interface changes.



normal



Normal events.



packets



Packets sent and received.



state



State transitions.



timer



Timer events.






match regex



(Optional) Refine the output to include only those lines
              that match the given regular expression.



microsecond-stamp



(Optional) Provide a timestamp with microsecond
              granularity.



size size



(Optional) Maximum size of each trace file, in KB, MB, or
              GB. When a trace file named trace-file reaches this size, it is
              renamed trace-file.0. When
              the trace-file again
              reaches its maximum size, trace-file.0 is renamed trace-file.1 and trace-file is renamed trace-file.0. This renaming scheme
              continues until the maximum number of trace files is reached.
              Then the oldest trace file is overwritten. Syntax: xk to specify KB, xm to specify MB, or xg to specify GB. Range: 10 KB through
              the maximum file size supported on your routing platform.
              Default: 1 MB.

Note
If you specify a maximum file size, you also must
                specify a maximum number of trace files with the files option.

traceoptions {

}



Hierarchy level


[edit protocols bfd]





Description
Define tracing operations that track unified ISSU functionality
        in the router. To specify more than one tracing operation, include
        multiple flag statements.



Default
If you do not include this statement, no global tracing
        operations are performed.



Options




disable



(Optional) Disable the tracing operation. You can use this
              option to disable a single operation when you have defined a
              broad group of tracing operations, such as all.



file name



Name of the file to receive the output of the tracing
              operation. Enclose the name within quotation marks. All files
              are placed in the directory /var/log. We recommend that you place
              global routing protocol tracing output in the file routing-log.



files number



(Optional) Maximum number of trace files. When a trace
              file named trace-file
              reaches its maximum size, it is renamed trace-file.0, then trace-file.1, and so on, until the
              maximum number of trace files is reached. Then the oldest trace
              file is overwritten. Range: 2-1,000 files. Default: two
              files.

Note
If you specify a maximum number of files, you also must
                specify a maximum file size with the size option.




flag flag



Tracing operation to perform. There is only one unified
              ISSU tracing option:




issu



Trace BFD unified ISSU operations.






size size



(Optional) Maximum size of each trace file, in KB, MB, or
              GB. When a trace file named trace-file reaches this size, it is
              renamed trace-file.0. When
              the trace-file again
              reaches its maximum size, trace-file.0 is renamed trace-file.1 and trace-file is renamed trace-file.0. This renaming scheme
              continues until the maximum number of trace files is reached.
              Then the oldest trace file is overwritten. Syntax: xk to specify KB, xm to specify MB, or xg to specify GB. Range: 10 KB through
              the maximum file size supported on your system. Default: 128 KB.

Note
If you specify a maximum file size, you also must
                specify a maximum number of trace files with the files option.














IndexA note on the digital index
A link in an index entry is displayed as the section title in which that entry appears. Because some sections have multiple index markers,
            it is not unusual for an entry to have several links to the same section. Clicking on any link will take you directly to the place in the text
            in which the marker appears.

Colophon
The animals on the cover of JUNOS High
  Availability are Bohemian waxwings (Bombycilla garrulus). The generic name
  Bombycilla, Latin for "silk tail," describes the bird's
  sleek, soft plumage. Waxwing refers to the red tips of
  the wing feathers that resemble drops of wax. Three species of waxwings
  exist: Japanese, Cedar, and Bohemian. These species are fairly similar in
  appearance and are primarily distinguished by geography: the Japanese
  waxwing lives exclusively in Asia; the Cedar inhabits North America; and the
  Bohemian—true to its name—travels throughout the sub-Arctic continents in nomadic flocks, particularly in
  winter as it searches for berries. The two latter waxwings have the most in
  common, although Cedars are more prevalent in the northeastern United
  States, whereas Bohemians are numerous in western Canada and the Rocky
  Mountain region. All three waxwings subsist on a diet of fruit and
  insects.
Another difference between the species is seen in the edges of the
  wing feathers: Bohemian and Japanese
  waxwings have white edges, while Cedars do not. At six to nine inches long,
  the Bohemian is also larger and grayer than the Cedar, although both have
  yellow tail feather tips and a pointed crest. The Bohemian waxwing's call is
  extremely similar to the Cedar's, most likely because the Bohemian has no
  territory to defend and thus has never needed to develop a true song.
The cover image is from the Dover Pictorial Archive. The cover font is
  Adobe ITC Garamond. The text font is Linotype Birka; the heading font is
