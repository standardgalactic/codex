Appendix C. High Availability Configuration Statements



This appendix supplies a summary of JUNOS configuration statements arranged by various high
  availability features.













Routing Engine and Switching Control Board
















Name
cfeb




cfeb slot-number (always | preferred);



Hierarchy level


[edit chassis redundancy]





Description
On M10i routers only, configure which Compact Forwarding
        Engine Board (CFEB) is the master and which is the backup.



Default
By default, the CFEB in slot 0 is the master and the CFEB in
        slot 1 is the backup.



Options




slot-number



Specify which slot is the master and which is the
              backup.



always



Define this CFEB as the sole device.



preferred



Define this CFEB as the preferred device of at least
              two.

















Name
description




description description;



Hierarchy level


[edit chassis redundancy feb redundancy redundancy-group
          name]





Description
Provide a description of the FEB redundancy group.



Option




description



Provide a description for the FEB redundancy group.

















Name
failover on-disk-failure




failover on-disk-failure;



Hierarchy level


[edit chassis redundancy]





Description
Instruct the backup router to take mastership if it detects hard disk
        errors on the master routing engine (RE).














Name
failover on-loss-of-keepalives




failover on-loss-of-keepalives;



Hierarchy level


[edit chassis redundancy]





Description
Instruct the backup router to take mastership if it detects a loss of
        keepalive signals from the master RE.



Default
If the failover
        on-loss-of-keepalives statement at the [edit chassis
        redundancy] hierarchy level is not included and Graceful Routing
        Engine Switchover (GRES) is not enabled, failover cannot occur. When the
        failover on-loss-of-keepalives
        statement is included and GRES is not configured, failover occurs
        after 300 seconds (five minutes). When the failover on-loss-of-keepalives statement is
        included and GRES is configured, the keepalive signal is automatically
        enabled and the failover time is set to two seconds. You cannot
        manually reset the keepalive time.














Name
failover other-routing-engine




failover other-routing-engine;



Hierarchy level


[edit system processes process-name]





Description
Instruct the backup RE to take mastership if a software process
        fails. If this statement is configured for a process and that process
        fails four times within 30 seconds, the router reboots from the backup
        RE.



Option




process-name



One of the valid software process names. A few examples
              are disk-monitoring,
              ethernet-link-fault-management,
              kernel-replication,
              redundancy-interface-process, and vrrp.

















Name
feb (Creating a Redundancy Group)




feb {
   redundancy-groupgroup-name {
      description description;
      febslot-number (backup | primary);
      no-auto-failoverr;
   }
}



Hierarchy level


[edit chassis redundancy]





Description
On M120 routers only, configure an FEB redundancy group.



Options
The remaining statements are described separately.














Name
feb (Assigning a FEB to a Redundancy Group)




feb slot-number (backup | primary);



Hierarchy level


[edit chassis redundancy feb
          redundancy-groupgroup-name]





Description
On M120 routers only, configure an FEB as part of an FEB
        redundancy group.



Options




slot-number



Slot number of the FEB. Range: 0-5.



backup



For each redundancy group, you must configure exactly one
              backup FEB.



primary



(Optional) For each redundancy group, you can optionally
              configure one primary FEB.

















Name
keepalive-time




keepalive-time seconds;



Hierarchy level


[edit chassis redundancy]





Description
Configure the time period that must elapse before the backup
        router takes mastership when it detects loss of the keepalive
        signal.



Default
If the failover
        on-loss-of-keepalives statement at the [edit chassis
        redundancy] hierarchy level is not included and GRES is not enabled,
        failover cannot occur. When the failover
        on-loss-of-keepalives statement is included and GRES is not
        configured, failover occurs after 300 seconds (five minutes). When the
        failover on-loss-of-keepalives
        statement is included and GRES is configured, the keepalive signal is
        automatically enabled and the failover time is set to two seconds. You
        cannot manually reset the keepalive time.



Option




seconds



Time before the backup router takes mastership when it
              detects loss of the keepalive signal. Range: 2-10,000.

















Name
no-auto-failover




no-auto-failover;



Hierarchy level


[edit chassis redundancy feb
          redundancy-groupgroup-name]





Description
Disable automatic failover to a backup FEB when an active FEB in
        a redundancy group fails.



Default
Automatic failover is enabled by default.
