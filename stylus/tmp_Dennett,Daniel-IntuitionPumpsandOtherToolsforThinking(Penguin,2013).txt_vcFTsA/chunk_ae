I. INTRODUCTION
The whimsical jailer and the jewels in the trashcan are drawn with revisions from Elbow Room (Dennett, 1984a).
II. A DOZEN GENERAL THINKING TOOLS
1. "Making Mistakes" began as "How to Make Mistakes" (Dennett, 1995b).
2. " 'By Parody of Reasoning' " has not been published before.
3. "Rapoport's Rules." The rules were first presented by me in print in my reflections on Dawkins's The God Delusion in Free Inquiry (Dennett, 2007a).
4. "Sturgeon's Law." The law was discussed in "Holding a Mirror up to Dupré" (Dennett, 2004).
5. "Occam's Razor" has not been published before.
6. "Occam's Broom." The coinage is attributed on many websites to Sydney Brenner. Apparently he has not published anything about it.
7. "Using Lay Audiences as Decoys" has not been published before.
8. "Jootsing" includes material drawn from "I Could Not Have Done Otherwise—So What?" (Dennett, 1984b).
9. "Three Species of Goulding" is drawn from "Confusion over Evolution: An Exchange" (Dennett, 1993) and "Shall We Tango? No, But Thanks for Asking" (Dennett, 2011b).
10. "The 'Surely' Operator" grew out of remarks in "Get Real" (Dennett, 1994a).
11. "Rhetorical Questions" has not been published before.
12. "What Is a Deepity?" draws on material in "With a Little Help from My Friends" (Dennett, 2000).
III. TOOLS FOR THINKING ABOUT MEANING OR CONTENT
13. "Murder in Trafalgar Square" is drawn from "Three Kinds of Intentional Psychology" (Dennett, 1981).
14. "An Older Brother Living in Cleveland" is drawn from "Brain Writing and Mind Reading" (Dennett, 1975).
15. " 'Daddy Is a Doctor' " is drawn from Content and Consciousness (Dennett, 1969).
16. "Manifest Image and Scientific Image" includes material drawn from "Expecting Ourselves to Expect" (Dennett, forthcoming); "Sakes and Dints" (Dennett, 2012); and "Kinds of Things" (Dennett, forthcoming). The discussion of anteaters and birds is drawn from Elbow Room (Dennett, 1984a).
17. "Folk Psychology" is drawn from "Three Kinds of Intentional Psychology" (Dennett, 1981).
18. "The Intentional Stance" is drawn from "Intentional Systems" (Dennett, 1971) and The Intentional Stance (Dennett, 1987) and is discussed in many other books and articles.
19. "The Personal/Sub-personal Distinction" is drawn from Content and Consciousness (Dennett, 1969).
20. "A Cascade of Homunculi" draws on Brainstorms (Dennett, 1978) and a piece on Edge.org (Dennett, 2008), later published in What Have You Changed Your Mind About (Brockman, 2009).
21. "The Sorta Operator" has not been published before, but themes in it are developed in "Turing's 'Strange Inversion of Reason' " (Dennett, forthcoming).
22. "Wonder Tissue." The term was first used in print in "Natural Freedom" (Dennett, 2005a). My thanks to Christof Koch for drawing my attention to the quotation from William Bateson.
23. "Trapped in the Robot Control Room" is drawn from "Current Issues in the Philosophy of Mind" (Dennett, 1978b).
IV. AN INTERLUDE ABOUT COMPUTERS
24. "The Seven Secrets of Computer Power Revealed" grew out of an introductory course in computer science that George Smith, David Isles, and I taught at Tufts, remarkably assisted by undergraduate computer science major Steve Barney. Steve became the lead programmer at the Curricular Software Studio at Tufts, a project funded by the Sloan Foundation after seeing the simulated computer, AESOP, created by Steve for that course. RodRego was inspired by AESOP, and first programmed in Logo by me in 1986—I called it Rego and the pointy-headed homunculus in the figure on p. 118 is a fossil trace of the Logo "turtle." It was then redone in more portable and robust versions, first by Rod Da Silva—RodRego—and then revised by Nikolai Shvertner at the Curricular Software Studio.
25. "Virtual Machines." These machines have been discussed by me in many places, including "Notes on Prosthetic Imagination" (Dennett, 1982d) (the manifesto that led to the creation of the Curricular Software Studio), Consciousness Explained (Dennett, 1991a), and "The Practical Requirements for Making a Conscious Robot" (Dennett, 1994b).
26. "Algorithms" draws on material from Darwin's Dangerous Idea (Dennett, 1995a).
27. "Automating the Elevator" was first presented by me in "Varieties of Content" at a symposium held at the University of Copenhagen in 2007 (Dennett, 2007c). It has not been published before.
The "Summary" includes ideas from "Turing's 'Strange Inversion of Reasoning' " (Dennett, forthcoming).

41. "Do Locusts Understand Prime Numbers?" is drawn with revisions from Darwin's Dangerous Idea (Dennett, 1995a).
42. "How to Explain Stotting" is new.
43. "Beware of the Prime Mammal" is drawn with revisions from Freedom Evolves (Dennett, 2003).
44. "When Does Speciation Occur?" is drawn with revisions from "The Multiple Drafts Model" (Dennett and Akins, 2008).
45. "Widowmakers, Mitochondrial Eve, and Retrospective Coronations" is drawn with revisions from Darwin's Dangerous Idea (1995a).

53. "Two Counter-images" includes material drawn from Consciousness Explained (Dennett, 1991a) and Sweet Dreams (Dennett, 2005b).
54. "The Zombic Hunch." The Zombic Hunch was defined in Sweet Dreams (Dennett, 2005b).
55. "Zombies and Zimboes" draws with revisions on material in Consciousness Explained (Dennett, 1991a).
56. "The Curse of the Cauliflower" draws with revisions on material from "Quining Qualia" (Dennett, 1988a).

61. "The Teleclone Fall from Mars to Earth" is drawn with revisions from The Mind's I (Hofstadter and Dennett, 1981).
62. "The Self as the Center of Narrative Gravity." This tool was first described in "Why Everyone Is a Novelist" (Dennett, 1988b).
63. "Heterophenomenology." Heterophenomenology was first described in "How to Study Consciousness Empirically: or Nothing Comes to Mind" (Dennett, 1982b). This was further elaborated in a chapter of Consciousness Explained (Dennett, 1991a). A special issue of Phenomenology and Cognitive Science (vol. 6, nos. 1 and 2), guest-edited by Alva Noë, is devoted to heterophenomenology, and comprises most of the best subsequent thinking on the topic. It includes my reply to the essays, "Heterophenomenology Reconsidered" (Dennett, 2007b).
64. "Mary the Color Scientist: A Boom Crutch Unveiled" draws with revisions on Consciousness Explained (Dennett, 1991a) and "What RoboMary Knows" (Dennett, 2007d), which appears in the second of the two anthologies devoted to "Mariology," the first one being Ludlow, Nagasawa, and Stoljar, 2004.
VIII. TOOLS FOR THINKING ABOUT FREE WILL
65. "A Truly Nefarious Neurosurgeon" is drawn from my Erasmus Lecture, "Erasmus: Sometimes a Spin-Doctor Is Right" in 2012.
66. "A Deterministic Toy: Conway's Game of Life." Martin Gardner introduced the game of Life to a wide audience in two of his "Mathematical Games" columns in Scientific American, in October 1970 and February 1971. Poundstone (1985) provides an excellent exploration of the game and its philosophical implications. There's also a decent Wikipedia article on it, with lots of links. I've often used the game of Life in my writing. This version is drawn with revisions from the account in Freedom Evolves (Dennett, 2003).
67. "Rock, Paper, and Scissors" has not previously been published.
68. "Two Lotteries" is drawn with revisions from Elbow Room (Dennett, 1984a).
69. "Inert Historical Facts" is drawn with revisions from "Get Real" (Dennett, 1994a). Tanmoy Bhattacharya drew my attention to the quantum complications.

71. "Ultimate Responsibility" has not been published before.
72. "Sphexishness" has not been published before.
73. "The Boys from Brazil: Another Boom Crutch" has not been published before.

75. "Philosophy as Naïve Auto-anthropology" is drawn with revisions from "Sakes and Dints" (Dennett, 2012), and "Kinds of Things" (Dennett, forthcoming).
76. "Higher-Order Truths of Chmess" is drawn, with revisions, from "The Higher-Order Truths about Chmess" (Dennett, 2006c).
77. "The 10 Percent That's Good" has not been published before.












* Words and phrases in boldface are the names of tools for thinking described and discussed in more detail elsewhere in the book. Look in the index to find them, since some of them do not get a whole piece to themselves.


* Aesop, like Homer, is almost as mythic as his fables, which were transmitted orally for centuries before they were first written down a few hundred years before the era of Plato and Socrates. Aesop may not have been Greek; there is circumstantial evidence that he was Ethiopian.


* The philosopher W. V. O. Quine (1960) called this semantic ascent, going up from talking about electrons or justice or horses or whatever to talking about talking about electrons or justice or horses or whatever. Sometimes people object to this move by philosophers ("With you folks, it's all just semantics!"), and sometimes the move is indeed useless or even bamboozling, but when it's needed, when people are talking past each other, or being fooled by tacit assumptions about what their own words mean, semantic ascent, or going meta, is the key to clarity.


* Many of the passages in this book have been drawn from books and articles I have previously published, revised to make them more portable and versatile, fit for use in contexts other than the original—a feature of most good tools. For instance, the opening story about von Neumann appeared in my 1995 book Darwin's Dangerous Idea, and this discussion of Hofstadter's hand tools appeared in my 2009 PNAS paper, "Darwin's 'Strange Inversion of Reasoning.' " Instead of footnoting all of these, I provide a list of sources at the end of the book.


* Two of the best: "Philosophy is to science what pigeons are to statues," and "Philosophy is to science as pornography is to sex: it is cheaper, easier and some people prefer it." (I'll leave these unattributed, but their authors can choose to claim them if they wish.)













* This doesn't give navigators their actual position, a point on the globe, but it does give them a line. They are somewhere on that line of position (LOP). Wait a few hours until the sun has moved on quite a bit. Then choose a point on your LOP, any point, and calculate how high the sun would be now if that point were exactly the right choice. Make the observation, compare the results, apply the correction, and get another LOP. Where it crosses your first LOP is the point where you are. The sun will have changed not only its height but also its compass bearing during those hours so the lines will cross at a pretty good angle. In practice, you are usually moving during those few hours, so you advance your first LOP in the direction you are moving by calculating your speed and drawing an advanced LOP parallel to the original LOP. In real life everything has a bit of slop in it, so you try to get three different LOPs. If they all intersect in exactly the same point, you're either incredibly good or incredibly lucky, but more commonly they form a small triangle, called a cocked hat. You consider yourself in the middle of the cocked hat, and that's your new calculated position.


* That is the ideal, but we don't always live up to it, human nature being what it is. One of the recognized but unsolved problems with current scientific practice is that negative results—experiments that didn't uncover what they were designed to uncover—are not published often enough. This flaw in the system is famously explored and deplored in Feynman's "Cargo Cult Lecture," a commencement address he gave at Caltech in 1974, reprinted in Feynman, 1985.













* My other indelible memory of that conference was of Popper's dip in the Grand Canal. He slipped getting out of the motorboat at the boathouse of the Isola di San Giorgio and fell feet first into the canal, submerged up to his knees before being plucked out and set on the pier by two nimble boatmen. The hosts were mortified and ready to rush back to the hotel to get nonagenarian Sir Karl a dry pair of trousers, but the pants he was wearing was the only pair he'd brought—and he was scheduled to lead off the conference in less than half an hour! Italian ingenuity took over, and within about five minutes I enjoyed an unforgettable sight: Sir Karl, sitting regally on a small chair in the exact middle of a marble-floored, domed room (Palladio designed it) surrounded by at least half a dozen young women in miniskirts, on their knees, plying his trouser legs with their hairdryers. The extension cords stretched radially to the walls, making of the tableau a sort of multicolored human daisy, with Sir Karl, unperturbed but unsmiling, in the center. Fifteen minutes later he was dry and pounding his fist on the podium to add emphasis to his dualistic vision.













* Maritime law is notoriously complicated, strewn with hidden traps and escape clauses that only an expert, a sea lawyer, can keep track of, so sea-lawyering is using technicalities to evade responsibility or assign blame to others.
† The Axelrod tournament (Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981; Axelrod, 1984) opened up the blossoming field of theoretical research on the evolution of altruism. I give an introductory account in Darwin's Dangerous Idea (Dennett, 1995, pp. 479-480), and in more recent times there has been an explosion of variations, both simulations and experiments, in laboratories around the world. Rapoport's wonderfully simple implementation of the idea "I won't hit you if you don't hit me" is the seed from which all the later studies and models have grown.


* The formulation of Rapoport's Rules here is my own, done from memory of correspondence with Rapoport many years ago, now apparently lost. Samuel Ruth recently pointed out to me that the original source of Rapoport's Rules is in his book Fights, Games, and Debates (1960) and his paper "Three Modes of Conflict" (1961), which articulates rule 1, attributing it to Carl Rogers, and variations on the rest of the rules. My version is somewhat more portable and versatile.













* Not to be outdone, the philosopher Jerry Fodor (2008) has adopted the practice of putting his "surely"s in italics—and repeating them (e.g., p. 38), as if to say, Take that, doubters! Take that, doubters!













* Miriam encountered my use of her term on the Internet recently and got in touch with me. Her own version of its coining is somewhat different, but in the same spirit: "In my family it carries a bit of scorn—an idea masquerading as Truth in order to elevate the speaker." She has graciously consented to my use of the version her father told me (as I recall it), and to my rather narrower redefinition of her brilliant neologism.













* They can, some enthusiasts will say, in languages we haven't discovered or translated yet. This is a perennially attractive idea, but the exhaustive studies of ape, bird, and dolphin communication conducted in recent years show that animals' ability to "share their thoughts" is very limited. If that's language, then termites are engineers, praying mantises have religion, and wolves have parliaments.
† Jerry Fodor (1975) brandished this rhetorical question very effectively in his pioneering book, The Language of Thought, and emphasized its implied answer by citing Lyndon Johnson's defiant observation "I'm the only President you've got" (p. 27).













* This conclusion is often called the holism of the mental (or the intentional); holism has been staunchly denied by Jerry Fodor, who claims to have no trouble imagining a creature with exactly one belief (Fodor and Lepore, 1992).













* We will consider the important details of this example in chapter 27.
† I apologize to those of you who like to fantasize about what it's like to be a daisy, and I offer the concept of the Umwelt as a consolation: it lets you do justice to the very real discriminatory prowess of a daisy without going overboard.













* Among those credited with this aphorism are the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, the artist Paul Klee, and the critic Viktor Shklovsky.













* The exceptions help us see the contrast. One of the clearest symptoms of autism, severe and mild, in its various forms, is difficulty with folk psychology. Those with autism who manage to interpret other people at all, such as Temple Grandin, really do seem to rely on a hard-won theory. Where we view others effortlessly and, indeed, involuntarily understand the meanings of gestures and smiles and circumstances, she has to deduce these implications of what she observes. She has resourcefully gathered evidence so that she can identify the hallmarks of a friendly greeting as opposed to a threat, and tell when people are agreeing on something. She has taught herself to identify promises and purchases, telling jokes and telling lies. The character Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory is a well-known fictional example of somebody with Asperger's syndrome, a mild form of autism, and we see and hear his brilliant scientific mind churning away, inferring the details of the situations he is confronted with as if he were analyzing the effects of catalysts in chemical reactions in a test tube. Temple Grandin, and the fictional Sheldon Cooper, clearly have a theory of mind. If we others do as well, it is not much like their theories.


* I called it the "intentional" stance instead of, say, the "rational agent" stance or the "belief-desire" stance because at the time (1971) much of the work by philosophers on intentionality involved the logic of the "intentional idioms" that serve to report on the propositional attitudes of belief, desire, expectation. It is the aboutness alluded to in these idioms that not only raise logical problems but also point to solutions. A belief or a sentence can be about something that does not exist, such as Santa Claus, and a desire can be for something that doesn't exist: the Fountain of Youth or just a cold glass of water in the middle of a desert. The intentional stance is about what agents are thinking about. It is not something that we intentionally adopt in the normal course of things; it is typically involuntary and seldom noticed.


* My 1983 target article in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, "Intentional Systems in Cognitive Ethology: The 'Panglossian Paradigm' Defended," provides the details, accompanied by a fascinating chorus of objections and rebuttals. For a more recent elaboration of the intentional stance and a further rebuttal to the common objections, see my essay "Intentional Systems Theory" (2009c), from which portions of this section are derived.













* This is the central claim argued in my book Consciousness Explained (1991a); the idea of such a special place—I call it the Cartesian Theater—is apparently indomitably tempting, for many thinkers still don't get it, in spite of all the reasons advanced by me and others.


* It is not often remarked that in that favorite thought experiment of philosophers, the brain in the vat, the living brain has to have had a life in a body to configure all the hardware with the software of years of experience. If you were "just" to build a brain from scratch, letting the connections between elements be whatever they happened to be (wiring up the brand-new brain at random, in other words), the probability of the brain having any competence, harboring any coherent ideas or intentions or projects, or any (apparent) memories would be Vanishing (see chapter 35). See also chapter 32.













* Proof of concept is a useful but dangerous bit of engineering jargon: asked to design a very sophisticated and complicated widget, you design a very simple widget—you solve what is nicely called a toy problem—and when it works on its stripped-down task, you declare that you have "proof of concept" and now it's "just" a matter of scaling up to the fully competent widget that was requested, which will require only more time and money; the hard, conceptual problem has been "solved." Sometimes this works just as advertised.


* Not everybody likes this idea. A recent book, Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience (2003), the collaborative effort of a neuroscientist, Max Bennett, and a philosopher, P. M. S. Hacker, heaps scorn on it. For a detailed rebuttal (and their rebuttal to my rebuttal), see Bennett et al., 2009.













* For an overview and introduction, see my "Logical Geography of Computational Approaches: A View from the East Pole" (1986). For the definitive first anthology, see McClelland, Rumelhart, and PDP Research Group (1986).













* Yes, the patterns of excitation in the occipital (visual) cortex (and other regions) actually do take on the (distorted) shapes of the objects in the world in front of your eyes, but is anything in your brain looking at those shapes? Maybe something is sorta looking at those shapes. This is an idea to approach with caution.













* I am grateful to my colleague George Smith for introducing me to register machines, in an introductory course on computers we co-taught at Tufts in the mid-1980s. He recognized the tremendous pedagogical potential of register machines, and developed the expository structure I adapt here for a slightly different audience. The Curricular Software Studio that George and I founded at Tufts grew out of that course.


* Solutions to the problems in the exercises can be found in the appendix.


* This means the other exercises are compulsory! I mean it. If you want to take advantage of this thinking tool, you have to practice, practice, practice until you become fluent. Working through the simple compulsory exercises may take you an extra hour or two, but it's worth it.


* Ada Lovelace, daughter of the poet Lord Byron, was an amazing mathematician and much else. In 1843 she published her translation of an Italian commentary on Babbage's Analytical Engine, together with her own notes, which were longer and deeper than the piece she had translated: Menabrea (1842). Included in these notes was her carefully worked-out system for using Babbage's Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. For this she is often hailed as the first computer programmer.













* Cognitive neuroscience and computational neuroscience are the research efforts trying to figure out these levels. The difference between the two subfields is mainly a matter of emphasis, with computational neuroscientists more insistent on creating actual working (computer) models of their ideas, while cognitive neuroscientists are often content to sketch higher-level patterns of competence and interaction that must be implemented in any lower-level model. In computer science a similar tug-of-war has existed for years, with, at one pole, AI visionaries who don't bother writing actual programs but settle instead for demonstrating facts about the specs for any successful program for one task or another, and at the other pole, hard-bitten engineering types who aren't impressed until they see code that actually runs and does the job. The rest, they sneer, is not software; it is vaporware. Their impatience with their more speculative colleagues is nothing compared to the hostility one can observe between different levels of neuroscientists. As one lab director (whose specialty was the calcium channels in neural axons) once said to me, "In our lab we have a saying; if you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience. If you work on two neurons, that's psychology." And he didn't mean it as a compliment! Since cognitive neuroscience gets the lion's share of media attention (everybody is fascinated by new discoveries about visual illusions, memory, consciousness, speaking, and understanding, but not everybody can get excited about the hundreds of different neuromodulators and their receptors, or astrocyteneuron interactions, ... or calcium channels), there is often a high level of professional jealousy infecting the attitudes of computational neuroscientists toward their neighbors in cognitive neuroscience.













* My colleague Ray Jackendoff (1993) calls this the paradox of language learning: children somehow effortlessly absorb, and follow, the rules of grammar that professional linguists are still trying to figure out how to express.













* Actually, Descartes's great imagination got him at least close to some very good ideas. He imagined that the tugging wires might open tiny gates or pores, releasing floods of pent-up "animal spirits" (cerebrospinal fluid) that could then do some kind of hydraulic work; not a bad sketch of an amplifier! Even better, he saw that at least some intelligent (apt, appropriate) work could be done entirely mechanically by such a device: an automatic reflex. Pulling your foot from a hot fire when the heat tugged on a wire was his example: all just brain-machinery, no mind required!













* An aside for the experts: CYC (Lenat and Guha, 1990) is certainly the most impressive artificial intelligence (AI) implementation of something like a language of thought, an enCYClopedic, largely hand-coded database with a proprietary inference engine presiding over it. CYC has been under development for over a quarter of a century now, the work of many hands, but it achieves its power by being ruthlessly nonbiological and nonpsychological in its design. (See the excellent Wikipedia entry on CYC.) Mike's thing about redheads almost certainly is not an axiomatized redhead-microtheory composed in Brainish and incorporated into a large database rather like CYC. We do not yet know how much can be done by a host of things about things of this ilk because we have not yet studied them directly, except in very simple models (such as the insectoid subsumption architectures of Rodney Brooks and his colleagues—see Brooks, 1987). One of the chief theoretical interests of Brooks's Cog project (a humanoid robot—see Dennett, 1994b) was that it pushed these profoundly nonpropositional models of contentful structures into territory that is recognizable as human psychology.













* I probably shouldn't have used this obsolete slang term for a quarter-detector when I first created this intuition pump, but I did, and the term has had a fair amount of, well, currency, so let's stay with it. The obscure origin of the term "two bits" for a U.S. quarter takes us back to "pieces of eight" and doubloons and other such relics of pirate days.


* A sad iron—like the one your great grandmother used to press the family clothes—makes a fine doorstop. If you hunt for one in antique shops and "collectibles" websites, make sure you get an authentic one, not a replica; some for sale are just iron doorstops, cast in the shape of antique sad irons. A hundred years from now somebody may manufacture quaint doorstops that look just like two-bitsers—you know, the devices your great grandparents used back when coins were used for money.


* Philosopher Hilary Putnam (1975) invented Twin Earth many years ago, and my intuition pump is carefully modeled to reproduce the relevant details of his. My two-bitser tale is really just an elaborate resetting of the knobs of his intuition pump. There have been dozens or maybe even hundreds of other variations discussed by philosophers in the last thirty-five years. In its original telling, Putnam chose water on Earth and ersatz water (composed of XYZ, not H2O) on Twin Earth, but this raises complications not relevant to our use of the intuition pump, so let schmorses be the quarter-balboa analogues in this telling.


* Tecumseh Fitch's important paper "Nano-Intentionality: A Defense of Intrinsic Intentionality" (2008) proposes that eukaryotic cells—but not their ancestors, prokaryotic cells—were the first evolved entities with "intrinsic" intentionality, because their self-protective talents were, he claims, strikingly more advanced than their ancestors'. His emphasis on the autonomy, the agency, of individual cells strongly influenced the revisions to my homuncular functionalism (see chapter 20), but I disagree with his attempt to stop the finite regress at eukaryotes. Prokaryotes can no more be "replaced by a machine" than eukaryotes; the agency goes all the way down to the proteins, bottoming out at the selfish genes.


* For an adamant and passionate denial of everything in this paragraph, see Fodor and Piatelli-Palmarini, What Darwin Got Wrong (2010). Either the book you are reading is dead wrong, or that one is. For a more detailed defense of the view in this book, see part VI, and my "Evolution of Reasons" (forthcoming).
† Ruth Millikan has developed this claim in greater detail than I, in a series of brilliant books beginning in 1984. See the new volume Millikan and Her Critics (Ryder et al., 2013) for the current state of play.













* As philosopher John Haugeland (1981, p. 23) put it, the first principle of AI is "if you take care of the syntax, the semantics will take care of itself." There are different ways of thinking of this slogan; in its first, overly hopeful version, it motivated the search for an enormous database, an axiomatized formalization of world knowledge that could be maintained and exploited by a (purely syntactical) inference engine. (CYC is the best example.) This has proved (in the eyes of most experts) to be unfeasible, but the slogan survives as a good expression of the idea that the brain is a kind of computer (and hence a syntactic engine) that, thanks to its design, approximately does the work of a semantic engine.













* IBM's Watson came along just in time to turn my science fiction into science fact, close enough. You could consider Watson to be in box A if you like, and box B to contain a Swedish alternative to Watson, independently developed by Bo. When I first published this thought experiment (Dennett, 1995a), the best I could say was this: "For a real-world example of such a project, see Douglas Lenat's enormous CYC (short for 'encyclopedia') project at MCC (Lenat and Guha, 1990)." see also the footnote on CYC in chapter 28. The approach to AI that Watson exemplifies was largely unimagined back in 1995, but it has been making great strides. Unlike CYC, which is largely hand-coded, Watson can graze unattended on the Internet for its own supply of truths, and make powerful use of statistical properties of the data available there. Both Watson and CYC in their different ways sorta understand the data in their data banks—much, much more than other computers with large databases.


* When I first wrote this intuition pump, ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) code was the standard format for almost all word-processing, e-mail, and Internet language. It has since been supplanted by an extended, backward-compatible format, UTF-8, which stands for Universal [Character-set] Transformation Format—8-bit. That is, ASCII is still a part of UTF-8.


* For philosophers only: Some have argued that my account of patterns in "Real Patterns" (1991b) is epiphenomenalism about content. This is my reply.


* Once the hypothesis occurs to them, the Martians can engage in a version of Quine's radical translation, but their task will be made doubly difficult by not being able to query their "informants," A and B, by holding up objects and asking "ball?" "pencil?" and the like.


* The same moral can be drawn about interpreting the historical facts of evolutionary history. Even if you can describe, in matchless micro-detail, every causal fact in the history of every giraffe who has ever lived, unless you go up a level or two, and ask, "Why?"—hunting for the reasons endorsed by Mother Nature—you will never be able to explain the manifest regularities—the fact that giraffes have come to have long necks, for instance. (More on this in part VI.)













* I have my own hunches about what a proper scientific theory of meaning will turn out to be, replacing the rigid, Boolean (logical) constructions of GOFAI (good old-fashioned artificial intelligence) with more flexible, Bayesian (statistical, probabilistic) networks of pattern-finders, but developing those ideas is a task for another time and place.













* Some commentators have thought that my comparison of Darwin's idea to universal acid was inspired by DNA, which is, after all, deoxyribonucleic acid, but I mean something more universal: DNA is not the only medium of evolution on our planet, and who knows what other instances of evolution there are throughout the universe?













* Borges chose slightly different figures: books were 410 pages long, with 40 lines of 80 characters. The total number of characters per book is close enough to mine (1,312,000 versus 1,000,000) to make no difference. I chose my rounder numbers for ease of handling. Borges chose a character set with only 25 members, which is enough for uppercase Spanish (with a blank, a comma, and a period as the only punctuation), but not for English. I chose the more commodious 100 to make room without any doubt for the uppercase and lowercase letters and punctuation of all the Roman alphabet languages.
† Stephen Hawking (1988, p. 129) insists on putting it this way: "There are something like ten million million million million million million million million million million million million million (1 with eighty zeroes after it) particles in the region of the universe that we can observe." Michael Denton (1985) provides the estimate of 1070 atoms in the observable universe. Manfred Eigen (1992, p. 10) calculates the volume of the universe as 1084 cubic centimeters.


* The Library of Babel is finite, but curiously enough, it contains all the grammatical sentences of English within its walls. But that's an infinite set, and the Library is finite! Still, any sentence of English, of whatever length, can be broken down into five-hundred-page chunks, each of which is somewhere in the Library! How is this possible? Some books may get used more than once. The most profligate case is the easiest to understand: since there are volumes that contain a single character and are otherwise blank, repeated use of these one hundred volumes will create any text of any length. As Quine (1987) pointed out in his informative and amusing essay "Universal Library," if you avail yourself of this strategy of reusing volumes, and translate everything into the ASCII code your word-processor uses, you can store the whole Library of Babel in two extremely slender volumes, in one of which is printed a 0 and in the other of which appears a 1! (Quine also points out that Theodor Fechner, the psychologist, propounded the fantasy of the universal library long before Borges.)
† Quine (1987) coins the term "hyperastronomic" for the same purpose.


* The Vale of Laughter (De Vries, 1953). The text goes on: "Feel absolutely free to. Call me any hour of the day or night. ..." De Vries also may have invented the game of seeing how large an effect (deleterious or not) you can achieve with a single typographical change. Some of the best: "Whose woods are these, I think I know; his house is in the Village though." Others have taken up the game: in the state of nature, mutant-Hobbes tells us, one finds "the wife of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short." Or consider the question, "Am I my brothel's keeper?"













* Well, not quite impossible. Geostationary satellites, orbiting in unison with the earth's rotation, are a kind of real, non-miraculous skyhook. What makes them so valuable—what makes them financially sound investments—is that we often do want very much to attach something (such as an antenna or camera or telescope) to a place high in the sky. Satellites are impractical for lifting, alas, because they have to be placed so high in the sky. The idea has been carefully explored. It turns out that a rope of the strongest artificial fiber yet made would have to be over a hundred meters in diameter at the top—it could taper to a nearly invisible fishing line on its way down—just to suspend its own weight, let alone any payload. Even if you could spin such a cable, you wouldn't want it falling out of orbit onto the city below!
† I was pleased to see the sky crane invented to help lower Curiosity, the robotic rover, to the surface of Mars on August 6, 2012, and especially pleased that it is called a sky crane not a skyhook, since it is the product of stunning engineering but no miracle.













* Note one important difference between the legacies of Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosome Adam: we all, male and female, have mitochondria in our cells, and they all come from our mothers; if you are male, you have a Y-chromosome and got it from your father, whereas virtually all—but not quite all—females have no Y-chromosome at all.


* Setting logical possibility aside and looking at actual history, we see that there have been men who tried to monopolize the siring in their populations, and apparently sometimes succeeded to an astonishing degree: powerful kings and warriors who took and impregnated hundreds of women. They probably have made a disproportionate contribution to our human gene pool, for better or worse.













* Dale Peterson has drawn my attention to the fact that chimpanzee hammer stones get gradually polished by continual use over long periods of time, and this provides a good "missing link" in a series that begins with more or less randomly picking up a stone and smashing a nut with it, then choosing the best-shaped stone you can see in the vicinity for that job, then looking far and wide for a better-shaped stone, then noticing (with your naked eye and visual memory) that your favorite stone is getting better from use, until finally you reach the sophistication of setting out to shape a stone for an anticipated task.


* The role of abiotic cycles in changing the probability of the emergence of reproducing cells is discussed in more detail in my "Evolution of Reasons" (forthcoming).













* Here is the fragment of German in an easier-to-read modern font: Freunde, Römer, Mitbürger, gebt mir Gehőr! Ich komme, Cäsars Leiche zu bestatten, nicht, ihn zu loben.













* This excellent coinage is a computer hacker's way of referring to a coding error at the semantic level, not the syntactic level. Leaving out a parenthesis is a typo; forgetting to declare a local variable is a thinko. In any human activity with a semantic or intentional interpretation, and clear canons of correctness or elegance, there is room for thinkos. Describing a lady as meretricious instead of meritorious is a thinko, not a typo. See Dennett, 2006b.


* Roughly, MIDI is to music what ASCII code is to writing: the lingua franca between computer programs and the outside world.













* One reader of an early draft of this book thought I was making all of this up. If you share that suspicion, check out the long, deadly serious article on philosophical zombies in the august Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, online at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/.













* This is another one of those places where some philosophers would like to accuse me of confusing a metaphysical question with an epistemological question: "Don't ask how we would know someone is a zombie! Ask what it is to be a zombie!" Metaphysics so isolated from epistemology is, at best, an exercise in fantasy.













* Doug zeroed in on the phrase "bits of paper" in Searle's essay, and showed how it encouraged people to underestimate the size and complexity of the software involved by many orders of magnitude. His commentary on Searle in our book featured this criticism, and led to a ferocious response from Searle (1982) in the pages of the New York Review of Books, because, although we had reprinted his article correctly, in his commentary Doug slipped and wrote "a few slips" where Searle had said "bits," and this, Searle claimed, completely misrepresented his argument! If Searle is right about this, if that small inadvertent mutation transformed the machinery, this actually proved our point, in a way: if such a tiny adjustment disables or enables a thought experiment, that is something that should be drawn to the attention of all whose intuitions are up for pumping.
† Check out Hofstadter's own virtuoso demonstration in The Mind's I (Hofstadter and Dennett, 1981), showing that the Chinese Room is an intuition pump with (at least) five knobs, which he proceeds to turn, one at a time, to derive a family of different thought experiments with different invited conclusions. In the closing reflections, I noted,

Each setting of the dials on our intuition pump yields a slightly different narrative, with different problems receding into the background and different morals drawn. Which version or versions should be trusted is a matter to settle by examining them carefully, to see which features of the narrative are doing the work. If the oversimplifications are the source of the intuitions, rather than just devices for suppressing irrelevant complications, we should mistrust the conclusions we are invited to draw. [p. 460]



* As has often been pointed out, this conviction echoes that of Descartes, who proposed in his Discourse on Method way back in 1637 that the best way to tell a machine from a person with an immaterial soul was to have a conversation with it.

It is indeed conceivable that a machine could be so made that it would utter words, and even words appropriate to the presence of physical acts or objects which cause some change in its organs; as, for example, if it was touched in some spot that it would ask what you wanted to say to it; if in another, that it would cry that it was hurt, and so on for similar things. But it could never modify its phrases to reply to the sense of whatever was said in its presence, as even the most stupid men can do.

Nobody knows if Turing got the inspiration for his intuition pump from Descartes's intuition pump.


* Thanks to linguist, sinologist, and polymath David Moser for the example, which was created in China just as I was casting about for such an example.













* Such as: How do you folks decide who is host and who are alters? How have you explained to yourself that your memory of recent experiences consists of brief episodes of being there surrounded by hours or days of oblivion? Doesn't that strike you as alarming?


* In T. S. Eliot's verse play, Murder in the Cathedral, Becket is asked about an event in his past and he replies:

You talk of seasons that are past. I remember
Not worth forgetting.














* The defense of heterophenomenology as the methodology of choice for the scientific study of consciousness has occasioned substantial controversy. Some researchers regard it as a game-changing clarification of the conditions under which science can study consciousness, some regard it as just rehearsing the obvious, and still others continue to object. See Sources for references to some of the best work on this that has appeared to date.













* If you doubt that instilling such a belief could have such consequences, see Vohs and Schooler (2008) and the subsequent literature for experimental evidence.













* See Dennett, 1987, chapter 9, for more on the theoretical implications of this trade-off in space and time.
† For a completely different perspective on two-dimensional physics and engineering, see A. K. Dewdney's Planiverse (1984), a vast improvement over Edwin A. Abbott's Flatland (1884), and a magnificent thinking tool in its own right.













* A delicious example of runaway higher-order second-guessing appears in the film The Princess Bride, in the scene in which Wallace Shawn as Vizzini tries to outwit Cary Elwes as Westley in the "Which cup has the poison?" encounter, and ends up outwitting himself. See http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xhr71a_never-go-in-against-a-sicilian-when-death-is-on-the-line_shortfilms.













* According to the official royal website, "Today, the Crown retains the right to ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water, but The Queen only exercises her ownership on certain stretches of the Thames and its surrounding tributaries. This ownership is shared with the Worshipful Company of Vintners and the Worshipful Company of Dyers, who were granted rights of ownership by the Crown in the fifteenth century. Nowadays, of course, the swans are no longer eaten."













* Hayes's work inspired others. See the anthology edited by Bobrow (1985). Authors of one of the essays therein remark, "Naïve physics is in itself an ambiguous term. Is it just bad physics? Is it psychology? Artificial intelligence? Physics?" (Bobrow, 1985, p. 13). The answer, I submit, is that naïve physics is the attempt to make the physics part of our manifest image rigorous enough to support automated deductive reasoning.













* With regard to another puzzle in this book, for one thing, the slop I love is even followed by Laura Dern, and for another, in spite of the smut, I hope to iron Sean Penn's shirt.


* A delicious chess hoax appeared on the Internet on April Fools' Day, 2012 ("Rajlich: Busting the King's Gambit," ChessBase News, April 2, 2012, http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=8047). It claimed that a gigantic consortium of computers working around the clock for over four months had proved that the King's Gambit (an opening long discredited but never "disproved") had now been shown definitively to be defeatable in all but one unlikely condition. The hoax fooled me—which was particularly embarrassing since I had written about an earlier hoax by Martin Gardner (in the introduction to Hurley, Dennett, and Adams, 2011). For the explanation of how the hoax was created, see "The ChessBase April Fools Prank," ChessBase News, April 4, 2012, http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=8051.
