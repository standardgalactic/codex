Appendix: Solutions to Register Machine Problems
EXERCISE 1
PROGRAM 1:

a. How many steps will it take the register machine to add 2 + 5 and get 7, running Program 1 (counting End as a step)?
Answer: Six steps: three decrements, two increments, one End (the last decrement is a branch on zero).
b. How many steps will it take to add 5 + 2?
Answer: Twelve steps: six decrements, five increments, and one End.
(What conclusion do you draw from this?)
Answer: The order of the contents can make a big difference, so you might think it would be good to have a rule of always putting the smaller number in register 1—but if you first had to test the two numbers to see which is smaller, you'd use up more steps than you'd spend doing the addition!
EXERCISE 2
a. Write the RAP program for this flow graph. (Note that since the program branches, you can number the steps in several different ways. It doesn't matter which way you choose as long as the "go to" commands point to the right steps.)

b. What happens when the program tries to subtract 3 from 3 or 4 from 4?
The program halts with 0 in register 4.

c. What possible error is prevented by zeroing out register 3 before trying the subtraction at step 3 instead of after step 4?
If there was a zero at the start in both registers 1 and 2, the answer when the program ended could be nonsensical (either -0, or some number other than 0 or 1 in the sign register).
EXERCISE 3
a. Draw a flow graph (and write the RAP program) for multiplying the content of register 1 by the content of register 3, putting the answer in register 5.

b. (Optional) Using Copy and Move, improve the multiplier you created in problem a: when it stops, the original contents of register 1 and register 3 are restored, so that you can easily check the inputs and output for correctness after a run.

c. (Optional) Draw a flow graph and write a RAP program that examines the contents of register 1 and register 3 (without destroying them!) and writes the address (1 or 3) of the smaller content in register 2, and puts 2 in register 2 if the contents of registers 1 and 3 are equal. (After this program has executed, the contents of register 1 and register 3 should be unchanged, and register 2 should say if their contents are equal, and if not, which of those two registers has the smaller content.)

EXERCISE 4 (OPTIONAL)
Draw a flow graph, and write a RAP program that turns a register machine into a simple pocket calculator, as follows:
a. Use register 2 for the operation:
0 = add
1 = subtract
2 = multiply
3 = divide
b. Put the values to be acted on in registers 1 and 3.
(Thus 3 0 6 would mean 3 + 6, and 5 1 3 would mean 5 - 3, and 4 2 5 would mean 4 × 5, and 9 3 3 would mean 9 ÷ 3). Then put the results of the operation in registers 4 through 7, using register 4 for the sign (using 0 for + and 1 for -) and register 5 for the numerical answer, register 6 for any remainder in a case of division, and register 7 as an alarm, signaling a divide-by-zero mistake.
