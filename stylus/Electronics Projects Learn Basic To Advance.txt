                 Basic Component Details                
 IC- Integrated circuit (IC), also called microelectronic circuit, microchip, or chip, an assembly of electronic components, fabricated as a single unit, in which miniaturized active devices (e.g., transistors and diodes) and passive devices (e.g., capacitors and resistors) and their interconnections are built up on a thin  
 IC358- The LM358 IC is a great, low power and easy to use dual channel op-amp IC. It is designed and introduced by national semiconductor. It consists of two internally frequency compensated, high gain, independent op-amps. This IC is designed for specially to operate from a single power supply over a wide range of voltages. The LM358 IC is available in a chip sized package and applications of this op amp include conventional op-amp circuits, DC gain blocks and transducer amplifiers. LM358 IC is a good, standard operational amplifier and it is suitable for your needs. It can handle 3-32V DC supply & source up to 20mA per channel. This op-amp is apt, if you want to operate two separate op-amps for a single power supply. It's available in an 8-pin DIP package. 
                                     
 IC555- The 555 timer IC is an integrated circuit (chip) used in a variety of timer, pulse generation, and oscillator applications.

Derivatives provide two (556) or four (558) timing circuits in one package.  
                                  
  IC4017- Most of us are more comfortable with 1, 2, 3, 4... rather than 001, 010, 011, 100. We mean to say that we will need a decimal coded output in many cases rather than a raw binary output. We have many counter ICs available but most of them produce binary data as an output. We will again need to process that output by using decoders or any other circuitry to make it usable for our application in most of the cases. 
 Let us now introduce you a new IC named IC 4017. It is a CMOS decade counter cum decoder circuit which can work out of the box for most of our low range counting applications. It can count from zero to ten and its outputs are decoded. This saves a lot of board space and time required to build our circuits when our application demands using a counter followed by a decoder IC. This IC also simplifies the design and makes debugging easy.

                    Transistor 
 A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It is composed of semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits. 
 Transistor BC547- BC547 is an NPN bi-polar junction transistor. A transistor, stands for transfer of resistance, is commonly used to amplify current. A small current at its base controls a larger current at collector & emitter terminals. ... Its equivalent transistors are BC548 and BC549. 
   
                                      
 Transistor BC548- The BC548 is a general-purpose NPN bipolar junction transistor commonly used in European and American electronic equipment. It is notably often the first type of bipolar transistor hobbyists encounter and is often featured in designs in hobby electronics magazines where a general-purpose transistor is required. 
                                     
   
   
   
 Transistor BC557- BC557 is a PNP transistor hence the collector and emitter will be closed (Forward biased) when the base pin is held at ground and will be opened (Reverse biased) when a signal is provided to base pin. 
                                 
 Transistor BC558- BC558 is a general purpose PNP transistor. It is used in switching and amplifier applications. The DC current gain varies in range 110 to 800. ... For switching applications,transistor is biased so that it remains fully on if there is a signal at its base. 
                       
                     Resistance 
 Resistance is a measure of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit. Resistance is measured in ohms, symbolized by the Greek letter omega (Ω). Ohms are named after Georg Simon Ohm (1784-1854), a German physicist who studied the relationship between voltage, current and resistance. 
 Resistance is the opposition that a substance offers to the flow of electric current of one ampere passes through  component across which a potential difference (voltage) of one volt exits. Then the resistance of that component is one ohm.

Each transistor is switched on to drive the corresponding LED when its base is supplied with current through the water through the electrode probes.

          TIMER SWITCH / 1 MINUTE TIMER CIRCUIT       
 As the name suggest 555 timer is basically a "Timer", which create an oscillating pulse. It means for some time output pin 3 is HIGH and for some time it remains LOW, that will create a oscillating output. We can use this property of 555 timer to create various timer circuits like 1 minute timer circuit, 5 minute timer circuit, 10 minute timer circuit, 15 minute timer circuit, etc. All we need to change the value of Resistor R1 and/or Capacitor C1. We need to set 555 timer in Monostable mode to build Timer. In monostable mode, the duration for which the PIN 3 would remain HIGH, is given by the below formulae: 
 T = 1.1 * R1*C1 
 So to build 1 minute (60 seconds) timer we need resistor of value 55k ohm and capacitor of 1000uF: 
 1.1*55k*1000uF 
 (1.1*55*1000*1000)/1000000 = 60.5 ~ 60 seconds. 
  
 A variable resistor of 1M is used here and set on 55k ohm (measured by multimeter). We can easily calculate the resistor value for 5 minute, 10 minute and 15 minute timer circuit: 
 5 Minute Timer Circuit 
 5*60 = 1.1 * R1 * 1000 uF 
 R1 = 272.7 k ohm 
 So to build a 5 minute timer circuit, we would be simply changing the resitor value to 272.7k ohm in above given 1 minute timer circuit. 
 10 Minute Timer Circuit 
 10*60 = 1.1*R1*1000 uF 
 R1 = 545.4 k ohm 
 Similarly to create a 10 minute timer we would be changing the resistor value to 545.4 k ohm. 
 15 Minute Timer Circuit 
 15*60 = 1.1*R1*1000 uF 
 R1 = 818.2 k ohm 
 As per above calculations, for a 15 minute timer circuit, we need the value of  resistor to 818.2k ohm. 
 We should note here that we have used LED at reverse logic, means when OUTPUT pin 3 is low, LED will be ON, and when OUTPUT is HIGH then LED will be OFF. So we have calculated OFF time above, means after the calculated time LED will be turned ON. LED will be ON initially (OUTPUT PIN 3 LOW), as soon as we press push button (trigger the 555 via TRIGGER PIN 2), the timer will start, and LED will become OFF (OUTPUT PIN 3 LOW), after the calculated time duration, PIN  3 will again become  LOW, and LED get turned ON.

     PIR SENSOR BASED AUTOMATIC ON OFF LIGHT 
   
 PIR sensors allow you to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range. They are small, inexpensive, low-power, easy to use and don't wear out. ... They are often referred to as PIR, "Passive Infrared", "Pyroelectric", or "IR motion" sensors.

 DANCING LIGHT / 10 LEDs CHASER LIGHT 
   
   
 The 555 timer IC is configured to work in astable mode. Which means, the output from the 555 timer changes continuously between high (Supply Voltage) and low (0V). In other words, if you connect an LED between the output of 555 timer and ground, the LED flashes/blinks continuously. 
 This pulsing output from the 555 timer is connected to the clock input of 4017 IC (a decade counter). It has 10 output pins and we have connected an LED to each output. By default, the first output pin is on/high and the rest are off. Each time the clock input pin of 4017 IC detects a rise in voltage (from low to high), it turns off the current output and turns on the next sequential output. This swapping of outputs which looks like the LED's are chasing each other, continues until the last LED and then the output resets back to the first LED. 
 [Watch the video at the beginning of this post for better visual understanding] 
 For this LED chaser circuit, we have used all the 10 outputs of 4017 IC. But if you wish to make an LED chaser circuit with less than 10 LED's, you can do the same by connecting the LED's starting from U0. Let's say you wish to build this circuit with 4 LED's, you need to connect an LED to each of U0, U1, U2, U3 and leave the rest.
